SECOND COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            The Republic of Togo
Amount:              IDA:  US$14 million
EEC Special Action Account: about US$4.6 million
Terms:               Standard IDA
Project              The project would continue cocoa-coffee rehabilitation
Description:        begun under the first cocoa-coffee development project.
It would be implemented over a five and a half year
period and focus mainly on replanting by about 17,000
smallholders of 7,500 ha of coffee and 4,000 ha of
cocoa; foodcrop planting within cocoa and coffee areas
as well as outside the plantations; providing marketing
facilities for plantain; supply the farmers with improved
extension services, including cocoa, coffee and food-
crop planting materials; rehabilitation and maintenance
of 300 km of feeder roads in the project area; and tech-
nical assistance to carry out a project evaluation,
including preparation of a possible follow-up project,
and to strengthen SRCC, the project executing agency and
PCU, the Project Credit Unit.
Project benefits would accrue to the Government through
increased foreign exchange earnings and to about 17,000
farm families through increased average annual incomes.
A project risk would be that producer prices and other
incentives were set too low to be attractive for replant-
ing, particularly for cocoa planters, about 50 percent
of whom are tenant farmers working under ill-defined
sharecropping arrangements. A safeguard against these
risks would be the Government's annual review of farmgate
prices in consultation with IDA and the introduction by
the end of March, 1980 of long-term contractual arrange-
ments between tenants and landowners.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT AND
AN EEC SPECIAL ACTION CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A SECOND COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed
credits to the Republic of Togo, a development credit for the equivalent of
US$14 million and an EEC Special Action Credit for the equivalent of US$4.6
million, both on standard IDA terms, to help finance a second cocoa-coffee
development project. This project would be cofinanced by a grant from the
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) for the equivalent of US$3.5 million
and a loan from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) for the
equivalent of US$7.7 million. The terms and conditions of the CCfE loan would
be over 19 years, including 6 years of grace at 4.5 percent annual interest.
The Government would onlend about US$2.5 million of the proceeds of the IDA
and Special Action credits to the National Agricultural Credit Agency (CNCA)
to be onlent to farmers at an interest rate of 8.5 percent over a term of 8
years, including 4 years of grace, for coffee plantings and 12 years, includ-
ing 6 years of grace, for cocoa plantings.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       The most recent economic report on Togo, Report No. 458a-TO "Current
Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on December 30, 1974.
An economic mission visited Togo in December, 1978 and its findings are
incorporated below and in Annex I which contains basic country data.
Economic Performance
3.       Over the 1972-78 period, the macroeconomic aggregates present a
picture of good growth, high investment, and rising debt. Real growth in
1972-78 is estimated at 5 percent per annum. Beginning in 1975, phosphate
profits were channeled into public investment, with gross domestic investment
averaging a high 31 percent of GDP over 1975-77, up from 20 percent in the
early 1970s. Rising public investment was therefore partially financed
by borrowing, which raised the debt service ratio from 6 percent in 1972
to 17 percent in 1978. Higher imports of capital and consumer goods have been
reflected in a widening resource gap, estimated at 27 percent of GDP in 1978.
The per capita GDP is estimated at US$300 in 1977 for a population of 2.35
million growing at a rate of 2.7 percent annually.
4.       Phosphate exports have provided the major stimulus to recent economic
growth in Togo, following the quadrupling of the world market price in early
1974 and the nationalization of the mines in the same year. Since then,
prices have stabilized at around $30 per ton, and this price combined with
increased output raised average phosphate revenues during 1974-77 to US$93
1/   Substantially identical with Part I of the President's Report No.
P-2503-To, dated May 31, 1979 for a Technical Assistance Project.



-2-
million per year or about 16 percent of GDP. In 1977 phosphate sales amounted
to about 40 percent of the country's merchandise exports. The increased
phosphate revenues have provided substantial new public income, shaped the
Togolese balance of payments and public finance picture over the past four
years, and broadly influenced Government's investment plans and expectations.
5.       Despite these developments agriculture remains the largest sector in
the economy employing 75 percent of the working population and accounting for
23 percent of GDP. It is mainly made up of small farmers growing a combina-
tion of foodcrops for subsistence and cotton, cocoa, coffee, or groundnuts
for sale.  Rainfall is considerably less than in the Ivory Coast or Nigeria,
limiting the range of feasible crops. The major agricultural exports are
cocoa and coffee, which provide about 30 percent of exports. These two crops
contributed heavily to Government revenues through the official marketing
agency due to high world prices and relatively low producer prices. The
volume of cocoa and coffee produced has, however, fallen sharply since the
early 1970s, coinciding with a decline in real producer prices. Output of
other agricultural products (mainly fooderops and cotton) has grown moderately.
Foodcrop production has generally kept up with rural population growth, with
the exception of drought years in 1976 and 1977; rainfall conditions were good
in 1978, and foodcrop storage capacity is presently fully utilized.
6.       The rise of heavy industry is one of the striking aspects of this
small country. Mining and beneficiation of phosphate rock was the first such
operation, now employing about 2,000 people. A 1.2 million-ton annual capacity
cement clinker plant (CIMAO) is under construction, with equity participation
by Ghana and the Ivory Coast as well as Togo, and financing from the Bank and
several other aid agencies. Production should start before the end of 1979.
However some of Togo's other heavy industrial investments appear less
promising. The Government-owned Lome oil refinery became operational in
October 1977, with an annual capacity of one million tons per year, but was
soon shut down for some time due to financial problems. A 20,000 ton steel
mill, based on imported scrap to produce reinforcing rod, has recently been
completed.
7.       Growth in the tertiary sector, accounting for 46 percent of GDP
at market prices in 1977, has largely been linked to trade, to substantial
infrastructure investments and industrial growth, and to the expansion of
the public payroll. The latter grew from 17,300 in 1973 to 37,600 in 1978
including 14,000 in education and an army of 5,400 men. Transport activity
has expanded with construction of a modern port at Lome in 1968, financed by
the Federal Republic of Germany. The nation's major international road links
are almost completely paved and have enabled increased transit trade principally
to Upper Volta and Niger. The construction sector is flourishing due to urban
building and civil works projects.
Public Finance Developments
8.       Prior to the 1974 phosphate boom, Togo's financial policies were
generally p-udent and its public investments modest in scale, in harmony with
the smallness and openness of the economy and its dependence on a few primary
for for- gn exchange earnings and Government revenues.  Public



- 3 -
expenditure was below 15 percent of GDP, the budget deficit was very small,
and the Government held substantial reserves in the form of deposits with the
banking system and net foreign assets. Foreign indebtedness was low because
by far the largest part of foreign resources was extended to the Government
in the form of grants or concessionary loans.
9.        However, public expenditures greatly accelerated beginning in 1976,
in response to phosphate revenues which tripled public receipts from 1973 to
1977. Current plus extrabudgetary expenditures expanded fourfold over the
same period, with extrabudgetary spending reaching 40 percent of current
spending levels, and a budget deficit equivalent to 6 percent of GDP devel-
oped. Extrabudgetary items included some spending for investment projects
and military equipment purchases. Among current expenditures, public debt
payments rose rapidly as did the cost of the largest ministries (education,
defense, and health) due mainly to sharp increases in the number of civil
servants.
10.       The Government also used readily available credit from foreign
private banks and suppliers to finance new projects. Committed public debt
rose from US$120 million at end-1973 to reach US$680 million by end-1977
(including US$160 million of CIMAO debt jointly guaranteed by the Ivory Coast,
Ghana and Togo). For the first time, substantial arrears to both domestic
and foreign suppliers began to accumulate and the Government borrowed from
the Central Bank and drew down its foreign reserves. Arrears on public debt
amounted to about US$125 million in April 1979.
11.       This situation led to a request by the Togolese for IMF assistance
and the negotiation, in April 1979, of a standby agreement in the third credit
tranche for SDRs 15 million. The program extends to December 1980, and during
this period it is expected that an extended facility will be agreed upon to
take effect in 1981. The performance criteria and other conditions generally
restrict new borrowings on hard terms; provide for a substantial reduction
in payments arrears; impose ceilings on net banking credit; and call for
reduced current and capital spending and the elimination of extrabudgetary
expenditures. Relief from certain external private debt is currently being
sought by the Togolese Government.
12.       The Government is committed to carrying out this program and rectify-
ing the current financial problems. It announced an austerity program along
these general lines in November 1978. Bank estimates indicate that much of
the spending cutbacks can be absorbed in the ongoing investment program and
that, despite the constraint on the recurrent expenditures, it will probably
not be necessary to lay off any civil servants. Fiscal restraint would then
permit real increases in current expenditures starting in 1981 and contribute
to a greater domestic share of capital expenditures in the 1980s. However,
debt service will constitute a heavy burden consuming 33 percent of Government
revenues in 1985 and 26 percent in 1990, even assuming that the mix of new
loan commitments is from more concessionary sources.
13.       To provide necessary foreign inflows, concessionary lending will
have to increase substantially: loan commitments from bilateral and multi-
lateral institutions will have to amount to about 60 percent of new commit-
ments on average over 1978-85 compared with roughly 40 percent in 1971-75



-4-
and 50 percent in 1976-77. This level of aid should be obtainable given the
traditional support Togo enjoys from Germany, France, and multilateral sources
and the agreement now reached with the IMF. At the same time a large per-
centage of local cost financing will be necessary, particularly on projects
with a relatively low foreign exchange component.
Development Planning
14.       The 1976-80 Development Plan was prepared during the phosphate boom
and does not provide a clear view of development priorities. The objectives
expressed for the long-term, while asserting that both equity and growth will
be pursued, basically emphasize growth through development of the modern
sector: an 8 percent annual real growth rate is to be achieved, largely
financed by domestic savings. The Plan focusses on mechanization of agricul-
ture, water supply, agro-industrial complexes, tourism, import-substitution,
minerals and the necessary infrastructure. The actual allocation of 1976-77
public debt commitments emphasize the modern sector with, for instance, hotels
accounting for 15 percent of committed debt in 1976-77. Many recent investments
do not address income distribution objectives, and rely on the "trickle down"
effect to reach the urban and rural poor. Only 2 percent of 1976-77 debt
commitments were in support of human resources. Health facilities and water
supply remain inadequate.
Economic Prospects
15.       The Government has begun to reformulate its development strategy.
In agriculture greater emphasis is being placed on integrated rural develop-
ment and on improving the use of the resources allocated to this sector. In
mining a less precipitous approach is being taken towards the extension of
both the phosphate and CIMAO activities than has characterized some earlier
decisions on the industrial sector. A significant development is the recog-
nition by the Government of the need to strengthen its planning capacity at
the macro level and its capacity to evaluate the economic viability of pro-
jects. This recognition was demonstrated by the Government's request for a
Technical Assistance Project, approved by the Executive Directors on June 12,
1979, which will provide the Minister of Planning with advice on a macro-
economic level as well as on project analysis.
16.       The macro-economic outlook, based on an analysis of sectoral
constraints and potential, is for real GDP growth of 4-5 percent per year
over the 1978-90 period. Present very high growth rates (8 percent per year
over 1976-78) will taper off as investment declines from the unsustainable
30 percent of GDP recorded in 1976-78 to about 17 percent of GDP during the
1980s. The ICOR is projected to decline in the late 1980s as the investment
program becomes more efficient. A sharply declining resource gap, fueled
by rising exports, should lead to higher domestic savings. The balance of
payments projections indicate a shortage of foreign exchange (essentially a
shortage of budgetary resources available) in the early 1980s due to the
heavy debt service from earlier projects and the inevitable lag between large
investments planned for a phosphoric acid project and a second phase of CIMAO,
and the resulting exports. The Bank's projections assume this gap will be
filled 1- a combination of short-term funds, debt relief, IMF resources, and
increascu borrowing from the West African Monetary Union's central bank. The



- 5 -
net result would be a diminishing deficit on current account and increasing
reserves. These projections do not include any output or exports from the
oil refinery or the steel mill, since the steel mill is not operational and
the oil refinery has only recently reopened. Higher petroleum product prices
and advantageous terms on Nigerian crude may result in additional foreign
exchange and public revenue inflows from the oil refinery.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
17.      To date the Bank Group has extended eight credits to Togo amounting
to US$59.9 million and two loans totalling US$53.0 million for the CIMAO
regional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo and one of US$49.5
million to CIMAO jointly and severally guaranteed by the Ivory Coast, Ghana
and Togo). Four of the credits were for highway construction, maintenance and
feeder roads, three for agricultural projects and one for technical assistance.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations in Togo, as
well as notes on the execution of the projects.
18.      The Highway Maintenance Project, the Bank Group's first lending
operation in Togo, was satisfactorily completed in November 1973. The
Second Highway Project evolved from preinvestment studies financed under
the first project and provided for the construction or upgrading of three
highways and the continuation of the maintenance program. This project is
now virtually completed, although, due to inflation, the scope of the road
construction component had to be reduced in 1976. The Third Highway Project
has as its main objective, the improvement of two important roads serving
mainly agricultural areas and linking the site of the CIMAO plant, Tabligbo,
with the port of Aneho, and to continue building up an efficient road main-
tenance service. Today, most of the country's major road links are paved
and adequately maintained. The Bank's future operations in the sector will,
therefore, aim at improving rural roads through the creation of an efficient
institutional framework and training of maintenance personnel.
19.      The first agricultural project for which a credit was approved in
1974, covers part of a long-range program for the development of the Plateau
Region's coffee and cocoa potential. The proposed credit is a follow-up
operation. The second agricultural credit, approved in June 1976, provides
financing for a rural development project in the Maritime Region geared pri-
marily to increasing foodcrop production and to providing support services
and rural infrastructure for 20,000 farm families. A possible follow-up
project is envisaged. The third and most recent agricultural credit, which
was approved by the Board in October, 1977 supports a 5-year program to
increase cotton and foodcrop production by introducing improved cotton and
foodcrop growing techniques. A rural development project in the Bassar region
is being prepared. It would intensify the integrated rural development
approach begun under the cotton project.
20.      Togo is the host to the CIMAO project, one of the largest interna-
tional industrial ventures so far undertaken in West Africa. Implementation
of this US$284 million clinker project, financed by the Bank and seven other
official aid agencies, is proceeding satisfactorily. The Bank Group is also
assisting in the preparation of a phosphoric acid project.



- 6 -
21.       A first education project has been appraised.  It emphasizes teacher
training at the primary level, upgrading and expansion of middle level agri-
cultural staff training and rural artisan training. Also, based on the
findings of a recent Bank-WHO Cooperative Program mission to Togo, an urban
water supply project for Lome is expected to be identified.
22.      Present Bank Group disbursements account for about 10 percent of
Togo's disbursed and outstanding public debt (as of early 1978).  Service
payments to the Bank Group are about 2 percent of total debt service and will
remain at about this level over the medium-term.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
23.       Agriculture employs about 75 percent of the active population
and accounted for about 30 percent of GDP in 1978, a decline from about 45
percent in 1973. This reflects the substantial growth of the mining sector
(phosphate) and a stagnation of agricultural output. Foodcrop production has
essentially kept pace with rural population growth and accounts for about 75
percent of agricultural production, except during the low rainfall years of
1976 and 1977. The major staples are maize, sorghum, yam and cassava. The
remainder consists of industrial and export crops, principally cocoa, coffee,
cotton and palm oil. Overall agricultural production is estimated to have
increased in real terms by about 3.5 percent per year during the period
1966-70, but since then the marketed production of coffee, cocoa and palm oil
decreased by about 50 percent, whereas cotton recovered from a decline in the
late 1960s. The share of agriculture in export earnings has varied between 25
and 50 percent in the 1970s, with cocoa and coffee accounting for an average
of 85 percent of agricultural exports and about 30 percent of total exports.
24.       Responsibility for the Agricultural Sector is shared by two minis-
tries. The Ministry of Rural Development is concerned with policy formulation
and program coordination of production activities and includes directorates
for research, development, cooperatives and credit, livestock, and training.
The Ministry of Rural Equipment is concerned with infrastructural develop-
ment and support services and includes directorates for rural engineering,
pedology, plant protection, veterinary services, forestry and fisheries,
and produce inspection.
25.       Execution of agricultural development projects is generally en-
trusted to autonomous, product-oriented public corporations. The major ones
are SRCC for cocoa and coffee, SONAPH for oil palm, TOGO-FRUIT for fruits and
SOTOCO for cotton. Their responsibilities include the supply of planting
material, provision of extension services and primary marketing and processing.
Agricultural credit is the responsibility of the National Bank for Agricul-
tural Credit (CNCA).
26.       The Milistry of Trade supervises two marketing entities:  OPAT,
responsiblt for coffee, cocoa, cotton, palm oil and palm kernels, and TOGO-
GRAIN for F-odcrops, OPAT's producer price stabilization program for export



-7 -
crops produces sizeable surpluses for the Government. In the past these have
been used to finance development in general, with only some 6 percent re-
invested in agriculture. TOGOGRAIN is intended to play a stabilizing role
for foodcrops by timely interventions in the market. It has built six silos
since 1975 with a total capacity of 7,000 tons.
27.       Agricultural research is carried out with technical assistance from
French commodity-oriented institutes. The Research Institute for Tropical
Agronomy and Foodcrops (IRAT) is in charge of foodcrops, the Research Insti-
tute for Cotton and Other Fiber Crops (IRCT) of fiber crops and the French
Institute for Coffee, Cocoa and Other Stimulant Plants (IFCC) of cocoa and
coffee. Soil studies, classification, mapping and analytical work are under-
taken by ORSTOM (Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique Outre-Mer).
The Government recently created a multidisciplinary research institute, the
Institut Polyvalent de Recherches (IPR), which should eventually become
responsible for overall research coordination, basic research, and laboratory
services.
28.       The main objectives of the Government's agricultural development
strategy are to increase food production, including maintaining food reserves
against natural calamities; rehabilitate and increase traditional export crop
production and diversify into some new products. However, until recently the
Government has viewed agricultural production as having rather low development
potential. During the Second Development Plan period (1971-75), actual
investments in agriculture amounted to about 6 percent of total investments,
compared with the originally planned 15 percent. The share of agricultural
investments is expected to reach 20 percent under the Third Plan (1976-80).
In the past few years the Government has begun to adopt a policy of helping
small farmers with extension service and credit, an approach supported by
three IDA rural development projects. The Association's strategy in the
sector will continue to support projects directly addressing the needs of
small farmers.
29.       A major policy issue in this sector currently under discussion
with the Government concerns agricultural pricing. Producer prices for the
main cash crops have traditionally been kept low, thereby reducing incentives
to farmers to invest in these crops which have relatively long gestation
periods. A recent 30 percent increase of the farmgate price for cocoa, from
about US$0.68/kg to US$0.91/kg, indicates that the Government recognizes the
effect of this constraint. The Association recently completed and submitted
to the Government for review an analysis of cash crop production incentives.
The report recommends a producer price policy which would balance conflicting
objectives such as increased farmer incomes from cocoa, coffee and cotton
against the need to generate public revenues, and the goal of food self-
sufficiency versus export crop production.
The Cocoa-Coffee Sub-Sector
30.       The area where cocoa and coffee are grown is in the western part
of Togo's Plateau Region (see map). The topography is heterogenous, encom-
passing lowlands, plateaux and mountains. The climate is tropical with a



- 8 -
rainfall pattern strongly influenced by the mountainous character of the area.
As a consequence, the area enjoys generally higher precipitation than the rest
of the country averaging 1,500 mm annually. The four months of dry season
fall between November and February. About two thirds of the cultivable soils
in this region are considered suitable for cocoa and coffee cultivation.
31.       In the 1960s, cocoa and coffee production stagnated and little new
plantings of these crops were undertaken, because of declining farmgate prices
and the lack of appropriate extension services. In 1971, the Government,
using FAC assistance, founded the National Cocoa and Coffee Development Agency
(SRCC). Its objective is to rehabilitate and expand cocoa and coffee cultiva-
tion by taking advantage of IFCC's cocoa and coffee research station estab-
lished in Togo since 1967, and by providing extension services and essential
infrastructure. SRCC was responsible for managing IDA's first Cocoa-Coffee
Project in 1973 (Cr. 503-TO) and its performance and financial control have
been good. SRCC would continue to be the project executing agency for the
proposed second project. Credits to farmers were introduced through the
Project Credit Unit (PCU) created under the first project within CNCA. Credit
recovery will only start this year and will primarily be the responsibility
of PCU, assisted by licensed buyers of cocoa and coffee. The Government has
agreed to establish an Organization of Licensed Buyers for this purpose by
November 30, 1979 (Section 4.12 of Development Credit Agreement). In addition,
the PCU has created in 1977/78 three pilot village group centers (VGC). They
serve to channel post-harvest technical advice to farmers and to construct
low-cost village stores. The proposed project would provide funds to continue
these services and to build this type of storage space in up to 80 villages.
32.       Individual village members acquire land use rights which they may
transfer to non-village members under rental or sharecropping arrangements.
Under the sharecropping system used for cocoa plantings, the tenant clears the
land and plants, maintains and harvests the crop. He receives as payment a
certain proportion of the crop or is paid a fixed sum per harvested headload
of cocoa. The rights of these tenants are ill-defined and conflicts between
landlords and tenants have arisen, particularly in the main cocoa growing
region (Litime), where about 50 percent of the cocoa area is worked under
various tenancy or sharecropping arrangements. Most tenants have no long-term
security on the land they work. The land shortage means that old trees need
to be uprooted to make space for replanting. But then, tenants and landlords
would have to give up the income from the old trees and have no income from
the new ones for four or five years.
33.       Since 1977, the Government has made bonus payments to landowners of
about US$45 per ha of old cocoa plantings cleared which, however, do not appear
to offer enough incentive to motivate them to replant. As a result only about
half of the 1975-80 cocoa planting target will be met under IDA's first cocoa-
coffee project. The landowner-tenant conflict, which does not affect the
coffee growing area, would be addressed in the proposed second project. The
Government would increase to about US$270 per ha the grant payment for clearing
old and replanting new cocoa and increase farmers' credits for cocoa plantings
from about TS$270 per ha of new plantings to about US$360 paid in equal instal-
ments over a five year period. With the support of the Government, SRCC is
preparing a format for long-term contracts between landowners and tenants.



- 9 -
These contracts are expected to be introduced by the end of March, 1980. IDA
has hired a Togolese consultant to study the landowner-tenant relationship
from a legal, social and traditional point of view. His report indicates that
proposed contractual arrangements appear to be acceptable to landlords and
tenants. This is an encouraging sign that the tenure issue may be resolved
and the cocoa planting targets under the proposed project can be met.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       The proposed project would be a continuation of the first Cocoa-
Coffee Development Project financed by IDA. It was appraised in September/
October 1978 and is summarized at the beginning of this report. Annex III
contains supplementary project data. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 2408-TO
of June 4, 1979, will be distributed separately. Negotiations were held
in Lome, Togo from May 15 to 16, 1979. The Togolese delegation was led by
Mr. Koudjolou Dogo, Minister of Planning, Industrial Development and Admin-
istrative Reform and included Messrs. Gassou and Bagnah, Ministers of Rural
Development and Public Enterprises (including OPAT); and other Government
officials.
35.       The project would be implemented over a five and a half year period,
starting in 1980 and would include the following components:
(i) replanting of about 7,500 ha of coffee and 4,000 ha of
cocoa by about 17,000 smallholder farmers and bringing
into production cocoa and coffee planted under the first
project;
(ii) providing marketing facilities for plantains grown
as temporary shade for young cocoa trees;
(iii) foodcrop plantings within replanted cocoa and coffee
and improvement of foodcrops outside cocoa and coffee;
(iv) extension services, input supply and credit to farmers
and construction of low-cost storage space for cocoa,
coffee and inputs in up to 80 villages;
(v) research and improvement of planting material and seeds
by IFCC for cocoa and coffee and IRAT for foodcrops;
(vi) building or rehabilitating about 300 km of feeder roads
and periodically maintaining these roads and those built
under the first project; and
(vii) provision for a financial manager for SRCC, technical
assistance to improve supervision and training of SRCC
extension agents and to carry out studies on the requirements
for expanded plantain marketing; and on the project's
progress, including preparation of a possible third project.



- 10 -
Project Implementation
36.       The proposed second project would continue to be carried out by
SRCC. As under the first project credits to farmers would be provided by the
CNCA through the PCU. The present General Manager of SRCC is a well-qualified
expatriate who would be retained for the first three years of the proposed
project until a suitably qualified and experienced national is ready to take
over.  The existing expatriate heads of planting material production and
general services (workshop and roads) would also need to be retained. For the
proposed two new posts in SRCC (financial director and field service manager)
it is unlikely that suitably qualified and experienced nationals would be
available. Thus, these positions would be filled by expatriates who would
train Togolese staff to take over their responsibilities at the latest after
project execution. The project also provides for two years of technical
assistance to CNCA (one expatriate) primarily for the purpose of supervising
PCU's initial involvement with recovery of farmer credits made under the first
project. Total technical assistance provided to SRCC would amount to 252
man-months at US$9,500/man-month and to 24 man-months for PCU at US$8,300/
man-month, including contingencies and all travel, housing and other allowances.
To allow for a smooth transition from the first to the second project, the
Government would, as a condition of effectiveness, deposit in a special
account established for SRCC and PCU with a bank satisfactory to the Associa-
tion, initial amounts of CFAF 50 million (US$230,000) and CFAF 25 million
(US$115,000) respectively (Section 6.01 (g) of Development Credit Agreement).
These revolving funds would be replenished quarterly by the Government in
advance, based on SRCC's and PCU's annual budgets.
37.       Most of the land suitable for cocoa and coffee in Togo is already
planted. Thus, the new program would be mainly carried out on land cleared
of old and unproductive trees. The planting program would be undertaken
by smallholders. A total of about 17,000 farmers are expected to participate.
SRCC would determine whether a farmer qualifies for the program by judging the
suitability of his land and his capability to establish and maintain his
plantation. To facilitate extension work, groups would be formed of at least
five farmers with a minimum total of 3 ha to be replanted. These groups would
produce their own planting material in village nurseries under the supervision
of SRCC. Farmers would be responsible for preparation of their plots, includ-
ing planting of plantain shade trees for cocoa plots.
38.       The proposed project would attempt to intensify foodcrop production
in the cocoa-coffee area which traditionally has had a foodcrop deficit. For
this purpose the Government would provide SRCC with two existing demonstration
farms (called centres polyvalents) to be used for field trials and planting
material production. The handing over of these two centers to SRCC would be a
condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01(e) of Development Credit Agreement).
Foodcrops would be interplanted with cocoa and coffee and, in a second phase,
foodcrop cultivation would be introduced outside plantations. As a result,
annual foodcrop production per family is expected to increase by 90 percent
in cereals, and 80 percent in tubers and legumes, an annual incremental pro-
duction of about 3,000 tons of grains and 7,000 tons of tubers.



- 11 -
39.       Production from the plantain shade trees could provide additional
cash income to farmers. However, the size of the output generated might
result in a drop of farmgate prices. At the peak of production in 1986
the Litime area would have an estimated surplus of about 9,000 tons of
bananas. To seek outlets outside of the project area the proposed project
would finance a study of the marketing and logistical requirements needed,
as well as the facilities required to handle the excess plantain (Section
3.02 and Schedule 2 (F) (2) of Development Credit Agreement). Incremental
revenues to farmers are estimated at about US$800/ha over the three years
that plantain trees are under production, before they are uprooted. This
would be an additional incentive for replanting cocoa.
Cocoa and Coffee Marketing
40.       Cocoa.  According to Bank projections, world annual cocoa production
is projected to increase from 1.5 million tons in the mid-1970s (1974/76) to
about 1.9 and 2.3 million tons by 1985 and 1990 respectively. In constant
1978 dollar terms, cocoa prices are expected to fall to about US$1.44 by 1990
from a 1974/76 average of US$2.00/kg and of US$4.05/kg in 1977. The major
reasons for this include the high production anticipated in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, notably in Brazil and Ivory Coast, the gradual decrease of trade
in cocoa beans, the increasing use of cocoa substitutes in chocolate and
confectionery, and the effects of international inflation. Demand growth,
projected at 3.3 percent per annum, is expected to follow the production
trend.
41.       Incremental production from the 4,000 ha to be replanted under the
proposed project would be 2,400 tons annually by 1993. Including the 1,300
tons net additional production expected from the first project (as from 1985),
Togo's total production and exports are projected to reach 20,700 tons by
1993. The present cocoa export quota for Togo, if enforced, would be 20,500
metric tons, with a provision for an increase to 23,000 tons, well above
Togo's projected exports in 1993. Adjustments to quotas would probably be
made under a Third Cocoa Agreement, for which negotiations are currently
proceeding.
42.       Coffee.  High coffee prices during the mid-1950s triggered an expan-
sion of coffee plantings in most producing countries, which led to an increase
in production and to mounting stocks during the early 1960s. Producer stocks
reached their peak of about 5.3 million tons, equal to 2 years of world import
demand, in 1966. As a consequence production fell continuously short of con-
sumption, gradually depleting stocks. However, prices reacted slowly to the
changing market situation. Only when the commodity boom of 1973/74 started,
did coffee prices join the upward trend, reaching US$1.58/kg in 1974, after
an average of US$0.88/kg in the 1960s. The Brazilian frost of 1975 increased
them further to a peak of US$7.25/kg in April 1977. However, consumer re-
sponse to high prices triggered a sharp decline in coffee prices through 1978.
Prices are nonetheless expected to remain above their long-term average level
until 1980. In the longer term the current decline in prices is expected to
slow the rate of new coffee plantings which will result in a strengthening of
coffee prices during the second half of the 1980s. Thus, according to Bank
projections in constant 1978 prices, they will reach US$2.26/kg in 1985 and
US$2.46 in 1990.



- 12 -
43.       Togo's export quota under the 1976 International Coffee Agreement
was 13,500 tons, with provision for an increase up to 16,875 tons in 1981/82.
Projected exports for Togo, including the production resulting from the first
and the proposed projects, are about 15,500 tons in 1990, well within the
quota. The International Coffee Organization has been consulted and has
raised no objection to the project.
Roads
44.       The SRCC road program, which began in 1972, would be continued under
the proposed project. It would consist of constructing and rehabilitating
300 km of feeder-roads and maintaining the 160 km of roads constructed under
the first project as well as those to be constructed under the proposed project.
The program would be carried out by SRCC's road unit which has performed well
under the first project. The roads would be built to standards sufficient to
facilitate essential all-weather traffic. To replace worn-out machinery, new
equipment would be financed under the proposed project. At the end of the
project responsibility for maintenance of these roads would be taken over by
the Rural Works Department of the Ministry of Rural Development.
Credits to Farmers
45.       To enable Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) to handle
efficiently long-term loans to cocoa and coffee farmers, a Project Credit
Unit (PCU), located in SRCC's regional office, was established under the first
project. By mid-1978 PCU's portfolio included over 7,000 loans. Under the
proposed second project, the PCU would continue operating under its present
structure having a central unit responsible for overall management of loans,
general accounting and central cash operations, and one or two credit agents
in each of the SRCC sectors, responsible for disbursements, recovery of
credit, individual accounts and accounts of farmers' groups.
46.       The project would provide credits to farmers for inputs and labor
to plant new cocoa and coffee trees. The term of cocoa credit would be twelve
years including a grace period of six years, and that of coffee credit eight
years including a grace period of four years. The grace periods represent
the respective gestation periods for these crops, during which interest would
be capitalized. In order to achieve PCU's financial viability, it needs to
receive a contribution equivalent to 11 percent on outstanding farmers'
credits. It would collect this rate by charging to farmers an annual interest
of 8.5 percent, CNCA's current rate on farmers' credits which is in line with
BCEAO regulations, and by receiving a complementary payment from the Government
of an additional 2.5 percent per year on outstanding credits to farmers. This
would constitute a compensation by the Government to the farmers as the latter
receive only about one third of the economnic value of cocoa and coffee, while
the Government collects almost two thirds of the market value of these crops
(Section 3.09 and Schedule 5(C)(2)(a) of Development Credit Agreement).
47.       Planters of cocoa and coffee would receive credits totalling
about US$360 and US$430 per ha respectively. Cash payments would amount to
about 80 percent of these credits and be disbursed over five and four years



- 13 -
respectively. The per hectare credit amounts would be reviewed annually
so as to cover possible price increases of inputs. Cocoa farmers would in
addition receive a grant, in five yearly instalments, each of about US$55
per ha as partial compensation for income foregone from old cocoa trees
(Section 6.01(g) of Development Credit Agreement). Credit recovery would rely
primarily on effective and persistent follow-up by PCU's credit agents and the
Organization of Licensed Buyers (para. 31 above).
Project Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing
48.       Project costs in mid-1978 prices during the five and a half year
investment period are estimated at US$31.4 million net of taxes. Taxes are
estimated at US$2.8 million. The foreign exchange component is estimated at
US$12.5 million or 40 percent of net project costs. The proposed IDA and EEC
Special Action credits of US$14 million and US$4.6 million respectively would
cover about 59 percent of net project costs. Financing would also be provided
in the form of a grant from FAC of US$3.5 million and a loan from Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), US$7.7 million. In addition to the
taxes, the Government would finance US$1.6 million in local costs. The terms
and conditions of the CCCE loan would be over 19 years, including 6 years
grace, at a 4.5 percent annual interest rate. The CCCE contribution would be
made available in two tranches, the second being dependent upon satisfactory
project performance during the period covered by the first one, through June
30, 1982. The amount of the first tranche would be US$2.2 million and that of
the second one US$5.5 million. CCCE's main concerns about project performance
refer to the size of the cocoa component in view of the replanting problems
and the maintenance of mature coffee trees. Both issues are addressed in this
project, the first by a substantially increased compensation grant for uproot-
ing old cocoa trees and the second through the provision of a field service
manager and staff to SRCC for improved extension services. In case CCCE would
decide not to proceed with the second tranche, the Government would be required
to provide, if the second tranche is not effective by September 30, 1982, the
necessary financing to complete the project (Sections 4.11 of Development
Credit Agreement). The effectiveness of the first tranche of the CCCE loan
and the signing of the EEC Special Action Fund Credit Agreement would be
conditions of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01(a) and (b) of Development
Credit Agreement). The Borrower would take all measures necessary to obtain
the FAC grant by December 31, 1979. If this grant shall not have become
effective by April 30, 1980, the Borrower would provide the necessary finan-
cing from other sources at conditions satisfactory to the Association (Section
4.10 of Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
49.       Equipment, vehicles and technical assistance to be purchased over
the first 18 months of the project (about US$1.1 million), financed by the EEC
Special Action Credit, would be procured in accordance with the Special Action
Fund guidelines. Other items financed by the EEC Special Action Credit in this
period, mainly operating costs and buildings (about US$3.5 million) would be
procured locally in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Goods and services
financed under the IDA credit would be procured according to the following
procedures: contracts for goods and services of US$50,000 equivalent or more



- 14 -
would be awarded through international competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA Guidelines, amounting to US$2 million; individual contracts for vehicles,
equipment and goods for less than US$50,000 would be awarded on the basis of
local competitive bidding procedures which are acceptable to IDA. Contracts
for less than US$10,000 would be awarded following prudent shopping. The
total amount for these items would not exceed US$1.4 million; civil works
(US$2.9 million), mainly road construction, housing, field offices and ware-
houses, scattered over a large area and unlikely to attract foreign bidders,
would be carried out under force account by SRCC or be contracted through
local competitive bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA;
services of consultants, applied research and seed multiplication, which were
considered satisfactory under the first project, would continue under contracts
approved by IDA, amounting to US$5.4 million; and US$13.5 million would be
expended on salaries and operating costs, and farmers' credit. The materials
and supplies would be obtained in accordance with the borrowers' normal
procedures which are satisfactory.
50.       IDA funds would be disbursed after all proceeds from the EEC Special
Action Fund have been disbursed. The IDA Credit would be disbursed over five
years (pari passu with the funds from CCCE and FAC), against 50 percent of the
following expenditures:
US$ Million
(to be disbursed)
(a)  SRCC (buildings; vehicles and equipment;
technical assistance; studies; local
personnel and operating cost)                               6.08
(b)  PCU (buildings; vehicles and equipment;
technical assistance; local personnel and
operating costs)                                            0.85
(c)  Credit to Farmers                                            2.10
(d)  Research and Foodcrops (IFCC and IRAT)                       1.64
(e)  Road Construction and Maintenance                            1.93
(f)  Unallocated                                                  1.40
TOTAL                                                      14.00
Disbursements for local personnel and operating costs and credit to farmers
would be against certificates of expenditure, the documentation for which
would not be submitted for review, but retained by the borrower and available
for inspection by IDA during the course of project supervision. The control
of these statements of expenditure would be reinforced by the annual external
audit. Disbursements for all other items would be fully documented.
Project Benefits
51.       The project's primary benefits would be the increases in foreign
exchange earnings from higher exports of cocoa and coffee. Maintaining the
present level of producer prices in line with inflation, the Government would



- 15 -
begin to earn revenues from the second project (through OPAT) in 1986.
Project-induced net foreign exchange earnings are estimated to rise to about
US$10 million annually (in constant 1978 terms) by 1993 and thereafter to
remain at about this level. These two crops are the only high-value cash
crops suitable for planting in the project area. Environmental and other
considerations preclude any substantial diversification into other crops.
52.       The project would benefit about 17,000 farm families, about 110,000
people. The average farm income for coffee farmers would increase in 1978
terms, from about US$440 to about US$830 in 1991 and for cocoa from US$1,150
to US$1,620 in the same period. The additional labor requirements during the
project period are expected to be supplied by the farm families which have
limited alternative employment opportunities during the season when such labor
is required. A shadow wage rate of 50 percent has, therefore, been incorpor-
ated in the economic analysis. Economic rates of return have been calculated
for each of the three project components (coffee, cocoa and foodcrops) separa-
tely and for the project as a whole. World market prices used for coffee and
cocoa are in line with the Bank's most recent projections.

Project Risks
53.       Since this is a follow-up project, the risks of failure are much
smaller than for a new venture, especially in view of the achievements under
the first project. The project's major risk is economic. Producer prices for
cocoa and coffee, coupled with the financial package (credits and grants)
offered to farmers, might not constitute a sufficient replanting incentive.
To guard against this risk the Government would consult with IDA annually on
the farmgate prices for cocoa and coffee (Section 4.05 of Development Credit
Agreement). The problem is compounded by the landlord/tenant conflict in the
cocoa area which emerged as a bottleneck for cocoa replanting under the first
project. The Government is attempting to resolve the problem by introducing
by March 31, 1980 contractual arrangements into the sharecropping system,
giving tenant farmers a long-term income security (Section 3.08 of Development
Credit Agreement). In addition, grants for uprooting old cocoa trees would
be increased from about US$45/ha to US$270/ha as a condition of effectiveness
of this credit (Section 6.01(f) of Development Credit Agreement). It is
recognized that the landlord/tenant conflict is a problem which can only be
resolved by the introduction of new contractual measures governing the rela-
tionship. Therefore, targets for cocoa replanting under the proposed project
have been set at about half the level of those for coffee. The risk that
the second tranche of the CCCE loan would not be forthcoming is small, as



- 16 -
described in para. 48 above. However should this be the case the Government
would provide the necessary financing to complete the project (Section 4.11
of Development Credit Agreement).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Togo
and the Association and the draft Special Action Credit Agreement and the
Association as Administrator of the EEC Special Action Account established
with funds contributed by EEC member states, and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
55.       Features of special interest are listed in Section III of Annex III.
Special conditions of effectiveness would be:
(i) the Government's initial deposits in special accounts,
established for SRCC and PCU with a bank satisfactory to
the Association, of CFAF 50 million (US$230,000) and
CFAF 25 million (US$115,000) respectively (para. 36 of
this report);
(ii) the Government's handing over to SRCC of two foodcrop
demonstration farms (para. 38);
(iii)  the effectiveness of the first tranche of the CCCE Loan
Agreement and the signature of the EEC Special Action Fund
Credit Agreement (para. 48); and
(iv) the increase of the premium paid to farmers for uprooting
old cocoa trees (para. 53).
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and that the proposed EEC Special
Action Credit would comply with the criteria established by the Agreement
of May 2, 1978 between the Association, the EEC and its member states.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit and EEC Special Action Credit.

D. Proiects in Execution*
Credit No. 450            Second Highway Project; US$8.7 Million Credit of
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979;
Effectiveness Date: April 19, 1974
The project originally provided for the construction of one section
of the main south-north road axis (Blitta-Sokode) and two secondary roads
(Sokode-Kambola and Agou-Notse). Due to inflation, the scope of the road
construction had to be reduced. The Agou-Notse road, the least priority
stretch of the three roads to be constructed under the project, was dropped
and subsequently included in the Third Highway Project. The project is now
completed and the undisbursed balance (about US$500,000) will be used to
finance studies for future road rehabilitation.
Credit No. 503            Cocoa/Coffee Development Project; US$6 Million Credit
of August 6. 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: March 12, 1975
This project provides for the rehabilitation, planting and mainte-
nance of 4,000 ha of cocoa and 4,400 of coffee in the Plateau Region. While
the coffee component is well on schedule, cocoa is lagging behind, mainly due
to lack of incentive for farmers to uproot old trees for replanting of new
ones. The Government is aware of the problem and has in principle agreed
to increase compensation payments for old trees and credits to farmers.
The project's overall replanting targets (cocoa and coffee combined) are
being met on schedule.
Credit No. 638            Maritime Region Rural Development Project; US$9.5
Million Credit of June 16, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981; Effectiveness Date: October 26,
1976
The purpose of the project is to improve and diversify production
of upland crops (maize, cassava, groundnuts, cowpeas and cotton); develop
lowland rainfed rice and vegetables; rehabilitate irrigation facilities for
existing vegetable production; renovate smallholder coconut plantings; and
provide the necessary support services and infrastructure for about 20,000
farm families. Foodcrop plantings are on target, while rice and cotton
targets are behind schedule, mainly due to uneven rainfall. The related
shortfalls in farmers' revenues have delayed repayment of about 80 percent
of the credits farmers received in 1977.
C  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of the projects in execution and, in particular, to
report any problems which are being encountered and the action being
-:aken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 1235 WAF          CIMAO Regional Clinker Project; US$60 Million 1/
Loan No. 1296 TO           Loans of June 28, 1976; Closing Date:  December 31,
1980; Effectiveness Date: April 17, 1978.
The project is designed to produce 1.2 million tons of clinker for
delivery to cement grinding stations in Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. The
project consists of (i) the industrial complex, comprising quarry, clinker
plant and related workshops, at Tabligbo, about 65 km northeast of Lome, and
(ii) related infrastructure components comprising a power link, a rail/port
terminal at Lome, a rail link and a township for CIMAO personnel. Execution
of the industrial complex is about 6 months behind schedule, due to delays in
civil works, increasing the cost of the project to the limits of available
financing. Commercial production of clinker is expected to start in January
1980.
Credit No. 693             Third Highway Project; US$10 Million Credit of
April 1, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981;
Effectiveness Date: September 13, 1977
The project provides for the reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo
road (45 km), the construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km), the provision
of technical assistance for improving transport planning and road maintenance
and preinvestment studies for a follow-up project. Project execution has
started satisfactorily with construction of the Agou-Notse road 65 percent
and Aneho-Tabligbo 12 percent completed. Recently contractors have stopped
work, however, due to delays in Government's counterpart payments. To ease
the situation the Executive Directors have recently approved US$2 million
additional financing from the EEC Special Action Fund (IDA/R79-37). This
increases total external financing to about 90 percent of project cost.
Credit No. 741             Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas; US$14
Million Credit of October 5, 1977; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982; Effectiveness Date: March 17, 1978
The project aims at increasing cotton production from 7,000 tons
to 34,000 tons and foodcrops grown in rotation with cotton from 40,000 tons
to 57,000 tons of maize and sorghum at full development.  Physical targets
for 1978 project execution have been met.
Credit No. 810             Feeder Roads Project; US$5.8 million Credit of
June 28, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1983;
Effectiveness Date: March 2, 1979
Procurement is underway.

SECOND COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Supplementary Project Data
Section I: Timetable of Key Events
I.   Project Preparation:
Studies carried out under the First Project,
completed                                              March 1977
2.   Appraisal Mission:                                      September/October
1978
3.   Negotiations completed:                                May 1979
4.   Loan Effectiveness Planned:                             September 1979
Section II: Special IDA Implementation Action
IDA funded study on legal, social and traditional values governing
landlord-tenant relationships in the cocoa-growing project area. This study
is expected to help formulate policies on how to resolve conflicts between
landowners and tenant farmers that could potentially hamper progress of the
cocoa planting program.
Section III: Special Conditions
The Government would:
(a) establish by November 30, 1979 an Organization of
Licensed Buyers to assist PCU to recover credits
from farmers (para. 31 of this report);
(b) hire consultants to carry out a study on marketing
of plantain and the related logistical requirements
(para. 39).
(c) cause PCU (through CNCA) to levy an interest rate on
farmer's credits of 8.5 percent and complement this
interest by a rate of 2.5 percent per year on outstand-
ing loans to farmers, bringing total interest collected
by PCU to 11 percent (para. 46);

ANNEX III
Page 2
(d) provide the necessary funds from other sources at
conditions satisfactory to the Association, if the
FAC grant is not effective by April 30, 1980 and/or
if the second tranche of the CCCE Loan is not effec-
tive by September 30, 1982 (paras. 48 and 53); and
(e) consult with IDA annually on the level of farmgate prices
for cocoa and coffee and introduce contractual arrangements
in the cocoa-growing areas between landlords and tenant
farmers (para. 53).
Special Conditions of Effectiveness would be that:
(a) the Government deposits in special accounts, established
for SRCC and PCU, with a bank satisfactory to the Associa-
tion, initial amounts of CFAF 50 million (US$230,000) and
CFAF 25 million (US$115,000) respectively (para. 36);
(b) the Government hand over to SRCC two foodcrop demonstra-
tion farms (para. 38);
(c) the first tranche of the CCCE Loan Agreement is effective
and the EEC Special Action Fund Credit Agreement is signed
(para. 48); and
(d) the Government increases the incentive payments for uprooting
old cocoa trees (paras. 47 and 53).
