Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project has been implemented satisfactorily in terms of development impact, and the fiduciary and safeguards perspectives.

 TSKB’s additional financing of US$300 million equivalent was fully disbursed by end-November, one month ahead of schedule (the residual amount is
 only due to exchange rate differentials). TSKB’s original credit line of US$300 million equivalent fully disbursed by end-2010. Turkish Eximbank (TE)
 disbursed fully in July 2013 under the original finance – US$298 million equivalent credit line and US$2 million for TE institutional development.

 The project exceeded expectations as measured by the PDO indicator on export performance by participating firms, which exceeded their peers by 6
 percentage points, and as measured by the low non-performing sub-loans in the project portfolio.

 The project has been restructured four times since approval in 2008: (i) an extension of the closing date following the additional financing in May 2011,
 (ii) a relaxation of eligibility restrictions (related to sectors) for TE in June 2011, (iii) a one-time procurement exemption for TSKB in October 2012, and
 (iv) a reallocation of proceeds from TE’s institutional development component to TE’s credit line (given lower procurement costs and TE’s decision to
 complete some activities under its own resources). In addition, TSKB proceeded with several reallocations of loan proceeds between PFIs during
 project implementation, based on PFI performance and demand, with the World Bank's no objection but without requiring formal World Bank project
 amendments.

 The project did not have a formal mid-term review, justified by the extensive review of Component 1 during the preparation of the additional financing,
 and of Component 2 for the project restructuring. The M&E and Environmental Frameworks were also revised at that time. However, the PDO was
 never revised: the ISR section on the PDO just corrects the discrepancy between the first ISR and the formal legal agreements.

 The Implementation Completion Report mission was completed in October 2014. The report will be published within six month of project closing date, by
 end-June 2014.

         Comments
         The difference with the previous value is because of updated data. The total amount considered non-performing was $24.5 million
         compared to a total volume of $846.01 million disbursed. As of June 2014, the NPL ratio was 2.8 percent in the banking sector; and
         7.1 percent in the leasing sector. Based on a 72/28 distribution of the EFIL IV loan portfolio, the sector weighted average NPL ratio
         against which we are comparing project performance is 4 percent. The target was fully achieved.

               Total exports of participating firms grew 6 percentage points (5.96) more than exports in their relative sector (the median relative
               growth was calculated for each participating exporter, and not the average – to avoid the distorting effect of outliers). The target was
               fully achieved.

               The indicator has been significantly reduced from 14 pps (based on 2012 exports) to 6pps (based on 2013 exports), due to a
               substantial fall of exports in the metalware sector (Manufacture of basic metals + Manufacture of fabricated metal products (exc
               machinery)) in 2013. Exports in this sector fell by 31% in 2013, compared to 2012 and 21% of the EFIL IV loan portfolio is
               comprised of loans to exporters in this sector.

               Some caveats need to be considered in the calculation: (i) The calculation is based on the latest available figures, with the latest
               exports data not always available. (ii) For firms that participated in EFIL IV in 2008 and 2009, export data only starts in 2009. As a
               result, for these firms, the calculation involves only their relative export growth rate since 2009. (iii) Sector classification by
               Eximbank and TKSB does not always match that of the Statistical Institute of Turkey (TUIK), requiring mapping to capture the
               activity of the participating firms. The “hotel & restaurants” and “construction” sectors were compared to the overall exporting
               volumes, because there is no equivalent sector in the TUIK tables.
