competitiveness", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "80150", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Fourth Export Finance\n            Intermediation Loan Project(EFIL IV) for Turkey were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: for any project, the design\n            context is inevitably different from the implementation\n            context. Market conditions evolve during implementation, and\n            adjustments are necessary to minimize implementation delays\n            and maximize the project\u2019s developmental impact. Eligibility\n            restrictions of any kind are thus counterproductive,\n            especially during times of hardship. Sector, geographical\n            and gender-based restrictions although motivated by strong\n            development objectives, often fail to account for a possible\n            over-sensitivity of the specific target beneficiaries to\n            adverse market conditions. In Turkey, commercial practices\n            have been assessed as acceptable with regard to World Bank\n            procurement requirements. As a result, project procurement\n            requirements should be similar to existing practices of PFIs\n            for sub-loan preparation and record-keeping requirements.\n            Given the recurrent complaints of PFIs and sub-borrowers, a\n            clear definition of working-capital expenditures and\n            distinctions between procurement and non-procurement\n            working-capital expenditures is warranted. The Innovative\n            Finance Project is already following this approach, which\n            should be widespread among all credit line operations. The\n            impact of a project extends beyond the loan amount extended\n            to firms and employment generation. First, it is often more\n            interesting to analyze the loan purposes, the nature of\n            investments, and productivity over time. Second, employment\n            data do not capture the firm\u2019s activities and life cycle.\n            Investments may lead to employment substitution, stagnation,\n            and even reduction, as confirmed by beneficiary site visits.\n            Furthermore, the operational manual and the subsidiary loan\n            agreements should have a section on monitoring and\n            evaluation requirements for the project similar to those\n            related to safeguards and fiduciary responsibilities."}, "docdt": "2015-06-23T03:16:01Z"}
