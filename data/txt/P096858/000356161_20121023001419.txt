                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER
A. SUMMARY

1.      The only proposed change to the captioned Project is to allow, on an exceptional
basis, a one time waiver to permit an increase in the threshold for using Established
Private or Commercial Practices from US$10 million to US$23 million equivalent or less
per contract for the procurement of raw material-primary unalloyed aluminum.

B.       PROJECT STATUS

2.      The Project has progressed well. Disbursements are ahead of schedule, and 12
financial intermediaries are participating in the Project, including the two borrowers
(Türkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.Ş (TSKB) and Turk Export Import Bank. The project
has supported 146 beneficiary enterprises and the non performing loan ratio is 0.6%.

3.        Under Component 1 of the Project, which is implemented by TSKB, additional
financing (total of US$180,000,000 and EUR87,800,000) was approved on March 17,
2011 to scale up activities. The additional loan was declared effective on May 2, 2011.
As of September 19, 2012 67.39% of funds were disbursed from the US$180,000,000
amount of the loan and 83.17% from the EUR87,800,000 amount of the loan
respectively.

4.        All Implementation Status and Results Report ratings are satisfactory or better.
The project is also fully complaint with all fiduciary or safeguard requirements

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

        Procurement

5.      The Bank has received a request from TSKB dated August 27, 2012 to provide a
one-time procurement waiver to lift the procurement threshold of established private
sector or commercial practices, referred to in Part B.2 of Section III in the Schedule 2 to
the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement provides that contracts for goods or works
estimated to cost the equivalent of $10,000,000 or less per contract may be awarded in
accordance with the established private sector or commercial practices. TSKB has requested
that a sub-contract executed by a sub-borrower is estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$23 million for raw material-primary unalloyed aluminum, be procured using
established private sector or commercial practices. The justifications for the waiver is based
on the fact that the global trade practice of procuring aluminum is based on the London
Metal Exchange prices, and not through International Competitive Bidding

6.    Based on the justifications described above, a one time waiver is proposed for
TSKB to use established private sector or commercial practices to procure raw material-


                                              4
primary unalloyed aluminum under a contract estimated to cost the equivalent of US$23
million. Clearance for this has been granted by the regional procurement manager.
