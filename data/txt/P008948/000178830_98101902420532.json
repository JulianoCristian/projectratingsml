The principal aim of the program\n            is to redirect the Turkish economy towards a development\n            path placing more reliance on market forces and adopting a\n            more outward-oriented strategy. The measures to be taken in\n            this phase of the stabilization program are outlined in the\n            Government's Statement of Development Policies - 1983,\n            and fall into two main categories: (a) at the macroeconomic\n            level, the program includes the development of a medium-term\n            framework, continued rationalization of the public\n            investment program, reform of the State Economic\n            Enterprises, import liberalization and export incentives;\n            (b) at the sectoral level, the program includes the\n            implementation of measures to address structural issues in\n            the financial, agricultural and energy sectors. The loan\n            will finance all imports with the exception of items\n            financed by other sources, military or para-military items,\n            luxury goods and nuclear reactors."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
