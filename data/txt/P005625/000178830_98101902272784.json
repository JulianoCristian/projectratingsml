          of STEG's 1977-1981 development program for electricity\n            generation. It consists of about 150 MW in seven gas turbine\n            units of equal size to be installed two each in Sfax (1977)\n            and Menzel Bourguiba (1978), and one each to be installed in\n            Tunis South, Korba and Metlaoui (1980). The main objectives\n            of the project are: (1) to ensure continuity of electricity\n            supply; (2) to cover the need for peakpower capacity, and\n            (3) to allow STEG to implement its next expansion program\n            later with larger and more efficient steam turbine units\n            than would be possible without the prior installation of gas\n            turbine units as proposed in this project."}, "docdt": "1976-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
