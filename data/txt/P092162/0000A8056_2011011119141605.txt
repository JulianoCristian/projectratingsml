                         Grant closing date was extended by three years, and the project was restructured to address significant cost overruns and funding gap. An action plan was drawn by the Government
                         to complete project's ongoing activities in the provincial towns by October 31, 2010. A review in November 2010 indicated that the Government has failed to implement the action
