One key reason for slow\n            disbursements is the delays in implementation of the\n            investment program attributable to Public Works Executing\n            Agency (AGETIP), which is carrying out the work program for\n            48 communes. Although AGETIP is a well-managed entity, it\n            was overloaded with many other programs and suffered a lack\n            of efficient oversight. The closing date for Senegal, Local\n            Authorities Development Project, will be extended from\n            December 31, 2011 until September 30, 2013. This will be the\n            first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
