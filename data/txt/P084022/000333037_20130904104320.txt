         SENEGAL - LOCAL AUTHORITIES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                              P084022
                           CREDIT 4224-SE
                                 Restructuring Paper

1.    The proceeds for the Senegal Local Authorities Development Program, Credit No.
4224-SE, P084022 will be reallocated as follows:

   Category of Expenditures           Allocation (SDR)             % of Financing
      Current       Revised         Current      Revised         Current     Revised
1. Investment      Unchanged       42,700,000 46,800,000          100%      Unchanged
   Programs under
   Part B of the
   Project
2. Support for     Unchanged        8,100,000     7,000,000      100% of    Unchanged
   implementation                                              expenditures
   monitoring and                                               excluding
   evaluation                                                     taxes
   under Parts A
   and C of the
   Project
3. Unallocated     Unchanged        3,000,000         0
   TOTAL                           53,800,000    53,800,000


2.      Due to slow start up and implementation delays, the closing date was extended to
September 30, 2013 to allow for full implementation of project activities and
disbursement of the proceeds of the Credit. In the pre-election period, in addition to a
general slowdown of activities, the Government had taken some decisions that countered
the decentralization process which weakened the municipalities and somewhat impacted
their performance. Despite this difficult context, the project has now disbursed more than
67% of the credit proceeds, double the amount disbursed during FY11. The new
Government in place since the last election has shown a strong interest in the project and
has expressed its commitment to quickly resolve all pending issues. The team is confident
about the achievement of the project development objective before the new closing date.
The level of works commitments under IDA financing has reached about 82 percent and
the disbursement rate is on the increase (between start of January and end of May 2012,
the project has disbursed over US$ 9 million, an average of US$ 1.8 million per month).
This huge improvement is close to the US$ 2.0 million per month agreed on, during May
2011 supervision.

3.      The PDO and IP ratings remain Moderately Satisfactory. The ratings are expected
to be reviewed during the next supervision and if implementation progress is maintained,
the team would consider upgrading the ratings to Satisfactory.


                                            3
4.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to cover the additional costs generated by
additional works that appeared as crucial during the implementing of the interurban roads
program in Dakar. These works have addressed, among others, the widening of certain
roads, the sidewalks, purging and loading of old dump discovered in the hold of a
program road, the change in the road structure to take in account existing oil pipes
discovered under the road, and strengthening the axis passing through the wetland of
Niayes, etc.

5.      The unallocated amount (category 3) of US3.0 million and an amount of US$1.1
million from category 2 (Support for implementation monitoring and evaluation under
Parts A and C) will be transferred to category 1 (Investment programs under Part B).
