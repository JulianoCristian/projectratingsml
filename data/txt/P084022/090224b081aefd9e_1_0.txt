                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is scheduled to close on September 30, 2013 and has now disbursed about 86% of the credit amount. All works have been committed. The following issues are still
                         pending since the previous supervision mission: finalizing delayed works, and liberating occupied or needed rights of way. The Government is committed to resolving these pending
                         issues quickly. It was agreed, at the last supervision mission, the establishment of a committee (by end March 2013) comprising key agencies and the Ministry of Finance to ensure
                         close monitoring of the remaining activities and take urgent actions when necessary.

                         Furthermore, the government is fully committed to the decentralization agenda (via its new decentralization strategy called axis 3). Discussions on the new national decentralization
                         strategy are ongoing. Studies prepared under the project are being utilized for the preparation of the strategy. There is a need for Bank's continuous support to the government in its
                         efforts to sustain the urban and local development agendas.
