                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Due to slow start up and implementation delays, the closing date was extended to September 30, 2013 to allow for full implementation of project activities and disbursement of the
                         proceeds of the Credit. The FY12 year was unique in Senegal because of the tension that prevailed during the pre-election period. In addition to the general downturn of activities
                         which resulted, the Government had taken some decisions that countered decentralization and this has weakened the municipalities and reduced their performance. Despite this
                         difficult context, the project has now disbursed more than 63% of its global amount, doubling the amount disbursed during FY11. The new Government in place since the last election
                         has shown a strong interest in the project and has expressed its commitment to resolve all pending issues quickly.
