 moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the willingness of the Government\n            of Senegal (GoS) to move forward with decentralization\n            agenda, during and after the project, cannot occur without\n            clear frameworks and a strong enabling environment. A\n            clearer legal framework is needed to support the development\n            of contract management agency (CMA) beyond public works\n            executing agency (agence d'execution de travaux\n            d'interet public pour l'emploi) (AGETIP) and\n            evolution of the municipal development agency (agence de\n            developpement municipal) (MDA) as an institution focused on\n            financing service delivery in communes (on behalf of the\n            government). The use of the municipal contract had proven to\n            be relevant all through the project. Although the\n            implementation tools (urban, financial, and organizational\n            audits) had proven relevant since the urban development and\n            decentralization program (UDDP), it is necessary to\n            complement them with performance-oriented tools, such as\n            scaled public expenditure and financial assessment (PEFA),\n            performance-based municipal contracts, set up of minimal\n            conditions for equipment maintenance, among others.\n            Opportunities for diversified sources of funding should be\n            explored, along with a rethinking of the exact role of the MDA."}, "docdt": "2014-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
