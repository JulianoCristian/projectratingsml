                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is scheduled to close on December 16, 2013. As of October 29, 2013, 86% of the credit amount has been disbursed. The last supervision mission (September 2013)
                         confirmed that the current conditions are conducive to the completion of the works in timely manner: (i) all the environmental and social constraints have been removed; and (ii) the
                         extension of the closing date from September to December 2013 should allow the termination of the remaining works, among others, the drainage works in Camille Basse district.
                         The Government is committed to resolving these pending issues quickly and complete the project in due time.

                         Furthermore, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment towards a more effective decentralization via the launch of the Third Act of the Decentralization Strategy. The Bank will
                         closely follow up on the implementation of this strategy and is ready to provide additional support to sustain the Government's urban and local development agendas.
