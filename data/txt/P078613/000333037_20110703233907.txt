SUMMARY
1.     This Restructuring Paper (RP) seeks your approval to amend the Grant
Agreement (Multi Donor Trust Fund- MDTF-TF No. TF056653) co-financing the Sierra
Leone Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project.

2.      The disbursement under the Sierra Leone Institutional Reform and Capacity
Building Project (IRCBP) closed on March 31, 2009. The proposed changes do not
affect the IRCBP Project Development Objective and involve scaling up support for
Sierra Leone’s successful decentralization program under the Grant Agreement.

3.     Specifically, we are requesting:

       (i)     the amendment of the Grant Agreement to reflect additional funds to be
               administrated by the Bank based on last call of funds;

       (ii)    the amendment of the Grant Agreement to accommodate additional
               resources approved by the Administrative Agreement signed by EC on
               May 30, 2001. The total amount of the additional resources are EUR
               400,000 million; and
       (iii)   the amendment of the Grant Agreement to reflect the reallocation of funds
               to be administrated by the Bank.

4.     The additional financing to support this scaling up of the IRCBP Project is
provided by EC through the MDTF with an estimated value of EUR 1,310,000 million
(US$1,915,875 million equivalents).

5.      The project implementing entities are in full compliance with the Bank’s financial
management requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial
report from these entities.


PROJECT STATUS
6.      An IDA grant (of SDR 16.8 million - $25.12 million) for ICRBP was approved on
May 11, 2004. It became effective on July 6, 2004. The PDO is to support the post-
conflict Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) to establish a functioning local government
system and improve inclusiveness, transparency and accountability of overall public
financial management at all levels of government. The original Project had four
components: (1) Decentralization and Capacity Building Component to support the
detailed design and implementation of the GoSL decentralization program, (2) Public
Financial Management (PFM) Reform Component to support implementation of the
                                            4
GoSL PFM reform program, (3) Development Learning Center (DLC) Component to
establish an information, communications and training center, combining a Global
Development Learning Network site and a Development Information Center, and (4)
IRCBP Coordination Component to ensure that IRCBP implementation complies with the
World Bank’s fiduciary guidelines and to ensure effective implementation of the first
three components. The original closing date of June 30 2008 was amended to March 31,
2009 in January 2008.

7.      A Grant Agreement (MDTF) was established in March 2006 to provide co-
financing for Components 1 and 4 of IRCBP until January 31, 2011. The MDTF is
funded by the European Commission (EC) and UK Department for International
Development (DFID) which committed Euro 9.10 million and GBP 7.95 million
respectively, and has a current estimated total value of about US$ 23.7 million.
Disbursement from the MDTF commenced in October 2006. The MDTF was amended
in March 14, 2011 to reflect changes in the original result framework and extensions of
the Closing Date up to June 30, 2011 and the administrative agreements signed with EC
and DFID. As of April 6, 2011, the Project has disbursed about US$ 21,476,968.622
million which represents about 97 per cent of the original amount committed. The
Project has committed an additional amount of US$1,639,894 million equivalent, which
will be disbursed before the project closes on June 30, 2011.

8.    The disbursement of the IDA credit of SDR 16.8m was effectively completed by
March 31, 2009 with a total of US$ 25.06 million disbursed as at IDA Grant closure on
November 4, 2009.

9.     The Project has been rated Satisfactory in terms of achievement of the PDO as
almost all the targets with respect to the PDO indicators were achieved. Key
achievements include:

Decentralization

   •   Successful completion of two rounds of democratic local elections.
   •   19 functioning local councils established, with participatory planning operating in
       all councils, and financial management standards met in most councils.
   •   Maintenance of service delivery levels in five key services following devolution,
       in most councils.
   •   Establishment and operation of an intergovernmental fiscal transfer system on an
       equitable and transparent basis which is universally accepted.

Public Financial Management

   •   Establishment of a modern regulatory framework for public finance through
       adoption of the Government Budget and Accountability Act 2005 and Public
       Procurement Act 2004.
   •   Implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Information System
       (IFMIS) as the Accountant General’s core accounting system, and roll out to 11
       ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs).

                                            5
   •   Removal of the substantial backlog in submission of annual financial statements
       to the Auditor- General, and achievement of timely in-year accounting and
       financial reporting.
   •   Establishment and operationalization of two procurement oversight bodies1,
       integration of procurement planning into the budgeting process, and completion
       of training and certification of procurement staff in central and local government.




PROPOSED CHANGES
Amendment of the Grant Agreement (MDTF)

10.   On May, 2011, the GoSL asked for the last call of funds und the Grant
Agreement, final tranche of EUR 910,000.

11.      On March 7th, 2011, the GoSL requested EC the reallocation of contingency
reserves of EUR 400,000 foreseen in the Grant Agreement between the GoSL and EC
(see Attachment 1). The GOSL letter explained the 2010 Annual Work Plan had included
a provision of US$500,000 for the supply and installation of solar power system for the
office complexes of each of the six (6) Local Councils in the more remote parts of the
country. The Local Councils identified are Bonthe Municipality, Bonthe District,
Kailahun District, Pujehun District, Koinadugy District and Hambia District. Also, the
letter informed that the GoSL has carried out a survey to determine power needs and
costing of the supply and the installation and estimated unit cost of US$163,865 for each
solar equipment at a total cost of US$1,083,190 resulting in a cost overrun.

12.    On April 5, 2011, the EC concurred with the GoSL’s proposal to the use of the
contingency funds of EUR 400,000 to fully cover the cost of US$ 1,083,190 for the 6
Local Councils. The GoSL subsequently requested the amendment to the Administrative
Agreement with the Bank. Bank response accepting to administer the resources is
attached.

13.    On May 16, 2011, the GoSL requested the reallocation of funds within the Grant
Agreement. The reallocation of proceeds will result in the increase of funds in the
category of goods and operating costs of the project.

14.     The Bank team considers the proposed reallocation: (i) as a Project change within
the meaning of OP/BP 13.05 (Project Supervision); (ii) does not involve the use of cost of
Project savings, specifically as per footnote 3 to OP 13.25; and (iii) does not involve any
new change to the original project description. Further, the team considers the proposed
reallocation to be a minor one within the meaning of OP/PB 13.05 (Para. 21 of the BP).
Finally, the proposed reallocation will not result in significant changes to the Project's
description, objectives, or associated outcome targets
