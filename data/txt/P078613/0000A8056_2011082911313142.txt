                         All 19 local councils have three-year rolling development plans. Councils have established ward committees, technical planning committees (TPCs), and have annual work plans. The
                         development plans were also linked to the national PSRP and the MDG goals. Since 2007, All 19 LCs prepared the FY07 budgets that comply with the content requirements of

                         Section 67. Furthermore, during the period under review, satisfactory progress has been made on previously agreed actions. As such, the project has been given a final rating of
                         satisfactory in terms of the PDO and implementation progress.

                         This was facilitated by the intensive support provided by the Bank task team during the last few months. Three separate visits were undertaken to ensure satisfactory completion of
                         remaining activities before project closure. Close coordination with the operational, finance and procurement units was carried out to facilitate the orderly closure of accounts and
                         timely conclusion of ongoing and the last remaining activities.

                         The IRCBP team has also closely coordinated with the DSDP team to continue mainstreaming actions including the identification of the list of preliminary activities to be rolled out
                         with DSDP support.
