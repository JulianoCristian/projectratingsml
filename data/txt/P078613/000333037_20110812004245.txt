SUMMARY
1.    This Restructuring Paper (RP) seeks your approval to amend the Grant
Agreement (Multi Donor Trust Fund- MDTF) for the Sierra Leone Institutional Reform
and Capacity Building Project (TF No. TF056653).

2.      The Sierra Leone Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP),
IDA Grant Number H086-0 SL has closed on March 31, 2009. The proposed change
does not affect the IRCBP Project Development Objective. It involves addition and
reallocation of funds $1,570,814.45 of earned investment incomes due to the exchange
rate fluctuation.

3.     Specifically, we are requesting:

       (i)     the amendment of the Grant Agreement to reflect the reallocation of funds to
               be administrated by the Bank.

4.      The project implementing entities are in full compliance with the Bank’s financial
management requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial
report from these entities.


PROJECT STATUS
5.      An IDA grant (of SDR 16.8 million - $25.12 million) for ICRBP was approved on
May 11, 2004. It became effective on July 6, 2004. The PDO is to support the post-
conflict Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) to establish a functioning local government
system and improve inclusiveness, transparency and accountability of overall public
financial management at all levels of government. The original Project had four
components: (1) Decentralization and Capacity Building Component to support the
detailed design and implementation of the GoSL decentralization program; (2) Public
Financial Management (PFM) Reform Component to support implementation of the
GoSL PFM reform program; (3) Development Learning Center (DLC) Component to
establish an information, communications and training center, combining a Global
Development Learning Network site and a Development Information Center; and (4)
IRCBP Coordination Component to ensure that IRCBP implementation complies with the
World Bank’s fiduciary guidelines and to ensure effective implementation of the first
three components. The original Closing Date of June 30 2008 was amended to March 31,
2009 in January 2008.

6.     A Grant Agreement (MDTF) was established in March 2006 to provide co-
financing for Components 1 and 4 of IRCBP until January 31, 2011. The MDTF is
funded by the European Commission (EC) and UK Department for International
Development (DFID) which committed Euro 9.10 million and GBP 7.95 million
                                            4
respectively, and has a current estimated total value of about US$ 23.7 million.
Disbursement from the MDTF commenced in October 2006. The MDTF was amended
in March 14, 2011 to reflect changes in the original result framework and extensions of
the Closing Date up to June 30, 2011 and the administrative agreements signed with EC
and DFID. As of April 6, 2011, the Project has disbursed about US$
7.      22,117,504 million which represents about 96 per cent of the original amount
committed. The Project has committed the remaining available funds, which will be
disbursed during the grace period.

8.    The disbursement of the IDA credit of SDR 16.8m was effectively completed by
March 31, 2009 with a total of $ 25.06 million disbursed as at IDA Grant closure on
November 4, 2009.

The Project has been rated Satisfactory in terms of achievement of the PDO as almost all
the targets with respect to the PDO indicators were achieved.

Reallocation of Fund of the Grant Agreement (MDTF)

On June 29, 2011, the GoSL requested the reallocation of funds within the Grant The
reallocation of proceeds will imply the increase of funds in the Category of Goods of the
Project.

9.      The Bank team considers the proposed reallocation: (i) as a Project change within
the meaning of OP/BP 13.05 (Project Supervision); (ii) does not involve the use of cost of
Project savings, specifically as per footnote 3 to OP 13.25; and (iii) does not involve any
new change to the original project description. Further, the team considers the proposed
reallocation to be a minor one within the meaning of OP/PB 13.05 (Para. 21 of the BP).
Finally, the proposed reallocation will not result in significant changes to the Project’s
description, objectives, or associated outcome targets
