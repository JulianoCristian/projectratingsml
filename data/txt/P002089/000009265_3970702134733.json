the supply of\n            fuelwood, poles and fodder; as well as (3) increase the\n            supply of industrial wood. The project would accomplish this\n            with: (a) an afforestation program; (b) a forest management\n            program; and (c) assistance for management, training, policy\n            analysis, research and studies. The project's\n            afforestation component would stabilize soil conditions and\n            enhance soil moisture and nutrient content, benefitting\n            agricultural productivity. The forest management component\n            would improve the management of existing plantations and\n            help establish new plantations, increasing the availability\n            of industrial timber. The support for management, training,\n            policy initiatives, research and studies would greatly\n            strengthen the structural base of the sector."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
