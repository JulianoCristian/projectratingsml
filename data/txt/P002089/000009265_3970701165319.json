of\n            the Federal and State Governments to:  (1) strengthen the\n            structural base of the forestry sector; (2) stabilize soil\n            conditions in threatened areas and improve the supply of\n            fuelwood, poles and fodder; as well as (3) increase the\n            supply of industrial wood.  The project would accomplish\n            this with:  (a) an afforestation program; (b) a forest\n            management program; and (c) assistance for management,\n            training, policy analysis, research and studies.  The\n            project's afforestation component would stabilize soil\n            conditions and enhance soil moisture and nutrient content,\n            benefitting agricultural productivity.  The forest\n            management component would improve the management of\n            existing plantations and help establish new plantations,\n            increasing the availability of industrial timber. The\n            support for management, training, policy initiatives,\n            research and studies would greatly strengthen the structural\n            base of the sector."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
