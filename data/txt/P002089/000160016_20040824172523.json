The project partially achieved its\n            objectives of strengthening the structural base of the\n            forestry sector and increasing the supply of industrial\n            wood, and substantially achieved the objective of\n            stabilizing soil conditions in parts of northern Nigeria.\n            Sustainability is likely; Bank and Borrower performance are\n            rated as generally satisfactory. Key lessons included the\n            following: The Bank and the Borrower need to 1) ensure that\n            a conducive policy environment exists or will be created\n            within an agreed time frame before investing in forestry\n            development; 2) identify and involve all project\n            stakeholders from the planning stage and through the\n            implementation and evaluation stages. A sense of ownership\n            has to be created among the stakeholders to encourage a\n            commitment to implementation and enhance project\n            sustainability; 3) firmly establish from the beginning the\n            collaboration among different agencies involved in the\n            project; and 4) ensure that future projects, particularly\n            for long gestation activities such as afforestation and\n            forestry plantations, are designed as time slices of a long\n            term commitment. This promotes a long-term perspective among\n            the implementers and allows subsequent phases of a project\n            to benefit from the experience of the previous ones."}, "docdt": "1997-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
