MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Zaire -
Agricultural Sector Management and Institutional Development Project
(Cr. 1958-ZR)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Zaire Agricultural Sector
Management and Institutional Development project (Cr. 1958-ZR) prepared by the Africa Regional
Office. The Borrower did not complete Part II.
The project had a unifying concept. Donor support for Zaire's agriculture was often
weakened because it relied on independent, project-specific management units. When the donor
ceased support, projects-unless self-financing-ceased to function; many disappeared with hardly a
trace. The project's solution was to work directly with the national agricultural ministries in a
sustained effort to improve them, inter alia by gradually building a cadre of competent and dedicated
civil servants. Eventually this would "create and maintain a policy environment conducive to private
investment with Government providing essential infrastructure and services," and an "institutional
framework in which donors will operate in harmony and contribute to the accelerated development of
the public sector institutions they wish to support" (President's Report).
Accordingly, the project aimed to develop the capacity of the agricultural ministries to
manage public expenditures, undertake economic analysis and policy formulation, collect statistics,
and manage personnel. To these ends, two thirds of the IDA credit were programmed for
consultants, the remainder for training, vehicles, equipment and logistic support. The project
succeeded for a time in developing a productive unit for policy analysis and programme development,
but it was always very dependent on donor financing. For other assisted institutions the PCR
suggests that results were weaker.
In the t:.ree years of disbursement-the collapse of the state forced cancellation in the fourth
year-the project achieved many of its immediate goals but did not achieve the long-term objectives
specified in the President's Report such as "(i) improved... sector-wide planning of donor
interventions; (ii) effective control of public expenditures; and (iii) civil service reform."
The project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory, institutional development as negligible and
sustainability as unlikely. The PCR is adequate.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAIRE
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT
AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1958-ZR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Agricultural Sector Management and
Institutional Development Project in Zaire, for which Credit 1958-ZR in the amount of SDR 9.0
million (US$11.6 million) was approved on October 20, 1988. The credit was closed on April 19,
1994, two years and two months ahead of schedule because of Zaire falling in arrears with the
Bank. The final disbursement was on January 4, 1994 and the undisbursed balance in the amount
of SDR 2,088,520.66 (US$2,944,815) was canceled on January 6, 1994. Expected Belgian co-
financing in the amount of US$2.5 million was not provided following the break in relations
between Zaire and Belgium in 1990.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture and Environment Operations Division of the
South-Central and Indian Ocean Department of the Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III). This report is based, inter alia, on the President's Report; the
Development Credit Agreement; project supervision and progress reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda. A copy of this report was
sent to the Borrower on December 22, 1994 with a request to prepare Part II.

AGRICULTURAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT
AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1958-ZR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
General Background
I.    Agriculture and forestry are considered vital to Zaire's economy. In 1985, agriculture
alone accounted for over 30 percent of GDP and provided direct and indirect employment to over
80 percent of the economically active population. However, these two sub-sectors have, since
the 1 970s, faced enormous difficulties stemming primarily from the deterioration of Zaire's terms
of trade, ill-conceived and poorly implemented macro-economic policies and poorly selected and
executed public investment programs. In an attempt to solve these problems, the Government of
Zaire had requested IDA financing in order to establish the First Agricultural Technical
Assistance Project in 1982 (PATI, Cr. 1244-ZR). This project supported efforts to define a new
agricultural strategy and to improve the share of public resources allocated to the agriculture
sector. It was on balance successful, with funds from the credit enabling improved program and
project supervision and monitoring of activities in the field.  The Agricultural Sector
Management and Institutional Development Project, was designed to build on the
accomplishments of PAT1.
Objectives
2.    The project aimed to strengthen the key public management functions of the agricultural
sector ministries through focusing on: (i) economic analysis and general policy formulation; (ii)
public expenditure programming and execution; (iii) the Ministry of Agriculture's human
resources development and evaluation capacity; and (iv) training.  By working through
permanent government structures, the project aimed at institution-building.
Implementation Experience
3.    The credit became effective on May 5, 1989 (about four months after it was signed). It
was not until September 1989 that the technical assistance team was assembled; the delay being
attributable to lengthy hiring procedures, unavailability of certain consultants proposed by the
selected consulting firms, and IDA not agreeing to the contracts until consultant fees were
reduced.



iv                                                                    Evaluatio .5Sunnna,r
4.    Actual project costs amounted to US$9.9 million (versus US$16.6 million estimated at
appraisal. Of this, the Government contributed US$0.5 million (US$2.5 million estimated), the
Government of Belgium contributed a negligible amount (US$2.5 million estimated) and IDA
contributed US$9.4 million (US$11.6 million estimated). The gap between actual and estimated
costs is explained by the lack of counterpart funding, the Government of Belgium witlhdrawing
its support to the project in 1990 following the breakdown in bilateral relations between the
countries and IDA's suspension of the Credit on July 15, 1993 because of the country falling into
arrears on its repayments.
5.    The project's overall design was appropriate and based to a large extent on lessons
learned from PATI. However, project design failed to adequately address two main risks:
ministerial turnover and inadequate counterpart funding. The latter was not even identified as a
risk in the President's Report, even though several IDA and donor financed projects were already
experiencing serious implementation problems as a result of this, prior to this project's appraisal.
6.    The project supported the establishment of the first Agricultural and Rural Developmenit
Master Plan. This plan established the broad strategic framework for agricultural development
and was to be supplemented by regional action plans. Because of the political instability that
prevailed during 1991-93, only the action plan for the Bas-Zaire region was prepared. The
project helped, in particular, with the preparation of the forestry and environmenit project, the
national extension project, the perennial crops project and the animal health project. These
projects were not implemented, however, because of the country's problematic political and
macro-economic situation. Resources were made available to improve investment programminig
and project supervision and monitoring capacity. The Ministries of Agriculture and RuLal
Development were merged in 1990 in name only; their structures were not integrated. A cenisus
of all Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and Ministry of the Environiment
and Nature Conservation (MECN) personnel was conducted in 1991 with a view to rationalizinig
personnel management.
Results
7.    Initially, the project was successful. The proceeds of the Credit and the presence of long-
term consultants enabled MARD and MECN to step up their supervision and monitoring ol
programs and projects in the field. Thanks to the training courses, the statf of MARD and
MECN were better equipped to prepare projects and carry out economic analyses. The capacityv
of the General Services Directorates improved, in that they developed sonic personillel
management control with computerized personnel data management systems that are easier to
manage.
8.    In the short term, the project's most visible impact has been to provide a regular and
reliable source of financing for the activities of key MARD and MECN directorates. Thle project
has shown that, providing resources are available, MARD and MECN can operate adequatelv



Evaluation Suimmaty                                                                v
and effectively if they improve the quality of their services by providing their staff with
continuing and regular training programs.
9.    The project results would have been better had the political and macro-economic
environment been favorable. It proved impossible to evaluate a considerable number of the
projects prepared with the project's assistance because of the lack of political security. The
human resource rationalization work was severely handicapped by the paralysis of the civil
service (prolonged absenteeism and persistent strikes). The study on the reorganization of
MARD was not carried out, due mainly to the fact that most of the Ministers who successively
took over the post were more concerned with short-term political :,urvival.
Sustainability
10.   The long-term sustainability of the efforts undertaken under this project will depend on
the amount of funds the Govermnent will continue to make available to MARD and MECN to
enable their staff to prepare projects, formulate good policies and monitor program and project
activities in the field. Although the project helped to strengthen human resources capacity,
effecLive uti'ization of this capacity will, to a large extent, depend on the Government's capacity
to mobilize financial resources through the national budget. Given the current political and
economic environment, it is highly unlikely that the Government can mobilize these funds. It is
therefore unlikely that project results will be long-lasting. It will not be possible to make the
most of the benefits gained from the project until the advent of a strong and credible government
committed to the cause of development.
Findings and Lessons Learned
11.   The main lessons learned from  the Second Technical Assistance Project can be
summarized as follows:
(a)   Institution building. In order to ensure that improvements and changes made are
lasting, they must be done through the existing organization. This might take
longer, but is also a lasting solution.
(b)   Program and project management. Programs aad projects can be well
managed by the Ministries provided sufficient funds are available.
(c)    Continuing staff training and development. There is a need to ensure the
continuing training of staff at all levels at reasonable costs. When available, local
training institutes should be used to train and develop staff and managers, since
they are much more cost-effective than training abroad (project data show average
costs of US$300 for local training versus US$10,500 for training abroad). And
(d)   Risks. Political and financial risks have to be adequately addressed at the design
stage.

Sub-sector:       Technical Assistance
2.    Background
2.1   Agriculture and forestry rank highly among Zaire's natural resources and play an
important role in its economy. In 1985, agriculture alone accounted for more than 30 percent of
GDP and provided direct and indirect employment to over 80 percent of the economically active
population. The political upheavals of the 1960s, the nationalization policy in the mid-1970s,
and neglect of rural infrastructure and poor investment and programming decisions resulted in a
drastic decline of farm productivity. The Government therefore requested IDA for help in
developing a strategy for the agricultural sector and in strengthening existing institutions.
2.2   First Agricultural Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1244-ZR).  In 1982, IDA
provided financial support to the Government of Zaire to help it (i) strengthen the institutional
framework of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD); (ii) strengthen
MARD's capacity to effectively implement agricultural projects; and (iii) assist the Government
in its efforts to address key policy issues which affected the performance of the agricultural
sector. The project was initially successful. The funds from the credit enabled MARD to
intensify project supervision and monitoring activities in the field. The presence of technical
advisors contributed to improving the quality of analytical work of MARD's Cabinet and Studies
and Planning Directorate. The training courses provided staff with an improved capacity for
project preparation and economic analysis. The strengthening of the project preparation and



2                                               Part 1: Project Reviewfrom Bank's Perspective
monitoring and evaluation services of MARD and improved budget control procedures were
among other major project achievements. The most visible short-term impact of the project was
that it provided a regular and dependable source of financing for the normal recurrent activities
of several Directorates of MARD. It showed that, if sufficient resources are made available.
MARD can function effectively and can upgrade the quality of its activities by regular and
effective training programs for its personnel. The project could, however, have been more
successful had there been a less frequent turnover of Ministers during the project's life.
2.3   Towards the end of the First Agricultural Technical Assistance Project (PAT I), it became
apparent that a follow-on project was needed to consolidate earlier gains and introduce similar
strengthening measures in the newly created Ministry of the Environment and Nature
Conservation (MECN). Moreover, IDA sought to convince Government to undo the split of
MARD into the Ministry of Agriculture (MinAgri) and the Ministry of Rural Development
(MRD), because of concern that the split would result in less decisive policy formulation and
duplication of work, at a time when Government was already unable to adequately fund its
operating costs.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   The project aimed to strengthen the policy formulation and implementation capacity of
MinAgri, MRD and the MECN through technical assistance, training and logistical support. The
project was to be implemented over a seven year period and had the following components:
(a)   Support for economic analysis and policy formulation, complementing other
donor contributions, by promoting available in-house capacity and strengthening
expert supervision of studies and project preparation.
(b)   Support for programming and execution of public expenditure by strengthening
the information systems and organizational structures established under PAT I
and expanding the scope of the project to include the management of recurrent as
well as investment budget expenditures.
(c)   Support for Personnel Management to reinforce the government-wide civil service
reform underway, through (a) an assessment of the General Services Directorate
(DSG) of MinAgri to introduce procedures for staff performance evaluation; and
(b) a staffing and functional review of MinAgri and the design of a human
resources development plan. The staffing and functional review would lead to
recommendations on the advisability of maintaining the separate ministries of
Agriculture and Rural Development.

(d)   Training. IDA would finance training as financier of last resort, based on a
comprehensive annual training plan. Training would be mainly carried out by
local institutes, targeting a critical mass of personnel.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1   The project s overall design was appropriate and to a large extent based on lessons
learned from implementing PATI. To coordinate project actixities in the three ministries, a
Coordination Committee (CC) was set up, chaired by the Secretary General of MinAgri and
including the Secretaries General of MRD and MECN. The role of this committee was to
examine and approve the annual work programs and budgets for the project. These were to serve
as the basis for credit disbursements and government budget allocations. The committee was
assisted in its work by a secretaiat composed of an Executive Secretary (ES), three managers
and two technical consultants. The ES was responsible for the annual programming, budgeting
and follow up of day-to-day implementation of the project by the technical directorates within
the three mi-iistries. The executive secretariat was designed to be phased out by the end of the
projert, replacing the large implementation unit created under PATI, which had been
insufficien+ly integrated into MARD and had thereby caused implementation problems.
4.2. The President's Report identified only two major risks: (i) high turnover of the Ministers
and their cabinets; and (ii) poor donor coordination. Insufficient counterpart funding was not
identified as a risk, even though it was apparent at the time of project preparation that many IDA
and donor funded projects were experiencing implementation difficulties as a result of this
problem. Moreover, the impact of ministerial turnover on the project was underestimated
because the project activities related to the merger of MinAgri and MRD were as a result
compromised for lack of political decision making.
5.    Project Implementation
A.   Background
Macro-Economic Environment
5.1   Project implementation took place against the background of a macro-economic
environment which was already unsteady during the mid-1980s, when the project was appraised,
and which deteriorated significantly during the project life. Not only did the Government
abandon its adjustment program in the late 1980s, but the political upheaval which followed the
decision to make way for democratic elections in 1990 introduced an atmosphere of uncertainty
and insecurity, which finally erupted in riots in late 1991 and again in early 1993. Inflation,
fueled by the expansion of money supply as a result of unrestricted public spending, increased
rapidly towards the end of the project, running at 90 percent in 1986 and 1987, 83 percent in



4                                              Part I: Project Review from Bank's Perspective
1988, 104 percent in 1989, 82 percent in 1990, and 2,150 percent in 1991. In the absence of
Government action to stabilize the economy, the monetary system collapsed in late 1991 and the
liquidity in the commercial banking system dried up. What little Government funds were
allocated to projects could only be mobilized with great difficulty, and by the time they were
mobilized, their value had been seriously eroded by inflation. Moreover, strikes and political
uncertainty paralyzed the work of Government agencies.
Credit Effectiveness
5.2   The credit was declared effective on May 5, 1989, only about four months after its
signature and two months after the originally planned date. The slight delay was caused by
administrative procedures (obtaining the legal opinion and ratification of the Development Credit
Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
5.3   Actual project costs amounted to US$9.9 million or 60 percent of the estimates at
appraisal of US$16.6 million. The Government of Belgium discontinued its support to the
project in 1990, following the breakdown in bilateral relations between the countries; The
Govemment of Zaire contributed US$0.5 million to the project compared to US$2.5 million
estimated (20 percent); and IDA contributed US$9.4 million compared to US$11.6 million
estimated (81 percent). The gap between the actual costs incurred and appraisal estimates is
explained by the lack of counterpart funding and IDA's suspension of the Credit on July 15,
1993, because of the country falling into arrears on its repayments.
Procurement
5.4   Procurement was carried out in accordance with IDA procedures albeit with serious
delays at the start of the project because of unfamiliarity with IDA guidelines. IDA therefore
organized a procurement workshop in 1990 to strengthen local capacity. There was a delay in
assembling the technical assistance team, partly because of the unavailability of some consultants
proposed by the selected consulting company and partly because of the high costs (about
US$18,000 per man-month), which IDA had considered too high. The consultant costs were
brought down to about US$14,000 per man-month following a meeting between Government,
the consulting firm and IDA.
Disbursements
5.5    In general, disbursements proceeded smoothly. This was in part the result of the
seminar on disbursement procedures organized by IDA in 1990. On occasion, however, and
because of the delay in the Government's budget allocation, the special account was used to
finance the Govemment contribution. The Govemment reimbursed IDA for the amount used, at
the request of the supervision missions. In 1992, the Special Account was reduced from

US$400,000 to US$200,000 in light of the country situation. The final disbursement was made
on January 4, 1994 and the undisbursed balance of SDR 2,088,520.66 (US$2,944,815) was
canceled on January 6, 1994. The credit could not be closed until April 19, 1994, because of
delavs by Government in documenting the Special Account.
B.    Project Components
5.6       Economic analysis and policy formulation. The support provided by the project
made it possible to start implementing the agricultural and ruralI development master plan in
1991. Its adoption by MARD' had implicitly required it to support the sector's development
plans based on services such as the national extension service, agricultural research, the national
farm  access road service and the national seed service (for the quality control of seeds).
However, the activities and decisions of several Ministers were not significantly influenced by
the new strategy adopted, since Minister Onyembe, who had bee-i the driving force behind this
initiative, left after fourteen months in office. The master plan, which provided the general
framework for future agricultural development, covered many of the subjects dealt with in the
1988 Zaire Agriculture Sector Memorandum. Preparation of regional action plans was delayed
because of political instability and the riots of 1991 and 1993. Only one action plan for the Bas-
Zaire region was prepared. In terms of project identification, the project specifically helped with
the preparation of the following projects: (i) the pilot extension project (Credit 2096-ZR, which
closed on December 31, 1993); (ii) the national extension project submitted to IDA for
consideration in 1993; (iii) the perennial crops project; (iv) the animal health project; and (v) the
Forestry and Environment Project (P844-0-ZR). 2
5.7       In the area of forestry, the contribution of the project focused on the preparation of the
forestry and environment project, whose appraisal, initially scheduled for October 1991 did not
take place because of the events of September 1991. A long-term technical consultant who
specialized in the macro-economics of forestry was assigned to the Coordination Unit for the
Forestry Sector (CCSF), but his contract was canceled by Government because of an
unsatisfactory performance evaluation by his counterpart. The post of technical consultant in
forestry micro-economics was never filled because the candidate who had been retained by the
consulting firm was no longer available. A Zairian candidate was then identified but the riots of
1991 and 1993 and the indefinite postponement of the forestry and environment project
prevented his coming on board.
5.8       Public expenditure programming and execution. The support provided by the
project for public expenditure programming and execution was aimed primarily, at appraisal, at
strengthening the General Services Directorate (DSG) for agriculture (where operating
expenditures were concerned) and the Directorate for General Project Administration (DAGP)
I   MinAgri and MRD were merged in 1990. The structures of the two Ministries remained, however, intact.
2   Preparation of the Forestry and Environment Project has been stopped, because of the country situation. Pilot activities are
still supported by the Japanese Grant facility, administered by the World Bank.



6                                                Part I. Project Reviewfrom Bank's Perspective
for agriculture (where capital expenditures were concerned). During project implementation, this
support was extended to two other administrative areas', i.e. rural development (DSG and the
Directorate for Planning, Studies and Evaluation, DEEP) and the environment and nature
conservation (DSG and CCSF). A long-tern technical consultant specializing in project
monitoring and evaluation was assigned to DAGP and made a major positive contribution in
setting up a simple project monitoring and evaluation system.  A  technical consultant
specializing in finance was assigned to the executive secretariat of the project and provided good
support to the financial and adminstrative staff of the three General Secretariats of MinAgri,
MRD and MECN.
5.9      The staff were trained in project monitoring and evaluation techniques and the project
bore the costs of field trips (air fares and per diems) to supervise programs and projects.
Between 1989 and 1993 the project financed about 6,650 man-days of field trips to projects (IDA
projects and those financed by other donors). These trips helped to improve the physical and
financial performance of the projects. In 1991 the project helped to establish an efficient project
monitoring and evaluation system with the preparation of indicators specific to each type of
project and improvements in the data storage system.
5.10     Rationalization of programs and projects. In order to help establish the basic
framework of the agricultural master plan, which consisted in concentrating efforts on national
services, instead of isolated independent projects, the project focused its support on rationalizing
the number of projects in 1992. The result of this work led to a significant reduction in the
number of programs and projects. Sixty-eight MARD programs and projects were regrouped
into twelve national programs (the national extension service being the most important), and
forty-four independent MECN projects were regrouped into eight national programs. This work
should have led to a reduction in budget items in the PIP and enabled the Government to improve
the allocation of funds.  The proposals were never implemented, however, despite their
submission to the Ministry of Plan in 1992.
5.11     Personnel Management. It was intended that the project would help the DSGs of
MARD (former DSG of MinAgri and DSG of MRD) establish a staff development plan (staff
salary, hiring and promotion policies). This support was extended to the DSG of MECN. As
part of this work, a census was taken of all MARD and MECN staff at the central and regional
levels in 1991.  Approximately 11,500 staff were identified in the case of MARD and
approximately 2,500 in the case of MECN and some 2,000 fictitious staff were counted. The job
description and functional review work, which had started in 1992, was interrupted because of
the complete paralysis of MARD's and MECN's administrative machinery (lengthy strikes and
chronic absenteeism). A long-term technical consultant was assigned to the executive secretariat
of the project to help carry out this component. Unfortunately this consultant was only in his
post for two years; he left Zaire in 1991 when the pillaging took place and never returned to his
post, partly for health-related reasons.

5.12     Reorganization of MinAgri and MRD. Despite the finalization of the terms of
reference, the study on the reorganization of MARD planned at the time of project appraisal was
not carried out. This is mostly attributable to the fact that a study of this type required high-level
political endorsement, given its sensitivity. The rapid turnover of Ministers (a new Minister on
average about every six months), most of whom were primarily concerned with their short-term
survival, made it impossible to carry out this study. MinAgri and MRD were merged in 1990 in
name only, the separate structures were maintained.
5.13     Tratining. A long-term training program consistent vith the staff development plan
and MARD's new organization was to have been established. The project was intended, in the
short term, to provide on-the-job training for staff at all levels, to be conducted primarily by local
institutes. The human resources expert was to help implement the general training plan. It
unfortunately proved impossible to establish such a plan because of the political instability and
the paralysis of the administrative machinery.
5.14     In all, 37 candidates were sent abroad for short-term training courses. These courses
varied in length from one to three months and the average cost (including travel) was about
US$10,500.  Training focused on policy formulation and management, human resources
management, project review and appraisal, agriculture and rural development, project
identification and planning, agro-forestry, forestry statistics, reforestation, and management.
Certain irregularities were observed in the training abroad. One candidate failed to turn up at the
training sessions in Washington after receiving the allowance (for travel expenses and per
diems). Following this irregularity, the IDA supervision mission suspended (for about one year)
the financing of training abroad. Emphasis was subsequently placed on training at local
institutes, which produced substantial results.  Evaluation of the training courses was
systematically done and the proposal to use the trainees as local trainers was partially
implemented.
5.15     About 1,000 individuals received training in Zaire in various subjects both on the job
and at local training institutes. Not only was this training much less expensive compared to
training abroad (US$300 for local training versus US$10,500 for external training), but it also
benefited a larger number of staff. It focused primarily on project preparation and analysis,
human resources management, automation of financial management of projects, rural
information, cooperatives, project monitoring and evaluation, agricultural statistics, accounting
and auditing, secretarial skills, and procurement and disbursement procedures. About 175 staff
from the Directorates of MARD and MECN and the project monitoring and evaluation units
attended seven seminars on project monitoring and evaluation in order to improve project
monitoring in the field. DSG's financial divisions were strengthened by training in accounting
and auditing.
5.16     Support for the collection of agricultural statistics.  The need to improve
agricultural statistics in Zaire has been long recognized. Opinions differed, however, particularly
among representatives of the donor community, as to the best way to tackle the problem. The



8                                                Part 1: Project Reviewfrom Bank's Perspective
project provided direct and indirect support to a UNDP/FAO financed project whose aim was to
establish a permanent system for collecting agricultural statistics. Between 1989 and 1993 the
statistical service published four surveys (evaluation of adoption rates and impact of agricultural
extension, economics of rural households, traditional sector farming and modem sector
agricultural operations).
5.17     Logistical support. Twenty-three cars were purchased and assigned to key MARD
and MECN Directorates. Twelve all-terrain vehicles were purchased to enable DAGP, DEEP
and CCSF to make field visits to projects in the Bandundu and Bas-Zaire regions. Three all-
terrain vehicles were assigned to the Shaba, Northern and Southern Kivu regions for pilot agro-
forestry and reforestation activities as part of the preparation of the Forestry and Environment
Project (P844-0-ZR).  Twelve minibuses were purchased for the transportation of key
administrative staff. In order to keep maintenance costs down to a minimum (keeping the
experience of the first project, Credit 1244-ZR, in mind), a buy-back (lease/option to buy)
arrangement was instituted to enable users to become the owners of their vehicles at the end of
the project; these users received a monthly allowance from the project for the use of the vehicles
for official purposes.
6.    Project Results
6.1   The proceeds from the Credit enabled MARD and MECN to step up their supervision
activities and their monitoring of the programs and projects in the field. The presence of experts
in project monitoring and evaluation helped to improve the quality of project supervision in the
field and that of the financial management of MARD and MECN funds. Unfortunately, the
paralysis of local banking institutions (shortage of funds) and the political instability resulted in a
cutback of field visits to programs and projects. Training improved the capacity of MARD and
MECN staff in the area of analysis and general policy formulation and project preparation, as
evidenced by the preparation the Agricultural Master Plan, and the National Extension Project
and Forestry and Environment Project. In the area of personnel management, the capacities of
MARD and MECN improved. Thanks to the project, the DSGs had increased control over their
staff and a computerized personnel data management system. The improvement in MARD's and
MECN's financial management was another important project result.
6.2   In the short term the project's most visible impact was in providing a regular and reliable
source of financing for the activities involved in the normal operation of key MARD and MECN
directorates. The project, like its predecessor, showed that, with adequate resources, MARD and
MECN could operate adequately and improve the quality of their work by providing their staff
with regular training programs to ensure the continuing upgrading of skills and knowledge that is
essential in order to improve the human resource capabilities of their Ministries.

7.    Project Sustainability
7.1   The sustainability of project results will depend on sufficient funding of MARD and
MECN. Although the project helped to build human resource capabilities, utilization of these
resources will, to a large extent, depend on the ability of Government to mobilize financial
resources through the national budget. However, given the current political and economic
climate, it is unlikely that it can do so. Thus, in the present political and economic climate
project results will be short-lived.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1   Ri aht from the start of the project, the Bank provided regular supervision of the project
from the resident mission and headquarters. It had, on several occasions, to explain the
objectives of the project to new Ministers who were often not prepared to support the activities
on a long-term basis be-ause of the political implications of some of its components (especially
the proposed restructuring of MARD) and were more interested in the project providing them
with an opportunity to finance the normal operation of their ministerial cabinets, as happened in
the case of F AT 1.
9.    Borrower's Performance
9.1   The project objectives were understood from the outset by the administrative staff of
MinAgri, MRD and MECN; this was not so in the case of some Ministers, who wanted the
project to be attached to their cabinets, as was done in the case of PAT1. Project staff spent a lot
of time explaining the project objectives and this had to be done every time there was a change in
Ministers.
9.2   The Secretaries General fully supported the project but their efforts were often inhibited
by the Ministers' cabinets, given that every major decision had to have the Ministers' backing.
The insufficiency of counterpart funds signified a lack of interest on the part of Government.
Although the Government professed to recognize the need to reorganize MARD, after the merger
of MinAgri and MRD in 1990, it was not prepared to do so because of political reasons.
10.   Project Relationship
10.1 Relations between IDA and the Government were good throughout project
implementation. The project supervision missions were generally jointly organized. Relations
between the project and MARD and MECN were also good during project implementation.

11.   Consulting Services
11.1  Overall, performance of the consultants was very good. The main exception was the
consultant for forestry macro-economics, whose contract was canceled by the Government
following an unsatisfactory performance evaluation by CCSF staff. In the particular case of this
project, it was found that cost-wise it was most advantageous to contract directly with individual
consultants rather than firms, with no difference in the quality of services provided.
12.   Documentation
12.1. Annual work programs, project progress reports and audit reports were available, with the
exception of the 1993 audit report. The latter had not been carried out as a result of the
suspension of disbursements by IDA on July 15, 1993 and the lack of Government funds.
