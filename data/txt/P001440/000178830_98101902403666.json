 and efficiency of primary education and to expand access to\n            primary schools through support for: (a) institutional\n            development of the Ministry of Education; (b) a primary\n            school development program to include establishment of a\n            national textbook program, upgrading of 2,250 primary school\n            teachers, strengthening of the educational inspectorate, and\n            construction, equipping, and furnishing of 24 new primary\n            schools, and furnishing of 30 additional primary schools.\n            The project would also: (a) strengthen the Agricultural and\n            Industrial Training Bureau and the Vocational Training\n            Center; and (b) establish a new commerial training center to\n            consolidate the activities of three existing training\n            programs. The improvements in primary education and skill\n            training are expected to lead to more efficient allocation\n            of resources, increases in skilled manpower, higher worker\n            productivity, and greater employment opportunities for graduates."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
