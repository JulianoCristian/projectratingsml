I. 
Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
Uruguay’s strong recovery from the 2002 owes much to the prompt and purposeful response of the 
authorities. 
Negotiations with creditors led to the successful conclusion of a sovereign debt exchange in 
May 2003, raising the average maturity of bonds by over 5 years without increasing interest rates and 
without a principal haircut. Policy achievements include a substantial fiscal adjustment that resulted in a 
primary surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP on average over 2003-05 (a major departure from primary deficits 
averaging 1.6 percent of GDP through 1999-2001). The government adopted a flexible exchange rate 
regime in mid-2002. Prudent monetary management enabled the inflationary impact of the 2002 
devaluation to be contained. Adoption of specific inflation targets by the central bank, pursued through 
management of broad monetary aggregates, has kept in check both inflation and inflation expectations. 
Subsequently, inflation has been brought down to single figures and has remained within the target range 
of the central bank. 
The recovery phase is now over and the challenge now is to achieve sustained growth.
 Uruguay has 
made substantial progress in achieving macroeconomic stability since the crisis. The challenge now is to 
transition from recovery to sustained growth by improving the business climate and setting the conditions 
for private sector-led growth driven by innovation.

Medium-term growth prospects depend on increasing the quality and quantity of investment. 
Investment has recovered since the crisis; but remains far below that of countries of a similar income 
Page  2

level. .
Essential to the country’s growth strategy are measures to improve the business climate. Uruguay 
ranks 64th in the world for the ease of doing business (Doing Business Survey 2007, World Bank 2006). 
Its rating is held back by the high administrative burden of starting a business and registering property, 
deficiencies in investor protection and contract enforcement, a burdensome tax regime, and difficulties in 
registering and enforcing contracts. The first Programmatic Reform Implementation Development Policy 
Loan (PRIDPL I) will support key reforms aimed at improving the tax regime and business climate. A 
further priority area identified by the government in this area is capital markets reform. Market 
capitalization and turnover of private securities by Uruguayan capital markets have remained low both in 
absolute and relative terms. The government intends to tackle wider capital markets development issues, 
such as the regulatory environment, and is working to build consensus on a comprehensive strategy. 
Further government reform efforts would be supported by the planned PRIDPL II in 2008. 
Critical to the growth agenda reform is successful implementation of the tax reform passed by 
parliament in December 2006. 
A
comprehensive reform package, the tax reform introduces in a 
personal income tax, reduces VAT and corporate tax rates, streamlines and eliminates minor taxes, and 
broadens the VAT base. The tax reform bill is intended to reduce inefficiencies caused by the current 
structure of the tax system and increase equity. As such, the reform will underpin the medium-term 
buoyancy of fiscal revenues. Rapid progress in tax administration will be a necessary condition to 
successfully implementing the tax reform and meeting revenue targets. The proposed PRIDPL I would 
assist the government with the implementation. 
The 2002 crisis demonstrated the limits of the generally good social protection system in Uruguay.
 
Contributory schemes have in the past represented an adequate response to the needs of a society with a 
largely formal labor market. However, the 2002 crisis showed that the social security system has some 
limitations. Unemployment rose sharply from below 10 percent in the late 1990s to almost 17 percent in 
2002, but the formal unemployment insurance benefits reached barely 6 percent of the unemployed. There 
was also a decline in compliance with contributions due to the increase in unemployment and informality, 
and the number of contributing workers to the main pension system fell by almost 12 percent between 
1998 and 2002. In addition, a sustained increase in poverty prompted the introduction of non-contributory 
family allowances (in 2000 and 2004) and a new social emergency program, PANES in 2005. The 
government now faces a series of challenges. First, it is important to ensure the sustainability of the social 
insurance contributory scheme, and at the same time include in the social protection system the share of 
the population with no access to the formal labor market. Second, the PANES program is scheduled to be 
phased out by late 2007, at which point a new, permanent social assistance scheme is to be adopted. The 
objective of the PRIDPL series is to support the government in these endeavors. In particular, in the 
PRIDPL I, there would be a focus on efforts to increase coverage the family allowances program and the 
social security system. 
II. Proposed 
objective(s) 
 
The key objective of the loan and an important value-added of the Bank is to provide the 
government with a well-specified, monitorable framework for the implementation of the reforms. 
The overriding aim is to support the implementation of the government’s overall reform program that 
aims at obtaining sustained growth at higher than historical rates, while combating poverty and exclusion 
and ensuring equitable access to opportunities. In line with the government’s priorities set by the 
government, the PRIDPL I would support the implementation of reforms in three key areas: (i) tax 
reform; (ii) the business climate and capital markets; and (iii) the social protection system, where the loan 
will build on the achievements of the Social Program Development Policy Loan (SPDPL). The PRIDPL I 
is the first in a series of two operations to support implementation of priority economic and social sector 
reforms as determined by the government. The loan is the second DPL under the FY05-FY10 Country 
Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No. 31804-UY). The amount of the loan is to be disbursed in a single 
Page  3

tranche upon effectiveness. The Institutions Building Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) is being prepared 
in parallel to the proposed PRIDPL I, and is intended to assist the government with the reform 
implementation. 
III. Preliminary 
Description 
 
The proposed PRIDPL series seeks to support the government in implementing selected reform 
priorities. 
The three policy components that the PRIDPL I would support were identified in discussions 
with the government as the key areas in which the Bank could assist the government in its overall 
development program. The first component of the PRIDPL I seeks to support the government in 
implementation of the tax reform recently passed by parliament. The second component of the PRIDPL I 
would support policies aimed at increasing the quality and quantity of investment. Government plans to 
improve the business climate include improvement of capital and financial market promotion and 
regulation; reform of the current bankruptcy law; and improvement of information transparency in the 
corporate and financial sector. In the third component of the proposed PRIDPL I, the operation would 
support policies aimed at increasing coverage of social assistance to those in need and to expand coverage 
and collection of the social security system to provide coverage to all individuals. 
IV. 
Safeguard Policies that might apply 
 
This is a Development Policy Loan (DPL) and is therefore not subject to OP 4.01,
 the Bank’s policy 
on environmental and social safeguards. 
The specific policies supported by the proposed PRIDPL I 
operation are not expected to entail significant impacts on the environment, forests or other natural 
resources. However, to the extent that measures supported by the PRIDPL I program are successful, over 
time, in attracting new investment (including in infrastructure), there will be a need to continue 
strengthening Uruguay’s national institutional capacity to identify and address environmental policy and 
regulatory issues. A poverty and social impact assessment (PSIA) on the distributive impact of the tax 
reform will be carried out to examine whether the tax reform will have a significant impact on equity 
and/or poverty.
