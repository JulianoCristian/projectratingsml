first of two operations\n            to support implementation of priority economic and social\n            sector reforms as determined by the government. The loan is\n            the second DPL under the FY05-FY10 Country Assistance\n            Strategy (Report No. 31804-UY). The first DPL was the Social\n            Program Development Policy Loan (SPDPL) approved in June\n            2005 with the CAS. The amount of the Loan is to be disbursed\n            in a single tranche upon effectiveness. In line with\n            priorities set by the government, the PRIDPL I would support\n            the implementation o f reforms in three key areas: (i) tax\n            reform; (ii) the business climate and capital markets; and\n            (iii) the social protection system where the loan builds on\n            the achievements o f the SPDPL."}, "docdt": "2007-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
