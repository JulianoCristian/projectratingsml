The Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory, while, the Borrower's performance was\n            highly satisfactory given its consistent, effective efforts\n            in the fulfillment, ownership, and operation of the project.\n            Regardless of success, the nature of the rapidly developing\n            economy, produced the competition faced by traditional\n            wholesale markets vs. the development of contemporary\n            private marketing infrastructure, namely supermarkets, and\n            discount wholesale sellers, a factor not foreseen at project\n            preparation, and which has narrowed the window of\n            opportunity for traditional wholesale market structures.\n            This has added an urgent need to find additional sources of\n            revenue for the market, considering that revenues of\n            traditional wholesale markets (particularly limited to trade\n            in perishable agriculture products), are insufficient to\n            support investments. Thus, traditional wholesale markets are\n            justified as providers of public services, whose investment\n            is a sunk cost incurred by society; yet, in light of modern\n            trading venues, this justification may not hold long.\n            Therefore, the economic, and financial justification would\n            be to broaden the market concept of traditional wholesale\n            trade in perishables, to a multi service establishment in\n            wholesale food trade. The project exemplifies this proactive\n            approach of management, and provides grounds for cautious\n            optimism for the future."}, "docdt": "2001-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
