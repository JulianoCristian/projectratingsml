REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESID)ENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO RED NACIONAL DE LOS FERROCARRILES ESPANOLES (RENFE)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF SPAIN
FOR A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
ta RENFE (Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Espanoles) in an amount in various
currencies equivalent to US$90 million to be guaranteed by the Government of
Spain. The proposed loan would be for a 20-year term including 4 years of
grace, with interest at 7-1/4%.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's eighth operation in Spain and
the third one to the Spanish railways. The project constitutes the last stage
of the Bank's participation in RENFE's Ten-Year Modernization Program (1964 to
1973). W4hen the first loan was made in 1964, the amount of external borrowing
required by the Plan had been estimated at about $200 million and the Bank had
indicated its willingness to participate further in the financing of the Plan.
The Bank's two previous loans, amounting in total to $115 million, are more
fully described in Part III below.
3.        Since the Bank's economic survey mission in 1961, relations between
Spain and the Bank have been consistently good and Spain has become an active
borrower, keenly interested in Bank expertise and advice in support of the
structural and policy reforms on which the Bank's lending is based. Since
1963 the Bank has made 7 loans to Spain totalling US$236.5 million, making
that country one of the most important European borrowers and the thirteenth
largest overall. The major part, US$187.2 million, has been for transporta-
tion. In addition to two loans to the Spanish Railways in 1964 (Loan 387-SP)
and 1967 (Loan 507-SP) amounting to US$115 million, the Bank made a US$32
million loan for highway development (Loan 360-SP) in 1963 and a US$40 mil-
lion loan (Loan 429-SP) in 1965, to help finance part of the 1964-67 ports
development program and to support reforms in port administration and finances.
In 1970, the Bank provided a US$12 million loan (Loan 699-SP) to help finance
an innovative project covering a limited number of experimental educational
institutions to test and demonstrate the principles of a major reform of the
educational system which is currently under way. Finally, the Bank has made
two loans for agriculture totalling US$37.7 million for a livestock develop-
ment project in 1969 (Loan 633-SP) and an agricultural research project in
1971 still to be signed. The purpose of the former is to initiate major
changes in livestock production techniques and to give support to significant
changes in import and pricing policies. The latter, approved by the Executive
Directors on May 18, 1971, is a new departure in the Bank's operations. It
aims at upgrading agricultural research, as a prerequisite to the use of
modern technology in agricultural production, principally through the re-



-2-
structuring of the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA) and the
reorganization of research towards a functional orientation. A summary
statement of Bank loans to Spain is at Annex I.
4.        Disbursements on several loans have proceeded at a slower pace
than expected. Construction under the Ports Project (Loan 429-SP) was af-
fected by time-consuming procedures for placing contracts and changes pri-
marily in the character and volume of traffic and technical aspects which
created difficulties in design. These problems have now been solved and the
final contracts are under execution. The closing date for this loan had to
be postponed from March 31, 1971 to March 31, 1972. In the case of the Sec-
ond Railway Project (Loan 507-SP) progress in physical works and improvements
in management have been satisfactory. However, utilization of the proceeds
of the loan will not be completed by the closing date, July 31, 1971, and a
requested postponement by one year is under consideration. As of April 30,
1971, US$14.2 million remained undisbursed, but all contracts mostly for
freight cars and locomotives have been placed for delivery during the next
few months. No disbursements have yet been made in respect of the loans for
Livestock Development (Loan 633-SP) and Education (Loan 699-SP).    In the case
of the former, the project unit (Agency for Livestock Development) was estab-
lished with delays because of administrative difficulties and this affected
the processing of sub-loans; the situation has now improved and disbursements
should start soon, since sub-loans eligible for reimbursement from the pro-
ceeds of the Bank loan have already been made. Difficulties in establishing
the project unit have also affected the education loan. Disbursements are
expected to start in the third quarter of 1971.
5.        Spain became a member of IFC on March 24, 1960.    Since then, IFC
has made two investments amounting to US$4 million. The first was achieved
in three different transactions in 1962, 1965 and 1967 totalling US$3.4 mil-
lion in Fabrica Espanola Magnetos, S.A. (FEMSA), an automotive electrical
equipment manufacturer, of which US$2.5 million was a loan and the remainder
equity; as a result of sales of equity and repayments, IFC held US$320,000
of the loan and US$575,000 in equity as of May 31, 1971. The other invest-
ment is a US$0.6 million equity participation in Banco de Desarrollo Economico
Espanol S.A. (BANDESCO), a privately owned development finance company. A
proposal for an investment in a liner-board project by INPACSA (Industrias
del Papel y de la Celulosa) is to be considered by the Executive Directors
in the near future.
6.        The third railway project was appraised in November-December, 1970.
Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington from May 17 to 28,
1971. The borrower's delegation was headed by Sr. Francisco Lozano, RENFE's
President, and included also representatives of the Ministry of Finance and
Public Works.
7.        In the immediate future, the Bank has under consideration projects
for education, port development and agriculture (irrigation-drainage). The
Bank is also planning an industry mission in the Fall of 1971 to investigate
the areas of possible Bank assistance in this sector, which is of highest
priority at Spain's present stage of development.

PART II -- THE ECONOMY
8.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Spain" in three volumes (EMA-34a), dated May 20, 1971, was distributed to
the Executive Directors on June 9, 1971. A Country Data sheet is at Annex
1II.
9.        As set forth in the report, the 1959-60 Stabilization Program and
economic policies in the 1960's brought about a gradual relaxation of govern-
ment controls over Spain's internal and external economic relations. The ec-
onomy was opened to foreign goods, technology and capital and the private
sector was encouraged to increase output and investment. Sustained by the
inflow of foreign technology and capital and by rising foreign exchange earn-
ings from tourism and from remittances of Spanish workers employed abroad,
total output grew by 7.5 percent per year in real terms during 1961-70. The
low net population growth (less than 1 percent p.a.) allowed CDP per head,
expressed in current dollars, to rise from US$374 in 1960 to almost US$850
in 1970.
10.       Industry became the main force in the development process, expanding
on average 10 percent annuallv in real terms in 1960-69. By 1969 manufactur-
ing alone provided about 27 percent of GDP, and combined exports of industrial
equipment and manufactured consumer goods exceeded agricultural exports for
the first time. While services grew in line with GDP during the 1960's, agri-
culture increased by only 2.8 percent, with large annual fluctuations.
Structural Reforms
11.       The need for continued structural reforms in agriculture and es-
peciallv industry has become even more urgent in the light of a closer rela-
tionship with the EEC, reflected in the preferential trade agreement which
went into effect in October 1970. In agriculture, price policies and produc-
tion patterns have to adapt to changing consumption habits which have resulted
from the higher standards of living. The period of easy and rapid growth,
during which investors could make immediate use of the opportunities of the
liberalized Spanish market by establishing new industries or expanding older
ones, is coming to an end. The generally weak financial structure of enter-
prises, the existence of too many too small production units and their con-
centration on domestic markets have all to be overcome. Higher exports of
manufactures are necessary to assure a continued growth of current imports,
because earnings from tourism and workers' remittances are not expected to
continue to increase at the high rate of the 1960's.
12.       While relatively successful in mobilizing resources, Spain conti-
nues to have a major problem in allocating and managing them. Institutional
improvements at the sector level as well as fiscal and financial policies
based on an overall plan of the sources and uses of public funds are essen-
tial.



-4-
External Financing
13.       The net inflow of medium- and long-term capital averaged US$465
million per year during 1965-70, of which over 90 percent was directed to
the private sector. The private sector should continue to be able to mobil-
ize a substantial capital inflow, subject to the political and economic
climate in Spain over the coming years, as well as on the response of domes-
tic and foreign enterprises to the preferential trade agreement between
Spain and the EEC.
14.       Planned increases in expenditures for education, research and other
social infrastructure as well as the support of structural reforms in key
economic sectors will involve a much greater need for long-term borrowing by
the public sector which has, in the past, been irregular and relatively small.
The attitude of the Spanish Government towards borrowing abroad has been
changing, however, in the recent past; since January 1971, the Spanish Gov-
ernment and its agencies have raised US$270 million through international
consortia of commercial banks. It may thus be possible for Spain to meet a
substantial part of the increased requirements by borrowing from the inter-
national capital markets. However, Spain's external net capital require-
ments may increase from about US$600 million in 1972 to about US$1,000 mil-
lion in 1976. Even assuming, that the private sector will be able to obtain
increasing amounts from abroad and that public borrowing in external capital
markets will be more active than until now, there is likely to remain a gap
in long-term funds which will need to be covered by external official sources
such as the Bank.   Bank assistance would be particularly appropriate in cases
where the Spanish Government wishes to obtain technical advice and financial
assistance to carry out structural and policy reforms.
15.       Spain is creditworthy for substantial amounts of additional lend-
ing on conventional terms. The debt servicing record is good and debt ser-
vice is moderate. Total external public debt oustanding at the end of 1969
was US$1,454 million, of which US$400 million was not yet drawn down. In
1970, an additional US$140 million of external public debt was incurred
against repayments of US$92 million. Service on debt outstanding as of the
end of 1969, was equal to about 5.6 percent of total foreign exchange receipts
in 1970. The debt service ratio as projected remains moderate, approximately
5 percent in 1976.
PART III -- THE BANK AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
16.       The Bank's approach in lending to Spain has been to assist in over-
coming constraints to development by supporting reforms in selected sectors,
starting with transportation. Considerable improvements have taken place
since the early 1960's, but modernization, reorganization and extension of
tlhe existing transport network remain of high priority. Under the Second
(1968-71) Development Plan, the Government allocated 25 percent of total



-5 -
public investment, equivalent to $1.6 billion, to transportation. However,
substantial shortcomings remain in the formulation of a coherent transport
policy, as well as in the management and operation of the various transport
modes. Together with contributing to the modernization effort, Bank opera-
tions in the transport sector have been directed at promoting and supporting
the necessary reforms in these fields. Most of the reforms were initiated
through the loans to RENFE, but important steps were also taken in connection
with lending for highways and ports.
Transport Coordination
17.       In Spain as in many countries, the planning of transport investment
is performed by the agencies in charge of their execution. The first step
towards a coordinated transport policy for all modes was taken on the occas-
sion of the 1963 Highway Loan, when the Government agreed to establish a perm-
anent Transport Coordination Committee at the intenministerial level. In
1964, following the Bank's recommendations, the Government established a new
advisory body on transport coordination, the Superior Council of Land Trans-
port (Consejo) to carry out studies on transport, pricing, taxation and in-
vestment criteria.
18.       Now that transport demand is likely to require new and costly fa-
cilities incorporating advanced technology, rather than the rehabilitation of
existing infrastructure, the "Conselo" needs to be in a position to fulfill
the function of transport planning and coordination agency.    The Government
has agreed that the Consejo will be given adequate staff and terms of refer-
ence to assist in the preparation of a basic transport law expected to be sub-
mitted to Government by the end of 1972. The Consejo will also carry out
studies of freight flows, user charges, economies of scale in transport,
among others, necessary to an adequate allocation of resources between the
different transport modes. Considerable improvements are taking place within
RENFE itself through the introduction of systematic investment criteria, cost
benefit studies, and sensitivity analysis. Several of these studies have
been done in cooperation with the Consejo to ensure a comprehensive view of
the requirements of the transport sector as a whole.
19.       Generally, the physical objectives of the Bank's loans for the
Transport sector have been achieved. RENFE in particular has undergone
striking changes since 1964. Through its Ten-Year Modernization Plan, in
part financed by the Bank, RENFE has been transformed from an obsolete enter-
prise providing inadequate service with antiquiated equipment and neglected
track, into a modern and efficient railway system standing favorable compar-
ison with most other European railways. The total staff of RENFE has been
reduced by 25 percent (or 12 percent in excess of agreed targets) since 1964
whiile traffic volume increased by 17 percent owing largelv to RENFE's ef-
forts.  Studies of unprofitable trains, lines and stations are underway:
closures have already taken place and further proposals are being submitted
to Government. Although commprcial poliev remains RENFE's weakest point, a
more aggressive and customer-oriented attitude has been adopted: RENFE is
presently carrving out with the help of consultants a reorganization of its
commercial department and a revision of its marketing practices.



- 6 -
20.       Until 1962, RENFE had operated as a department of the Ministry of
Public Works. A major step towards autonomy and commercial operation was
taken on the occasion of the Bank's first Loan when provisional measures
granting RENFE a degree of autonomy were embodied in a Statute (Estatuto).
The Estatuto established RENFE as a public corporation to be operated along
commercial lines, limited the control of the Government and made RENFE's man-
agement fully responsible for day-to-day operation. One of the major
purposes of administrative autonomy was to give management the power to set
user charges at a sufficient level to permit economic operation. Reforms of
a similar nature have been pursued in respect of Ports, and a pilot autono-
mous port is now under operation. The Highway Department within the Ministry
of Public Works, was reorganized at the time of the Bank's loan in 1963 and
an effective maintenance organization was established.
21.       One of the central objectives of Bank lending to the transport sec-
tor has been the elimination of large deficits in the principal public enti-
ties. A Port Finances law was passed in connection with the Bank's loan,
and some financial progress has been achieved. Despite its impressive achieve-
ments in the fields of modernization, productivity and management, RENFE has
been unable to achieve the financial targets agreed with the Bank under the
two previous loans. Traffic was adverselv affected by an economic slowdown
in 1967-68. It also proved impossible for RENFE to offset wage increases by
commensurate rate increases without running counter to Government anti-infla-
tionary policies. This rigidity in rates resulted in a reduction in the real
prices of RENFE's services. RENFE, therefore, continued to operate at a def-
icit, while the benefits of the productivity gains achieved through modern-
ization and reorganization was almost entirely distributed to workers and
customers. Because of the substantial cost reductions achieved, however,
RENFE is now commercially in a better position to achieve financial equili-
brium within the near future. Under a decree issued in April 1971, RENFE
has been given freedom within wide limits and the constraints of the market
to adjust its rates and fares. This is vital to improved financial perform-
ance, which is a major goal of the proposed loan.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       A report entitled "Spain: Appraisal of a Third Railway Project"
(No. PTR-89), dated June 16, 1971 is attached. A Loan and Project Summary
is at Annex III.
23.       The project consists of the first three years (1971-73) of RENFE's
Five-Year (1971-75) Investment Plan. The total cost of the project is esti-
mated at $519 million. Its major components are track rehabilitation ($205
million), rolling stock and motive power ($94 million), signalling equipment
($30.5 million) and electrification of lines ($30.2 million). The foreign
exchange component of the project would be $137 million, if all items pro-
cured through international competitive bidding were to be purchased abroad,
and would fall to about $104 million if all contracts were won by local firms.
The most likely figure, on the basis of experience under the existing railway
loans, is about $123 million. The Bank's contribution would be $104 million,



- 7 -
being $90 million from the proposed new loan and the $14 million undisbursed
balance of Loan No. 507-SP which would finance items in the previous Bank
project which have been carried forward into the 1971-75 Investment Plan.
The Bank would thus finance about 20 percent of total project costs. The
rest would be provided from RENFE's own funds, about US$94 million equiva-
lent (18 percent), and by the Government, about US$321 million equivalent
(62 percent).
24.       The proposed loan would finance track materials, locomotives and
electric multiple units, freight cars and baggage vans, air brake equipment
containers, copper for telephone and overhead wires and signalling equipment
(see Annex III). Should all tenders for these items be won by foreign bid-
ders, the total of $90 million would finance only foreign exchange costs.
Experience with procurement of railway equipment under the two previous Bank
loans to RENFE, however, suggests that local bidders are likely to win a
large proportion of the orders. Were local bidders to win all bids, about
USS32.4 million, that is 36 percent of the amount of the proposed loan, would
be local cost financing. A reasonable estimate based on the outcome of bids
under previous loans is that foreign firms would win about US$35 million
while Spanish firms would win the remaining US$55 million. Of this latter
amount, imported parts and raw materials of which Spain is a net importer
(mainly steel and copper) would account for about US$41 million, so that the
probable local cost financing would be of the order of US$14 million, that
is, only 15.5 percent of the proposed loan. In any case the total Bank con-
tribution to the project of USS104 million would not exceed the estimated
minimum foreign exchange component of the project as a whole.
25.       The Plan of Action agreed with the Government and RENFE under the
proposed loan principally sets forth financial targets which would bring
RENFE to financial equilibrium, i.e. an operating ratio of 100, in 1975.
This is considered attainable, slnce RENFE's wage rates are now on par with
those of comparable industries, its labor force has been brought in line
with actual requirements, and RENFE is in a much stronger competitive posi-
tion than five years ago. The project should moreover lead to further gains
in productivity and, with the help of consultants, lead to improvements in
RENFE's marketing practices.
26.       All goods financed under the proposed loan would be acquired through
international competitive bidding, and for purposes of bid comparison domes-
tic manufacturers, as in the past, would be accorded a margin of preference
of 15 percent or the actual tariff, if lower. Imports into Spain are also
subject to a compensatory tax, the "Impuesto de Compensacion de Gravamenes
Interiores" (ICGI) designed to equalize fiscal treatment, and hence compe-
tition, between foreign and domestic suppliers. This tax is equal to the
indirect taxes levied on the local production of such items manufactured in
Spain. The ICGI has been accepted by the GATT as a means of minimizing dis-
tortions and discrimination in international trade and is not regarded by
GATT as a protective device.   Similar provisions are also to be found in the
Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. Accordingly, for pur-
poses of bid comparison the CIF price would be adjusted by adding not only
15 percent or the-actual tariff, if lower, but also the ICGI (the applicable



- 8 -
rate of which ranges from 11 to 16 percent on typical railway equipment). On
the other hand, domestic bids would be adjusted by adding 15 percent or the
actual tariff, if lower, and the ICGI to the imported component; as fuirtlher
explained in paragraph 4.17 of the Appraisal Report, this practice, whiclh
is peculiar to Spain, serves to restrict the effective preference provided to
local suppliers.
PART V -- LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
27.       The draft Loan Agreement between RENFE and the Bank, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Spanish Government and the Bank, the Renort
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
28.       The proposed Loan Agreement conforms to the general pattern of
Bank loan agreements with railway enterprises. In Section 4.03 and Section
4.04 RENFE agrees to continue to employ consultants to carry out a detailed
study of freight containerization, to take appropriate action to implement
their consultant's recommendations contained in a report dated January 1971,
and to prepare and put into effect rules regarding criteria for the analysis
of new investments. The conditions of effectiveness are that the revised
(1971-1975) Investment Plan has become effective through adoption of the
necessary legal measures (Section 9.01 (a)), that as permitted by the De-
cree empowering RENFE to set its own rates mentioned in paragraph 27 above,
an increase in tariffs averaging 8 percent has been put into effect (Section
9.01 (b)) and that the Government has taken appropriate action in respect
of RENFE's uneconomic lines (Section 9.01 (c)).
29.       In order to improve its financial situation, the Borrower agrees
to meet all cash operating expenses and interest by the year 1973, to cover
in addition charges for depreciation of its operating fixed assets by the
year 1977, and to attain an operating ratio of 100 in 1975. (Schedule 5-1(b)).
30.       The Guarantee Agreement is in the usual form.    Section 2.03 (a)
and (b) commits the Government to take such steps as may be required to
provide RENFE with funds sufficient to carry out the project. In Section
3.03 (b) the Guarantor undertakes to take such action as is necessary on
its part to carry out the Investment Plan and the Plan of Action and in Sec-
tion (3.04) agrees to take from time to time necessary action to enable
RENFE to earn sufficient revenues to cover its operating costs and to meet
its financial targets.   Section 3.06 (a) requires the Government to implement
the arrangements included in Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement in respect of
the discontinuance of service on uneconomic lines. Finally, Section 3.07 (a),
(b), and (c) commits the Guarantor to achieve effective enforcement of trans-
port regulations, to broaden and strengthen the structure of the Superior
Council of Land Transport (Consejo) and to carry out studies regarding re-
strictions imposed on road transport which would substantially affect com-
petition between road and rail transport.



-9-
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI -- RECOMMENDATION
32.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.

///difference in planning approach:
(a) RENFE's Plan has been prepared on a financial basis and
unforeseen price changes will be dealth wvith by adjusting
the physical amount of equipment purchased.
(b) The goods to be financed by the Bank's Loan have been de-
fined in absolute physical terms; the contingencies al-
lowance, therefore, has to cover price changes without
adjustment of the quantity of equipment.
