Description:           The    proposed NWFP SAC2 supports               implementation o f the
                       government's medium-term reform program. The reform program i s
                       based on five pillars (i) reforms; (ii) financial management
                                                fiscal               public

                       development and improve service delivery in key sectors (especially
                       basic social services); (iv) governance reforms to achieve an efficient,
                       accountable, and service oriented civil service; and (v) promoting growth

                       province, including greater access to and better quality o f education,
                       especially for girls, and higher coverage o f immunization and health
                       programs; (ii) a sustainable fiscal position - which will provide more
                       resources for poverty reduction expenditures and will increase
                       effectiveness o f public spending; (iii)  reducing poverty by revitalizing
                       the private sector in an improved investment climate and increasing
                       trade, broad based economic growth and private service delivery; and
                       (iv) institutional, policy and process reforms that will improve

                       cumulative progress in key areas that are expected to pay off, as the
                       public perceives that the situation i s improving and it will be difficult to
                       reverse reforms; and the Bank sustaining and deepening its policy

         ADJUSTMENT CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OFPAKISTAN

                                          I.INTRODUCTION

1.      After a decade o f worsening macroeconomic problems, stagnation inpoverty reduction and social
indicators and political instability, in 1999 Pakistan embarked on a new course with comprehensive
economic and governancereforms, aiming at restoring macroeconomic stability, raising growth rates and
reducing poverty. The federal reform policies have been supplemented by reforms in several provinces,
including the NorthWest Frontier Province (NWFP), to further the efforts inpoverty reduction.

2.      The previous military, technocratic Government of the North West Frontier Province embarked
on its Provincial Reform Program in 2001. The Bank supported the reform program with a Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC) inJuly 2002 guidedby the 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The CAS
emphasized support to provinces that had embarked upon comprehensive reform programs and had built
credible track records on implementation, recognizing that in Palustan the provinces and local
governments bear most o f the responsibility for delivering public services central to poverty reduction,
including education andhealth, but have very limited"fiscal space" to provide these services.

3.      Elections took place in October 2002. The new government - Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA)
(coalition o f4 Islamic parties) -quickly adopted the Provincial ReformProgramand has been effective in
carrying its implementation forward. While there were initially some concerns both domestically and
abroad about the continuation o f reforms under the new government, its actions during its first year in
office have shown that this government i s firmly committed to the reforms under the SAC. The reforms
address the key challenges to development and poverty reduction in the province as described below,
aiming at accelerating human development, reducing poverty and vulnerability, increasing broad based,
pro-poor economic growth, and strengthening public sector govemance and law and order inthe province.

4.      The first Structural Adjustment Credit to NWFP supported the first phase o f the provincial
government's medium-term reformprogram initiatedunder the previous government. The SAC1program
document had identified key areas where reformprogress could lay the basis for the second SAC. Based
on a careful evaluation of progress with implementation o f SAC1 and further progress with the areas
(milestones) for SAC2 under the leadership o f the new government this Program Document provides the
rationale for moving ahead with the proposed SecondNWFP SAC. To provide context, it begins with an
analysis of recent developments inPakistan (Section 2) and progress inachieving development outcomes
inNWFP, including the MDGs (Section 3).        Section 4 summarizes the development challenges facing
NWFP. Section 5 outlines the Provincial Reform Program adopted by the Government to address these
challenges, and provides an assessment o f progress to date under the Reform Program. Section 6 outlines
overall Bank support to the province.       Section 7 describes the proposed operation to support the
Provincial ReformProgram and Section 8 describes indicative triggers for a third NWFP SAC. Section 9
summarizes lessonslearnt, benefits andrisks.


        11. ECONOMIC SITUATIONAND RECENTDEVELOPMENTSINPAKISTAN

5.       Over the past 4 years, the Government o f Palustan has made substantial progress in reforming
Pakistan's economy. The Government launched an ambitious and comprehensive program of reforms to
stabilize and transform the economy from a highly regulated to a more open market economy and
acceleratepoverty reduction and improvementsina broadrange of welfare indicators. Implementation o f
the reform program has been largely successful and the Government has consolidated its domestic and
external reputation as a reformer. Macroeconomic performance has continued to strengthen under the

leadership o f the elected government. In 2002t03 GDP growth (at factor cost) accelerated to 5.1%,
industrial production grew by 9% (against a 3% annual average in the 1990s), inflation remained low
(around 3-4%), and the extemal current account and the overall balance o f payments continued to
improve (see table of selected indicators below). Palustan's debt burden was reduced sharply with
external debt as a share of foreign exchange earnings declining from 335% in FY99, to 179% in FY03.
The fiscal deficit shrank from 6.7 o f GDP in FY02 to 4.5 percent o f GDP in FY03, falling below 5
percent for the first time inmore than 25 years, and progress was made inre-orienting public expenditure
toward poverty reduction. Poverty reduction expenditures have risen steadily inreal terms, with the total
accumulated increase reaching 62 percent between 1999tOO and 2003t04. While these developments bode
well for Pakistan's future economic and social development,                       the level o f investment remains low, as
investor confidence has taken longer than expected to restore itself.

6.        Nevertheless, the acceleration o f growth in recent years has now laid the foundations for
accelerating poverty reduction in Palustan. Looking forward, the main objectives of the Government o f
Pakistan are achieving and sustaining a higher growth path (with increasedprivate investment - domestic
and foreign), maintaining macroeconomic stability, translating this higher growth into lower poverty and
bridgingthe social gap. The Government's PovertyReduction Strategy Paper (PSRP) provides the policy
framework for consolidation o f reforms. The GoNWFP's Provincial Reform Program is consistent with
the national PRSP, emphasizing the same pillars: (i)                    achieving sustained high and broad-based economic
growth; (ii)    Improvinggovernance and consolidating devolution; (iii)                   investing in human capital, with a
renewed emphasis on effective delivery of basic social services; and (iv) targeting the poor and
vulnerable.

7.        In Palustan's federalist structure the Federal, Provincial and Local governments all have
important roles to play in reducing poverty. The Federal government has the key responsibility for
maintaining macro stability, implementing second generation policy reforms to sustain rapid growth and
increase investment, and provide defense and invest and maintain the bulk of public goods. It also has a
key role to play in overall policy making and monitoring and evaluation invirtually all sectors. Through
the National Finance Commission awards mechanism, the Federal government provides the bulk o f the
resources to provinces for pro-poor expenditures at lower tiers of government. The Provincial
govemments are responsible for managing the consolidated provincial finances and fiscal transfers to
Local governments; executing provincial development programs, delivering province-wide services such
as irrigation, road networks and tertiary services; undertaking monitoring and evaluation of Local
governments; and providing the regulatory framework for the private sector. Under the devolution o f
power the Local governments are responsible for service delivery for pro-poor programs in basic
education, curative and preventive health, water supply and sanitation, rural development, farm-to-market
roads, etc. Hence, a major impetus of successful poverty reduction policies in Pakistan would be to
improve policy and working coordination between the three tiers of government. Special focus would
have to be givento Provincial governments and the Local governments that directly deal with the poor.

       111. NWFP'SDEVELOPMENT:OUTCOMESAND PROGRESSINRECENTYEARS

8.         The Government o fNWFP has made substantial efforts inthe last few years to improve the lives
o f its citizens. While progress has not been uniform, and certain reforms have taken longer than expected,
GoNWFP has taken significant steps forward in a range o f reform areas. Progress on reforms in fiscal,
public financial management and service delivery areas has been quite good. In financial management
reforms NWFP leads other provinces inPakistan. Fairly goodprogress has also been made ingovernance
and civil service reforms and in facilitating growth and private sector development. Importantly, the
reform effort has been sustained even with governments o f very different political orientation. But
notwithstanding the progress made, there i s no doubt that NWFP faces huge challenges and needs to
continue withthe direction andpace of reforms for poverty reduction and human development.

9.         At this point in time an assessment of progress in human development based on outcome
indicators can only be based on data up to 2001/02 (the most recent data available); i.e., before the SAC
started. While current human development outcome indicators (e.g., education, health) are not available,
progress in reform implementation and improved input and intermediate indicators give a strong
indication that the underlyingprogress is substantial. This will however not be reflectedinthe discussion
below that i s basedon the only firm outcomes data available (2001/02).

 10.       MillenniumDevelopmentGoals(MDGs). A graphical analysis ofNWFP's performance against
a subset of Pakistan's MDGs i s presentedbelow. Although NWFP has madeprogress towards the MDGs
much remains to achieve these outcomes. Based on 2001/02 data, NWFP i s on track to meet the infant
mortality target, but trendperformance inthe period up to the SAC was worse than requiredfor all other
important MDGs such as poverty reduction, school enrollment, ratio of female-to-male literacy,
proportion of immunized children aged 12-23 months, and access to safe water. It is expected that more
recent data would show improvements in these indicators as a result of the serious reform efforts that
have been undertaken by the GoNWFP since 2001. However, this simple graphical analysis o f MDGs
 goals clearly points out that ifPakistan i s to meet its MDGs, special attention to provinces like the NWFP
 i s essential. The SAC i s one vehicle that can assist the province inachieving its goals.

 11.       Poverty. According to various estimates, includingthose listedinthe PRSPofthe Government of
Pakistan, poverty in Palustan has increased between 1998-99 and 2001-02. The PRSP document also
 states that since the methodology o f poverty measurement i s still evolving, rural and urban estimates of
poverty, as well as provincial estimates for the year 2001-02 using the oJffciaI poverty line are not yet

available. Thus while the nationalpoverty headcount from the PRSP for recent years are listed inTable 2
below, for estimates o f poverty inNWFP, one has to rely on computations based on an alternate poverty
line. Discussions with the government on resolving the methodology for measurement are planned for
June 2004; in the meantime these alternate set o f estimates are presented in Table 3 to provide an
indication o f poverty trends inNWFPinrecent years.

12.       Table 3 below shows poverty headcounts for NWFP, and comparable estimates for Palustan,
usingan alternate poverty line (developed by the WorldBank) that has been extensively used for analysis
inreportsbythe Bankand other agencies. Applyingthispovertylineandits associated methodologyfor
estimating poverty, national, regional and provincial estimates are available usingPIHS data for 1998-99
and 2001-02. Although these estimates cannot be construed as official figures, they are still useful: first,
they provide a consistent measure o f poverty trends - based on a poverty line fixed in real terms; and
second, they indicate trends over time that would remain largely unaffected by small changes in the
poverty line.' It should however be noted that the World Bank poverty line is slightly higher than the
official line mentioned above; thus these would yield provincial and national estimates that are higher in
absolute terms than what can be expected usingthe official poverty line.

 13.      With the exception o f Balochistan, NWFP i s the poorest province in Pakistan, with an overall
incidence o f poverty substantially higher than that for the country as a whole (poverty headcount for
NWFP is 46%, compared to 37% for Pakistan in 2001-02, usingWorld Bank poverty lines) (table 3).'
Bothurban and rural poverty inNWFP are higher than that for the entire country (poverty headcounts for
urban and rural NWFP are 35% and 48% respectively, compared to 26% and 42% respectively for all o f
Pakistan). Moreover, depth and severity o f both urban and rural poverty, measured by poverty gap and
squared poverty gap respectively, are relatively higher for NWFP than for the rest o f the country.

 14.      Not only i s poverty higher inNWFP, but poverty incidence also increased inthe 1990s. Poverty
reduction between 1990-91 and 1998-99 in NWFP appears to have occurred only in urban areas while
rural areas have become poorer on the average. From 1998-99 to 2001-02, poverty has increased inboth
urban and rural areas o f NWFP, resulting ina marginal increase for the province overall -the increase for
the province i s however less than what is seen for the country as a whole over this period (Table 3). The
 13 percentage point rural-urban gap in 2001-02 for NWFP, higher than the national average, has all the
more significance for overall poverty inNWFP, since the province is muchmore rural than the country as
a whole - around 85% o f NWFP's population live inrural areas, compared to about 72% o f the country's
 'Note that no matter which poverty line is used, national headcountfor Pakistanbetween 1998-99 and 2001-02 shows a rising
trend(refer to Tables 2 and 3).
* Itis generally believedthat Balochistani s the poorest province in Pakistan, but this does not show up in the Bank's (1998/99
and 2001/02) and the Government's (1998/99) poverty head count estimates because of sample and non-sample biases.
Balochistanhas a vast territory and low populationdensity which makes it difficult for surveys to be representative. Moreover,
seasonal fluctuationsinconsumption also raise doubts about Balochistan's consumption and price indices used inpovertyhead-
count estimates.

people inthe province3.

15.       HumanDevelopment. NWFP has poor social indicators with the performance of the education
sector slow and stagnant, but health outcomes have shown a rising trend duringthe 1990s. Historically,
the performance of the education sector in NWFP has been slow and stagnant, with enrollment and
literacy rates rising only marginally. In FY02, overall literacy rate was 38% inNWFP compared to the
national average of 45%. Good progress was achieved inthe enrolment rates between 1998-2002, against
the national average, particularly in the rural areas. NWFP has also shown positive gains in health
outcomes duringthe 1990swith a rising trend inhealth and population indicators. Outcomes towards the
health MDGs are better compared to Pakistan as a whole with the province registering a lower infant
mortality rate and higher immunization rate of children aged 12-23 months. However, challenges remain,
such as the use o f contraceptive methods i s limitedto 22% o f currently marriedwomen aged 15-49 years.

16.       Gender equity. The overall sex ratio inNWFP is 0.97 (female/male), which i s higher than the
sex ratios in all other provinces. Early age sex ratios (0-4, 5-9, and 10-14) are also comparable to or
higherthan the national sex ratios, suggestingthat the extent ofrelative deprivation faced by females may
be lower inNWFP as compared to other provinces. However, schooling relatedvariables like literacy and
enrollment rates, show wide gender gaps. While the literacy and school enrollment rates for males are
closer to or even higher than the national average, the corresponding rates for females are among the
lowest in the country. The NWFP male literacy rate is about 57% and the male net primary enrollment
rate is 62% while the female literacy rate i s 20% and the female net primary enrollment rate i s 39%4.
Under present conditions inNWFP, gender gaps in educational apainment are likely to persist, and even
widen in the future, unless focused policy measures are taken to curb these trends. Large gender gaps
translate into particularly low literacy and enrollmentrates among poor women, with adverse implications
for future human development - since women's education i s known to be especially critical for a child's
health and education. Traditionally, women have had a limited role in public life such as the low
proportion of females voting in elections and the low proportion of female counselors in Local
Governments. There are additional issues of exclusion such as material rights to dowry, share inproperty
and inheritance, and power in important decisions - a rather typical problem faced by a large number of
women in Pakistan. Inview of the high gender gaps, the Provincial Reform Program has paid special
attention to programs and policies to reduce gender disparities ineducation andhealth sectors.




  There i s considerablevariation across the province in terms of poverty and social indicators. According to the Multi-Indicator
Cluster Survey (MICS) 2001, the districts of Kohistan, Upper Dir, Bunner, Batagram, Shanga and Tank are among the poorest
six districts in NWFP, ranking extremely low in terms of social indicators, whereas the districts of Peshawar, Haripur,

18.      Agriculture registered growth o f 4.1% in FY03 with a normal monsoon, rebounding from the
drought-induced weak performance in FYOl and FY02 with annual declines o f 2.7% and 0.1%,
respectively. Most significant i s the recovery of the crops and livestock sub-sectors, which grew by 3.6%
and 4.3%, respectively.        The sector has made a significant contribution to the improvement of the
lackluster performance o f the NWFP economy in the last two years. The sector's contribution to GDP
continues to be around 30%, slightlyhigher than its contribution to the national GDP at about 24%. This
demonstrates that agriculture accounts for a larger share o f aggregate employment and incomes in the
province and makes substantial contribution to the ago-based industries inthe province and outside the
province. About 61% of agnculture's share to GDP comes from the livestock sub-sector and 36% from
the crops sub-sector, indicating the importance ofthese sub-sectors inthe NWFPeconomy.

                                 IV. CHALLENGES AND CONSTRAINTS

19.      The previous section showed that in the years leading up to the SAC1 NWFP had slow
improvement inprimary school enrollment, infant mortality rates and immunization coverage of children
aged 12-23. It had stagnating or slowly worsening indicators for poverty incidence-particularly                     highin
rural areas-access      to safe water and ratio o f female to male literacy. In all these areas as well as real
GDP growth the province was lagging the rest o fthe country.

20.      Three strategic challenges for the province emerge from this analysis that are addressed in the
provincial government's poverty reduction strategy: (i)the challenge to increase the growth rate; (ii)                   to
acceleratehumandevelopment; and (iii)            to reduce rural vulnerability.

21.       (i)Thechallengetoincreasethegrowthrate. Persistentpovertyreductionrequiresmorerapid
pro-poor, broad based growth with substantial employment generation. Sustaining rapid growth will
require a better investment climate and better infrastructure for not only industry and services, but also
agnculture (see paragraphs 25-26), and over the medium and long term, a better educated and shlled
workforce. However, there i s also a need for well-targeted poverty alleviation programs for vulnerable
groups. Inorder to meet the challenge o f getting more rapid economic growth a well formulated growth
strategy andrelatedpolicy reforms needto take into account the following opportunities and constraints.

22.      The province has a narrow economic structure but substantial economic potential.
Historically, the provincial economy has been mostly dependentonrelatively low value-added agriculture

 This is based on the comparison o f average monthly per capita incomes in Pakistan and NWFP in the Household Income and
Expenditure Survey 2001/02. Average per capita monthly income in Pakistan is Rs 1030, whereas it i s Rs 891 in NWFP. The
absence o f provincial GDP estimates in Pakistan is a major hindrance in doing growth analysis for provinces, including for
NWFP. Most o f the understanding o f the provincial economy is based on piecemeal data or periodic studies.



                                                              7

as the largest production sector, services, and public employment (especially in the armed forces). The
manufacturing sector i s small and with competitiveness problems; half of the registered industrial units
have closed down inrecent years, especially as time-bound fiscal concessions expired. However, there is
substantial mineral wealth inthe province such as precious and semi-precious stones, marble, and granite
that can be exploited with improvements in infrastructure, a better policy environment, and opportunities
for training on advancedtechniques. Similarly, availability of better infrastructure relatedto tourism and a
better image of the province can help develop the potential that exists for tourism. There is also
considerable potential to further develop NWFP's rich hydel resources. Under the new strategy o f
encouraging small hydel generation plants, and development o f off-grid localized energy distribution
from these plants, the province has the potentialto attract industry, e.g., agro-processing, by offering them
localizedand inexpensive sources of energy above long-run marginal cost.

23.      Private investment is constrained by a weak investment climate but there are signs that the
investment climate might be improving. Analytical work undertakenby the World Bank has found that
NWFPhad the weakest investment climate inPakistan (not covering the province o f Balochistan). Main
impedimentswere severepower shortages, the time it took to get a new electricalconnection, crime and
law and order problems, and high transport costs for exports and for inputs due to long distance to the
port. However, there are signs that the law and order situation i s improving. A 2003 nationwide survey
found that NWFPnow hadthe highestsatisfaction rate inthe country with regardto law and order, access
to justice and non-compt police. Also, indications are that in recent years there has been growth o f
industries basedon locally-producedraw materials.

24.      (ii)Thechallengetoacceleratehumandevelopment. Thereisacentralrolefortheprovincial
and local governments inimproving education, health and other social indicators through public provision
of in particular basic education and health services - within fiscal constraints - but also through
improving the policy framework to facilitate an increasing role for the private sector andNGOs in service
provision. Improving public provision of education and health services requires that public sector
governance improve. The largest shortfalls in social indicators to reach the MDGs are for women. Hence,
reducing gender disparities in education and health i s a central part of the challenge to accelerate human
development, and is already reflectedas a core thrust o f the government's reformprogram.

25.      (iii)Thechallengetoreduceruralvulnerability.InNWFP4outofevery5peoplederivetheir
livelihoods from the rural areas, and the widespread vulnerability-in     particular among farmers inrainfed
areas-was    highlighted once again when a large part of the population was severely affected by the
drought in FYOl and FY02. A central development challenge i s hence to accelerate agricultural growth
and rural employment creation. However, agncultural growth i s limited by constraints in factor inputs:
land, water and credit. Landsales markets are extremely thinwith lack of clear title and with complicated
and costly land dispute resolutionmechanisms. Inland rental markets statutory security of land tenure for
tenants i s not guaranteed in actual effect. More than half of land in the province i s rainfed but with
potential for productivity increaseswith improved agricultural practices. Inirrigated areas water supply to
farms i s constrained by large conveyance losses in water distribution due to inadequate maintenance of
canal lining, and tail end users get less than farms at the head due to losses and abuse of the water
rationing system. The efficiency of on-farm water management is low, and government on-farm water
management field offices are laclung at the districtkehsil level. Higher productivity will also come from
extending the irrigation frontier inNWFP, which has both surplus irrigable land and water. Furthermore,
since land is the required collateral a large share of m a l (farm) households is credit constrained which
reduces farm productivity significantly.

26.      Agricultural growth in the province is also constrained by the choice o f outputs, production
technology and supporting institutions and regulations. Opportunities for increasing productivity can, if
properly planned and managed, come through higher cropping intensities, crops with lower water



                                                     8

requirements, diversification to higher-value crops and improved animal health and breeding. The
potential growth for particular commodities in premium domestic and export markets is constrained by
lack o f market support (market infrastructure, market information systems) and implementation of food
safety standardsas well as quality and grading standards.

27.       The government needs to address the three strategic challenges within existing fiscal and
political constraints. In the former area the fiscal situation has been improving but constraints
remain. NWFP has faced serious resource constraints for a number of years. Close to 90% o f provincial
receipts come from the federation (including WAPDA), reflecting the very limited provincial tax base.
Throughout the 1990s, as a result of lower than envisaged federal fiscal transfers and hydel profits, and
inadequate efforts at raising own revenues, expenditure composition became skewed with underprovision
o f key public services and low development spending.6 However, recent years' increases in own
provincial revenue collection as a result of reforms' as well as a likely increase in federal transfers with
the expected NFC Award could provide additional fiscal space for the next few years. Nevertheless, the
fiscal budget faces the constraint of appropriate expenditure composition and effectiveness inspending to
achieve the Government's goals for increased and improved social service delivery. Even with a new
NFC award, the fiscal budget also faces sustainability constraint over the medium term. Ifthere i s no new
NFC award so that revenue sharing agreement remains, the Provincial Government i s faced with tight
constraints on spendingalready inthe near term.

28.       Furthermore, the electedgovernment faces realpolitical constraints. The MMA government
that won election in October 2002 i s a government o f an alliance o f religious parties. It faces strong
political pressure from the public and Members of the Provincial Assembly (MPAs) for increased
spending ina number o f areas, including creation of civil service posts and public investment projects to
MPAs' local constituencies. Furthermore, it has been under pressure - but largely resisted - to take
policy measuresinother areas that could have reinforced a less favorable image o f the province as a place
to invest. Notwithstanding this difficult political balancing act, the new government has so far managed
the demands of its differentpolitical constituencies quite well. While it has enforced the Shariah (Islamic
law) inthe province, which was a reenactment o f acceptedIslamic laws inPalustan, it has also continued
to work with a range o f development partners' for reducing poverty in the province, has improved
political relations with the Federal government, and has kept more radical elements withinthe party under
control. The biggest political challenge for the government would be to deliver on its election promises
(see paragraph 32) bymaintaining the momentum o f the reformprogram.


                                       V.      NWFP'S REFORMPROGRAM

A. Overview

29.       At the time of the military take over in 1999, NWFP faced a number o f serious socioeconomic
problems, including: a stagnant economy; endemic governance issues; poor service delivery in all major
services; low social indicators; low tax potential and a rigid expenditure structure. The Government
started to address the multiple social and economic problems during 2000, with varying degrees of
 success. Recognizing that many of the problems were interdependent and needed a more systematic


  The province has been runninglimited fiscal deficits. These can only be financed through loans/grants from federal govemment
and foreign assistance, and limited short-term ways and means loans from SBP.
'There  was a 20% increase in own tax revenues during FY03 over FY02; a reduction in debt servicing payments from 25% of
total expenditures in FY02 to 22% in FY03 as a result of accelerated repayment o f the most expensive debt; a 35% reduction in
expenditure on food subsidies; and a number o f actions to implement reforms in public financial management such as timely
reconciliation of accounts, closure of suspense accounts and off-budget accounts; computerization o f accounts under PIFRA,
*formation o fthe Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC), and enactment o f a Procurement Law.
   Including, among others, USAID, DFID, NORAD, GTZ and the Asian Development Bank.



                                                               9

approach, the former GoNWFP decided to develop a comprehensive reform program for the province.
For this purpose, it prepared a strategy document, the Provincial Reform Program (PRP), which has
been discussed extensively with various agencies, including the Bank.

30.      NWFP was the first province to embark on such a comprehensive reformprogram. Inline with
the goals o f the national PRSP, the overarching objective o f the PRP i s poverty reduction, improved
human development and facilitation o f economic growth by restoring good governance andrespect for the
rule o f law, enhancing effectiveness o f public expenditures, and reestablishing the integnty o f state
institutions and their accountability to the public. The PRP has the following five main pillars (i)   fiscal
reforms; (ii)   public financial management reforms, (iii) to accelerate human development and
                                                           reforms
improve service delivery in key sectors (especially basic social services); (iv) governance reforms to
achieve an efficient, accountable, and service oriented civil service; and (v) establishing an effective and
transparent enabling environment for private sector development to accelerate economic growth. This
reform program is well aligned with the three strategic challenges outlined above and provides a
comprehensive strategy for poverty reduction.

31.      The PRP was approved by the Cabinet in June 2001 and several o f the PRP reform measures
were incorporated in the FY02 Budget and reflected in the Budget White Paper and other documents.
The NWFP SAC supported the province's economic and social reformprogram inline with the objectives
o f the national I-PRSP and the Bank's CAS (FY03-05).

32.      The Mutahidda-Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) government that took office in December 2002, won
elections on promises o f Islamization of NWFP, poverty reduction by improving access to and quality o f
education and health facilities, improving economic opportunities inthe province, improving governance,
reducing corruption, and reducing gender inequalities in the province - i.e., many o f the goals are quite
similar to the thrust o fthe Provincial Reform Program and the NWFP SAC.

33.      Very soon after taking office, the NWFP Cabinet in its January 21, 2003 meeting discussed and
fully endorsed the NWFP SAC and agreed to fully abide by its commitments. Although the bulk o f the
new Provincial Assembly members and Cabinet was rather inexperienced - this being their first time in
Parliament - the elected members have come on a clean reputation, are public-service oriented, and also
h o w that their reelection would depend on improved governance, delivery o f social services and
economic opportunities andjobs. The main champion o f reform is the Senior Minister (who also heads
the portfolios o f Finance, Planning, Development and Environment), effectively. supported by other
champions such as the Ministers o f Education and Health. The Bank has had good interactions with all
these key counterparts on the SAC. Ina relatively short period o f time, despite their initial inexperience,
the political leadership inthe province has provided good guidance and direction from the top about the
 SAC program. A core group o f top civil servants are effective leaders inpushingreform implementation,
inparticular inEducation, Health, Finance andPlanningandDevelopmentDepartments.

 34.     A number of external factors inthe year following SAC1 approval affectedthe speed o fprogram
 implementation. The elections in October 2002 brought democratically elected Federal and Provincial
 govemments in Pakistan; post-election their formation took several months. Practically very little
 decision-malung and program implementation took place in Palustan during the first half o f FY03 as a
result o f first preparing for elections (duringAugust-September 2002), the elections and announcement o f
results (mid-October 2002), and the formation o f new governments (December 2002 January 2003).
                                                                                           -
Moreover, Pakistan was undergoing the first full year o f implementing the devolution o f power and
 creation o f Local Governments. Significant teething problems were encountered in all provinces,
 including NWFP, related to the devolution process such as issues o f lack o f clarity in roles and
 responsibilities o f the provincial and district govemments, inadequate and l o w capacity o f local

B. Implementationofthe ProvincialReformProgram

B.l Summary Overview

35.     NWFP's Provincial Reform Program has come a long way over the last few years. While
progress has not been uniform, and reforms have taken somewhat longer than expected, GoNWFP has
taken significant steps forward across a range ofreformareas.

36.     A summary score-cardofprogressfor the PRF' since SACl approval inthe core areas ofreformis
as follows (more detailed andquantitative assessments follow inthe subsequentsub-sections):

    1   Fiscal reforms: Goodprogress. Own revenue/provincial GDP ratio has increasedthrough further
        tax reform, accelerating and rationalizing user chargers, and improving tax administration.
        Increases in priority spending (development spending and current social spending) while
        rationalizingother expenditure.
    1   Public Financial management reforms: Good progress.               The GoNWFP has satisfactorily
        implemented the SAC1 public financial improvement plan; reconciliation o f accounts and
        Parliamentary oversight and accountability have improved; and as the first province in the
        country it has adopted the Provincial Financial Accountability Assessment, enacted a new
        Procurement Law and putnew regulations andprocedures for procurement inoperation.
    1   Reforms to accelerate human development and improve service delivery: Good progress.
        Service delivery has improved and also expanded inthe priority areas of education and health in
        other services. A number of health outcomes have shown improvement. Firm data on education
        outcomes are pending but are expected to show improvements inenrollment andreduced gender
        gaps.
    1   Governance and civil service reforms: Fairly good progress. There has been relatively good
        progress incivil service reform. NWFP has continued to maintain the autonomy of the Provincial
        Public Service Commission(PPSC) for recruitment to grades 11-16 incontrast to some provinces
        and the Federal government. Initial steps have been taken to lessen recruitment delays, increase
        tenure, and respond to actuarial liabilities. The Government has liftedthe 7-year long recruitment
        ban on vacant positions other than teachers, healthpersonnel and police but the expansion inthe
        number of filled civil service posts is limited. The impact on the wage billcanbe accommodated
        within a sustainable fiscal fkamework. Administrative devolution has been somewhat patchy but
        with some signs of further progress.
     1  Promoting sustainable economic growth: Fairly good progress. The government has
        announced its PSD policy statement and formulated an Agnculture Strategy, has rationalized and
        simplified regulations affecting industries, and has improved the law and order situation with
        benefits to the overall investment climate in the province. The new, elected government has
        slightly different preferences on public sector involvement than those expressed in the SACl
        program document but i s fully committed to having a sound private-sector ledgrowth strategy.

37.     Cutting across the pillars of the reform program is the government's comprehensive
approach to improving governance and reducing opportunities for corruption. Inthis regard, NWFP
i s a leading province in Pakistan. It was the first in the country to enact a new Procurement Law,
implementassociatedguidelines andbiddingregulations, andestablish aPublic Accounts Committee as a
watchdog for public financial accountability and the office o f a Provincial Finance Controller. Inaddition
the autonomous Provincial Public Service Commission contributes to more merit-based recruitment,
functioning Parent-Teacher Associations with a planned role in monitoring o f teacher absenteeismhave



                                                      11

been established in all primary schools, and devolution is designed to strengthen accountability and
transparency and to empower citizens. NWFP is only second to one province with regard to the extent o f
reconciled public receipts and expenditures, it has the highest rated auditing system and enjoys the highest
public satisfaction with law and order agencies. The government intends to continue its efforts, as
envisaged in the program, to strengthen accountability and transparency systems including better
monitoring and acquiringbetter data.

38.         Perhaps the strongest point o fNWFP's reform program i s that it has now been sustained for three
years even while undergoing the transition to a democratically elected provincial government. While
implementation slowed in the quarters before and after elections, and due to teething problems related to
Devolution, the new government soon adopted the reform program, and has shown steady reform
commitment and effective leadership inimplementation.

39.         Notwithstanding the progress made to date, NWFP faces a large unfinished reform agenda.
NWFP needs both to consolidate its gains inresource mobilization, expenditure prioritization and public
financial    management, and to take forward the initiatives launched to meet the province's strategic
objectives o f maintaining rapid growth and accelerating human development. The sections below list out
inmore detail, for eachofthe four pillars ofthe program, boththe progressmade since Boardapproval of
the first NWFP SAC which at this stage in the staffs view merits approval o f the second NWFP SAC,
and the future reform challenges to be implementation of which could support a SAC3 and possibly
additional follow on operations.

B.2 A DetailedAssessment

     Pillar One: FiscalReforms

40.         The GoNWFP adopted comprehensive fiscal reforms with the overarching objective o f
maintaining a sustainable fiscal position and improving provision o fpublic services.

41.         The government has maintained a sustainable fiscal position. Table 4 shows that in recent
years the government has been successful in increasing fiscal space (total spending excluding interest
payments and pensions) while containing overall spending and deficits to sustainable levels. Although the
fiscal deficit in FY03 at 0.9 percent o f provincial GDP (PGDP)' was slightly higher than the average
fiscal deficit during FY99-01 (0.7 percent)-fully            reflecting the higher development spending previously
 severely constrained by lack o f fiscal space-the          fiscal position i s on a sustainable path: The debt service
burden has declined from 3.3 percent of PGDP in FY02 to 2.2 percent in FY04, and is projected to
continue to decline over the mediumterm. Public debt as a ratio to PGDP has declined from 19percent on
 average in the three years preceding the SAC (FY99-FYO1) to 16 percent in FY03, is projected to reach
 14percent inFY05 andto decline to 12percent over the mediumterm.

42.         ...and   has improved expenditure composition by using the fiscal space for high priority
 spending. While containingthe overall deficit the government has also managed to increase fiscal space
 through early retirement o f expensive debt inFY03 and early FY04 and enhanced own provincialrevenue
 collection (from 0.8 percent o f PGDP in FY02 to 0.9 percent in FY04). Non-interest, non-pension
 spending increased from 7 percent o f PGDP on average in FY99-FYO1 to 7.4 percent in FY02 and is
projected to reach 7.8 percent inFY04. The increased fiscal space together with improved composition o f
 spending has enabled a sound expansion in high priority social spending-from                   3 percent o f PGDP in


   Official  provincial GDP series are not estimated in Pakistan. NWFP's GDP is guesstimated at 10-11% of Pakistan's GDP,
 based on results of periodic studies. The GoNWFP has undertaken a study to estimate the provincial GDP; results would be
 availableby end ofFY04.



                                                               12

FY02 to 3.8 percent in FY03 and FYO4-while                                   overall spending levels fell slightly inpercent o f PGDP.
The share of social sector expenditures reached 38 percent of total expenditures in FY03 - 7 percent
higher than the FY03 MTBF target. In particular, actual education and health sector development
spending in FY03 overshot the ambitious FY03 MTBF target by 6 percentage points. (A wide range o f
institutional reform measures, as described below, has also been taken to increase the effectiveness of
spending). Current expenditures came down to 8.1 percent o f PGDP in FY03 from an average o f 8.6
percent duringFY99-01, i.e., down to 81 percent of total expenditures from 89 percent. The government
kept expenditures on the generalized wheat subsidy to Rs 800 million or 0.2 % o f GDP against an average
o f 0.8 percent o f GDP duringFY99-FYO1.

43.      Looking ahead, the medium-term budget framework in the baseline scenario is sustainable
and can meet the multiple fiscal objectives: reduce the debt burden to sustainable levels, continue to
raise high priority spending - in particular in health and education - and avoid a squeeze after the last
SAC disbursement, and continue to raise development spending, including on growth facilitating
infrastructure (see details in Annex C). The Government has stated its commitment to maintain fiscal
discipline by preparing and implementing annual budgets in line with this medium-term budget
framework and hence to ensure fiscal sustainability.

44.      While the proposed NFC Award would provide additional fiscal space, a key issue will be
appropriate expenditure composition and effectiveness in spending to achieve the Government's
goals for increased and improved social service delivery. A central challenge over the mediumterm is
to use this fiscal space in line with the PRP priorities on poverty reduction, enhanced social service
provision and accelerated human development as well as improved law and order situation. The MTBF
does reflect these priorities and hence the issue i s to fully reflect the MTBF spending priorities in the
annual budgets and ensure adequate budget implementation. Since a large part o f spending in the high
priority areas o f basic health and education services i s under the purview o f local governments it i s
important that the coming Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) Award passes on sufficient fiscal space
to the local governments to enable them to increase and improve provision o fthese services as targeted. It
will also be crucial to monitor the employment situation carefully to ensure that, as and when the
GoNWFP devolves full recruitment authority to local govemment, the fiscal space at the district and
TMA level isnot fully absorbedbynew hiring.

45.      Below follows a more detailed review o f the key areas o f fiscal reform: (i)      enhancing revenues;
(ii)reprioritizing expenditures and improving expenditure management; (iii)improving budget
preparation, execution, and oversight; and (iv) strengthening fiscal devolution.

(0 Enhance revenues

46.      Progress to date. Collection o f provincial own revenues grew by 20% from FY02 to FY03"
(17% inreal terms), increasing from 0.8 percent o f PGDP to 0.9 percent. Revenue mobilization has been
strengthened through further tax reform, accelerating and rationalizing user chargers, and improving tax
administration. Tax reform measures includedrestructuring and reducing the number of provincial taxes;
imposing an apcultural income tax (AIT) to complement the province's land-based tax";                            and
harmonization o f AIT and Motor Vehicle Tax rates with other provinces. User charges have been raised
for tertiary-level social services and irrigation water. Tax administration measures include piloting the
computerization o f land records; setting up a school for Patwaris (land appraisers) and training of Board
of Revenue staff; and giving back the collection o f Aabiana (irrigation charges) to the Irrigation
Department. The govemment has completed studies on tax policy and administration (Reform o f AIT and
Land Tax in NWFP, Tax Potential in NWFP, and Reform o f Tax Administration in NWFP) that will
provide input to future improvements inprovincial revenue efforts.

47.      Future Challenges. The Government still needs to undertake a number of policy and
administrative measures as outlined inthe above-mentioned studies. These could include: pay as incentive
a graduated reward o f up to 5% o f the revenue collections to staff assigned additional responsibility o f
taduser charge collection; open Tax FacilitationCenters with support from private sector for collection o f
Motor Vehicle Tax, and to further consider transfer o f collection o f property tax on pilot basis to one o f
the Tax Facilitation Centers; improve the water rate formula with the aim o f making it self financing;



loThese were somewhatbelowthe MTE3Ftargets for FY03 which envisages a 15% increaseinprovincial taxes and 37% increase
inuser charges, with anoverall24.5% increaseinprovincialrevenuesfrom these two sources.
   Unliketheotherprovincesthe landtax inNWFPis appliedto all landholdingswithout exemptions.

review and revise higher education fees and user charges for health services, with adequate safety nets for
the poor; and further strengthen provincial tax administration12. These and other efforts are projected to
raise own provincial by collected revenue by 13% per year in FYOS-FY08-a                     robust increase in light o f
the narrow and non-buoyant provincial revenue base and faster than PGDP growth. However, due to the
small share of own provincialrevenue compared to federally transferred receipts, this will only amount to
increasing own provincial revenue from about 0.8 percent of GDP inFY02to 1.0percent by FY07.

(ii) Reprioritize expendituresand improve expenditure management

48.        Progressto date. Expenditure managementhas been strengthened, an MTBFhas beenprepared,
and expenditure compositionhas improved throughreprioritization.

      Development expenditures as a share of total expenditures have increased from 10-12% during
      FY99-01 to almost 20% in the FY03 Budget. Moreover, the development expenditures have been
      reprioritized to predominantly focus on pro-poor sectors. The "throw-forward" o f fiscal liabilities of
      the original Annual Development Plan of FY04was significantly higher compared to that o f FY03,13
      but was reprioritized andreduced to 3.0 years, slightlybelow the 3.24 years o fFY03 (SAC2 trigger).
      While trimmed down, the development programmaintains its emphasis on the pro-poor sectors.

      Debt Management. The Government prematurely retired Rs 7.6 billioni4 expensive domestic debt
      (Capital Development Loans (CDLs) from the Federal government) and created a permanent fiscal
      space o f Rs 1.4billion which contributes to ensuring the sustainability o f the pro-poor programs once
      the SAC supports ends. NWFP has formulated and proposed a provincial debt management strategy
      to the Federal government, aimed at early retirement o f additional CDLs, using a number o f
      instruments including market loans.

      Rationalizationof Other Expenditures. The GoNWFP has reduced the wheat subsidy from Rs. 3.3
      billion in FYOO to currently Rs. 1billion, mainly to maintain strategic stocks. It has closed a number
      o f public enterprises and autonomous bodies with annual savings of Rs. 70-100 million. It has
      established a separate General Provident Fund and a Pension Fund outside the Budget to better
      manage the government's deferred liabilitie~'~;the capital o f the Pension and Provident Funds is
      being increased regularly with the aim o f making them fully funded inthe future.

49.        Future expenditure challenges include continuing to increase fiscal space and ensuring that
additional fiscal space i s used for poverty reduction and human development by maintaining the MTBF
targeted allocations for education and health inthe annual budgets; ensuring that the ADP throw-forward
 does not increase beyond the current level; containing establishment costs to FY04 levels in terms o f




 l2 Measures couldincludeamorewell-defined and streamlinedrole of the Boardof Revenue(BoR) andthe ExciseandTaxation
 (E&T) Department; modemizing the mode of application, laws, and administration of agricultural and land-based taxes; and
 improvingcoordinationbetweenthe BoR andE&T Departments.
 l3Throw-forwardis defined as the total remainingcost of a development project minus the allocationof the project in a given
 year. Throw- forward of the developmentprograminnumber of years is the ratio of the throw-forwardcost to the allocationina
 givenyear. It indicatesthe number of years that it would take to completethe developmentprogramat present level of allocation
 ifnonewschemesare added.
 l4Rs 5.7 billion inFY03 andRs 1.9 billion inearlyFY04.
 l5At the end of FY03 the General ProvidentTrust Fundhad a total deposit of Rs. 4.9 billion, against the present total deferred
 liability of Rs 8.9 billion. The Pension Fund presentlyhad deposits of Rs 2.3 billion against the pension liability of Rs. 3.2
 billion; normallyannualpensionsliabilities are inthe range of Rs3-4 billion.



                                                                15

Fundwiththe aimat self-sufficiency; andcomplete areviewofPublic ExpenditureManagement.

(iii) Improve budgetpreparation, execution and oversight

50.       Progress to date. The GoNWFP has also instituted several reforms in the preparation,
processing, and execution of the budget, such as posting fiscal data on the web'7; economic classification
o f expenditures in budget documents; piloted preparation of program and performance budgeting;
initiated computerization of updated land records on a pilot basis; online linking of the Provincial and
District Budgets; and establishing a professionally staffed Budget Analysis Unit, which i s now fully
functional and playing an important role intracking and reporting on the consolidated fiscal deficit and
key fiscal indicators on a quarterly basis.

51.       Future Challenges: improving the transparency and credibility of the fiscal budget by adopting
standard accounting conventions, implementing performance budgetinginmajor departments for which a
DFID-funded TA is in process; continue to expand computerization of land records in Districts; and
accurate and timely reporting of the consolidated fiscal deficit and other key fiscal aggregates on a
quarterly basis.

(iv) Strengthenfiscal devolution

52.         Progress to date. NWFP was the first province to use a needs-based formula (based on
population and indicators of social development and backwardness) for budgetary transfers to the districts
startinginFY02. All non-salary recurrent expenditures and district development spending were devolved
to the districts during FY03 and FY04. The PFC Awards of FY04 (compared to FY03 PFC),
strengthened fiscal devolution by providing matching incentive grants to Districts for additional revenue
mobilization and enhancing non-salary allocation of Districts by 10%; directly transferred the Octroi
grants to Tehsils (instead of through the Districts) to ensure timely transfer of funds; and piloted
devolving the Urban Immovable Property Tax (UIPT) in two districts. The government has decided to
devolve the district salary budgets to District governments' accounts (Account IV) (SAC2 trigger), which
i s currently only being done in the Punjab. It has also agreed in principle to devolve more tax collection
authority to the Districts as allowed under the Local Government Ordinance (LGO) 2001, and remit user
fees for health and rural water supply directly to Districts. While the province i s committed to continued
fiscal devolution in the next PFC Awards, it should be noted that PFC i s an autonomous body with the
final authority to adopt or reject recommendations madeby the Government.

53.        Future Challenges are: A central challenge i s ensuring enough fiscal space to local govemments
and supporting the devolution of spending decisions while also preserving national objectives such as
progress on health, education and other social indicators through appropriate fiscal incentives to local
governments that provide the bulk of public services inthese areas. More analysis i s needed to tailor the
best instrument to the circumstances of this particular province. The provincial government has however
already expressed interest in a transparent formulahystem of incentivizing grants to well-performing
Districts for improving service delivery as one option. Other challenges are ensuring stronger assistance
to the PFC Secretariat; proper monitoring of releasesto local government; review fiscal performance of
districtshehsils and take steps to improveprocesses, allocations, staffing, training, etc.

         PillarTwo: PublicFinancialManagement andAccountabilityReforms

54.      NWFPcontinuesto make goodprogressinimplementingpublic financial management and
procurement reforms. The GoNWFP has satisfactorily implemented the key elements of the public
financial improvement plan agreed under SAC 1, including: enhanced reconciliations, reduction in
suspense accounts, progressive closure of off-budget accounts, up-gradation o f DAOs, embracing and
talung advantage o f PIFRA computerization, appointment of the Provincial Financial Coordinator (PFC)
as the focal person for FM reforms, operationalization of an effective Parliamentary Public Accounts
Committee (PAC), and creation of DGDistrict Audits. Following is a brief description of the progress to
date onkey elements o fthe Public Financial Management (PFM) andprocurement reforms.

(a) Improving Accounting and instituting computerizationof accountingsystems

55.      Progress to date. Reconciliation of receipts and expenditures continues to improve, increasing
from 50-60% a few years ago to the current level o f 90% for receipts and 93% for expenditures. Currently
90% of transactions in suspense accounts and 85% in inter-governmental accounts are reconciled as
against 80% and 84%, respectively, inFY03. The provincial government is progressively closing all off-
budgetaccounts includingPLAs and Assignment Accounts.

56.      Adoption of the New Accounting Model (NAM)and computerization of govemment accounting
system will have a positive impact on the reliability and timeliness of provincial accounts. The PIFRA
supported computerized accounting system (NAM, SAP W3)i s being implemented and the 4 positioned
pilot sites (includingthe AG & AGPR offices) are operating in live production mode. The NWFP i s by
far the most advancedprovince inthe implementationof the PIFRA project.

57.      Future Challenges. Like in other provinces inPakistan, NWFP's primary challenge would be
the adoption of a methodical and comprehensive accounts reconciliation framework and strengthened
internal control systems to improve the reliability and accuracy of its financial data and timely
reconciliation. The government should aim for preparing the provincial budget for FY05 on the basis of
the New Accounting Model, using the New Chart of Accounts (indicative SAC3 trigger). Real time
comprehensive reconciliation framework will be designed under PIFRA-2 and implemented in 2006/07,
through interfacingbetween the AGs/DAOs, SBP, NBP, and CBR.

(b) Institutional reforms

58.      Progress to date. A number of institutional reforms have been undertaken to improve public
financial accountability. NWFP was the first province to appoint a Provincial Finance Controller as the
focal person for fiscal, financial management and procurement aspects of the NWFP reform program. It
was also the first province to adopt a Provincial Financial Accountability Assessment (PFAA) which
included a detailed time bound financial management improvement program. Implementation of the
PFAA reform agenda will continue through the next four years.          Internal Audit units were initially
established in four main provincial Departments ( Health, Education, Police, and Public Works); now
Internal Auditors have beennotified in 19provincial departments.

59.      FutureChallenges. The systematic institution of internal auditing function inall provincial and
devolveddistrict departmentswould further support the reduction of high-cost systemic errors which have
tended to result in undesirable financial leakages. Under the aegis of PIFRA, an Internal Audit Manual
has been produced for implementation in federal government departments through a methodical roll-out.
As part of the finalized NWFPPFAA consistent with the CFAA, NWFP should institute proper Internal
Audit units in all provincial government departments by March 2006, and initiate the progressive
introductionof the function at the district level

                                   Box 1: The New ProcurementLaw inNWFP

 NWFP is the first govenunent (including Federal and Provincial) inthe country to pass a Procurement Law on
  December 29, 2003. This law builds on the earlier Procurement Ordinance passed in May 2002. The new
  Procurement law would simplify and consolidate the procurement procedures based on national and
  international best practice; shorten time for public procurement with clear timelines o f each activity; make the
  public procurement system more transparent, cost effective and, more competitive compared to earlier laws,
  andreduce fiduciaryrisks. Compared to previous public procurement procedures, the salient features o fthe new
  procurement law are: the evaluation criteria have to be given upfront inbidding documents; the recording of
  procurement proceedings in writing has been made mandatory; the practice o f negotiating with the lowest
  bidder which led to discretion ofpublic officials handling procurement has been abolished; intimation o f award
  of contract has to be given to each bidder to finalize the proceedings, and the unsuccessful bidder has been
  given the right o f redressal through a review process. The Procurement law would be applicable to public
  procurement at all levels o f government (Provincial and District), which would cover at least 3-4% of the
  provincial GDP. It is likely to have a positive impact on small and medium enterprises because the bidding
  system has beenmade more accessible for SMEs. The new Procurement law is also likely to encourage hitherto
  unregistered or undocumented vendors to come into the tax net by getting a National Tax Number and the Sales
  Tax Numberbecause these documents are required to be eligible vendors. The new procurement law and other
  measures to improve public financial management indicate the commitment o f the NWFP government to
  establish clean and accountable financial governance inthe province.


(c) Improving Parliamentary Oversightand Accountability

60.      Progressto date.InJanuary 2003 the NWFPProvincialAssembly established a Public Accounts
Committee (PAC), the first inthe country. The PAC has reviewed public accounts o f 1998/99and would
begin with accounts o f recent years in the next session. The PAC sessions were open to the press
indirectly through the release o f daily summary by the Public Relations Officer. No PAC in Palustan,
including the NWFPPAC, allows the public and the media to sit inthe sessions at this point intime.

61.      Future Challenges. Fundamental challenges include the clearing o f the backlog and timely
review o f audit reports and accounts by the reconstituted PAC; enforcement o f PAC recommendations;
strengthening of the capacity o f the PAC Secretariat to be able to provide meaningful administrative
support to the PAC; and ensuring that the audit reports and accounts o f the districts are reviewed by the
District Accounts Committees (DAC) under the devolved district government framework.

(d) Procurement reforms

62.      Progress to date. Continuingwith its lead on procurement reforms by passing a Procurement
Ordinance in M a y 2002, the GoNWFP passed a new Procurement Law for goods, works and services,
which was approved and notified in November 2003; standard biddingdocuments for goods, works and
services have been adopted, based on the model o f the Pakistan Engineering Council, and notified by the
Department o f Planning. Departments have already been instructedto follow the Rules and the standard
biddingdocument formats, andwork has begunto institutionalizethe procurement training program.

63.      Future Challenges. The achievement o f milestones in the passing o f the Procurement Law as
well as the promulgation of rules and biddingprocesses and documentation i s one good step inthe right
direction; the judicious implementation and enforcement of the L a w and the rules is another cogent area
that confronts the province in its drive towards achieving the desirable outcome. NWFP's challenge is,
therefore, to actualize the reforms established under the agenda through capacity buildingand compliance
strategies. Complaints resolution mechanisms should be devised under an institutional arrangement as is
being introducedunder the Federal Procurement Agency.




                                                           18

          Pillar Three: Human Development -Service Delivery Improvement Reforms

64.       The reformprogramhas a strong focus on human development (HD). Provincial implementation
of HD related reforms i s fully consistent with reaching the national MDG targets and the nationwide
PRSP spending targets. Historically there has been a certain disparitybetween this and larger (and more
affluent) provinces with regard to public provision of basic health and education services as reflected in
the less favorable human development indicators for NWFP. The NWFP SAC sets out to accelerate
human development in the province and to some extent enable it to reduce the disparity using a two-
pronged strategy: (i)      reforming the institutions and incentive/accountability structures for social service
provision to improve service delivery, quality and the effectiveness of such spending, and (ii)                enable the
province to expand its spending inthese areas through concessional IDA financing (and also by revenue
mobilization and other reforms to increase fiscal space as discussed in the fiscal section) to improve
access to basic public services. It is envisaged that these reforms will contribute to productivity growth,
increase equity, and reduce poverty. The central focus of these reforms has been to strengthen public
health and education delivery systems and to devolve responsibilities to expand access to these services,
with a focus onprimary service delivery.

(0      Education Sector Reforms

65.        In education, the GoNWFP's medium-term objectives are to: (i)                    improve access to primary
education (enrollment) and its quality; (ii)       reduce gender and rural-urban disparities; and (iii) the    expand
capacity at the secondary school level for continuing education beyondprimary level.

66.        Inthe short-term, the GoNWFP aimedto redeployhire teachers to bringthe teacher studentratio
to 1:40 in primary schools and also rationalize staff and faculty in secondary schools; provide basic
facilities in all primary schools over three years; allocating 70% of the ADP for grls schools; create a
district cadre for teachers and do all new hiring on facility-based contacts; create a separate teaching and
management cadre to improve both these functions, establish Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and to
channel funds for instructional materials and minor school repairs (IM&R) in primary schools through
them; encourage public-private partnerships, and improve the education quality by a province-wide
assessment system.

(a)     Improving access and gender disparity in education

67.        Progress to date. The new government i s committed to continuing with the Education Sector
Reform Program and has taken new initiatives: it has exempted fees in government schools upto
secondary level, and has initiatedprovision o f free textbooks in government schools up to primary level
(first  to girls then to boys)18. There are plans to make education compulsory up to class 8 and institute
penalties for parents who do not send their children to public schools (since schooling and textbooks are
now free). It is expected that these initiatives would help improve access to education for girls' by
motivating very poor parents to send their g r l s to schools. As part of the Institutional Reforms Program
inthe EducationSector, alarge number ofgirls' schools were providedbasic fa~ilities'~.The government
plansto increasethe number of secondary schools by 10%duringFY04, focusing on girls' education.




     The government allocated Rs 100 million for the provision of free textbooks, which is inadequate to provide books to all
government primary school children.Hence, duringFY04, free textbooks would be providedat the beginning of the school year
inApril 2004, first to girlsandthento boysupto at leastclass11.
    Including boundary walls (90% of the targetedprojectscompletedby FY03), latrines (96% of the targeted projectscompleted
by FY03), constructionof additional class rooms (50% of the targeted projects completedby FY03), and water supply (64% of
thetargetedprojectscompletedbyFY03).



                                                             19

68.     Future Challenges. The Government needs to continue to provide missing facilities to all
remaining girls' schools; continue with the program o f free distribution to textbooks to all primary
schools at the start o f the school year (in April); increase the number o f secondary schools by 5% to
encourage completion o fprimary education.


               Box 2: EducationSectorReformTargetsFY04-FY06and Achievementsto date

   m   Development budget allocations on school education increasedby71% from Rs 1244.5 million inFY03
       to Rs 2279.6 millioninFY04. Development spending on education is targeted to increase by an
       additional amount o fRs.4.3 billioninFY04 -FY06 compared to FY03.
       Spending share on girls' education raised to 81% during FY03 against targeted 70%. A 70% spending
       share on girls' education will be maintained.
       Close to 85% o f girls' schools were provided with missing facilities during FY03. Target i s to provide
       100%o f girls' schools with missing facilities by FY04.
       Gross Enrollment Rate rose from 70% in2001 to 73% in2003*. It is targeted to go up to 85% (84% for
       girls) by 2006.
   m   Drop-out rate decreasedfrom 45% in2001to 43% in2003*. It is targeted to decreaseto 35% by 2006.
   m   PTAs are functional inall primary schools. Itis targeted to make PTAs functional in 100%o f middle
       andhighschools by 2006.
    m  2,350 teachers(1,500 female) recruited on school specific contract duringFY03; additional positions of
       4,000 teacherscreated for recruitment during FY04. During FY04-FY06, the objective is to recruit

 (b) Improving qual& of education

69.      Progress to date: The government created a district cadre o f education staff after Devolution and
has recently announced new recruitment rules to reduce teacher absenteeism*'.                     The targeted teacher-
student ratio has been raised from 1:40 to 1:30, which requires an additional 12,200 teachers. Around
2,350 teachers were recruited (including 1500 female teachers) in FY03 to overcome staff shortages in
girls schools and another 4,000 are expected to be recruited inFY04. Separate teaching and management
cadres were notified in September 2003 (the latter i s meant to establish a professional school managerial
cadre). Rules have been framed to regulate the two cadres, and the cadres would be made functional
during FY04. The School and Literacy Department met the target o f training at least one teacher per
primary school (around 40% o f all teachers) and all district managers have been trained in management
skills and financial procedures. A comprehensive Institutional Reform program was approved and has
been revised. The government approved a program, for periodic student assessment, which has been
piloted in selected schools o f two districts intwo subjects for grade 4, and has started to mainstream and
modernize Madrassas (religious schools).

70.      Future Challenges. The Government needs to continue with its district-based recruitment rules;
complete the program for teacher rationalization, separation o f teaching and management cadres, and
implementation o f the teacher monitoring and communication system with full funding; appoint 4,000

*'The government has recently set up a new criteria where innew recruitments 75% o fteachers will be recruited from the Union
Councilinwhich they reside and the remaining 25% from the district.

teachers on school specific contracts againstpositions createdinFY04; revise and update the Institutional
reform program according to needs; continue with teacher training and expand the system o f student
assessments. Institutional and management reforms comprising bifurcation of the provincial education
department into lower and higherlevel education were undertaken

(c) Increase significantly the budgetaryallocationfor education

71.        Progress to date. Necessary inputs in terms of budget, creation of new positions and actual
recruitment are in place. Education spending registered a rapid but still sound increase of 45 % fi-om
FY02 to FY03". Expenditures were reallocated toward primary and secondary education and vocational
training (including teacher training). The GoNWFP overshot the target of providing 70% of the
development funds for girls' schools by rather spending 81%. User charges from higher education -
historically very low - were increased by 14              - 30% during FY03. Also in FY04 the education sector
budget hasbeen adequately funded along the parametersofthe MTBF.

72.        Future Challenges: Continued provision of MTBF programmed fundingto the education sector
including for IM&Rand EMISi s important. A key future challenge when all staff and budgetshave been
devolved to district governments i s that the high priority for education be reflected in the district
governments' Budgets and other related actions. Other challenges include enhancing the district
governments' capacity to spend the higher education budgets efficiently, the timely release o f IM&R
funds andimprovedtransparency andaccountability intheir use.

(d) Encouragingpublic-private partnerships and community involvement

73.        Progress to date. The Government has initiated a number o f measures to encourage private
secto?',    such as use of unoccupied government buildings for establishing schools; allowed the private
sector to publish and print textbooks; established a Frontier Education Foundation (FEF) and an
Elementary Education Foundation (EEF) -- two autonomous bodies that would promote tertiary and
elementary education, respectively, in the private sect^?^; strengthened PTAs in almost all 20,000
primary schools and started providing them IM&R funds that PTAs are now using for minor school
repairs. The PTAs would become more important in the future as they become involved in other
activities, such as monitoring and reporting on teacher absenteeism. The government has also deregulated
the publication of textbooks for grades 1-12.

74.         Future Challenges: Activate PTAs inmiddle and highschools with authority to monitor teacher
attendance and to spend IM&R funds; continue to expand public-private partnerships using vacant
government buildings and operating evening classes; continuing with the textbook deregulation policy
and the role o f the FEFand EEFto promote private sector ineducation.

 (e) Strengthening monitoring and supervisory mechanisms

 75.        Progressto date. Duringits first year inoffice, the new government has taken disciplinary action
 against 773 absentee teachers24,which has sent clear governance signals to teachers although the number



21   ReachingRs. 12.7 billion. Development expenditureswere 0.2 billion inFY02 risingto 1.5 billion inFY03.
 "OveralltheroleofNGOsintheeducationsectorisquitelimitedinNWFP.Theroleofprivatesectorinprovisionofeducation
 i s growing in urban and semi-urbanareas as in the rest ofPakistan, but since NWFP i s largelyrural the privatesector role i s less

 23 The FEFhasestablished 14 girls' colleges andplansto providescholarshipsfor girls inhighereducation.
 24  141 teachers were reported absent during FY03 and another 632 cases have been filed during the first half of 2003. The
 teachers have been penalizedby deductingtheir salary for the days they were absent, stoppingtheir annual increment or by the
 initiation of an inquiry againstthem.



                                                               21

of cases i s small relative to the large-scale absence. It i s strengtheningmonitoring o f teacher attendance
bytaking actions onthe monthly reports filed bythe ExecutiveDevelopment Officers (Education). Itwill
pilot a more expanded role for the PTAs in monitoring teacher attendance in Peshawar District during
FY04, with the possibility of extending this to other districts. In addition, the Education Management
Information System (EMIS) has been devolved to the district level to improve monitoring and
supervision. EMISwill be fully funded inthe regular budget. The government's facility specific contract
recruitment policy i s also expected to reduce teacher absenteeism. Information technology (IT) tools are
increasingly beingusedto improve M&E. A Website has been set up for the Directorate of Schools and
Literacy (DoSL), which has improved access of important documents to the public, and all district
departments have been linkedwith e-mail.

76.      Future Challenges: The Institutional Reform Unit in the DoSL needs to be made functional
(staffingandbudget allocation) to effectively monitor and evaluate the reforms. Baselines and targets for
reducing teacher absenteeismneed to be established and then achieved through close monitoring, and to
take appropriate and prompt actions on PTAs' reports on teacher absenteeism.

03 Education Outcomes

77.      While current education sector outcome indicators from independent surveys are not available,
progress inreform implementationand input and intermediate indicators give a strong indication that the
underlyingprogressis s~bstantial.~~s expectedthat the above goals for outcomes willbe achieved.
                                            It i

78.      Future Challenges: While progress has beenmade inenrollment, the medium-term targets (85%
overall GER and 84% GER for girls) are unlikely to be achieved unless a special enrollment increase
campaign i s launched to bringmore children inprimary schools. To meet this challenge, the DoSL plans
to set enrollment and other monitoring targets for each school and district, to reach 100% GER by 2015
with a comprehensive motivational campaign including involving religious leaders.

(g) Religious schools -madrassahs

79.      Madrassahs are an old institution in Pakistan for imparting free religious education outside the
public education system. Various estimates indicate that there are approximately 10,000 madrassahs in
Palustan (about 1,500 in NWFP) with total enrolment nationwide between 510% o f total public and
private enrolment (700,000 to 1.5 million, grades 1-16). The spreado f madrassaheducation appearsto be
related to the extent o f poverty; poor public education and lack of employability o f general education
graduates; and state patronage of madrassahs during the period of the Afghan `jehad' in the 1980s.
Madrassahsprovide free room, board and clothing to the pupilsinaddition to the free religious education,
and seemto provide a credible safety net to poor families, especially inrural andpoorer urban areas.

80.       The government has taken three major steps to regulate the madrassahs: (i) August 2001, GoPIn
passed the Model Deeni Madrassah Ordinance. The aim o f the Ordinance i s to bring the religious
institutions into the main stream through incentives such as funding, teacher training, computers and free
textbooks; (ii) an effort to curtail foreign fundingand foreign students, the Voluntary Registrationand
                   In
Regulation Ordinance was passed in 2002; (iii)            in2002, Madrassah Reform was included inthe Federal
Government's Education Sector Reform Action Plan with financing for the establishment of model
Madrassahs, and approval was given in early 2004 o f a five year project to mainstream madrassah
education by supporting approximately 8,000 madrassahs in the country. Government support will be

25 As mentioned earlier, at this point in time an assessment o f progress in the health and education sectors based on outcome
indicators in independent surveys such as the PIHS can only be based on data up to 2001102 (the most recent data available). The
next PIHS and the first Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire are scheduled for 2004/05.



                                                              22

provided to those madrassahs that integrate religious education with standard curricula o f formal
education so that 700,000 - 1.5 million madrassahstudentsreceive formal education.

81.       Progress on the Government's program for reforming the madrassahshas been perceived to be
slow because of associated political difficulties. However, recently the federal Education Minister has
said that over 4,000 madrassahshave come forward for registration.

82.       The Bank's support in this difficult area is aligned with the Government's efforts to fix public
service delivery and to improve public private partnerships in the broader education sector.                            It is
anticipated that over time the madrassahoption would become less attractive for poor families when there
are visible improvements and reforms in the quality and access o f public education as well as expansion
of low cost private education and NGO schools supportedby govemment programs.

(io Health Sector Reforms

83.       The Government's strategy, prepared in consultation with the stakeholders, comprises of
management and organizational reforms; programmatic reforms; and increasing financial allocations. The
reforms aim to significantly improve health indicators in the province over the medium term by: (i)
improving the management structure and buildingdistrict management capacity; (ii)                       reorganizing health
facilities, with a multi-level referral system; (iii)focusing on preventive and primary health care; (iv)
removing obvious gaps in facilities; (v) increasing budgetary allocations; (vi) and increasing reliance on
the private sector with adequate regulation. Major actions in these areas include: establish a health
management cadre, create a district cadre for health workers and future hiring on facility-specific
contracts; increasemanagementand financial authority to tertiary hospitals; create additional positions for
female nurses; expand the immunization program with GAVI support; expand coverage o f TB Control
using DOTS strategy; and higher budget allocations for the health sector over the medium term. The
provincial govemment will also expand the number of Lady Health Workers to improve access to family
planningandprimary healthcare. While the Department of Healthcontinues to promote partnerships with
the private andNGO sector, the role of the private sector inthe provision of health services inNWFP has
been limitedmainly to curative services and NGOs have mainly been involved inprimary health case and
reproductive health services largely related to Afghan refugees. The medium-term health strategy
envisages a stronger emphasis on public private partnerships, and besides the existing partnership, use of
NGOs to provide services inthe enhancedHIV efforts and TB control.26

(a) StrengtheningCommunicableDisease Control and Maternal Health Programs

84.       Progress to date. The health sector reforms have done well in implementing programmatic
reform areas such as expanding TB DOTS, increasing neo-natal tetanus coverage, and improving access
to family planning and primary health care services by the expansion of the LHW program. The TB
DOTS program has expanded from 10to 17 districts inNWFP (there are 24 districts inthe province), as
targeted. By March2004, the population coverage had increased from 20 to 60%. The immunizationrate
of children has increased from 54% to 57%. Hepatitis B vaccination has been introduced across the
province and neonatal tetanus campaigns completed in all high risk districts increasing coverage of
pregnant women from 34% to 39%. The polio campaign i s on track with 42% reductioninthe number of
new cases inthe last three years. The programmoved slowly untilthe GAVI-supported EPIprogramwas
approved (with delay). The program has made functional 15 new centers in FY03 and will fill gaps in
manpower, cold chain, enhancing managerial support to the districts, and expanding social mobilization
activities and opening new EPIcenters.


26While the Department o f Health continues to promote partnerships with the private and NGO sector, the role o f the private
sector in the provision o f health services in NWFP has been limited mainly to out-patient and curative services and NGOs have
mainly been involved inprimary health case and reproductive health services largely related to Afghanrefugees.

             Immunization coverage o f pregnant women (two doses of TT) increased from 34% to 39% by
            December 2003. Coverage o f 50% is targeted by 2006.
             The number o f polio caseshave decreased from 57 in2000 to 33 in2003. There will be `0' cases

has given administrative approval for the Enhanced HIV/AIDS programwhich aims to prevent HNfrom
becoming established in vulnerable populations and spreading to the general adult population, while
avoiding stigmatization".

86.      The LHWs program made good progress by improving access to family planning and primary
healthcare services, specially women and children. The number o f LHWs was expanded from 7,800 to
10,255 by March 2004 and coverage of mothers and children inrural areas increased from 37% to 50%,
as planned. Another 261 are under training and 2,500 LHWs are expected to be recruited in FY04.
Stronger program management has ensured that L H W s are now being paid salaries on time and explicit
hiringcriteria are enforced with involvement of local councilors and community and improved quality of
supervision. The medium-termhealth strategy envisages improved access to family planning and primary
healthcare, implementationof a community midwiferyprogramand upgradation of district hospitals.

using LHWs as treatment observers and introduction of DOTS strategy in teaching hospitals and the
privateNG0 sector. The government also aims at hiring2500 new LHWs to reach 13,000 by April 2005.
It also aims to improve coverage of the EPIprogram for mothers and children to achieve immunization
coverage o f 65% by utilizingLHWs for vaccination, create 50 new centers inFY05 and 337 new centers
over the next five years. With slow progress and continued focus on supply side interventions, it i s critical
that the immunizationprogrampilots demand side interventions to assist families inthe form o f vouchers
or cashtransfers to families to improve immunization coverage inpoorly performing districts.

(b) TheHealth Care and Hospital System Management Reforms

88.      Progress to date. The Department o f Health was restructured in line with the Devolution
initiative with a substantive shift o f staff and resources, and significant delegation of administrative and
financial  powers to the districts. Good progress was made to build capacity of District Managers with
training in planning and budget formulation.          A management cadre was created, and the separate
male/female cadres o f doctors were merged. A Health Sector Reform unit was established to strengthen
capacity for planning and monitoring the reformprocess. All tertiary hospitals have been given financial
and administrative autonomy with the aim o f achieving financial self-sufficiency in three years, and a
study has been initiated to protect access o f the poor through safety nets. To ease the critical shortage of
nurses and improve quality o f care at the district and sub-district hospitals, 420 posts were created as part
of the rationalizationprogram and 281trained nurses have already beenrecruited. An additional 130posts
are to be filled during FY04/05. Rationalization and standardization o f District Headquarters Hospitals
have been initiated in 17 districts. The implementationprogress was slow but has started to pick up.The
institutional reforms to improve district health care so that district health facilities can treat more non-
serious or non-urgent cases, have resulted in seven district hospitals being upgraded to A level with
capability in 24 medical specialties.         Facility specific contracts have been introduced to reduce
absenteeismz8. Long-term plan for health sector reform was developed and approved. Strengthening o f
monitoring and evaluation has started to pick up with third party validation survey contracted out. The
results would be used to undertake analysis o f health system performance by districts and public
dissemination of the results. In addition, resources are being provided through recurrent budget for
strengthening o f Health Management Information system.                 The Department continues to promote
partnerships with the private and NGO sector. Besides the existing partnership, the Department envisages
use o f NGOs inthe enhanced HIV efforts and TB control to provide a package o f services for vulnerable
populations and TB patients.

89.       Future Challenges: Effective reform implementation with buy in o f all stakeholders is the key
challenge.      This necessitates preparation o f detail plans, on-going consultations and coordination,
especially with District Governments. Another significant challenge for the provincial government is to
enhance accountability by further strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems, undertaking health
systems performance assessment, and provide support to districts to ensure effective implementation. A
critical area for the Department i s to build district health systems capacity in terms o f management,
financial   management and planning. In addition, the government needs to move beyond the current
approach of adhoc public private partnerships in the sector and develop clearly defined policy framework
and standard operating procedures andprotocols as envisaged inthe mediumterm strategy.

(c) Increased allocations for health sector

90.       Progress to date. The health sector expenditures have continued to increase rapidly in recent
years in line with the MTBF and still at a sound pace. Overall (actual) health spending was 7% o f total
provincial spending in FY03 and 40% higher than FY02 spending. Utilization o f funds fell short o f
budget allocation^^^ due to devolution-related delays in releases for non-salary expenditures in districts
duringthe first half of the year, vacancies o f staff specially at the district level, capacity constraints, and
time taken for preparation and approval o fnew schemes. The FY04 Budget allocated Rs 3,654 million for
the health sector - in line with the MTBF and 22% higher than the FY03 actual expenditures. The FY04
allocation for development programs has been increasedfrom 5.8% inFY03 to 6.5 % o fthe total ADP.




28 The govemment has taken note of absenteeism in the health sector and action has been taken against 15 doctors and 15
paramedicsduringFY03.
29 Actual recurrentanddevelopment spendingwas 74% and53%, respectively, ofthe FY03 Budgetallocations.



                                                        25

91.       Future Challenges: The Department o f Health has been focusing on increasing its investment
and ensuring that resources are well targeted. The challenge for the Department is to prepare a realistic
implementation plan for long term development and ensure effective implementation. Inaddition, it will
be essential that Department invests resources on key priorities e.g. phased introduction of Integrated
Management o f Childhood Illnesses; slulled birth attendants program; universal salt iodization program;
hepatitis B and C prevention program buildingessential drug program in all districts; and strengthening
capacity of district health systems byenhancing staff slulls for effective implementation.

92.       Health Outcomes: Data on health outcomes for 20021'03, which would be important to evaluate
outcomes under the SAC, are not yet available. However, there are indications that health outcomes may
be improving in NWFP. The Pakistan Integrated Household Survey 2001/02 indicates health
improvements in NWFP from the 1998/98 survey, with decreasing infant mortality, increasing
immunization coverage and contraceptive use, although the improvements are very gradual. Infant
mortality has declined by about 5 percentage points and immunization coverage o f children aged 12-23
months has increased by about 3 percentagepoints (54 to 57 percent). The percent of the populationwith
access to TB control using daily observation therapy (DOTS) has increased from 20 to 60. Population
with access to safe drinlung water was unchanged at 58 percent at the latest estimate (it i s 63 percent
according to MICS). There are concernsthat slow improvement inhealthcare delivery system may not be
able to meet the targeted improvements inhealth indicators by 2005. The government i s aware o f these
problems and has indicatedits commitment to try and achieve the targeted outcomes.

          Pillar Four: Governance and Civil Service Reforms

93.       The previous government had launched a very ambitious governance and civil service reform
agenda inthe areas of devolution, personnel management, and capacity buildingwith the objectives of (i)
improving the capacity to deliver on NWFP's poverty reduction and economic development challenges,
and (ii)   enhancing the motivation (via better incentives, slull upgrading, etc.) to deliver better public
services. However, being an unelected govemment appointed by the military government in Pakistan it
had little accountability to the end users and there was limitedownership of these reforms. The advantage
of the MMA government i s that it carries that mandate of the people. However, it works within the
constraints of democracy andwith a number o f coalitionpartners. A major demand facing the government
i s to improve social service delivery. There are other demands to increase public sector employment to
absorb a sizable number of the educatedunemployed. Notwithstanding these "demands o f democracy" -
fairly typical o f elected governments inPalustan-the new govemment has done quite well on improving
both the capacity and motivation to deliver on the objectives o f the governance and civil service reform
program. There has been relatively good progress and no deterioration in any area within the scope o f
civil service reforms. A key issue ahead for the Government i s to ensure that the composition and
managemento f the civil service i s adequate to increaseand improve service provision as targeted.

 94.      The government's vision i s to contain the size of the civil service, increasing posts and/or hiring
mainly inhighpriority areas (education, healthand police). An important element i s to maintainmerit and
transparency innew recruitment, postings and transfers, as part of its overall strategy for being a "clean"
 government that is accountable and accessible to the electorate. To implement the strategy, the new
 government has been quitejudicious inincreasing the number o f sanctioned positions. These have mainly
been in education, health and the police where the government has also been careful not to expand
 employment beyond what the budget can bear.              30 The Government has lifted the freeze on recruitment to
vacant positions other than teachers, healthpersonnel and police (inplace for the past 7 years), primarily

 30For instance, although there is aneed to hire about 12,000 teachers, only 4,000 teachers are plannedto be hired during FY04
 due to budgetary constraints. Similarly, although additional 29,000 policemen are needed in NWFP to fully implement the
 reforms under the Access to Justice program, the increased sanctioned posts in FY04 and FY05 are half of that. Furthermore,
 only 5,000 additionalpolicemenare expectedto berecruitedinFY04 becauseofbudgetarylimits.



                                                               26

because it had become a bottleneck for service delivery with an expanding population. The impact on the
wage bill o f increasing sanctioned posts and lifting the freeze on employment can be accommodated
within a sustainable fiscal framework (see Paragraph 104).

95.       The government's vision on maintaining merit in public sector employment is also visible in
practice. Whereas the Federal and some Provincial Governments have removed the authority of the
autonomous Provincial Public Service Commission for recruitment to grades 11-16, the Government of
" F P has maintained the PPSC's authority o f in this area in spite of the huge pressures to create civil
service jobs. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the new recruitments in education, health and the police
have largely been on merit.3'Initial steps have been taken to lessen recruitment delays, increase tenure,
and respond to actuarial liabilities. There were complaints of excessive and out-of-turn postings and
transfers within the bureaucracy immediately after the new government came into power. This i s a
phenomenon that has accompanied transitions from military to political government and with changes o f
political governments inPalustan and hence was not particular to NWFP. The government addressedthis
problem by issuing a notification that allowed postings and transfers to take place only in March (for
teachers) and in July (for all other workers) and also setting up a Special Committee on Postings and
Transfers inthe ProvincialAssembly to hear complaints and make recommendations.

96.       On devolution, the previous NWFP government shared the federal government's vision of
achieving three important objectives: a) reform o f entrenched political structures by introducing new
blood into politics and to improve accountability of politicians by the electorate; b) improve the delivery
o f public services with a special emphasis on social services; and c) to improve access to justice for
common people by improving performance of local administration, courts and police. The main MMA
coalition party - Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam - boycotted the 2000/01 local government elections, mainly
because it had reservations regarding the new system o f devolved govemment. Initially lack of political
alignment led to significant political tension between the MMA-ledprovincial government and the local
governments, which slowed down improvements in service delivery. However, this political tension has
now eased with the passage of the Legal Framework Order (LFO) that provides constitutional cover to
Local Governments, and the MMA's agreement with the Federal government to support the LFO in
Parliament. It i s expected that the MMA would field candidates in the local government elections in
August 2005. Improved political alignment and better worlung relationships between the provincial and
local govemment would go a longway inimplementing the original objectives of devolution.

97.       Followingis a brief overview o f the status of governance and civil service reforms in each area -
devolution, personnel management, and capacity building.

98.       Progressto date. Administrative devolutionhas been somewhatpatchy, although there are some
signs of promising work. The province took the lead in implementing administrative and operational
aspects of devolution of power including fully devolving 12 Provincial Departments to the districts,
placing 200,000 out o f 280,000 provincial employees in districts. It has set up a special cadre of district
employees inthe Education andHealth Departments to ensure effective control (hiringand firing powers)
and improve provision of social services3' including devolution of the recruitment authority o f teachers to
district governments. However, progress on transferring staff to the districts was somewhat patchy,
largely due to delays in transferring the staffing budgets, but this is likely to be ameliorated from the


31Newspaper articles indicate that the first batch o f police recruitments were "most transparent and merit-based"..Health   sector
personnel that were recruited on temporary contracts last year to save time due to recruitment delays have been asked to appear
before the PPSC to renew their contracts for an additional three years. There have been almost no reports o f lack o f transparency
and political patronage in recruitment o fnew teachers.
32 The staff in BPS 1-15 would be recruited from the district on the recommendation o f a District Recruitment Committee
(comprising provincial and district officials). Postings and transfers o f these functionaries would be within the district; and
district authorities would be able to take disciplinary actions against these employees.



                                                                  27

FY05 Budget when the province will transfer the salary budgets to the districts. There have been other
problems partly due to the incomplete design o f the devolution such as inconsistencies concerning the
cut-off point for the district cadres and the purview o f the PPSC, issues related to transferring
responsibility for performance and career management of district-based staff, and provincial interference
indistrict affairs, especially inintra-districtpostingandtransfer of staff.

99.      Other measures taken to institute administrative devolution included transferring the district
budgeting and most other non-policy functions to the districts; preparing district rules of business
notifyinglocal government contract rules and establishing district accounts; setting up DisputeResolution
Committees at the sub-district levels and as per the Local Government Ordinance; and constituting a
Local Government Commission (LGC) to oversee the worlung of local governments and to help in
conflict resolution. Rules and regulations governing personnel management which had become
excessively complicated and opaque over time have beenrewrittenand simplified ina new Establishment
Code (Estacode) and Volume One of the Code has been published. Although there were teething
problems, the Government has made efforts to institute administrative devolution in the province.
However, the lack of political alignment and coordination between the District and Provincial
governments has been an issue in NWFP which has meant that there has been limited progress in
implementingthe devolution o fpower inits true letter and spirit.

100.      Future Devolution Challenges: (i)            Reassigning the provincial administered functions to local
governments, particularly including PHED;33 (ii)Ensure that inconsistencies with devolution are
removedby reviewingthe NWFP Civil Service Act of 1974, the District Government Rules of Business,
and the constitution of the Local Government Commission and make them consistent with the District
Service Rules. This would also include review of the facilities and authorities (financial, technical and
settlement) provided to the local government monitoring committee and local government staff to
incorporate the early lessons of experience.                    (iii)Where possible, some provincial-local tax
reassignments, such as the possible devolution of AIT to the districts should be explored and some pilot
testing established. (iv) Completion of the transfer of staff to the districts. This has two aspects. First,
the risk, over the medium term as recruitment authority i s transferred to the districts, that this does not
result in over-hiring in local government, or inrecruitment in low-priority (non-PRSP) areas, absorbing
the fiscal space with unnecessary staff. This i s not an immediate concern as the province will maintain
controls on hiring in local government            - but  ultimately this must be faced. Second, the districts must
become unambiguously the employers of their own staff - possibly, when feasible, through creating a
Local Government Career Service (LGCS). Table 5 lays out the possible staff categories who can be part
o f a future District Career Service.

101.      Steps intransferring responsibility for managing the LGCS to the districts:


0    Full control over the salary budget for the LGCS would be passed to the district immediately -
     allowing for local determination of the size and compositionof the district workforce.
0    PFC transfers to the districts would initially be based on 2003/4 staffing figures, recognizing that it i s
     difficult for districts to rectify historic disparities indistrict employment inthe short term.
0    PFC transfers to the districts for salaries would move incrementally towards a formula-based transfer
     within 5 years, that allowed for employment levels based on similar per capita ratios, with some
     allowance for the diseconomies faced by small districts and by remote rural districts.



33NWFP has recentralized PHED. Initially, PHED had been devolved to the district, not TMA, level. However, in May 2003,
the provincial government divided the province into six circles, each headed by a Superintending Engineer (SE) o f W&S
department, a newly established post with jurisdiction over 4-5 districts. A Circle is an administrative division (for technical
departments such as PHED with authority over scheme identification and Technical Sanction power) that clusters several districts
together. These circles now have responsibility for water and sanitation services.



                                                               28

e    Districts that can not reduce staffing through attrition to that allowed for in the NFC awards after 5
     years wouldbe offered the option oftransferring unwantedstaff to a provincial surplus pool.
e    In the short term, the province would maintain restrictions on the total headcount, while allowing
     districts to determine staffing composition. Within one year, provinces would relinquish control over
     the district establishments completely, with discipline exercised on district employment practices
     through PFC provisions that penalize districts for staffing beyondprovincial norms.

(ii) Personnel Management

102.           Progress to date. A number of measures were taken in 2001 to downsize and streamline
government departments and to improve accountability, merit and transparency in civil service.34
Consequently on the basis o f identifiedredundancies, over 6,000 employees were placedina surplus pool
between 2001 and 2003, most of whom have since been assigned to districts. Recruitment, promotion,
and transfer policies have been improved and the key institution managing them, the provincial Public
Service Commission (PSC), has been strengthened and made more autonomous, through appropriate
changes in its legislation and government's administrative and Financial Rules. The PSC remains l l l y
responsible for all recruitment of all officers o f grades BPS 17 and above, and certain staff inBPS 11-16
in order to make recruitment and promotion merit-based. The compulsory retirementrules have been
amended to facilitate retiring of redundant or incompetent officials. The first phase of the work in
compiling a centralized human resource database has been completed. The work on the second, final
phase of actual data collection and processing has been initiated and i s expected to be completed by
FY04/05.35 The HR database would improve workforce planning, traclung of sanctioned posts and
existing staff, identification o f ghosts workers, budget preparation, and facilitate actuarial analyses of
government pension liabilities.

103.           NWFP has gone considerably fwrther than a pilot contract-based employment scheme. All new
staff, with the exceptions o f police and the prisons departments and the judiciary, are to be recruited on
fixed term contract.36 This new policy i s a determined step, and offers some prospects of increasing
flexibility and limitingfuture pension liabilities butalso creates some risks.37

104.            Reform relatedneeds led to an increase inthe sanctioned posts of 9,000 teachers, health workers
and policemen at the beginning o f FY04, raising the total establishment size (Districts and Province) to



34 There are now 23 Departmentsand40 attachedDepartments(down from 46).
35 The consultancyfirms havebeenshort-listed, and financialandtechnicalbidswill be invited shortly.
36 All contractsare to be for 3 years minimum(unless the post itself is sanctioned for a shorter time). The terms and conditions
are identicalto those ofpermanentstaff, exceptthat the positionsare not pensionable.
37 Iti s veryprobablethat a future governmentwill regularizecontractstaff; contract extensionsmight be grantedautomatically,a
lowerthresholdmaybeappliedfor contract recruitments who may eventuallybecomepermanentstaff; futuregovernmentscould
usethe optionofnot renewingcontractsinorder to removepolitical opponentsfrom the service; andthe relativelymodestpublic
sector salaries coupled with the reduced attractiveness of a non-tenuredposition might make recruitment difficult. Currently
there are few defenses inplace againstthe misuseof contract postsandthe government shouldconsiderputtingthese inplace.



                                                                                                                             29

283,745 from a reported 274,261 inFY03. Iti s expectedthat another4,000 teachers and 5,000 policemen
would be added during the on-going or next fiscal year. Bank staff assesses that these positions are
necessary to meet the needs for additional public services in these areas and are also consistent with the
goals in the PRSP. The past ban on recruitment to categories other than teachers, health workers and
policemen affected 20 percent of the civil service. It was lifted in August 2003, as it had become a
bottleneck for efficiency in service delivery to meet rising demand by a rapidly growing population. The
scope for expanding the ranks by additional hiring against these vacancies is limited because there are
reportedly only about 2,000 such vacancies which amount to less than 1percent of the civil service.

105.     Future Challenges: (i)            Minimize the fiscal consequences from federally-determined salary
increases. The Government's strategy for the civil service i s to contain the expansion insanctioned posts
to less than 3 percent per year over the medium term (Le., in line with population growth). With salary
adjustments inline with the projected growth inprovincial per capita income this would contain the wage
bill at 4 percent of provincial GDP and below 38 percent of current spending over the medium term,
which is fully sustainable. A greater risk to the wage bill could come from the Federal Government if it
decides to give additional large across-the-board salary increasesinthe coming years, to which provincial
governments normally follow suit38.The government should therefore limit future increases in the
average salary to the growth inprovincial per capita income. Ideally, these salary increases should also
decompress the wage structure, which currently offers too few incentives for senior staff. (ii)                     Ensure
adequate composition and management of the civil service to achieve targeted provision o f highpriority
services. While the proposed NFC Award provides fiscal space for the planned medium-term expansion
inthe civil service, a key challenge will be to ensure that the composition and management of the civil
service is adequate to increaseand improve service provision as targeted, inparticular inthe highpriority
areas of health, education and law and order. The government's strategy for the civil service fully reflects
this view and gives priority to meetingthe needs for additional serviceprovision staff inthese areas.

106.      (iii) Adequate fiscal transfers. When salaries are transferred via account lV and become more
formula-based, the full responsibility for fundingthe wage bill within a constrained budget envelope will
fall to the districts althoughit is anticipated that the province will retaincontrol over the creation o f new
                       -
positions at the district level, and filling vacant positions inthe districts will require provincial sanction.
Hence, the PFC awards need to pass on sufficient funds from the NFC award to provide adequate fiscal
space for the districts to pay salaries and to fund their additional development and O&M responsibilities
inorder to, amongother things, enablethemto increaseandimprove social service provisionas targeted.

 107.     (iv) Tracking staff and career planning. The HR information system, currently under
development and to be computerized and put into operation in FY05, will be a crucial tool inworkforce
planning and inproviding early alerts of potential problems at the district level. The widespread use of
contract staffpresents a major challenge as it is not clear that a unifiedcareer service can be maintainedif
significant numbers of staff leave at the end of their contracted period. The use o f fvred term contracts as
a method for constraining the pension liabilities i s inappropriate and it i s to be hoped that the pension
scheme can be adjustedto managethe liabilities while allowing most staff to resume permanent positions.

 108.     (v) Further institutionalreforms. More rigorous enforcement of the Efficiency and Discipline
Rules which were amended by the NWFP Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance 2000 is
needed. Extension of PPCS oversight for grades 11-15 in district or devolved departments could also be
considered.


38 A scenario with a federal govemment initiated 15 percent across-the-board salary increase in FY05 followed by annual
increases in line with average per capita incomewould raise the wage bill to 4.4-4.5 percent of PGDP and to 43 percent of total
expenditures over the mediumterm. This would still be fiscally sustainablewithin the financial framework of the proposedNFC
award. However, the compositionof spendingwould then be skewed towards larger unit costs and less scope for expansionin
the volume ofservices-envisagedinthe PRSP-than inascenariowith salary increasesin line with per capitaincome.



                                                             30

109.     (vi) Managingactuarialliabilities. The province is considering a guaranteedannual capital
injectionto the Pension Fund(inadditionto the employees' contribution) and a full actuarial review of
pension liabilities. These would be useful steps inlimitingthe increasesinliabilities and indetermining
the mostpromising options for managing the liability inthe longer term.

(iii) CapacityBuilding

110.     Progressto date. Severalinstitutionalreforms and capacity buildingprograms were initiated as
part of the provincial reformsprogram. These include:

     The Essential Institutional Reform Operationalization Project (EIROP) funded by UNDP, SDC
     and GTZ, was initiated inMarch 2001 to assist with HRand institutional reform and support capacity
     building and training at the district level. EIROP undertook a number of activities for training of
     elected officials and staff, and has also undertaken a comprehensive needs analysis. The EIROP
     programand the ADB-fundedDecentralization Support Programwill provide further training.
     WithDFIDsupport, a training programwas launchedat district and lower levels; 60% o fthe elected
     local government officials, including nazims and councilors were trained inthe operation of the new
     local government system; orientation workshops on budget, revenues and accounts were conducted
     for senior district and TMA staff. InFY04, training would be provided to staff of the City Districts,
     TMAs and Union Councils. Training is also being provided to staff of the Local Government
     Commission, Monitoring Committees, CitizenCommunity Boards, and Public Safety Commissions.
     Review of capacity-building needs has been done in a report by a high-powered govemment
     Committee. Education and Health Sector Reforms Unit, the Budget Analysis Unit, and the overall
     SAC Coordination Unit have been established to help coordinate and implement provincial reforms.
     In addition, the government approved a comprehensive three-year capacity building program to
     strengthen the managerial and technical capacity o fprovincial and district officials.

 111.    A key challengeis ensuringadequatelocal government budgetand financial managementskills.

 112.    Governance and Civil Service Outcomes: The government has laid the groundwork for
improved professionalism and governance instate institutions. NWFP has movedtoward the objective o f
a decentralized administration with greater administrative autonomy at the district level. Rationalization
of staffing has also taken place in a number o f agencies and departments. With the increased
independence of PPSC for recruitment for grades 11 and above, it is expected that recruitment and
promotion will become more merit-based, and that the opportunity for corruption and misconduct will
diminish. There were frequent transfers of Secretaries and also of lower level staff in FY03, but
monitoring data suggests a significant improvement inthe average tenure of secretaries from 7.5 months
in September 2002 to 11.5 months by September 2003. Lengthenedtenures of civil service will promote
better management of institutions and greater accountability of upper level staff. After a slow start, there
has been good progress on the HRdatabase. The first phase of the work has been completed and work on
the second phase has begun. The eventual establishment of a civil service database would help eliminate
 "ghost" workers from payrolls and yield a more accurateestimate of the government pension liabilities.

         Pillar Five: Private Sector Development and Growth Oriented Reforms

 113.    The government's vision is to achieve sustainedpoverty reduction not only through accelerating
broad based economic growth but also with the private sector as the engine of this growth. This requires
 increased private investment; hence improving the investment climate i s central in the government's
 growth strategy. The provincial government's strategy to improve the investment climate i s
 complementary to the federal government's; however, the latter remains of paramount importance for the
investment climate in all provinces in Pakistan. The provincial government has developed strategies to



                                                     31

improve the investment climate, enhance productivity in agnculture and water use efficiency, reduce the
role o f the public sector in commercial and industrial activities, and promote public-private partnerships.
These reforms aim at (i)achieving better governance and developing stronger institutions, better
enforcement o f rule o f law, and control of corruption and crime; (ii)          improve regulatory structures for the
promotion o f a competitive private sector; (iii)        effective provision o f public services or o f the framework
for such services, and the quality o f the labor force; and (iv) improving the efficiency, quality and
availability o f the province's infrastructure, including water/ irrigation facilities, road and urban
infrastructure and services. While also important, the power and telecommunications sectors are mainly in
the federal government's purview.

114.      The Government has formulated a broad vision o f its strategy for economic development in the
PSD Policy Statement based on sound principles. Going forward the Government intends to follow up
with value chain analyses in 4-5 industries where NWFP has a comparative advantage, and a study o f
administrative barriers to businesses.              Based on specific recommendations in these studies the
Government will operationalize the broad strategy into action plans to be implemented starting this and
continuing over the medium term. The Govemment intends also to seek technical assistance from the
IFCLFIASto strengthenthe capacity o frelevant agencies for business development.

115.      Meanwhile the Government has moved on the following fronts: It has made good progress in
reducing the impediments to doing business and improving the business and investment climate by a
better law and order situation and by reducing the number o f government inspections3'. It has divested 12
out of the 13 public sector unitsestablished by the Sarhad DevelopmentAuthority (SDA);40 leased out or
completed biddingprocess for lease o f all remaining small hydel projects to the private sector; leased out
one fourth o f the 39 government mineral exploration and development industrial units; dissolved four
autonomous bodies; and retrenched staff o f autonomous bodies. It has integrated and merged government
agencies dealing with industry and mining; and amended Mining Concessions Rules to allow for
simplified procedures, entry o f small-scale businesses and clear policies on mininginthe Province. It has,
together with the private sector, initiated the development o f mechanisms for ongoing dialogue between
the Government and the private sector in order to address the issues, problem, constraints and
opportunities that the private sector faces. It has increased public investments in infrastructure that
increases private sector productivity (roads, irrigation etc). It has also set in motion the process o f
reorganizing the technical and vocational training institutes to ensure a market demand-driven focus in
training. Furthermore, it has developed an agricultural growth strategy, has created farm service centers in
24 districts and has increasingly put more emphasis on making credit available to SMEs and farmers fi-om
national andprovincial institutions through targeted credit and micro-credit schemes41.

 116.     However, in other areas o f PSD reforms progress has been somewhat mixed. The government
now plans to reduce the ownership in Bank o f Khyber (BOK)to 51% by December 2004 as opposed to
the previous government's commitment under SAC1 to retain a minority share o f 49%.42                            . Ithas also
progressed less than expected in refocusing the Sarhad Development Authority SDA, which primarily
manages public-sector owned industrial estates, to investment facilitation. It would also like to keep the
 Small Industries Development Board (SIDB) for its promotional role and as a provider o f technical
training and services. While one cannot at this stage claim that the business environment has improved
under the new govemment with the exception o f the improved law and order situation, it i s worth noting


39 From 23 to 13 industrial inspections per year and clubbing them into three/ four times a year carried out at times which are
convenient for the businesses.
40 The remaining unit is inthe process o fbeingprivatized.
41  Micro-credit disbursement by BOKand national level institutions to farmers and SMEs have increased in NWFP in recent
years. National commercial banks are also increasingly involved in lending to SMEs and the rural sector. However, access to
 credit remains a constraint to most farmers and SMEs.

that it has shown pragmatism and has kept a neutral policy stance with regard to the private sector,
contrary to initial fears among domestic and foreign observers.

                                                                        ~     ~~~    ~


                  Box 4: The provincial government's efforts to improve the law and order inNWFP

    NWFP bore the brunt o f the long drawn-out Afghan civil war during the 1980s and 1990s' which among other
    problems led to a rather poor law and order situation in the province, including smuggling, drug trafficking,
    violence relatedto politicalrivalry o f the Afghan factions inlarge refugee communities, and domestic sectarian
    violence. The previous government took actions to improve law and order inthe aftermath o f post September
    11 (2001) events and the ensuing war in Afghanistan. Controls were made more stringent on the Pakistan-
    Afghanistan border, numerous Al-Qaeda suspects were arrested; and for the first time the army took action
    against suspected Al-Qaeda elements in the Tribal Areas bordering NWFP. Improving the law and order
    situation is a top priority o f the current government, and it has taken a number o f actions in this regard to
    implement the Police Reforms andADB-supported Access to Justice Program as well as home-grown actions.

    The number o f serious crimes has already declined visibly in2002 and 2003: murder (-5%), attempted murder
    (-2%), rape (-12%), abduction (-12%), bank robberies, kidnapping (-18%), armed robbery (-24%), bank
    robbery (-50%)' assault (-24%), car lifting (-24%), and car snatching (-24%). A recent survey shows that
    NWFP ranked better than the rest o f the country on indicators o f public perception and satisfaction with law
         ...
    and order agencies including the police andjudiciary.   'Some  o fthe key findings o f the survey are:

             26% o f respondents in NWFP would use the police for a problem o f personal safety vs. 22% in
             Pakistan;
             36% inNWFP said that the police make them feel safe vs. 30% inPakistan;
             60% o f relevant respondents inNWFP (who had had a contact with police during the last five years)
             could get a First Information Report (FIR) registered vs. 49% inPakistan (getting an FIR registered
         .   for a police case is a major avenue o f police corruption and a critical hindrance in getting access to
             justice; inthis regard NWFP does muchbetter compared to other provinces inPakistan);
             40% o f respondentswith police contact inNWFP ratedthe service satisfactory vs. 31% inPakistan;
             49% o f respondentsinNWFP thought that the courts were there to helpthem vs. 46% inPakistan.

    The focus on improving law and order and making the police force and judiciary less corrupt and more
    accountable is likely to improve safety andthe overall investment climate inthe province.




 117.    Developing a dynamic private sector is a major challenge for NWFP. NWFP's investment
climate i s one o f the worst in the country according to analytical work undertaken by the Bank. Hence
improvingthe investment climate is the most important challenge for the government. It needs to raise
with the Federal government a range o f issues that have a bearing on the provincial investment climate,
among others, federal rules on trade through land routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia, federal
regulations that impact local businesses, the role o f special industrial zones, and hydel power
development. It also needs to implement measures to reduce provincial regulations and administrative
barriers based on recent and coming studies. It should also form a functional and dynamic Provincial
Privatization Committee that can privatize or wind-up a number of public assets that best belong in the
private-sector domain; ensure that BOKi s privatized by the scheduled time; increasingly include private
sector representatives on the Board o f Directors/Governors o f the remaining public sector entities and
with a view to hire Managing Directors from the private sector in coming years. It needs to specify a
detailed timebound action plan based on a number o f recent studies and with additional knowledge
buildingsupport from the WorldBank andmeetingmilestones inthisplanover the next year. One central
area i s improving trust and communications between the private sector and the Government, which
remains a major hurdle. There is a strong demand from within the business community, both domestic




                                                           33

and foreign, for a forum such as a formalizedBusiness-Government Dialogue Promotionmechanism43for
maintaining dialogue with Govemment and affecting change.

118.     Furthermore, enabling higher growth depends largely on the success in improving NWFP's
competitiveness. This would include raising productivity including through buildinghuman capital and
upgradinglabor skills. Inthis regard, the government should fully implementthe TEVTA (Technical and
Vocational Training Agency) Ordinance, ensure financial sustainability of this organization, and have
substantial representation o f the private sector on the Board. It should also review and improve labor
regulations and policies. Limitedavailability of project and runningfinances i s another impediment to the
growth of the private sector, particularly the potentially large SME sector inNWFP. The government can
provide support for capacity buildingto increase bankability of SME projects and consider setting up a
revolving SME Commercial Finance Fund with the help of donors to ease the strict credit constraints
against SMEs. Another challenge i s the need for forming good provincial policies for the development o f
sectors, which have a strong growth potential. Inthis regard, the government can play an important role
in defining clear and transparent policies for developing small hydel plants and improving the policy
environment for the miningand tourism sector.

(iv) Improvingproductivity of agriculture and water use efficiency.

119.      The government has developed a strategy for the agncultural sector that addresses the constraints
described in section IV, aiming at raising rural incomes and reducing rural vulnerability. While this is a
good beginning, an action plan based on a more detailed assessment of rural development needs and
priorities would have to be developed, including a focus on the livestock sub-sector, the horticulture
industry,water and irrigation, andrural financial services. Withregard to rain-fedapculture, the strategy
includes: water harvesting; embankment of fields; improved tillage practices; introduction o f crop
varieties requiring less water; and introduction o f water-saving irrigation systems like drip and sprinkle
irrigation for plants and crop production. On water, decentralization o f the Provincial Irrigation
Department by having        (1) an autonomous Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authority that control, own
and have responsibility for constructing, operating and maintaining part of the intra-provincial iriigation
and drainage infrastructure; (ii)a financially self-accounting quasi-autonomous Area Water Board
(AWB) that control, own or lease the parts f infrastructure and drainage infrastructure on each canal
commands currently known as "circles",                 and (iii)fully autonomous farmer organizations (FOs)
established at the distributary or minor level owned and controlled by farmers i s what is envisaged. It is
envisaged that these reforms would result in enhanced maintenance o f canals; strengthening farmers'
organizations to self-regulate local water distribution systems. Combined with effective information and
extension services, this will create an environment conducive to farmers adopting new farming practices
and switching to crops with higher value addedrelative to the water requirement.

 120.    Historically, the only channels for credit to agriculture in the province were the NWFP
Provincial Cooperative Bank and Agriculture Development Bank of Palustan (ADBP). Over time the loan
portfolio these banks accrued a large share o f non-performing loans in their portfolios. The Provincial
Cooperative Bank in NWFP has now ceased its operations, as have the ones in Sindh and Balochistan.
The ADBP has recently been restructured as the Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited, and a new Board o f
Directors consisting of private sector representatives well versed in farming from all the four provinces
has been formed and empowered to carry out the neededreforms. The State Bank of Palustan has taken
the lead on addressingthe issue of lack of credit to small farmers through new nationwide policies rather
than specifically by the provincial government. Commodity financing - so far the exclusive domain o f the


~~




43The principalobjective o f this mechanism is to improve the ability o f the private sector, foreign and domestic, large and small,
formal and informal, to inform Govemment in a constructive way about constraints on their activities, their ideas for growing
their own businesses and the economy, and to discuss various technical and economic sector issues.



                                                              34

public sector - has been opened up to the private sector and at the same rate o f financing,l2 percent p.a.
The SBP has also allowed banks the facility o f revolving credit to small and subsistence farmers with the
limit on credit against personal securitiesraised from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 100,000. As a result o fthe above
measures, credit to small farmers has increased more rapidly than to larger farfners in the last few years
and credit extended by privatebanks to farmers now exceeds credit from public banks.

121.    While there has been progress in some areas o f the strategy, the government will also need to
expand and deepen actions inthe following areas: (i)   improve the efficiency and targeting o fpublic sector
expenditure programs to policy goals, (ii)     reorient expenditure programs in support of well defined
development priorities and reduce establishment costs, and (iii)   encourage much greater private sector
investment inagnculture and promotion of market development and o fexports.

122.    Future Challenges. (a) Public-private partnerships are needed to foster rural growth and
employment creation. High impact areas include (i)social mobilization to increase community
participation in development programs (farmer organizations, forest user groups, commodity grower
associations, etc.); (ii)
                        specialized market analysis especially for products with an export potential; (iii)
more efficient marketing and reduction o f post-harvest losses through further strengthening o f the market
information system, and provision o f specialized infrastructure for cold storage, packagmg and grading
(in conjunction with the private sector and grower associations); (b)strengthening human and physical
capacity in the responsible agencies to monitor and enforce product quality and food safety standards
(e.g., pesticide residues, quality o f pesticides and fertilizers); (c) operational support for priority
technology development and dissemination, with results based funding; and expanding the Farm Service
Centers to the Tehsil and union council level; (d) development and implementation of a comprehensive
approach to water conservation including groundwater recharge, range-land and watershed management,
and efficient and environmentally sound water use; and (e) re-aligningpublic expenditure withpriorities
ident8ed in theAgriculture Strategy.

C. Monitoring and Evaluation

Fiscal monitoring:

 123.    Progress to date:The provincial government has improved its monitoring o f key fiscal indicators
and the social sector expenditures. The GoNWFP reports to the Bank the consolidated fiscal deficit, with
details o f revenues, current and development expenditures for the provincial and district governments
separately. This system produced quarterly reports during FY03 but with inadequate and incomplete data
reported by the newly-established District governments. There have also been data problems and delays
incompilation ofthe quarterly report inFYOkxpectedto betemporary-related              to the PIFRA roll-out
during FY04 as accounts during the transition are maintained on both the old and the New Accounting
Model. The reporting has recently been improved to include Province and District quarterly data also on
Educationand Health (salary, non-salary and development) spending.

 124.    Future Challenges: ensure timely, consolidated fiscal data and improve the accuracy o f the
reporting, particularly from Districts and on social sector expenditures; enhance capacity for fiscal
monitoring andregular updatingo fthe MTBFinthe government.

Monitoring and Evaluation of the Development Program:

 125.    Progress to date: The Planning and Development (P&D) Department monitors physical and
financial progress in implementation o f the development projects as well as their quality. This includes
quarterly review meetings. P&D's Monitoring and Evaluation Directorate undertakes quality checks on
physical infrastructure and on-site inspections o f projects which cost above Rs 40 million but due to



                                                     35

severe capacity constraints it can cover at best 30-50 schemes ina year compared to about 1000 schemes
inthe revisedFY04ADP. Inaddition, line Departments cany out internal M&Eand on-site inspections.
M&E can be fuiher strengthened with a higher budget allocation and improved processes and
procedures.

126.    Future Challenges:First, improve processing of ADP projects to incorporate criteria o f need,
adequacy, transparency, and financial sustainability. Second, provide more staff and staff with varied
skills to ensure adequate M&E and improve coverage of projects. Third, define a set o f indicators that
monitor the poverty and social impact ofprojects andnot only the physical infrastructure.

Monitoring of poverty and socialindicators

127.     Monitoring performance along a core set of poverty and social indicators across districts within
NWFP as well as across provinces is closely linked to the nationwide monitoring plan outlined in
Palustan's PRSP. This requires data sources that are reliable, with uniformity o f measures, comparable
across provinces and over time as well as available at regular intervals. Hence, the comprehensive system
o f survey and non-survey tools applicable for the country as a whole also provides the monitoring
framework for NWFP. With the progress o f devolution, the availability o f district level data to monitor
performance and informpolicymaking has grown inimportance for all provinces. Thus it has also become
increasingly importantto develop data sourcesfor district level indicators at a nationwide level.

128.     Monitoring in the context of national level efforts: A comprehensive system of surveys has
existed inPakistan for monitoring poverty and social indicators disaggregated by gender and ruralhrban
regions -at the nationallevel, and for all provinces. This includes a multi-purposehousehold survey -the
Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PMS) that i s the primary source for key poverty and social
indicators -and a Labor Force Survey (LFS), both conducted at regular intervals of time.

129.     Progress to date: Since the I-PRSP, significant progress has been made in identifying the gaps
that existed in the monitoring system, particularly in monitoring the impact o f service delivery inputs,
with the objective of providing timely feedback to policymakers. A collaborative process conducted
during 2002, involving federal and provincial line ministries, donors, and civil society, resulted in the
selection of appropriate monitorable outcome and intermediate/output indicators for all provinces - as
articulated clearly in the PRSP. Moreover, since with devolution the accountability for delivery of
services inhealth and education has largely shiftedto local governments, many o f these indicators would
have to bemeasuredat the district level inorder to be useful for informing policy decisions.

 130.    Data sources identified for intermediate indicators include the Educationand HealthManagement
Information Systems (EMIS and HMIS). Considerable doubts however remain about the quality of
administrative data reported by implementing agencies - especially for quality and performance
indicators like attendance o f teacherhealth personnel, student attendance rates and enrollments.
Accordingly, the PRSP clearly outlines the Government's intention to rely increasingly on independent
monitoring surveys. Since existing sources are not sufficient to provide these indicators at the district
level, an annual survey based on the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) has beenplanned for
tracking intermediate indicators at the district level for all provinces. The indicators to be monitored are
related to households' access, usage and satisfaction with public services, and quality of services at the
facility level (e.g. the presence of teachers at classrooms or that of health staff at basic health clinics). A
pilot o f this survey covering around 1000 households spread among all 4 major provinces has been
successfully completed in November 2003. This provides useful guidelines for implementing the lSt
round of the full CWIQ, planned for April-September 2004, with the results for all provinces becoming
available withintwo months o f completion o fthe survey.




                                                       36

131.     Future Challenges: The biggest challenge in monitoring social sector and poverty outcomes is
the timely availability and accuracy of monitoring instruments, in particular the CWIQ survey and the
PMS where the GoNWFP would largely dependon progress inthe nationwide implementation, but it can
play a role inguidingthe debate and improving the instruments basedon its ownneeds. Implementingthe
CWIQ survey and institutionalizing it on an annual cycle will provide a valuable database to complement
the comprehensive information on outcome indicators in poverty and human development currently
available at the provincial level from the PIHS. The next round o f PMS i s expected to be launched in
August 2004, with the national and provincial results becoming available in 2005-06. The PMS is
expected to be conducted once every three years - a frequency that i s appropriate for trachng changes in
outcomes in poverty and human development that are relatively slow to change. The CWIQ will be
conducted on an annual basis, coordinated with the PMS such that (subsequent to the lst      round) it would
not be conducted duringthe years when the PMS would be undertaken. The system o f national surveys -
o f which the PMS and the CWIQ are the most important components - will form the primary source of
data on poverty and social indicators for NWFP. This will include outcome indicators that are useful for
tracking progress inpoverty reduction and social development -includinggender gaps inachievements -
as well as intermediate indicators that are importantto monitor the short-term impacts o fpolicy reforms.

132.      Province-specific efforts: Inaddition to the national level plans described above, a few province-
level initiatives have occurred in NWFP. The Multi Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), developed by
UNICEF, was conducted in NWFP in 2001. While the MICS provides some district level outcome
indicators ineducation and health, it has limiteduse inmonitoring district performance: firstly, the survey
will only be conducted every five years; secondly, there are some questions about its reliability since the
surveyors were primarily government service providers; and thirdly, the average per-district sample size
i s not large enough for reliable data on relatively infrequent occurrences like infant and childmortality.

133.      Although the PIHS and CWIQ would constitute the mainstay of the monitoring system, since
information from these may not be available for some time, in the mean time EMIS and HMIS can be
used to monitor a set of few intermediate indicators (e.g. utilization rates o f first level health care
facilities, availability of basic amenities and facilities in schools, and stocks of drugs and availability of
contraceptives in health facilities).    Given the doubts about the quality of this data, this information
should however be validated against district level aggregates from CWIQ surveys, when these become
available. Moreover, in order for the MIS to be a reliable monitoring tool for even a select set of
indicators, it will be critical to improve the quality o f such information.

 134.     At the level of the province, some efforts inthis direction have been initiated. The government
has undertaken measures to strengthen its management information systems in health and education
(HMIS and EMIS) to better track progress in implementation of its programs inthese sectors and take
remedial actions. Both management information systems will now be fully funded inthe regular budget.
District governments will compile and send monthly MIS reports to the provincial government for
aggregation and analysis. Also, ThirdParty Validation (TPV) surveys to measure satisfaction with public
health and education services by users are being prpepared. The TPVs are expected to be completed by
June 2004. While the indicators they measure are similar to some o f the information collectedby CWIQ,
they would beusefulinthe interveningperiodbefore the results from the latter become available.

 135.     Future Challenges:At the local level, the GoNWFPshoulduse the comingTPVs as performance
audits inbasic education and healthsectors and ensure that they provide good information.

Monitoringofimplementationofthe overall SACprogram:

 136.     Progressto date:The government conducted monthly reviews ofprogress of the SAC programin
meetings chaired by the Senior Minister during the latter half o f FY03. These were supplemented by



                                                        37

monthly Departmental review meetings in the Education, Health and Work and Services Departments
chaired by the respective Minister or Secretary, and the quarterly P&D review of the development
program chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary. These monthly meetings were instrumental in
ensuring adequate implementation of the SAC program last year. The government will continue with
detailed quarterly review of the SAC program duringFY04.

137.    Key future challenges include improving and intra-governmental coordination o f SAC
implementation, and ensuringa stronger role for the Education and Health Sector Reform Units.


                           VI. BANK'S ASSISTANCE FORNWFP'SREFORMS

138.    Overview.         The Bank's current assistance strategy in NWFP i s guided by the Pakistan CAS,
which was discussedby the ExecutiveBoard on June 24, 2002 and reaffirmedby the draft CAS Progress
Report to be discussed by the Board in April 2004. Highlighting three strategic principles of (i)                   client
"pull" and selectivity; (ii)    adoption of a programmatic approach; and (iii) on partnerships, the
                                                                                          reliance
CAS emphasizes assisting those provinces which have embarked upon a comprehensive fiscal and
economic reform program, have built credible track records on implementation and have sought the
Bank's assistance. All three strategic principles are applicable to the proposed operation. NWFP has a
comprehensive medium-term reform program that includes fiscal, governance and economic reform
components. The government has high ownership of and strong commitment to continued reforms. The
Senior Minister i s the key champion of reform and there is a core group of capable reform leaders within
the administration. Together with donors such as DFID, the Bankhas a strongpartnership withNWFP.

139.    Bank support.          The Bank's wider program of support to NWFP covers both lendingand non-
lending activities. The Bank initiated in 2002 a program of three single tranche Structural Adjustment
Credits over the period FY03-05 to provide performance-based budget support to enable the province to
restore financial equilibriumwhile undertakmg its Provincial Reform Program. The first o f these credits
for NWFP was approved in early FY03 for the amount of US$90 million. The following are ongoing
Bank projects in NWFP:           (1) the NWFP On Farm Water Management Project (US$21 million IDA),
which i s helping to reduce water losses and implement farmer managed irrigations system44;and (ii)
NWFP Community Infrastructure Project I1(US$42 million IDA), which supports community driven
small infrastructure schemes. The province also receives support from the Bank through several
nationwide or multi-province operations: these include (iii)the rehabilitation o f the drainage
infrastructure through the country-wide National Drainage Program (NWFP's share i s around US$20
million IDA), (iv) Pahstan Poverty Alleviation Fund 11, (v) HIV/AIDS Prevention Project, (vi)
Partnership for Polio Eradication Project, and (vii) Protected Areas Management Project (GEF). Reform
policies in the NWFP On Farm Water Management Project and the National Drainage Program are
integrated into the policy design of the proposed SAC2 and follow on operation. The proposed SAC2 i s
also complementary to the Bank's proposed PRSC credit insupport o f the nationalPRSP policies.

 140.    Analytic and advisory services.               Notwithstanding the broad reform program and the solid
progress to date, the Government has emphasized the needto deepen its analytic understandingo f further
policy and institutional reform agendas and to establish an analytic foundation for formulating reform
strategies in emerging priority areas.            Knowledge partnerships and public consultation are seen as
essential for ensuring a strong reform program with broad public support. The analytxal base has been
strengthened considerably with the following recently completed reports: NWFP GrowthPotential Study,
PSD study, PSD and Economic Growth Strategy paper, Agricultural Strategy paper, Reform of AIT and


44This project will close in 2006. In line with the Federal Government's new strategy for borrowing fiom the World Bank the
Governmentwill notrequestto renew it.



                                                              38

Land Tax in NWFP, Tax Potential in NWFP, and Reform o f Tax Administration in NWFP, fiscal and
public expenditure policy note, poverty assessment policy note, a provincial financial accountability
assessment for NWFP, an economic growth strategy note, and the proceedings from a WDR 2004
workshop in Peshawar with a wide range o f stakeholders, focusing on how the province can improve
service delivery to the poor. The findings have beenutilized inthe policy design for the current operation,
in most cases confirming the original program design envisaged at the time of SAC1 approval, and
utilized even more for the policy design in future years. However, additional analytical work i s required
to strengthen the knowledge base and future policy design, inparticular analytical work on the provincial
economy.

141.     The Bank i s assisting the Government o f NWFP in developing a core set of phase IIanalytical
activities with the objective o f expanding the reform agenda through knowledge partnerships with the
Bank and with a network o f academic and donor supported initiatives. Elements o f additional Bank AAA
services include developing and refining a medium-term strategy for private sector development and pro-
poor growth, both urban and rural; and studies to support continued reforms to improve delivery of public
services -inparticular social services to empower the poor; devolution arrangements bothon the revenue
and expenditure side; and public expenditure management. Related Bank ESW in the pipeline is among
others the nationwide rural factor markets study with a bearing on provincial policies. The GoNWFP has
initiated work on estimating provincial GDP (expected completion in 2004), and it plans to publish an
annual Economic Survey o fNWFP along the lines o fthe Federal Government's Economic Survey.

142.     Knowledge initiatives inthe broader network o f academic institutions and donors that might take
place over the medium term include DFID-supported work on improving financial management and
govemance in education and health, and AsDB-supported analytical work on the transport sector in
NWFP and - under AsDB's Devolution support program - a survey to assess revenue potential of Local
Governments and a study on unit cost of service delivery.

143.     The Bank foresees possible technical assistance in cooperation with donors in the following
areas: inpublic expenditure management and budgeting where DFID i s interested inproviding technical
assistance in performance budgeting, in civil service reform with assistance in completing the
computerization o f the Human Resource Management Database, and in the area of administrative
devolution with assistance to district governments to buildHuman Resource management capacity as the
district governments gradually assume full responsibility for staffing.

 144.    GoNWFP will first need to substantially strengthen its capacity for policy formulation to ensure
that well crafted departmental policy proposals, together with their financial implications, are submitted
for cabinet review and discussion duringbudget formulation. The government has shown interest inthese
issues but given the limited capacity in the departments for analytical work, it has not been able to make
much progress as yet. As part o f the Bank's future engagement, it will discuss the possibility of
establishing a Policy Reform Committee, chaired by the Finance Secretary, to provide leadership and
focus to key capacity-enhancing reforms. This will rely on a network o f public and private institutions to
undertake public policy research and analysis. An appropriately staffed cell o f the Finance Department
would develop and maintainthe network relationship with institutions.


                                       VII. THE PROPOSEDCREDIT

 145.    The proposed NWFP SAC 2 is the second operation ina series o f three planned SACSto NWFP.
The choice o f instrument is based on the multi-sector and crosscutting nature of the multi-year Provincial
Reform Program. Many o f the reform efforts and expected outcomes are system-wide, cross-cutting (such
as improved govemance affecting service delivery in education, health and other areas, and fiscal



                                                    39

reforms) and with synergy effects.              These outcomes would better be achieved through Structural
Adjustment Credits rather than sector specific adjustment loans. The SAC 2 supports the PRP through a
disbursement to the Government o f Pakistan o f US$90 million (IDA) with the Rupee equivalent being

146.      The NWFP SACSsupport the implementation o f the govemment's medium-term reformprogram
over the period FY02 - FY05. The detailed government program, progress to date and outcomes being
sought are provided in Annex A. Within the context o f this overall policy fkamework, the SACS are
designed to focus on a number o f core reform areas that are considered critical to the success o f the
overall program. The proposed SAC2 i s based on the progress on the indicative triggers that were
documented in NWFP SAC1.45 This progress is summarized in Box 5. A more detailed account o f
progress i s provided in the paragraphs referred to in Box 5. Annex D compares the wording o f the
original indicative triggers for the follow-on operation in the SAC1 Board document and in cases where
the wording differs, a trigger i s dropped or a new trigger added, it explains why.

147.      All upfront actions for SAC 2 havebeencompleted.

B. Loadcreditadministration

148.      Fundsflow arrangementsfor the loadcredit are as follows. The funds flowing fromthe NWFP
SAC2 will be disbursed to the Borrower (GoP) under the IDA'S simplified transfer mechanism for
adjustment operations. The Government o f Pakistan has established a Special Deposit Account with the
State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) into which the proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed on a single tranche
basis. The Rupees equivalent o f the funds in the Account will, automatically, be transferred into the
Consolidated Fund(Account No.1 won-food)) o f the Govemment o fNWFPheld with the SBP.

149.      Procurement. Disbursements from the Consolidated Account No.1 (Non-food)                                 by the
Govemment o f NWFP shall not be linked to any specific purchases and no special procurement
requirement shall be needed. The proceeds o f the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance
expenditures inthe negative list as defined         inthe Schedule ofthe DevelopmentCredit Agreement. Ifany
portion o f the Credit i s used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule o f the
Development Credit Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to reimburse the amount to the
Special Deposit Account to finance eligible expenditures or refund the amount to the IDA.

150.      AuditingRequirements for the Credit. The SBP, on behalf o f the Govemment, shall maintain
an appropriate accounting system in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles. The
Bank may request an audit to be carried out, with a view to providing a `special opinion' as to the receipt
o f funds into the special deposit account and the eventual transfer of the local currency equivalent o f such
funds into the ConsolidatedFundAccount o fthe Government o fNWFP.

151.      Financialaccountability environment. As discussed above (paragraphs 56-62), NWFP is ahead
o f other provinces and the federal government with regardto reforms inpublic financial management and
procurement. The recently completed Provincial Financial Accountability Assessment provides an in
depth analysis o f the strengths and weaknesses of the financial control environment in the Provincial
Government. Its assessment is that the system inplace does provide reasonable safeguards for reliance on
Govemment financial accountability systems to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended.

45 Iti s worth noting that these milestoneswere indicative. In some cases milestones havebeenmodified (details on changes are
provided in Annex 2). In most cases this has tended to raise the bar, e.g., in education sector reform, public financial
management, andfiscal andadministrativedevolution.



                                                               40

       152.     Environment Aspects. The environmental safeguard OD 4.01 does not apply, and the policy
      measures supported by the Credit are not expectedto have a direct negative impact onthe environment.

       C. Performancemonitoring and evaluation arrangements

       153.     The NWFP SAC2 design gives heavy emphasis to monitoringto enable learning and feedback for
       the reform program. It will draw on data and findings from a range o f sources to monitor progress on
       social indicators, public service delivery and fiscal implementation. These include the government's
       annual Education Management Information System (EMIS) reports and Health Management Information
       System (HMIS)reports, ThirdParty Validation surveys for education and health (including public service
       delivery), monthlyreports on teacher absenteeismprovidedbyEducationDistrict Officers (EDOs),

                     VIII. FUTURENWFPADJUSTMENTLENDINGOPERATIONS

154.       Assuming continued successful reform performance as measured by its pace and depth, it is
expectedthat the Bank will process one more adjustment operation to NWFP after NWFP SAC2 inFY06.
The total amount of adjustment lending to NWFP fiom the three SAC operations would be US$ 270
million. The overall objective o f NWFP SAC3 i s to consolidate and extend progress in core parts o f the
government's PW, such as fiscal and govemance reform, human development through a focus on school
education and provision of basic health services, and private sector development. Indicative triggers for
SAC3 are presentedinBox 5.

155.       Notwithstanding the progress made to date, the development challenges that NWFP faces are
considerable and would require sustained reforms over the long term. Looking forward, the range and
scope of NWFP's reform agenda could merit additional adjustment lending to the province beyond the
third SAC operation. Sincethe thrust ofthe provincial reformprogramis closely alignedwith the core of
a PRSC, further adjustment lendingoperations could possibly be inthe form of a provincial PRSC.



                                                                      43

                           IX. LESSONSLEARNT,BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Lessons

156.    The current operation benefits from several important lessons drawn from NWFP's first policy
based lending program as well as that o f Sindh province and wider experience with adjustment lending.
Experience has shown the usefulness o f a series o f single-tranche adjustment operations to support fiscal
and governancereforms at the provincial level inPakistan ina well-identified multi-year framework.

157.    A policy based lendingprogramis more likely to succeedwhen there is strong ownership by
the government. The new government quickly adopted the homegrown PRF' and has in its one year in
power shown strong commitment and ownership o f the SAC-supported program. In spite o f no prior
experience ingoverning itrelatively quickly assumed effective leadership inimplementation.

158.    A strong dialogue between the Bank and the provincial government at the technical as well
as the cabinet level i s a key to success for a reform program. The increasingly strong policy dialogue
has also strengthened government ownership of the reform program further.

159.     The policy dialogue has included sound analytical work to support the lending program.
The body o f knowledge on the province acquired through analytical work has increased substantially
during the SACS. Due diligence policy notes have been prepared on a variety o f topics including fiscal
sustainability, public expenditure composition and management, public financial accountability, growth,
and poverty. Other reports include studies on the province's growth potential, PSD, tax potential,
agrlculturalincome tax and the national devolution study with highrelevance for NWFP.

160.     Improving fiscal sustainability and composition of expenditure must be accompanied by
improved expenditure management and service delivery to raise the effectiveness of spending.

161.     Fiscal improvement alone i s not sufficient without a complementary focus on economic
growth, the investment climate and humandevelopment.

162.     The SAC needs to show sensitivity to local political conditions. Sequencing and prioritization
of reforms, pace o f progress and achievement o f outcomes can be significantly affected by political
considerations. In NWFP the elections in 2002 changed the political landscape. The political reality
facing the current elected government i s different than under the previous government. The previous
freeze on recruitment to positions other than teachers, health personnel and police has been lifted which
leads to a limited expansion in the civil service. This does not pose any threat to fiscal sustainability and
i s being accommodated within the program.

163.     These lessons havebeenincorporated into the design o f the SAC, which has also demonstrated its
flexibility as a multi-year instrument.

B. Benefits

164.     Support for reform. Bank support for NWFP's reform program with a SAC2 i s an appropriate
response to the progress made by GoNWFP across the reform spectrum. These reforms have consolidated
gains achieved under SAC1,thereby reducing the risk o f reversing the reformcourse in spite o f change in
government in this period. The SAC can help further strengthen the ongoing reform process in the
province. The government has a determined strategy to reduce poverty, improve provision o f social and
other public services, improve social indicators and public sector governance, and provide better
employment prospects through broad based economic growth. Progress in these areas would be very
valuable in pullingthe province towards moderate social leanings. Ifthe government can be engaged at


                                                     44

this point and provided the resourcesneededfor service delivery and development -important issues for
the local electorate-that would helpreduce (or even eliminate) the riskofpolicyreversal to which a cash
starved government would be more prone. Reform progress in the province could also induce more
reform competition and learning across provinces inPakistan.

165.    Impact on poverty. GoNWFP's reform program supported by SACSwill help the province in
achieving better socioeconomic outcomes and reduce poverty: (i) credit would directly go for
                                                                          the
measures aimed at poverty reduction in a very poor province, includingboosting a social sector service
delivery system that provides greater access and better quality education, especially for girls, aiming at
narrowing rapidly the gender gap, and higher coverage of immunization and health programs; (ii)        the
program maintains a sustainable fiscal position subordinated to a medium-term framework             fiscal
restructuring will provide more resources for poverty reduction expenditures, improvement in the
procurement rules and financial management including transparency will increase economy and
effectiveness o f public expenditures; (iii) acceleration of economic growth led by the private sector
remains fundamental to poverty reduction. The reform strategy aims at revitalizing the private sector and
increasing trade, broad based economic growth and the private sector's role in service delivery.
Streamlining business regulations and improving infrastructure will improve the investment climate for
private sector development, benefiting in particular medium and small enterprises; (iv) institutional,
policy and processreforms to improve accountability, transparency and rule of law.

166.    Debt restructuring. The proceeds from the SAC credit are currently transferred by the
Government o f Pakistan to the province on IDA terms and with the federal government carrying the
exchangerate risk. Thus, the SAC2 providesthe Government of NWFP with relatively less expensive and
long-term funds, with which GoNWFP can substitute for more expensive types o f debt. The SAC2
proceeds thus benefit NWFP by improving its debt profile, lowering its interest burden, and thereby
creating more fiscal space for priority spending.

C. Risks

167.    Risks associatedwith the government's medium-term reform programinclude: (i)       political risks;
(ii) oflimitationsonreformimplementationcapacity;(iii) risks;and(iv)externalshocks.
    risks                                                         fiscal

168.     (i) Political risks. On the external front, spillover from the regional security situation, in
particular from Afghanistan and conflicts in the border area, could lead to rising opposition to the
government's reformprogram supported by the World Bank through a conditionality-based credit. Onthe
internal front, political dynamics within the province might pull the government in a more radical
direction. This could pose a challenge to its commitment to reforms. However, if anything, the new
government has shown it i s committed to broad areas of the reformprogramand i s expected to remain so.

 169.    (ii) Risks of limitations on reform implementation capacity exist. Experience so far shows that
weak implementationcapacity has at times delayed but importantly, not derailed, reform implementation.
The weak implementationcapacity is beingaddressedwith ongoing technical assistancefrom donors ina
numberofareas andcouldinclude technical assistancefrom the Bank.

170.     (iii) Fiscal risks. In light of recent signals that the proposed NFC award is likely to provide
additional fiscal space to the province the prospective fiscal risk over the mediumterm has to some extent
shifted from being a risk to overall fiscal sustainability more towards a risk o f not maintaining the
appropriate spending composition for achieving the goals of human development, facilitating growth and
poverty reduction. Lessjudicious use of public resources could lead to higher spending on lower priority
areas - both inthe composition of the civil service through rapid recruitment across the board as well as
the spending composition on goods and services and choice of development projects. While such an



                                                     45

expansion in spending would sow the seed in the near term, it would most likely only threaten overall
fiscal sustainability in the outer years (after 4-5 years) if also own provincial revenue collection or the
unpredictable flows o f hydel profits from WAPDA fall short o f MTBF targets. At that time the fiscal
adjustment would more likely be a squeeze on spending -possibly inthe provision o f high-priority social
services and ADP spending (including O&M) - than a ballooning deficit since the financing o f the latter
would be limited. Continued commitment to the MTBF and its path for high-priority expenditures and
overall deficits will be required to mitigate this risk. A low case scenario (see Annex C) built on the
assumption that there is no change in the current NFC revenue sharing arrangement and hence no
substantial increase in the revenues accruing to the province shows that the Provincial Government is
faced with tight constraints on spending already in the near term. This would make it very difficult to
expand as planned even the highpriority social spending and ADP. The curtailment inspending would in
particular affect discretionary spending which can be adjusted more flexibly. The low case scenario
shows clearly that maintaining the current revenue sharing arrangement with the provinces would not be
consistent with the national PRSP goals, progress towards the MDGs and the ongoing devolution
initiative where more spending is expected to be undertaken locally. Hence, consistency in policies and
revenue sharing arrangements for the Government o f Palustan to reach those goals does require a
substantial increase in provinces' share o f revenues, and through the PFCs, in local governments' share,
as i s assumed inthe fiscal baseline scenario.

171.     (iv) External shocks. Another major risk arises from the threat o f external shocks, either in the
national economy (impacting on resource transfers from the center and on own revenues), droughts that
affect the majority o f the population whose livelihood is linked to apculture, or the possibility o f
tensions along the borders disrupting normal commerce and possibly affect the political environment as
described above. To a limited extent increased emphasis on improved irrigation networks and water use
arrangements could mitigate the effect o f droughts but overall these are real risks with limited potential
for risk mitigation. These risks must be recognized and weighed inthe context o f potential benefits. The
impact on the provincial fiscal budget o f lower than projected growth - national and provincial - would
mainly be felt on the revenue side. The revenue shortfall would however most likely be substantially
lower than inthe low case mentionedabove and the expenditure adjustments would be more limited.

172.     Risks stemming from disengagement by the World Bank. As described inparagraph 32, the
government i s under considerable pressure to demonstrate changes while in office. If the Bank were to
disengage and the prospects o f future SACSwere waning, the Government would be at risk o f losing out
to political pressure that could sharply change the direction of policies. Key reforms could be halted and
possibly reversed, among others the current progress on devolution. N o w there i s good dialogue with the
government who has shown that it is receptive to World Bank advice and i s willing to pursue reforms. It
has made strong efforts to overcome its initial lack o f experience in governing and to implement SAC
reforms with the expectation that if it honors its part o f the deal, the Bank will come through with the
SAC2. It i s the assessment o f both Bank staff and the Government that reform progress i s sufficient to
merit the disbursement o f SAC2. Ifthe Bank were to not go ahead with the proposed credit, it would lose
credibility with the provincial government and it could take years to restore the dialogue. On balance the
relativerisks weigh heavily infavor o fproceeding with the proposedcredit.

 173.     Sustainability of reforms. Inlight o f the risks described above and the fact that NWFP faces a
large unfinishedreform agenda notwithstanding the progress made to date, a key question is: What i s the
likely sustainability o f reforms? There are several good reasons to believe that reforms are sustainable in
NWFPover the medium and longterm.

objectives such as expanding education, inparticular for girls, improving and expanding service delivery,
resolving fiscal issues and improving governance, law and order have been sharedby several generations
of governments and by the electorate. Because of demandby the civil society, these reforms are expected
to remain an important part of the reform agenda of any government inthe future.

175.    (ii)Mostimportant,thesereformshelpdeliveringvisibleandsignificantbenefitsontheground
through improved service delivery, public accountability, and greater transparency. It would be difficult
to reverse reforms as the public perceives that the situation is improving or if the reforms are explained
well. Efforts are being made to further develop the communications strategy for the reform program.
Overall the reform program becomes self-sustaining in that positive outcomes in terms o f growth and
human development contribute further to sustainability o fthe reforms.

176.    (iii)Severalreformsthathavebeentakenwouldbehardtoreverse:thesubstantialtransfer of
resources and authority to lower levels of government to improve accountability and service provision;
free education through secondary school; free textbooks through primary school and for poor through
middle school; procurement reforms such as enactment of the Procurement Law, malung bidding
transparent and use of standard documents and practices; and setting up institutions such as the
autonomous Provincial Public Service Commission, Provincial Financial Controller and Public Accounts
Committee with public dissemination of findings.

177.    The Bank's adjustment program also seeks to minimizethe risks to reform sustainability.
While the SACSgenerally support the medium-termreform program o f GoNWFP, the disbursement o f
each SAC i s contingent on progress made against a set of monitorable actions that were outlined in the
previous loan. SAC2 funding i s inrecognition o f GoNWFP's satisfactory completion of a set o f actions
that were outlined in SAC1. Loohng ahead, this SAC2 document outlines a similar set o f measures that
will underpin a decision to process a possible future loan. The prospect of receiving the third SAC
disbursement, which has a substantial effect on the province's fiscal space, i s a major incentive for the
government to complete the set of actions outlined inthis program document.

                               Letter ofDevelopmentPolicy

1.       NWFPisby far the poorest province o fPakistan with overall incidenceo fpoverty
at 44% is substantially higher than that for the country as a whole. Both urban and rural
poverty, indepth as well in severity, are relatively higher than that for the entire country.
Consistent with the poverty estimates, average per capita consumption expenditures are
also lower for NWFP vis a vis the rest o f the country. Poverty in NWFP is closely
associatedwith lack o f humancapital, measured by the education and literacy status, who
had to contend with the delivery o f poor quality public services in key social sectors o f
education, health, rural water supply and sanitation, and large deficits in the availability
o f infi-astructure inthe communication andrural development sectors.

2.       The Provincial Government in order to harness the rising levels o f poverty and
deficits in social indicators during the 1990s launched a far reaching Provincial Reforms
Program, developed through a series o f dialogue to redirect provincial government's
efforts towards reform and economic revival, in2001. The PRP places emphasis on fiscal
and financial management reforms, improvement o f social services delivery, governance
and devolution that are consistent with the overall objectives o f the Federal
Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy paper. The objectives o f this medium term
transformation program, for which the International Development Agency has shown
interest to support through provision o f three tranches o f US$ 90 million each, are
consistent with the reforms being undertaken by the Government o f Pakistan to stabilize
the economy on an even keel, reduce poverty and enable sustainable and more rapid
economic growth.

3.       Initiation o f the reforms program coincided with the commencement o f the
electioneering process for electing political governments at the federal level and in the
provinces that culminated in October 2002. The electorate retumed Muttahida Majlis-e-
h a 1 (MMA), a coalition o f religious parties, with majority to form government at the
provincial level. The provincial government i s committed to its declared manifesto o f

                                                                                   Annex A
                                                                                Page 3 of 16

reducing poverty by improving access to and quality o f education and health services,
reducing gender inequalities in the province, improving governance and reducing
corruption.

4.      Within one month o f taking office, the NWFP Cabinet started reviewing
programs initiated by the earlier government; the Provincial Reforms Program was
discussed in detail on January 21, 2003. The Cabinet expressed satisfaction with the
thrust o f the Program on the following four main pillars i.e. (i) reforms to create
                                                                    fiscal
fiscal space; (ii)public financial management reforms to improve governance in
budgeting and expenditure management; (iii)      reforms to improve service delivery inkey
sectors (especially basic social services); (iv) governance reforms to achieve an efficient,
accountable, and service oriented civil service; and (v) private sector development and
growth oriented reforms. The Government made a conscious decision to continue with
the implementationo fthe reformprogram.

Implementation of the Provincial Reforms Program

5.      A number o f external factors following the approval o f NWFP Structural
Adjustment Credit-1 (SAC 1) affected the pace o fprogram implementation. The elections
of October 2002 and the formation o f elected government delayed implementation o f the
agreed measures. Significant teething problems were faced as a result o f the devolution
process especially issues o f design o f the devolution itself, roles and responsibilities o f
district governments and capacity o f district government fimctionaries responsible for
improving service delivery, andplanningand implementing development initiatives.

6.      Subsequent to formation o f the elected government and after review o f the
reforms program by the Cabinet and its decisionto continue with it, the Cabinet formed a
team, under my leadership, to provide effective guidance to the reform program with the
task to steer the program on course and to recover the time lost. Other members o f the
team are the Ministers for Education and Health, and a core group o f provincial
Secretaries heading the reform implementing departments. The combined efforts o f the
team have translated inimproved and significant achievements inthe reform areas.

A.      Ensuring fiscal sustainability

7.      The province has in the recent years been forced to resort to expensive stop gap
borrowing as it derives only 10% o f its revenues from non-buoyant taxes, user charges
and other non tax receipts. For the other 90% the province is dependent on Federal
Government for vertical straight transfers, grants and net hydel profits. The
unpredictability o f net hydel profit transfers has ledto unplanned cuts inthe development
and essential O&M expenditures. To create fiscal space and curtail wastages for
sustaining the reform effort, government planned for early retirement o f expensive debts
and to enhance revenues through tax administration and policy reforms, improving
expenditure prioritization based on performance and projected needs for improved
service delivery, greater budgetary discipline and expenditure analysis,

                                                                                  Annex A
                                                                                Page 4 of 16

Actions Taken

8.      After identifying expensive Cash Development Loans obtained from Federal
Government with a rate o f return o f over 17% to finance development expenditures, Rs.
5.7 billion and Rs. 1.9 billion were retired in 2003 and 2004 respectively to create a
permanent fiscal space o fRs. 1.4billion.

9.      The provincial own revenues grew by 20% from FY02 to FY03. Revenue
mobilization has been strengthened through further tax reform, accelerating and
rationalizing user chargers, and improving tax administration. Tax reform measures
included reducing and restructuring provincial taxes; imposing an income-based
agricultural income tax to complement the province's land-based tax; and harmonization
of Motor Vehicle Tax rates with other provinces. User charges have been raised for
tertiary-level social services and irrigation water. Tax administration measures include
piloting the computerization o f land records; setting up a school for training Patwaris
(land appraisers) and transferring collection o f Abiana (irrigation surface fees) from
Revenue Department to the Irrigation Department i.e. the appraising department.

10.     The government has nearly finalized studies on tax policy and administration
(AIT restructuring, NWFP Tax Potential, and improving Tax Administration) that will
provide inputs for future improvements inprovincial revenue efforts. The final drafts o f
the studies were presented before the Cabinet for considering recommendations for
inclusion in the next budget. Cabinet has formed sub-committees headed by respective
Ministers to firm up proposals for consideration and approval o f the Cabinet and
inclusion in the next budget.The Cabinet before forming the sub-committees agreed to
adopt the recommendation: to provide logistic support to the Excise & Taxation Officers
before the commencement o f next financial year, and consider proposal for provision o f
motor bikes to supervisory staff in the FY 05 depending on the results achieved after
provision o fvehicles to ETOs.

Inadditiontheprovincial government hasapproved the following measures:

     a.     Pay as incentive a graduated reward o f up to 5% o f the revenue collections to
            staff assigned additional responsibilityo ftaduser charge collection;

    'b.     Open Tax Facilitation Centers in Mardan and Abbottabad with support from
            private sector for collection o f Motor Vehicle Tax, and to further consider
            transfer o f collection o f property tax on pilot basis to one o f the Tax
            Facilitation Centers.

     c.     Devolve O&M to 4 registered Farmer Organizations and transfer 40% o f
            abiana to the FO for the purpose on pilot basis in one o f the Area Water
            Boards.

Future Reforms

 11.    To keep the reforms process on track, budgetary allocations will be presented to
the Provincial Assembly in accordance with the agreed MTBF parameters, with

                                                                                    Annex A
                                                                                 Page 5 of 16

expenditure targets for social sectors, maintaining the ADP throw forward within
manageable limits and containing wage bills and pensions. Releases for development
initiatives in the social sectors will be made 100% upfront on approval o f the scheme to
ensure that progress is not stunted due to lack o f funds.

12.     Provincial taxes due to their inflexibility provide limited scope towards
appreciable increase in volume o f receipts in the medium term; premature payment o f
expensive loans have created a fiscal space o f around 30% o f the provincial own receipts.
The Provincial government has prepared and shared with the Federal Government a Debt
Management & Reduction Strategy that aims to prepay and replace existing domestic
debts with inexpensive debts available inthe market due to excess liquidity. This single
initiative has the proved potential o f ensuring sustainability o f pro-poor and human
development initiatives once SAC support terminates.

13.      To overcome weaknesses in budget preparation and expenditure monitoring, a
comprehensive capacity building plan i s being formulated under PIFRA to train
provincial and district core staff in use o f NAMto ensure preparation o f FY 06 budget
using the New Chart o f Accounts; implementation o f performance budgeting on pilot
basis in a couple o f high expenditure making provincial departments and extension to
remaining departments and the district governments in the medium term. The Provincial
Finance Commission is working on redesigningits formula for the next three year Award
to introduce incentive and conditional grants to encourage local governments to ensure
spending in prioritized social sectors in line with national and provincial poverty
reduction objectives.

 14.     Computerization o f land records and field based assessment o f Agriculture
Income Tax will be closely monitored and supervised to attain the true potential o f this
important tax. The Government is thinking towards the levying o f a uniform rate o f
abiana to rectify misreporting of cropping patterns and resultant improper assessment o f
the user charge; review health user charges especially at the tertiary tier and to further
increase collection through capacity building and administrative reforms in light of
Cabinet sub-committee proposals to be considered for incorporationinthe next budget.

 15.     The forthcoming NFC Award is expected to provide additional fiscal space that
will be used to finance expenditures inpriority areas o f poverty reduction and enhanced
social services. Most o f the expenditures in the high priority areas o f basic health and
education services are made at the local government level, recommendations will be
made to the next Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) to prepare Award, which will be
 for three years, to pass on sufficient fiscal space to the local governments to enable them
to increase and improve provision o fthese services as envisaged inthe reforms.

 16.     To provide incentive to the district governments to increase their revenue receipts,
 Government will continue to provide matching grants for revenues collected through
imposition o f new taxes and increased collections over base years. The Town Municipal
Administrations will be encouraged and provided capacity building support to mobilize
rural communities to take over drinking water supply schemes and to improve water rate
 collections in urban areas. These initiatives are expected to reduce the impact o f

                                                                                  Annex A
                                                                                Page 60f 16

electricity charge payments that have been eating into the already weak fiscal resources
ofthe local governments.

B.      Improve financial management and accountability

17.     The reforms aim at devolving o f fiscal functions in accordance with
administrative devolution, providing reliable and timely information on provincial and
district government transactions, and improve: (i)   monitoring o f spending programs; (ii)
outcomes; (iii) o f information to track actuals versus planned expenditures; (iv)
                 flow
public procurement; and (v) legislative oversight.

Actions Taken

18.     To meet the targets set inthe MTBF and to initiate development plans o f the new
government, the development expenditures as a share o f total expenditures saw an
increase o f 27% inthe FY04 Budget. To keep the throw forward o f the development plan
at 3.O years level, development expenditures were reprioritized. However, a deliberate
effort was made to protect program emphasis on the pro-poor sectors. Inspite o f being a
food deficient province, wheat subsidy was reduced from Rs. 2.7 billion in FY99 to
currently Rs. 1billion, mainly to maintain strategic stocks. General Provident Fundand a
Pension Fund outside the Budget have been established to better manage the
government's deferred liabilities; deposits in Pension and Provident Funds are being
increased regularly with the aim o fmakingthem to fully fundnew pension and.Provident
findliabilities inFY 2009/10.

19.     The Government has instituted several reforms inthe preparation, processing, and
execution o f the budget. Classification o f expenditures inbudget documents; initiation o f
performance budgeting on pilot basis; computerization o f updated land records on a pilot
basis; online linking o f the Provincial and District Budgets; and establishing a
professionally staffed Budget Analysis Unit that is now fully functional tracking and
reporting on the consolidated fiscal deficit and key fiscal indicators on a quarterly basis
are noticeable among them.

20.     NWFP's Provincial Finance Commission was the first to use a formula based on
population, indicators o f social development and backwardness in its Award for
budgetary transfers to the districts starting inFY02. All non-salary recurrent expenditures
and district development spending has been devolvedto the districts from FY03 onwards.
The PFC Awards strengthened fiscal devolution by providing matching incentive grants
to Districts for increasing tax bases and collecting revenue in excess o f budget estimates
(provided they are in excess o f the preceding year); enhancing non-salary allocation o f
Districts by 10%; direct transfer o f Octroi grants to Town Administrations to ensure
timely transfer o f funds; and piloted collection o f the Urban Immovable Property Tax
(UIPT) intwo districts.

21.      Reconciliation o f receipts and expenditures increased to 90% for receipts and
93% for expenditures inFY 03. Currently 90% o f transactions in suspense accounts and
 85% in inter-governmental accounts are reconciled as against 80% and 85%,

                                                                                     Annex A
                                                                                 Page 7of I 6

respectively, in FY03. These reconciliation rates are the highest amongst the provinces.
With support from PIFRA, NAM (SAP W3) is being implemented and the 4 positioned
pilot sites are operating in live production mode.          NWFP is the first government
(including Federal and Provincial) in the country to enforce Procurement Rules pursuant
to the Procurement Ordinance passed inMay 2002.

22.     The new Procurement rules and guidelines simplify and consolidate the
procurement procedures based on national and international best practice; shorten time
for public procurement with timelines o f each activity; make the public procurement
system more transparent and competitive, and reduce fiduciary risks. Compared to
previous public procurement procedures, the salient features o f the new procurement law
are: the evaluation criteria have to be given upfront inbiddingdocuments; the recording
of procurement proceedings inwriting has beenmade mandatory; the age old practice o f
negotiating with the lowest bidder which led to discretion o f public officials handling
procurement has been abolished; intimation o f award o f contract has to be given to each
bidder as soon as proceedings are finalized, and unsuccessful bidder has been given the
righto fredressal through a review process. These measures are to have a positive impact
on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as the bidding system has been made more
accessible for SMEs and encourage hitherto unregistered or undocumented vendors to
come into the tax net by getting a National Tax Number and the Sales Tax Number
becausethese documents are requiredto fulfill eligibility criterion.

23.     Ours was the first province to appoint a Provincial Finance Controller as the focal
person for financial management aspects o fthe NWFP reform program and to complete a
Provincial Financial Accountability Assessment (PFAA) that includes a detailed time
bound financial management improvement program. Internal Audit units have been
established in all the 19 provincial departments. NWFP Provincial Assembly was first in
the country to establish a Public Accounts Committee (PAC) inJanuary 2003. The PAC
has reviewed public accounts o f 1998/99 and would begin with accounts o f recent years
inthe next session. The outcome of the PAC's deliberations is released to the public
within 2 days.

Future Reforms

24.     Cooperation and experience o f PIFRA and Federal programs will be used to
sustain and expand the reform program in financial management. The existing rules and
regulations will be revised to eliminate obsolete contents and references and make them
consistent with PIFRA initiatives e.g. NAM, and international best practices. The
monthly rate o f reconciliation rate o f provincial receipts, expenditures, suspense accounts
and intergovernmental transfers will be raised across the board to 92%, 94%, 92% and
90% respectively with two months lag inFY 05.

25.     To achieve the desired objectives o f setting up o f internal audit units, a program
to train master trainers for in house capacity building with in the departments is being
planned for FY 05; duringthe same period internal audit units are to be established at the
district government level. A Steering Committee will be set up to monitor the completion
of time bound activities agreed in the PFAA. To create a positive impact o f decisions

                                                                                    Annex A
                                                                                  Page 8 of 16

taken by the PAC, the Speaker Provincial AssemblyKhairman PAC has taken a
conscious decision to consider reports on last in first out basis. The practice o f
considering earlier reports failed to deliver the desired results as in most o f the cases
officers responsible for the leakageshadretired.

C.     Enhanced Service Delivery

26.     InNWFP low levels of human capital are hrther worsened by the inability to
undertake investments to improve skills leading to increase inpoverty levels. It is critical
to address the nature and causes o f deprivation that translate into lack o f capability to
enhance future economic opportunities. The poor in NWFP are characterized by low
levels o fhumandevelopment as indicated by various education andhealth indicators that
are lower than the corresponding country average except the male net primary
enrollment.

27.    To have a lasting impact on productivity and poverty, focus o f our Government
would continue to remain on efforts to further improve and consolidate gains made in
delivery o f services especially humandevelopment services. Initiatives will be fine tuned
to devolve responsibilities to local governments to further improve these services and
make accessibility easier with focus on primary service delivery

Education

28.     The medium term objectives for providing for achieving longer term poverty
alleviation and economic development, the reforms aim to: (i)      improve access to primary
education (enrollment) and its quality; (ii) reduce gender and rural-urban disparities; and
(iii) thecapacityatthesecondaryschoollevelforcontinuingeducationbeyond
     expand
primarylevel.

Actions Taken

29.     To improve educational environment 81% o f the development funds were
allocated in the education sector to provide basic facilities in girls schools. After
achieving the following results inFY 03, the activity has been broadened to complete the
left over girls primary schools, provide basic facilities to all the boys primary schools and
to provide deficient basic facilities in girls middle and secondary schools over the next
two years.

                                                                                Page9of 16

Inaddition to provisionof 633 additional classrooms indeficient schools, upgradationof
137 girls and 365 boys schools, 20 middle and 9 high schools for girls are to be
established by endFY 06.

30.     To overcome staff shortages besides the rationalization exercise completed inFY
03, 1496 female primary school teachers and 850 male CT teachers were recruited with
primaryschool recruitment beingmade facility specific, as far as possible, from the union
council to ensure presence o f the teacher. Another 9873 positions for teachers have been
created; process for recruitment o f 4000 teachers has been initiated. To strengthen
institutional mechanism to monitor and discourage teacher absenteeism an elaborate
monitoring mechanismhas been developedat the district level to make monthly reporting
to the Directorate o f Schools & Literacy Department from January 2004. To assist the
district supervisory staff inreducing teacher absenteeism, PTAs have been authorized to
make spot checks o f primary schools and report their findings to the district managers.
These efforts have translated in initiation of disciplinary action against 773 delinquent
teachers.

31.     Management and teaching cadres have been created in the Schools & Literacy
Department to improve the quality o f education and management. Service rules for both
the new structures have been notified on April 9, 2004. Initially the Management cadre
(BS 16-19) will be filled through transfer on competitive basis under the auspices of the
Provincial Public Service Commission; unfilled positions will be filled in through initial
recruitment bythe PPSC.

32.      Ours was the first province to have gone ahead with making primary education
free, provide free textbooks at primary level, and to modernize madrassas to bring them
into the mainstream. Till now 10,218,043 textbooks have been provided to 2,216,098
primaryschool students with the remainingto be distributedbymidMay2004. Underthe
teacher training programinitiated at provincial and district level in disciplines of budget
& finance, planning & development, establishment & administration, and community
participation inschool supervision andimprovement program capacitybuildingo f 24,844
teachers inFY03 and22,861 inFY 04 was completed.

33.      We firmly believe in encouraging public-private partnership and community
involvement in the promotion o f education. Private sector has been encouraged to use
unoccupied govemment buildings for establishing and running schools, gradually take
over the responsibility o f publishing andprintingtextbooks, strengthened PTAs in21988
primary schools and empowered them to spend IM&R h d s in consultation with the
school head teacher and to monitor and report teacher absenteeism to the respective
Monitoring Committee.

34.      The Frontier Education and Frontier Elementary Education Foundations have
been established and provided with endowment funds. The Frontier Education
Foundation has earmarked Rs. 20 million which the private sector can access through the
Bank o f Khyber for provision o f 70% fundingrequirements with a maximum o f Rs. 0.5
millionat subsidized rate o freturnfor aperiodo ffive years.

                                                                                     Annex A
                                                                                 Page 10of 16

Future Reforms

35.      The provincial government strongly believes that education has the potential to
make inroads inthe pervasive poverty and to provide the requiredimpetusfor moving the
provincial economy. It further believes that focused gains in female education are to
result inliftingthe cultural baniers and inhibitions albeit gradually, leadingto creation o f
a tolerant motivated society geared to play its due role in the establishment o f a vibrant
provincial economy.

36.      Our Government is committed to continuing and improving the reform agenda in
the Education Sector. Future plan are to focus on allocating preferential allocations to
girls education, creating additional accommodation at the middle level to encourage
completion o f primary and continue education beyond primary level, continue with
provision o f free text books and consider provision o f free uniform at primary school
level, making education compulsory up to class 8 with institution o f penalties for parents
who do not send their children to school. Keeping in view the cultural constraints
inhibiting girls education at the University level, a Women University and Women
Medical College inPeshawar shall be established inthe public sector.

37.      ThirdPartyValidation Survey informationandsubsequent CWIQ surveys will be
used for impact assessment to steer the reform course. To achieve the targeted enrollment
rate o f 85% (84% for girls) by end FY 05, the Schools & Literacy Department i s working
towards setting enrollment targets for each schools and district to achieve Education For
All.

Health

38.      Our Government's medium-term health strategy, prepared in consultation with
stakeholders, focuses on organizational and programmatic reforms, and providing
increased financial allocations to achieve the objectives. With the objective o f
significantly improving health indicators implementation o f the strategy envisages to:
(i) increasing health sector budget; (ii)improve management structure and build district
management capacity; (iii)   reorganize health facilities, with a multi-level referral system;
(iv) focus onpreventive andprimary healthcare; (v) standardization o f facilities; and(vi)
increase reliance on the private sector with adequate regulation. Major actions in these
areas include to: establish a health management cadre, make hiring on facility-specific
contracts; increase tertiary hospitals management and financial authority; continue to
create additional positions for female nurses; and expand the immunization program with
GAVI support and coverage o f TB Control using DOTS strategy. The provincial
government will also expand the number o f Lady Health Workers to improve access to
family planning and primary healthcare. The health strategy envisages a stronger
emphasis on public private partnerships, and besides the existing partnership, use o f
NGOsto provide services inthe enhancedHIV efforts andTB control.

                                                                                    Annex A
                                                                                Page 11of 16

Actions taken

39.     Allocations for health sector have been made in line with the MTBF; 100%
upfront releases have been made to ongoing and approved schemes that have shown
significant achievement in expenditure targets. HMIS activities being earlier financed
from the development budget have been brought on to the recurrent budget to
institutionalize the activity. During FY04 funds have been provided for the activity from
both the development and current budgets. The TB DOTS program launched in 13
districts has now been extended to 17 districts in the Province and the desired target of
60% coverage has beenachieved.

40.     Progress of the immunization program was hindered due to delays inthe approval
o f GAVIprogram and subsequent delays inopening o f donor fund accounts, however, 50
EPIcenters are to be openedbyFY 05. Antenatal coverageincreasedto 39% from 34%.

41.      Creation o f charge nurse positions under the Standardization of District Hospitals
Program increased the number o f positions to 420. Recruitment process for 321 charge
nurses has been completed with their assignment to districts, while recruitment process
for the remaining 139 is to be completed in FY 05. The LHW and midwifery programs
provided improved access to family planning and primary health care services. As o f
March 31, 2004 the number o f LHWs actually in field was 10,516. An advertisement has
been placed to recruit another 4034; due to non availability of willing candidates it i s
expected that another 2110 LHWs will be recruitedby end June 2004. As compared to 34
polio virus cases detected inFY 03, 13 cases were uncoveredinFY 04.

FutureReforms

42.      Preferential budgetary allocations will continue to be made in the medium term
with focus on primary andmother andchild care, to cover the costs o fthe reforms andto
make them sustainable. Human resource development plan will be finalized and
implemented, including a initiating a pilo test performance based payment system. GTZ
support will be targeted to improve district health system capacity in terms o f
administrative and financial management, planning, and monitoring capabilities. The
institutionalization o f H M I S is expected to enhance accountability o f district managers
and improve performance assessment and effective implementation.

43.      The approval o f GAVI program will translate in opening of 50 EPI centers to
supplement the existing EPI program to increase the immunization coverage to 65% by
FY 06 from currently 57%, reduce polio cases to zero andincrease coverage o fpregnant
women by health professionals to 40% and TT immunization to 50%. Recruitment o f
another 1924 LHWs i s to be completed in FY 05, provided eligible and willing
candidates become available. Access to TBDOTS strategy will be increased to 100%by
FY 06.

44.      Our government will continue to support the role o f the private sector andNGOs
in the provision of health services in NWFP. The former presently has been limited
mainly to curative services and the latter have mainly been involved in primary health

                                                                                  Annex A
                                                                              Page 1.2of 16

care and reproductive health services largely related to Afghan refugees. The medium-
term health strategy envisages a stronger emphasis on public private partnerships and use
o fNGOs to provide services inthe enhanced HIV efforts and TB control.

D.      Governance and Civil Service Reforms

45.        A promising start at civil service reform was made with implementing
measures like enforcing better discipline, restructuring the provincial government in
preparationfor devolution, preparing for the use o f contract appointments, and improving
the performance evaluationprocess (along the lines instituted bythe federal government).
Inthe longer term, four main areas of concem were identified: (i) compensation at
                                                                      low
senior levels; (ii)declining quality o f new entrants; (iii)very limited resources for
adjustment; and(iv) a largebase o f currenthetired government employees.

46.     To confront these challenges the provincial governance and civil service reforms
focused on a) devolution, including restructuring the provincial government, budgeting
and resource allocation for the future, and setting up the new district arrangements,
including assigning staff, identifying new roles in the new structures, introducing new
systems, and finalizing powers o f the main bodies; (b) personnel management, o f which
the most radical is the planned move to much greater use o f contract and facility specific
appointments. Other measures include rightsizing and restructuring government
departments, managing staff under the new devolved system, providing more
administrative autonomy to the provincial Public Service Commission (PSC), a new
performance appraisal system, and pulling together the formerly scattered regulatory
framework into a new codified manual; (c) capacity building which, as time and
resources permit, will need to include the necessary facilities and equipment for the
devolved organizations, training both on and o f f the job, and appropriate new systems
andprocedures as well as better information systems.

Actions Taken

47.     The gains obtained in 2001 through restructuring and downsizing of provincial
departments have largely been retained. Increase in government size did result in the
education and health sectors as a consequence o f actions initiated under the reforms that
saw an addition o f teachers, doctors and paramedics raising the government size from
274,261 to 283,745. The Provincial fiscal framework was revised to allow fiscal transfers
to the district governments in a transparent and predictable manner, District Government
Rules o f Business were re-notified in October 2002 to bring clarity and remove
ambiguities inthe role and responsibilities o f the public functionaries working in district
governments, and to devolve recruitment and transferring authority o f civil servants o f
devolved departments to the district governments. A local Government Commission was
established to resolve differences between departments and district governments and to
report on the over all performance of the district governments. Reports on functioning o f
two district governments have been finalized. A number o f teething problems have been
resolved that were faced by the district governments with assignment o f new
responsibilities.

                                                                                  Annex A
                                                                              Page 13 of 16

48.     The government did not have a centralized computerized human resource
database due to which budgeting was relied largely on manual submissions made by line
departments on their current workforce. Government was not in a position to undertake
actuarial analysis o f pension liabilities. A two stage consultancy has been approved to
develop and computerize HR database o f the government; the first phase o f the
consultancy has been completed.

49.     Considerable headway has been made towards contract based employment. All
new staff, except judiciary, police and prison department, and some revenue staff, is to be
recruited on fixed term contract. All contracts are to be for three year period; the terms
and conditions o f employment are identical to those o f permanent staff except that the
positions are not pensionable. Facility based recruitments have been made at the lower
tiers o f education and health departments to reduce the incidence o f staff absenteeism.
The Government i s working on identifyingmeasures to reduce the risk o fregularizingthe
staff to become permanent and automatic renewal o f contracts.

50.      When our government took office the average tenure o f Provincial Secretary was
7.5 months. Except for the initial reshuffling o f senior civil servants, Government has
been conscious o f not disturbing the leadership o f a department unless it becomes
essential to do so. This conscious decision has led to improvement inthe average tenure
to 15.2 months that i s likely to increase over time.

51.      To protect merit in recruitments the Provincial Public Service Commission
(PPSC) is continuing with the policy o f making recruitments in BPS 11 and above. To
reduce the risk o f retrenchment o f PPSC mandate due to delays inrecruitment process, a
monitoring cell has been established in the Establishment Department to periodically
monitor completion o frecruitment process within six months.

52.      To support institutional reforms, comprehensive capacity building, and training o f
elected representatives and staff especially at the district level, Swiss Development
Cooperation has agreed to fund the second phase o f the Essential Institutional Reform
Operationalization Project. The Establishment Department has also camed out an in-
house evaluation to identify capacity building needs o f the provincial departments over
the medium term. In addition to the GTZ continued support for the Health sector, DFID
i s planninganother three year capacity buildingprograms focusing on the elementary and
secondary school sectors.

FutureReforms

53.      Inspite lack o f political alignment between the provincial and district
governments, our government is committed to the devolution process and is undertaking
measures to strengthen the process further. The Provincial Finance Commission Award
will be for three years, increased transfers will be made to the local governments to
ensure sufficient fiscal space to implement the expanded social service programs, salary
budget will flow through Account IV o f the district governments, and to avoid stoppages
and delays from district to town administrations, direct transfer o f town administration

                                                                                  Annex A
                                                                              Page 14of 16

shares will be made. Control over creation o f new positions will continue to stay, for the
time being, with the provincial government to discourage diversion o f additional
resources towards the local government wage bills.

54.     At the provincial level, the size o f the government will be maintained allowing
expansion only in the health, education, and judiciary sequel to reform initiatives and
some positions for law & order. The controlled growth i s expected to be within three
percent o fthe existing government size to keep it fully sustainable.

55.     Second phase o f the HR Database is expected to be contracted before September
2004 with expectation to have a reliable HR database towards the end o f the year with
user interfacing for provincial departments and selected district governments. This will
help plantimely recruitments, capacity buildingand forecasting o f pension liabilities ina
prudent manner. Government will consider the possibility o f extending the civil service
lawdrules for redressal o f their grievances thus reducing risk o f pressures for seeking
regularizationo f services.

E.      Promoting growth and private sector development

56.       Key to poverty reduction lies in accelerating economic growth with private
sector leading the way as the engine o f growth. To achieve this goal, reforms have been
directed at improving business environment, changing role o fpublic sector from provider
to facilitator and regulator, promote public-private partnerships, and enhance agriculture
productivity. To provide road map for undertaking initiatives to reach the aforementioned
goals studies have been initiated to reduce distractions being faced by entrepreneurs and
over regulation o fbusinesses, and address other factors affectingthe investment climate.

Actions taken

57.      Our Government haszmade good progress in reducing the number o f industrial
inspections from 23 to 13 that have to be prenotified, 12 out o f 13 POEs (Sarhad
Development Authority) have been divested, 7 microhydels constructed and operated by
Sarhad Hydel Development Organization have been leased or biddingcompleted with the
remaining two to be leased after refurbishing, training institutes o f Small Industries
Development Board have been provided one time BMR grant and converted in self
financing   institutes, and Vocational Training Institutes brought under an autonomous
Agency to create linkages with private sector for introducing market driven trainings. A
Provincial Privatization Committee has been constituted to offload the remaining public
sector commercial concerns. Cabinet has agreed to reduce government equity in Bank o f
Khyber to 51%by endDecember 2004.

58.      An Agriculture Strategy has been formulated to address the multidimensional
modern day requirements o f the agriculture sector. At one hand it is focused on serving
the small and landless peasants while on the other hand it strives for income generation,
better quality living, encouraging private sector participation in provision o f inputs,
sustainable agriculture addressing environmental concerns with overall objective o f

                                                                                      Annex A
                                                                                 Page 15 of 16

achieving food security and economic self sufficiency. In the Irrigation sub-sector,
initiatives are already in hand to improve the imgation systems to make water available
at the tail end, increase abiana annually by 25% till full recovery o f O&M costs, transfer
o f all aspects o f operationand maintenance o f irrigation systems by the beneficiaries.

Future Reforms

59.      Our Government's efforts, afier considerably improvingthe law & order situation
inthe province, willwork to align `perception' corresponding to the groundrealities as a
first step to improve the investment climate and attract investors. Results from an
independent survey indicated that public perception o f the law & order situation in
NWFP was the best amongst the provinces. Private Sector representation on Boards o f
selected autonomous organizations will be considered to provide the hitherto missing
market linkages and increase transparency in managing o f the organizations. Technical
andVocational Training Agency will adopt demand driven focus inaccordance with the
Ordinance provisions. Concerted efforts will be made to encourage growth o f SMEs.

60.      To achieve higher rate o f agricultural growth, enhanced crop diversification, and
to improve incomes from livestock enhanced allocations will be made over the medium
term to finance initiatives under the Agricultural Strategy. The number o f Farm Service
Centers will be increased to atleast one per tehsil to ensure availability o f agricultural
inputs,including finance, to the small and landless farmers at affordable rates. Inaddition
local field offices o f On Farm Water Management are to be established to strengthen
farmer organizations to take over water distribution, collection o f abiana, and operation
and maintenance o f respective irrigation systems. Extension services will be geared to
provide information to pave way for adoption o f new technologies, switching to high
value and off season crops, conservation and application o f water as per crop
requirements, and adoption o fpost harvestingand grading technologies.

61.      To exploit the hydel potential o f the province, renewed efforts will be made for
construction o f power generation facilities through public sector and public-private
partnerships.     To encourage development o f selected cottage industries SHYDO has
started working on leasing o f mini-hydel sites on major canals for captive power
production. Our Government has requested the World Bank to support a comprehensive
provincial economic study defining course for long term reforms. The study is expected
to be initiated from the next financial year.

Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements

62.      Monitoring o f the reforms program i s led in an institutionalized manner with
convening o f periodic review meetings chaired by me; sectoral monthly meetings are
chaired by the respective Ministers or in their absence by the Secretaries. Monitoring
weaknesses have been identified at planningcell level in Schools & Literacy, and Health
Department and monitoring o f district level initiatives. Steps have been initiated to
improve Education and Health Management Information systems along with adequate
provision o f funding. Through the current development program financing has been
provided for establishment o fplanningcells at each district educationoffice.

                               NWFP-MEDIUM                TERMBUDGET          FRAMEWORK

1.        Duringthe late 1990s, NWFP experienced a serious fiscal crisis and resource crunch, which led
to sharp cuts inrecurrent and development expenditures and a squeeze in non-interest and non-pension
expenditures'. To overcome the fiscal crisis and structural weaknesses in the economy, the Government
of NWFPadopted a comprehensive Provincial Reform Program (PRP) inJuly 2001, with the overarching
objective of poverty reduction, enhancing economic growth, improving governance and accountability,
and enhancing effectiveness o f public expenditures. The main thrust o f fiscal reforms under the P W was
to increase own tax revenues; improve recovery o f user charges; work toward ensuring that NWFP gets
its full share o f constitutionally guaranteed Net Hydel Profits; abolishment o f the wheat subsidy;
reduction in the wage bill through attrition and promoting early retirements; adequate funding o f O&M
expenditures; and primary focus on enhancing povertyreduction expenditures.

2.        Since FYO1, the GoNWFP has implemented a number o f fiscal reformmeasures that have started
producing good results. Provincial own revenues have increased, the composition o f expenditures has
improved considerably, and there have been good progress in improving the effectiveness of spending
with fiscal and public financial management reforms. In this annex we discuss the prospects for the
medium-term fiscal path for NWFP.

3.        Tables 1 and 2 provide the main elements o f the agreed Medium-Term Budget Framework
(MTBF) interms o f Rupees and the Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP), respectively. The key
assumptions for the fiscal projections over the medium term (FYs05-08) are:

          The share o f total divisible pool for provinces at 47 percent and the share of NWFP at 15 percent
           expected under the forthcoming 6thNFC Awards2.
          No subventions grants to NWFP and 2.5 percent General Sales Tax (GST) as Octroi Zilla Tax
           (OZT) replacement grants to be parto fthe divisible pooltransfers.
          Net HydelProfits (NHP) at the current level o f Rs 6 billion.
     m     Foreign Project Assistance (FPA) utilization to be around 2/3rd of the Budgeted amount inFY05
           with nominal increases o f 10-14percent duringFY06-08.
           13 percent nominal annual increase inprovincial own revenues.
           The wage bill to increase by 6-11percent nominally, including 3 percent increase due to annual
           increments; a 2.5-3 percent annual increase in staff in priority reform areas; and periodic wage
           increases o f 3-5 percent inFY07-08.
           The pension bill to increase by 6 percent annually, including 3 percent annual increase in
           pensions and a 3 percent annual increase innumber o fpensioners.
           Wheat subsidy only to maintain strategic stocks of wheat.
           Continued focus on social sectors and pro-poor expenditures inthe development plan.
           Province to continue with the Debt Management Strategy o f accelerated repayment o f expensive
           domestic debt depending on the availability o fresources.



 'During   the period FY97-01 the fiscal deficit experienced sharp annual fluctuations and ranged between 0.3 to 1.2 percent o f
 PGDP. Non-interest and non-pension expenditures fell from 7.5 percent of GDP inFY97 to 6.7 percent o f GDP inFYOI.
 'These   are the assumptions of the baseline projections for the forthcoming 6th NFC Awards. The low case scenario, discussed
 later, assumes the continuation o f the current NFC Awards.

4.        Overall deficit. As Table 2 shows, the overall deficit increased from an average o f 0.7 percent o f
GDP duringFY99-01 to 0.9 percent o f the GDP inFY03 and the projecteddeficit is expected to be 1.2
percent o f PDGP inFY04. Higher deficits inFY03 and FY04 were primarily due to higher development
expenditures, a sizable reduction inFederal and Foreign grants, and a continuous decline inthe share o f
NHP as a share of PGDP. Although the fiscal deficit has been higher, as a result o f fiscal reforms fiscal
space (defined as total spending excluding interest payments and pensions) o f 0.7-0.8 percent o f PGDP
has been created duringFY03-04 compared to the period FY99-01.

5.        Loolung forward, the medium term fiscal path is fully sustainable. The fiscal deficit i s expected
to range between 0.6-0.8 percent o f the provincial GDP duringFY05-08. Total expenditures are expected
to increase by an average o f 10.5 percent annually during FY05-08 with higher projected increases in
development expenditures at an average rate o f 16 percent annually. The additional fiscal space is
expected to be ploughed into higher development spending in priority areas and in prematurely retiring
expensive debt. The MTBF projections are based on the best available information at the time o f loan
negotiations3. For the next fiscal year (FY05) it has been agreed that if the NFC Awards are more
generous and if there i s agreement on higher NHP by WAPDA, then additional resources beyond the
agreed thresholds would be utilized for accelerated debt retirement. Ifthe sum o f resources from the NFC
Awards and WAPDA are lower than projected, then total expenditures would be adjusted accordingly to
maintainthe agreed overall fiscal deficit o f Rs4.3 billion inFY05 (0.8 percent o f the PGDP).

6.        Provincial own revenues: The results o f past tax policy and administrationreforms resultedin a
healthy growth o f 20 percent inprovince own collected revenues in FY03 compared to a fairly stagnant
own revenue growth during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Provincial tax revenues increased by 14
percent and non-tax revenues by 26 percent inFY03. Inthe medium term, provincially collected revenues
are expected to increase from 0.9 to 1.0percent o fprovincial GDP. The share o f the provincially collected
revenues in total revenues would continue to be around 10 percent because o f the NFC Award
assumptions and expectations o f growing Federal tax assignment due to good prospects of overall tax
collection inthe country.

7.        The MTBF envisages a 13 percent annual increase in provincially collected revenues during
FY05-08. These provincial own revenue collection projections are underpinned by both tax policy
reforms and further improvements inthe tax administration4. The govemment would be taking up specific
recommendations for the FY05 Budget based on results o f a number o f research-based studies5. These
policy-based studies suggest that NWFP has considerable potential to generate higher own revenues by
improving tax administration, adjusting tax rates to remove exemptions and by making them more
equitable, harmonizing tax rates and coordinating with other tax jurisdictions, abolishing taxes with little
yield, avoiding usingregulatory taxes for revenue purposes and creating a better tax climate.


   By end-May 2004, the 6th NFC Award determination consultations were still continuing. The estimates o f Federal Tax
 Assignments and Net Hydel Profits (NHP) are based on fairly conservative assumptions o f the forthcoming NFC Awards. The
 total share o f the divisible pool, including 2.5 percent o f GST as Octroi and Zilla Tax replacement grant, has been assumed at 47
 percent and NWFP's share in the provincial pool has been taken at 15 percent. NHP from WAPDA are assumed to continue at
 the current level ofRs6 billion.
  The govemment has recently taken a number o f measures to improve tax administration, such as provision o f logistic support
 to staff o f Excise and Taxation Department to help improve their performance; pay as incentive a graduated reward o f up to 5
 percent o f revenue collection to staff which is assigned additional responsibility o f collecting tax/ user charges; piloting the
 computerization o f land records to improve accuracy and tax collection; and administrative changes to improve collection o f
 Aabiana (irrigation charges) by the Irrigation Department which both assesses and collects this user charge.
  These included studies on Reform o f AIT and LandTax inNWFP, Tax Potential inNWFP, and Reform o f Tax Administration
 inNWFP.

                                                                                                               Page 5 of 8

8.        Expenditure Composition: The recent fiscal reforms have considerably improved the
composition o f expenditures by containing non-priority expenditures to create additional fiscal space for
high priority pro-poor spending and expansion of public investments, in particular in health and
education. Current expenditures have declined to 81 percent o f total expenditure during the first two
years o f reform program (FY02/03) from an average o f 89 percent during FY99-01; and the share o f
development expenditure has increased from an average o f 11percent o f total expenditures (FY99-01) to
close to 20 percent inFY02/03. The debt-servicing burdenhas been reduced sharply ina very short period
o ftime -- from an average o f 3.1 percent o f PGDP inFY99-01 to 2.7 percent inFY03. To bridge the large
social and gender gaps in NWFP, pro-poor expenditures (PRSP-type expenditures) have increased from
an average o f 6 percent o f PGDP over FY99-01 to 6.3-6.4 percent of PGDP duringFY02/03.

9.        Over the medium term, the composition o f expenditures is expected to improve further. The share
o f current expenditures intotal expenditures i s expected to decline from 80 percent inFY04to 76 percent
by FY08, and the share o f development expenditures would increase from around 20 percent to 24
percent over the same period. The govemment would be curtailing current expenditures by reducing
establishment charges limitingthe wheat subsidy to only maintain strategic stocks; continuing to follow a
strategic policy o f accelerated debt retirement to reduce the debt servicingburden; reducingthe remaining
contingent liabilities; and improving management o f the deferred liabilities (i.e. the PensionFundand the
General Provident Fund). The GoNWFP also plans to expand public investments and improve the
effectiveness o f this spending. These measures include improving budget processes and budget
management; strengthening regular monitoring o f the consolidated provincial finances, with particular
emphasis on monitoring and evaluation o f expenditures and physical infrastructure related to the
development program. Moreover, the govemment i s tahng measures to strengthen administrative and
fiscal devolution6to improve access to and the quality o f social service delivery for the poor. The medium
term projections on key items o f the current and development expenditure are as follows:


percent o f total expenditures) during FYsO5 - 08. The onetime jump in the wage bill in FY04 (from
10.        Wages and Pensions: The wage billis expected to stay at around 3.8-4.0 percent o fPGDP (37-38

around 3.7 percent o f PGDP to 4.1 percent during FY03 and FY04) i s not likely to be repeated unless
there i s a sudden change inthe Federal government's wage andpensionpolicy'. The wage bill i s expected
to increase 6-11 percent nominally during FY05-08 including periodic small wage increases o f 3-5
percent, a 3 percent increase in normal annual increments; and a 2.5-3 percent annual increase in staff in
priority reform areas in the social sectors, for maintenance o f law and order, and in critical areas where
there are staff and skill shortages'. Expenditures on pensions would be around 0.6 percent of PGDP in
the medium term based on assumptions o f a 3 percent nominal annual increase in pensions and a 3
percent annual increase in the number o f pensioners. GoNWFP's General Provident Fund and Pension
Funds, which are expected to fully funded by 2010/11, would also lead to saving of around Rs 3-4 billion
annually at current levels from the Budget beyond the medium term.


 6Toimprovefiscal devolution,the governmentdevolved all non-salaryrecurrentexpendituresanddistrict developmentspending
 to the districts during FY03 and FY04; in FY04 it directly transferred the Octroi grants to Tehsils (instead of through the
 Districts) to ensure timely transfer of funds to TMAs; and initiatedapilot to devolvethe UrbanImmovablePropertyTax (UIPT)
 to two districts (Nowshera and Swabi), whereby they collect and retain the tax. Starting FY05, the GoNWFP has decided to
 devolve the salary budgetsof the devolveddepartments to District govemments(Accounts IV). It has also agreed inprinciple, to
 createprovisionsfor additionalfunds to well-performingDistrict govemmentsto incentivizedistrict servicedelivery.
    In the FY04 Budget, the Federal govemment announced a 15 percent increase in basic pay and pensions for Federal
 govemment employees, which all provincial governments, includingNWFP followed suit.
 `The provincialgovemmenthas hiredaround4,000 teachers and 600 healthworkers during FY03. Recruitment of another4,000
 teachers and a few hundred healthworkers are expected inFY04. As part of the Provincial RefomProgram, there is a needto
 hireanadditional12,000 teachers, 700-800 doctorsandparamedics,andabout 15000policemen.

11.        Interest Payments: The share o f interest payments in total expenditures would continue to fall
sharply from 17.4 percent in FY03 to 11percent in FY08 or from 1.8 percent PGDP to 1.1 percent o f
PGDP. The pre-mature debt retirement o f the high-cost CDLs inFY03 and FY04have already generated
interest savings and would continue to generate savings o f more than Rs 1.3 billion annually even if no
new debt i s retired. Inthe medium term, based on the availability o f resources, the GoNWFP expects to
continue with its policy o f pre-mature retirement o f CDLs, which i s likely to reduce the debt servicing
burdeneven further.

12.         Subsidies: Over the medium term, the GoNWFP expects to spend Rs 1-1.1billion annually (0.2
percent o f PGDP) on maintainingstrategic stocks of wheat' inthe province. These estimates are based on
the cost o f buyingwheat from wheat-surplus provinces, (e.g. Punjab) or importing wheat in case there is
an overall shortage inthe country.

 13.        Pro-poor expenditures: The Provincial Reforms Program's high priority to increasing public
expenditures on social sectors (mainly education and health) and for infrastructure and rural development
would continue over the medium term. Development expenditures on education and health are expected
to increase by an average o f 11-12percent annually duringFY05-08, and by 8 to 12percent annually in a
range o f infrastructure sectors, inparticularwhere filling gaps ininfrastructure has a substantial impact on
the poor. As Table 3 shows, expenditures in sectors that are likely to have a high impact on reducing
poverty and on enhancing growth (i.e. the PRSP-type expenditures) would rise from an average of 6
percent o f the PGDP during FY99-01to close to 7 percent during FY05-08. Social sector expenditures
 would increase from 38% percent o f total expenditures in FY04 to 40% percent by FY08". Gaps in
physical infrastructure and in the rural and agricultural sector are also likely to be reduced by higher
public investments in agriculture, small irrigation projects, drinking water supply and sanitation, rural
 development and in roads, including access roads, farm-to-market roads, and key provincial highways.


   Currently the estimated size o f the strategic stock is 300,000 tons.
 loTotal expectedexpenditures, including ForeignProjectAssistance (FPA) inthe educationsector would increase fromRs 14.1
 billion inFY04to Rs21.8 billionby endFY08, and inhealthfromRs 3.3 billion to Rs 5.4 billion over the same period.

                                                                                                                 Annex C
                                                                                                               Page 7 of 8

The MTBFalso envisages a healthy increaseinO&M expenditures for adequate runningand maintenance
o f the public infrastructure.

14.       Public Debt: The size o f the public debt stock which stood at Rs 67 billion" at the end o f FY03
is expected to reach Rs 79.5 billion by FYO8, but most o f the new debt build-up would be in terms o f
concessional foreign loans/credits including the SACS.Over the medium term, there would be a decline in
the public debt to PGDP ratio from almost 16 percent (in FY03) to 13 percent by end-FY08.                              The
authorities have formulated and proposed a provincial "Debt Management Strategy" to the Federal
Government, with the objective o f creating more fiscal space by premature retirement of remaining CDLs
(worth Rs 28 billion by end FY04) and/or renegotiating the terms of the existing loans with the Federal
Government. It is expected that the GoNWFP would pursue its debt reduction strategy by retiring
expensive CDLs and creating fiscal space when resources are available such as available cash balances,
budget support credits or better than projectedFederaltransfers.

15.       BudgetFinancing:Medium-term projectionsindicate that NWFPwould have adequate available
financing to sustain the medium-term program. DuringFY05-08, the fiscal deficits are projected to be
within 0.6 to 0.8 percent o f the PGDP. The main financing sources include the foreign loans already in
the pipeline'*; the NWFP SAC 2 and proposed NWFP SAC 3 (FY06); and proposed DFIDbudget support
expected to start inFY06 totaling 50-100 millionpounds over five years.

16.       Low case scenario: There is a possibility that by the time the Credit goes to the Board, the
negotiations for the 6' NFC Awards may not have been finalized and the GoNWFP would have to
continue with the current NFC Awards13. Estimated medium-term projections for the low-case scenario
are shown in Table        414. Under this scenario, there would be only a 10 percent nominal increase in total
revenues and grants in FY05 driven by the increase in Federal Tax Assignments (FTA) accruing to the
province. This compares to a 20 percent overall increase intotal revenues and grants under the baseline
scenario discussed above. Inthe low case scenario, there would be expenditure compression in terms o f
PGDP due to limited resources and deficit financing. Total expenditures would fall from 9.9 percent o f
PGDP in FY04 to 8.9 percent in FY08. Incomparison, under the baseline scenario total expenditures
increase to 10.1 percent over this period. The bulko f the compression inthe low case would be incurrent
expenditures, particularly in O&M expenditures, but cuts would also be required in some areas o f
development spending. Development expenditures would decline from 2 percent of the PDGP inFY04 to
 1.8 percent by FY08 in the low case; in contrast development expenditures increase from 2 percent of
PDGP to 2.4 percent over the same period in the baseline scenario. The province would also be
significantly constrained inmeeting its objective o f creating fiscal space (additional non-interest and non-
pension spending) under this scenario. Compared to the increase in non-interest, non-pension spending
under the baseline case (from 7.8 percent o f PGDP in FY04 to 8.5 percent in FY08), there would be a
decline in non-interest, non-pension spending by 0.5 percent o f GDP under the low case. Highpriority
recurrent and development spending including on health and education would grow considerably more
slowly than in the base line scenario. The fiscal deficit i s projected to decline from 0.6 percent o f PGDP


 "Including Rs 30.2 billion in CDLs and Rs 34.8 billion inForeign Exchange Loans guaranteed by the Govemment o f Pakistan.
 I2The bulk o f the foreign loans are Asian Development Bank and IDA loans, both for province-specific projects and NWFP's
share in Federal govemment projects/programs. Inaddition, there i s an IFAD loan for rural development and Japanese loans for
rural roads.
 13This would imply a 37.5 percent share to provinces from the divisible pool; a 13.81 percent population-based share o f the
divisible pool to NWFP; and continuationo f subvention grants for NWFP.
 14The GoNWFP has indicated its commitment to adhere to the MTBF principles under the low-case scenario, although the
situation would entail revisions inthe agreed baseline MTBF estimates.

inFY05 to 0.4 percent inFY07 - somewhat lower than the baseline scenario reflecting the expenditure
compression and early drawdown o f cash balances.

17.      The l o w case scenario shows clearly that maintaining the current revenue sharing arrangement
with the provinceswouldnot be consistent withthe national PRSP goals, progress towards the MDGs and
the ongoing devolution initiative where more spending is expected to be undertaken locally. Hence,
consistency in policies and revenue sharing arrangements for the Government of Palustan to reach those
goals does require a substantial increase inprovinces' share o f revenues, and through the PFCs, in local
govemments' share, as i s assumed inthe fiscal baseline scenario.

                                               POVERTY NWFP  IN

1.       Poverty in NWFP, as it i s the case with all o f Pakistan, i s multi-dimensional - encompassing
deficiencies in income and consumption, as well as in human capability. In order to draw a profile o f
poverty for NWFP, this Annex starts with a discussion o f the findings on trends and patterns in
consumption poverty, and attempt to rationalize these estimates with a close look at the growth and
distribution o f consumption. Subsequent to this, understanding the combination o f factors that constrain
the incomes o f poor people entails examining the critical correlates o f poverty, like employment
characteristics, land ownership, human capability and socio-economic factors. Given the critical role o f
human development indetermining the path out o fpoverty, the Annex ends with a briefdescription o fthe
status o f human development and service delivery in education and health in the province, with a view
towards understanding some o fthe key challenges that needto be addressed.

TrendsinConsumption,InequalityandPoverty

2.        Before outlining the trends and patterns in poverty, it i s useful to reflect briefly on the current
situation regarding poverty measurement inPalustan. Recently, the government o f Palustan has adopted
an official poverty line, the rupee value o f which (Rs. 674 per monthper equivalent adult male in 1998-99
Rs.) is arrived at by estimating an expenditure level that is required to attain a minimum threshold of
calorie consumption (2350 calories per equivalent adult per day). However, a number o f methodological
issues, particularly related to equivalence scales used inpoverty measurement and suitable price indices
to adjust poverty lines over time for inflation, remain to be settled. While progress i s being achieved in
this direction, there is no consensus yet on the provincial poverty estimates - as articulated in the
government's recently publishedPRSP.

3.        Inthe absence of an officially recognizedmethodology, this note willpresent poverty estimates
based on the World Bank stafs own calculations using P M S rounds o f 1998-99 and 2001-02. The
World Bank poverty line used here - as well as in previous studies like the Poverty Assessment (2002)
and the Development Policy Review (2002) - i s a "basic needs poverty line" measuring the minimum
expenditure necessary to attain a basic level o f welfare, defined in terms o f food as well as non-food
consumption.'      Although these estimates cannot be construed as official figures, they are still useful:
firstly, they provide a consistent measure of poverty trends -based on a poverty line fixed inreal terms -
going back to the early 1990s; secondly, they indicate trends that one would expect even ifone were to
use a dzfferent poverty line, since trends over time remain largely unaffected by small changes in the
poverty line. It should be noted that this poverty line i s higher than the official line mentioned above,
which would mean that poverty estimates using the official line are expected to be lower than the
estimates derivedhere.

4.        Finally, for the sake o f comparison, poverty estimates for NWFP for 1998-99 and 2001-02 using
the official poverty line are also listed. However, it i s important to note that these are derived from World
Bank staff calculations, following to a large extent the methodology used by the Federal Bureau o f
Statistics o f Pakistan for their previous work.            These do not represent officially endorsed poverty
estimatesfor NWFP, and are presented merely as an example o f the picture that could emerge once the
official methodologyo fpoverty measurement is fixed inPalustan.




  The World Bank poverty line for Pakistan i s Rs. 680 and Rs. 767 per equivalent adult per month for rural and urban areas
respectively, in 1998-99 Rs. For more details, see Pakistan: Development Policy Review, and Pakistan: Poverty Assessment,
World Bank(2002).

Poverty trends andpatterns in NKFP

5.        Estimates usingWorld Bankpoverty lines indicate that on the whole, between 1998-99 and 2001-
02, there has not been an appreciable change in the incidence, depth and severity o f poverty inNWFP.
Moreover, urban and rural areas o fNWFP remain significantly poorer than the country as a whole.

that while the incidence o f poverty has increased a little, there have been some improvements in the
average consumptiodincome o f the poor and its distribution among the poor. However, the movements
in all the measures o f poverty discussed so far - headcount, poverty gap and squared poverty gap -
between 1998-99 and 2001-02 are small enough to indicate that the poverty situation in NWFP has
remained largely unchanged over this period.

 1, shows that the trends inheadcounts for NWFP have largely mirrored the trends for the entire country.
Also, urban and rural poverty inNWFP has remained significantly higher than those for the country since
 1990-91; provincial estimates suggest that NWFP has continued to be the poorest province in Pahstan
throughout the period. However, it should be noted that poverty estimates for Balochistan - due to
problems in designing the sample on account o f the way the population i s distributed in this province -

                                                                                                                    Annex D

are quite inaccurate relative to the other provinces, so that the relative ranking o f NWFP vis-&vis
Balochistan on poverty incidence must be treated with caution. Having said that, it i s still true that in
spite o f some convergence in recent years with the rest o f the country, the poverty challenge in NWFP
remains considerable -inabsolute terms as well as relative to the rest o f the country.

9.       Finally, the headcount estimates based on World Bank calculations usingthe official poverty line
for Pakistan (lower panel of Table 1) show that the changes inpoverty incidence for NWFP since 1998-
99 are similar to those with the World Bank poverty line. For the province as a whole and separately for
rural areas, poverty headcount i s seen to have increased marginally, while the increase i s a little larger for
urban areas.

Trends in consumption and inequality

10.      Since poverty estimates are sensitive to the choice o f the poverty line on which these are based, it
i s useful to look at consumption over the period - specifically the average levels and inequality measures
-tounderstandwhatexplainsthechangesinpovertymeasures describedabove, aswellastocheckfor
consistency with these measures. The evidence indicates that between 1998-99 and 2001-02, average
consumptioninNWFP declined, but to a smaller extent than for the rest o f the country. At the same time,
inequality in consumption also declined, by and large more than in other provinces. The overall impact
on poverty incidence by these two competing factors, on balance, was a small increase in headcount
poverty, with some indication that the poorest groups registered some tangible gains.

decline in gini is larger
than that for all provinces,
with the exception of Punjab that registered a similar magnitude o f decline. These results are consistent
with the observation above that the increase in poverty inNWFP was smaller than for the country as a
whole over this period.

rural areas separately (Table 3),                  Table3: Average Consumptionand InequalityinNWFP

Moreover, average urban consumption - in spite of its steeper decline since 1998-99 - continues to be
significantly higher than rural consumption, which i s consistent with the wide urban-rural gap inpoverty
incidence that persists inthe province.

13.       The fall in average consumption levels - in NWFP and for the whole o f Palustan - i s likely
associated with the incidence of drought, which has been a persistent phenomenon over several years
preceding the survey of 2001-02, with severe consequences for livelihood options o f the poor. Sub-
province level statistics are not available fiom the PMS.                     A qualitative study, namely the draft
Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA), reports that the effects of drought are seen across NWFP, with
the aridand semi-arid rural areas inthe south of the provincebeingthe hardesthit.'

14.       A growth-inequality decomposition of poverty headcount change between 1998-99 and 2001-02
show the importance of growth as well as distributional changes for poverty-reduction. The "growth
effect" of a reduction in average consumption i s found to be an increase in poverty headcount for both
urban and rural areas. The "redistribution effect", namely the contribution o f a change inthe distribution
of consumption to poverty headcount change, is a fall inheadcount. Onbalance, the two opposing effects
leadto the observed small increases inpoverty headcount inbothurban and rural areas. The reduction in
inequality inNWFP thus negated some o f the poverty-increasing impact o f negative consumption growth
inurban andrural areas alike. With this distributional change, if average consumptionhad not declined
and even held at 1998-99 levels in real terms, poverty headcount would have declined slightly in rural
NWFP, andby almost 7 percentagepoints inurbanNWFP.3

 15.      Evidence so far thus indicates that while growth in                  Fig-4: GrowthIncidenceCurve for NWFP
consumption has been negative on the average, the shift in
consumption between 1998-99 and 2001-02 has been
somewhat "pro-poor".          The shape of a growth-incidence
curve (GIC) constructed for NWFP as a whole confirms
this (Figure4). Growthinper capita consumption is found
to be positive for the lower consumption groups (centiles),
and highlynegative for those above the 80* percentile. In
fact, positive growth is observed only for the bottom 30
percent of the          population ranked by per capita
consumption expenditure.

 16.      To conclude this discussion, it i s relevant to recall
the observation made previously that while headcount
poverty registered a small increase in NWFP between 1998-99 and 2001-02, poverty gap and seventy
 declined. This is plausible, given the consumption patterns described in this section, namely that of a
 decline in average consumption, combined with a reduction in inequality (or a pro-poor movement in
 consumption levels).

 Characteristics of Poverty: Who are the poor?

 17.      A close look at the correlates of consumption poverty serves the dual purpose of understanding
 the multi-dimensional nature o f poverty - well beyond deprivations in consumption alone - and

  The PakistanPPA involvedparticipatory discussions, activities and analysis intwo contrasting sub-sites in each of54 urbanand
 rural Union Councils throughout Pakistan. In NWFP, PPA fieldwork was conducted in 9 sites since mid-2001, each with two

identifying the characteristics o f the poor that constrain their eaming potential and thus perpetuate the
cycle o f poverty and low capability. This section accordingly explores some of the key factors associated
with consumption poverty, related to employment and occupational characteristics, ownership of
productive assets, education and healthcharacteristics that determine human capacity and socio-economic
characteristics. While most o f the evidence consists of estimates from the PMS data, a few additional
insights will be drawn from qualitative evidence documented in the Participatory Poverty Assessment
(PPA) in NWFP, and the Community Information Empowerment and Training (CIET) social audit
baseline survey o f 2001/2002, conducted inall districts inthe 4 mainprovinces ofPak~stan.~

Thelabor market characteristics: employment and wages

18.       The objective here i s to explore how the sectoral features o f the labor market are related to
observed trends and patterns inpoverty. Moreover, some diagnostics on the composition of employment,
particularly among the poor will help identify the sectors where growth has to occur in order for it to be
pro-poor.

those employed inagriculture and construction respectively (Figure 9). Disaggregating by occupation, 56
and 69 percent o f agricultural/fishing workers and unskilledlabor respectively belong to the poorest 40
percent group. These results support a few conclusions: first, those employed inagnculture - seen above
as the most significant employer as a sector - are on the average more likely to be poor; second,
occupations that are predominantly inthe informal sector (agriculture or fishmg workers, unslulled labor)
are associatedwith higher incidence ofpoverty.

22.      Wage rates for different sectors and occupations partly explain the observed links between
employment characteristics and poverty, as well as help rationalize the poverty trend between 1998-99
and 2001-02 (Figures 10 and 11). In 2001-02, wage/day i s found to be the lowest in agriculture and
construction sectors, and for agricultural/fishing workers and unskilled labor - consistent with these two
sectors having a higher incidence o f poverty. There i s little change in the relative rankings o f the sectors
and occupations on wage rates between 1998-99 and 2001-02. Moreover, wage rates inmost sectors and
occupations have declined over the period. Real wages inthe agriculture and construction sectors, which
rankedamong the lowest in 1998-99, also suffered the steepest declines of 37 and 19percent respectively.
Among occupations, sharp declines are seen not only for lowly paid occupations like craft-related,
agriculture and fishing workers and unslulled labor, but even for highly paid jobs like managers and
professionals.

 23.      The across-the-board reduction in wages between 1998-99 and 2001-02 helps explain the
 observed increase inpoverty and decline in average consumption levels over this period. Together, they
 suggest a scenario of stagnating growth that resultednot only inwage declines in sectors like agriculture
-andininformalsectoroccupationsmorebroadly-where thepooraremorelikelytobeworking, but
 also in most other sectors and occupations across the economy. Also as seen above, along with this

                                                                                                                Annex D

stagnation, there was some movement towards lower inequality in consumption - the current analysis i s
unable to explainhow this may have happened. What does come through from looking at the wage trends
inthe labor market isapicture ofeconomic stagnation, andthis is consistent withthe evidence ondecline
inaverageconsumption over the period.

24.     Qualitative evidence from the PPA conducted in NWFP since mid-2001 reveals people's
perceptions about livelihood opportunities that broadly resonate with the findings above. A notable
perception was that while employment opportunities increasedduringthe 1970s and 1980s, inrural areas
this trend was reversed during the 1990s. This was mainly connected to the fact that with continuing
drought and the resulting decline inthe agricultural sector, employment levels had fallen. Inurban areas,
livelihoods were dominated by daily wage labor inthe informal sector. Employment opportunities inthe
formal private and public sectors had fallen over the last decade; at the same time there had been an
increase inopportunities inthe informal sector.

Poverty and ownership of land and livestock

25.     Besides being a critical productive asset, land i s also
important for a number of other key determinants of                   Fig. 12:Distributionof ruralpopulationin NWFPby
                                                                         ,              landownership

opportunities, and social and political empowerment.          In            L l D                                       I

NWFP, ownership of agricultural land i s found to be closely
associated with poverty in rural areas. Poverty incidence
declines notably for households owning 1 hectare of land or
more, and to almost zero for households with more than 4
hectares. More than 16percent of those owning 1-4 hectares                 nolandin Ocha<=l Icha<=Z 2cha-4          4cha

and 53 percent of those owning more than 4 hectares of land                  hhoM

belong to the top quintile, compared to only 9 percent of             DAll ruralWFP Bottomquintile(percapita consn.)


those owning no land. While individuals with no land constitute about 58 percent of the rural population,
they account for about 70 percent ofthe populationinthe bottodpoorestquintile (Figure 12).

26.      Land distribution in NWFP also appears to             Table 4: Land OwnershiDinrural NWFP
have marginally deteriorated between 1998-99 and                                                   YOof population
2001-02 (Table 4). There has been a small increase        Land OwnershipCategory
in the proportion of rural landless population over
this period, and a decline inthe proportion of those      No LandOwned

who are marginal landowners, while the proportion         >O - 1 hectare

significant change; however itdoes suggest that landownership i s not becoming more equal duringrecent
years.

27.      Given that the poor are unlikely to own a significant amount o f land, livestock is often a key
livelihood asset for them, providing critical resources as well as act as a stock to draw from in times o f
shocks. In this context, an observed decrease in the number o f livestock due to the drought and the
reduced pasture available at the PPA sites on the plains and in the arid or semi-arid (barani) areas is
indicative of an increase inpoverty and vulnerability inthese areas. For example at the two sites inbarani
Karak district, farmers may have had flocks of over 100 sheep or goats in the past, but over the last
drought stricken years this had fallen to only 4 - 5 per household. Inthe low mountain sites, in spite o f
drought conditions, livestock remainedan integral part of the farming and livelihood strategies.

                                                                                                                Page 8 of I 7

Access to natural resources

28.     Giventhat they lack productiveassets like land and livestock, the poor are often highlyreliant on
naturalresources for livelihoods -especially ina province like NWFP with extensive mountainous areas.
The PPA suggests that a number of trends are perceived to be affecting the natural resource base - the
increasing prevalence o f drought, deforestation, falling livestock numbers and fragmentation o f land-
holdings -with severe impact on livelihoods and vulnerabilities incertain areas ofthe province.

29.     Naturalresources available to poor people, and the importance of these resources, vary across the
three eco-regional zones. Inthe arid and semi-arid PPA sites, while much land i s cultivable, agnculture
i s mainly rain-fed and productivity i s low. The availability o f water for irrigation i s adversely affected by
drought, financial constraints on maintenance, and violation of property rights by large landowners. The
drought, decreasing land productivity and chronic poverty escalated distress land sales that resulted in
increased migration in search of work. Agriculture at the sites inlow mountain areas is also rain-fed and
dominated by subsistence food crop production. Inthe high mountainousforest regions, agricultural land
was relatively scarce. At the PPA sites of Kohistan and Swat, forest resourcesprovidedmore income and
livelihood opportunities than agriculture. However, ownership rights and control over these resources
varied: insome areas, local communities hadextensive rights while inothers, rights were more restricted.

30.      Due to a number o f factors like the degradation o f natural resources, changes incropping pattems
and continued drought, there was a perception that food insecurity across rural sites had increased at the
household level over recent years. As well as being a longer-termtrend, variations infood security levels
also occur seasonally: shortages of wheat, the staple food, are most acutejust after sowing andjust before
harvest.

Poverty and human development

31.      Poverty i s also characterized by low level of             fig. 13:Distributionof NWFP populationbyeducation
human capability, manifested in deficient outcomes in                                 of householdhead
education and health. The importance o f human capital                     e


i s seen, firstly, by the strong correlation between the
education level of household head and poverty
incidence (Figure 13).       Households whose head has
never attended school constitute 62 percent of the
population o f NWFP, but account for 71 percent of the
bottom quintile. Incontrast, 16percent of the population
from households whose headhas had education of matic                  0 All MNFPm Bottomquintile(percapitaconsn.)
level or above constitute 11 percent of the poorest
quintile. Poverty incidence declines with higher levels o f education: 30 percent of individuals living in
households whose head has never been to school belong to the bottom quintile; this falls to 24 percent
when the household headhas attendedprimary school and 20 percent when helshe has finished school.

 32.     Access to safe drinking water and sanitationare important determinants o fhealth, and a strong
association between these indicators and consumption poverty indicates the health challenges faced by
poor households. Table 5 shows that in2001-02, ,51percent o f households inthe bottom quintile rely on
potentially unsafe open sources for drinkingwater, 68 percent have no access to drains and 34 percent do
not have toilet facilities inside their homes. These proportions fall progressively for higher quintiles, to
 18,43 and 9 percent respectivelyfor the top quintile.

                                                                                                            Annex D

33.      A comparison between 1998-99 and 2001-02                      Table 5: Access to water and sanitation
reveals no discemible improvement in access to
drinlungwater between theyears, amarginalreduction

basic services are available from the CIET survey                  Total

households and households designated as "very                      Total

supply.5

35.      Nationally, access to and satisfaction with public sewagehanitation services were found to be low
-just 12percent ofhouseholdswere satisfied and over half hadno government sewage services at all. In
NWFP, 15 percent of householdswere satisfied with sanitation facilities. As inthe case of water supply,
households designated as "very vulnerable" were less likely to report satisfaction with or access to
government sewage system or be located in communities with a government sewage system, compared
with less vulnerable households.

36.      Connectivity to electricity,             piped gas and         Table 6: Connectivity to electricity, gas and
telephones affects the ability of households to gain access
to information and opportunities related to education, health
and employment.          Table 6 shows that connectivity to
telephones is strongly correlated with economic status in
NWFP.        The correlation i s far weaker for electricity
connections, since a large majority o f the population is
connected. The proportiono f population connected to gas -                         72.4         3.6           11.6

overall connectivity to gas and telephones has changed very
little between 1998-99 and 2001-02, although the rich-poor
disparity seems to have worsened somewhat. Connectivity
to electricity has improved overall, by around 4 percentage                        74.0         1.8           2.2

                                                                        4          85.4         5.8           19.9
37.      The CIET survey report reveals that 56 percent of
households in NWFP report satisfaction with electricity
supply, whichis lessthan the national average of 63 percent,

'A   vulnerability index was constructed from information about type of roof construction, room occupancy and type of
occupation of the mainbreadwinner (for details, see CIET report).

                                                                                                PageIOof17

but more than the satisfaction rates in Sindh and Balochistan. For both gas and electricity, very
vulnerable households are less likely to have any supply or be satisfied with the services than do less
vulnerable households.

38.     Access and satisfaction with roads and transport facilities are other important indicators that
signify connectivity with markets, and education and health facilities. According to the CIET survey, 31
and 59 percent of households nationally reported satisfaction with roads and public transport respectively
in their areas. The corresponding figures were 40 and 57 percent for NWFP, which ranks it as first
among provinces in terms o f satisfaction with roads. The rural-urban divide is the most significant
feature for these indicators, with urban areas reporting much higher satisfaction with roads and public
transport.

39.     Thus access to and satisfaction with some basic serviceslike water supply and roads appear to be
better for NWFP than for other provinces, and for others similar to those for the rest o f the country.
However, the overall figures are still low and (as i s the case for the entire country) strongly associated
with poverty. Poor (or vulnerable) households as well as poorer communities are less likely to have
access to basic services - including safe drinking water, sewage facilities and electricity supply - or be
satisfied with those services, even where they do exist.

Socio-economic relationships and law and order

40.     Poverty i s commonly associated with lack of voice in influencing decisions at community and
policy making levels. In the PPA for NWFP, lack o f empowerment is articulated as a fundamental
experience o f the poor in all spheres o f their social, cultural and economic lives. Moreover, social
constructs such as gender, ethnicity and caste amplify the nature of powerlessness, with the result that
there exists a large degree o f intersection betweenthe poor and the disadvantaged social groups. Inurban
areas, for instance, migrants from rural areas and refugees are often excluded from wider society on the
basis of their ethnic and social identity. The majority of the traditional occupational castes, the Kammis,
are amongst the poor and poorest. The cultural status of these groups tends to be low, their role in
decision-malung extremelylimited and their livelihoods often highly dependent on the well-being o f the
wider society. The poor are also found to be less connected to community networks and the associated
social capital, due to the lack of time and money along with the stigma attached to poverty.

41.     The PPA study also indicates a strong gender dimension to poverty and well-being in NWFP.
Discrimination against female children manifested itself at the PPA sites interms o f less access to food,
healthcare and education, which results inpoor education and health outcomes among women. PIHS data
shows female literacy rate in NWFP to be as low as 15 percent for the province (11 percent for rural
areas), compared to a male literacy rate of 54 percent (5 1percent inrural areas). Women and children are
often the most affected by food insecurity as they are the last priority inthe intra-household distribution
of food. Many women, and particularly poor women, often report exclusion from rights like sharing
rights inproperty and inheritance, the rightto mobility, and the power to influence marital decisions.

42.     Poverty i s also often associatedwith vulnerability to law and order problems, often due to lack o f
access to and relationships with authorities like the police. According to the CIET report, only 22 percent
of householdrespondents inall o f Pakistan would go to the police for a problem of personal safety. This
figure was slightly better for NWFP (25 percent); the gender differential was however the highest in
NWFP, with female respondents far less likely to seek police assistance than male respondents. On the
question of whether police in their community made the respondent safe, as well as on satisfaction with
contactswith the police, NWFP fares significantly better than other provinces.

43.      Poverty plays a large role inthese perceptions -respondents from "very vulnerable" households
were less likely to contact the police for a threat to personal safety or property across the country, inurban

                                                                                                                        Annex D
                                                                                                                  Page I1 of 17

and rural areas, and irrespective of whether there was a police station in the community.                                   These
households were also less likely to feel safer with the presence o f police in their community. "Very
vulnerable" households are also likely to report fewer contacts with the police, which suggestpoor access
to police services for suchhouseholds.

44.        Thus the poor inNWFP, as inthe entire country, suffer from lack of empowerment and voice -
and this i s manifestedindisadvantagesinterms of access to social networks and authorities for redresso f
law and order problems. Available evidence also suggests that lack of gender equality i s an important
issue inNWFPthat exacerbatesthe other inequitiesbrought about by economic and social differences.

EducationandHealthinNWFP

45.        Achieving long-term sustained growth in income to reduce poverty in Palustan would require
substantial improvements in human capital.6 Given that, it i s important to take a close look at the key
indicators for education and health in NWFP, to identify the critical challenges as well as the progress
made inrecent years. It i s also important to bear inmindthat the outcomes in education and health are
closely associatedwith the access to and quality ofpublic service delivery, and the discussion of available
evidence on public services will help understand the shortcomings that would have to be overcome in
order to achieve better outcomes.

  According to various publications (see Pakistan Development Policy Review and Poverty Assessment, World Bank (2002), and
 Easterly, W: Pakistan S Critical Constraint: Not the Financing Gap, but the Social Gap (2001)), improving Pakistan's deficient
 outcomes in human development, in other words closing what they term as the "social gap", is imperative for achieving long-term

50.       A more complete picture o f challenges ineducation emerges from looking at other indicators of
education attainment (Figures 15a, b and c). These show the pattern of late entry into school for both
boys and girls inNWFP, and highdropout rates for beyond a certain age. Comparisonbetween boys and
girls for NWFPrevealthat not only i s the rate o fentry into school lower for girls than for boys o fall ages,
butgirls also start droppingout of school at an earlier age and at ahigherrate. Comparing girls inNWFP
with those inrest o fPalustan, the former are found to have lower rate o fentry into schools, withthe result
that proportion of girls who have never attended school is higher in NWFP for all ages. Table 9
summarizes these observations with averages for all relevant ages, showing clearly the gender gaps in
NWFP, and those between outcomes for girls inNWFP and averages for the rest o f the country.

 strong for girls: 44 percent of girls o f age 10-20                                                        53.4          24.46

this i s likely to induce a virtuous cycle o f improving education outcomes among children, and girls in
particular.

Selected health indicatorsfor NWFP

often entail complex issues that are best measured by specialized surveys. A few indicators are presented

Service delivery in education and health in i?EFP

58.       The outcomes described above indicate the acute challenge faced by NWFP inachievingprogress
consistent with the long-term MillenniumDevelopment Goals or the medium-termtargets outlined inthe
country's PRSP. These are similar ina number o f areas to those faced by the country as a whole; but in
specific areas, notably for indicators relatedto gender equality ineducation and health, the province faces
even steeper challenges. As shown above, between 1998-99 and 2001-02, tangible progress has been
achieved inNWFP for critical indicators like enrollments, particularly inrural areas, among females and
among the poor - more than what i s seen for the country as a whole. For some key indicators like
immunization rates, while the evidence on progress since 1998-99 i s unclear, the province on the whole
ranks ahead of the country averages. Other indicators, like those for maternal health and access to safe
water and sanitation, have shown littleprogress and do not compare favorably with country averages.

59.       On the whole, in spite of some movements in the right direction in the recent past, closing the
gaps in achievement - by gender, economic status and ruralhrban - are critical challenges for NWFP.
These would require improving the outreach and quality o f public servicesto poor and vulnerable groups,
including women and remote rural areas. This section will document some insights available from
national surveys on access to and quality o f services in education and health, to better understand the
status of service delivery inthe province and the nature o f challenges facingpolicy-makers.

60.       Distance from school is found to be an important determinant of education outcomes inNWFP,
especially inrural areas as far as the presence o f girls' school i s concerned. While 94 percent of the rural
population of NWFP had a primary school for boys in the village according to the PMS (2001-02),
around 84 percent had a primary school for girls inthe village. Primary net enrollment rate for girls was

Coveragebasedon recall or record usedinTable 10 are also consistentwith what is found inother data sources (e.g. MICS).

                                                                                                                Annex D
                                                                                                           Page I5 of 17

40 percent when there was a school open to girls inside the village, and less than 25 percent when the
distance from the nearest school was more than 1km.' While these results underscore the importance o f
access to schools inremote rural areas for improving school attainment, mere availability of schools does
not necessarily imply access to quality education, or even to functional schools. Although evidence on
school quality i s not available fiom PIHS, a large number of other sources have indicated that quality of
schools i s indeedaprobleminPalustan, withNWFPbeingno exception.'

61.       One indicator of school quality i s the level of satisfaction of parents. According to the CIET
survey report, nationally, 55 percent of all households (60 percent for NWFP) were satisfied with
government education services intheir area. Across the country, 73 percent o f parents of children of age
5-9 attending govemment schools (including 72 percent for NWFP) reported satisfaction, compared to
nearly 90 percent o f those attending private/religious/non-formal schools. Thus while the figures for
NWFP compare well with those for the whole country, they still indicate much lower levels o f
satisfaction with government education than with private systems. Across Palustan, a child from a "very
vulnerable" household i s found to be twice as likely to attend a government school compared with one
from a less vulnerable household, suggesting that the poor -who rely on govemment schools more - are
also likely to be less satisfied with the quality of education available to their children.

62.       Inhealth service delivery, the PIHS data show some improvement inavailability of government
facilities, with the proportiono f population inrural NWFP who live ina village with a govemment health
facility having increased from 52 to 55 percent fiom 1998-99to 2001-02. However, quality o f services is
again a major concem: the CIET survey finds that only 23 percent of households inPalustan, including 27
percent of those inNWFP, reportedoverall satisfaction with government health services.

63.       In spite of availability and satisfaction rates in NWFP being close to the national averages, a
relatively high proportion o f CIET survey households in NWFP reported using govemment health
facilities - 59 percent compared to only 31 percent nationally. Notably, the travel costs to reach
govemment health services were the hghest in Balochistan and NWFP (average cost inNWFP was 30
percent higher than the country average), likely due to the geography of these provinces. The cost o f
health care also appears to be the highest inNWFP - average total cost for a visit to a govemment health
facility during the 3 months preceding the survey for the most common ailment (fever) was around 50
percent higher than the country average. Notably, across the country including NWFP, there were no
discernible difference on the likelihood of paying for government health services, or the average amounts
paid for services, between highly vulnerable and less vulnerable households, male and female users, or
urbanandrural users.

64.       Inrelationto visits inthe last 3 months, 60 percent ofhouseholds inNWFPreport satisfaction
with their contact with the govemment health services - the country average was 62 percent. These
figures have to be seen inthe context of the fact that 82 and 76 percent o f households nationally reported
satisfaction with their contact with private qualified and unqualified practitioners respectively. People
also appear to be less satisfied with government practitioners inareas, like BalochistanandNWFP, where
they use them more, suggesting that government facilities are generally used not for their quality, but
because of a lack of accessible or affordable altematives. The most common reasons for dissatisfaction
were the health problemnot being solved, non-availability o f medicines inthe facility, andpoor quality of
servicesor staff.

65.       Thus as far as services ineducation and health are concerned, the situation inNWFP is not very
different from that for the country as a whole, although there are some issues more relevant for the


  Access to schools is found important inthe CIET report (2003) also, especially for girls' enrollment.

province. In education, the imperatives are to expand access to school for girls in rural areas, and to
improve the quality o f public schooling. This would be particularly critical to close the rich-poor gap in
education outcomes, since the poor are much more likely to rely on govemment schools, which have far
lower satisfaction ratings compared to private schools. The fact that gender gaps in education are large
even inurban areas where there i s greater access to and choice o f schools suggests that factors other than
the availability o f schools, like parental attitudes, may also be important. To overcome these, there is a
possible role for public programs to create demand-side incentives - for example, by encouraging girls to
enroll and stay in school through scholarships for girls or conditional transfers to households - to
complement supply-side policies to improve service delivery.

66.      Inhealth, the relatively highreliance on public providers inNWFP, perhaps due to a lack of
private alternatives relative to other parts o f Pakistan, would make it all the more imperative for public
services to be improved to achieve better outcomes. An additional issue in NWFP i s that o f relatively
highcosts o ftravel due to the difficult terrain andlongdistances, which canbe reducedby expanding the
network o f public facilities to remote areas. Improving the affordability o f health services for the poor
may also require providing targeted services to the poor and the vulnerable, which does not seem to be the
case at present based on the statistics on costs.

ClosingRemarks

67.      To conclude, it i s useful to recap the main insights from this note. Historically, NWFP has been
the poorest province inPakistan, and inspite o f some closing o f the gap inrecent years, it continuedto be
the poorest in 2001-02. Since 1998-99, the increase in poverty has been less for NWFP than for the
country as a whole and marginal in absolute terms - this has occurred mainly through a fall in average
consumption levels, while some degree o f pro-poor redistribution appears to have partly mitigated that
effect. Sectoral data on wages and employment seem to confirm what i s suggested by the consumption
trends, that lack of growth    -  most likely caused by successive years o f drought preceding the survey -
was the primary reason for the observed small rise inpoverty.

68.      Consumption poverty inNWFP, quite like inthe rest o f the country, i s associated with a number
o f factors that constrain the poors' eaming capacity, ranging from lack o f opportunities for productive
employment to poor education and health exacerbated by lack o f access to basic services and amenities.
Poverty i s also reinforced by social exclusion, vulnerability to law and order problems and gender-based
 inequities.

 69.     Improving human capability i s a pre-requisite for achieving sustainable growth and poverty
reduction, and there the primary issues inNWFP are similar to those for the country as a whole - large
rich-poor, urban-rural and gender based divides in education and health outcomes. Although there i s a
 long path to traverse in order to achieve the long-term MDG targets, there are encouraging signs o f
 progress inrecent years that have occurred inspite o f stagnation inconsumption poverty: enrollment rates
 have improved in NWFP in the recent past more than in the rest o f the country, immunization rates are
 higher and infant mortality significantly lower than the rest of the country, and access to and satisfaction
 with basic services like water supply and roads rank better than in other provinces. Acute challenges
 remain in improvingindicators related to maternal health, and in reducing the gender gaps inhealth and
 education. In education for instance, even after recent improvements, large gender gaps -the highest in
 the country - have adverse implications for the prospects of future generations given the importance of
 mother's education for child's schooling.

 70.     Achieving progress would require improvements in access to and quality o f public services.
 Current evidence indicates that while NWFP largely compares well with.other provinces in terms of
 users' satisfaction with education and health facilities, due to its difficult terrain, the costs o f accessing
 health facilities are relatively large. Moreover, inabsolute terms (and relative to private facilities) level o f

                                                                                                     Annex D
                                                                                                  Page I7 of 17

satisfaction with public facilities i s low, and more so for poor or vulnerable households. At the same
time, suchhouseholds dependpredominantly on government facilities, which make improvingthe quality
of public services and targeting them better to the poor imperative for poverty reduction. In addition,
given that gender gaps are not simply a reflection of lack of facilities but also o f social and cultural
attitudes, strategiesto improve service delivery may have to be complemented by demand-side incentives
for female education.

71.     Finally, it i s important to recognize that policy initiatives to improve service delivery ineducation
and health in NWFP - as in other provinces - are closely linked with the ongoing devolution that i s
seeking to fundamentally change the relationships between service providers and clients. The success of
these efforts thus rides on the question o f progress of devolution, as well as specific programs by the
provincial government. Understanding and assessing these initiatives - in the context of the landscape
and the challenges outlined so far - will require a close look at the efforts on the ground, and should be
the subject of a future exercise.

       PUBLIC FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND MANAGEMENT INNWFP


1.      Financial management and accountability issues are at the center o f the NWFP Government's
reform program. Improvement in fiscal management, quality o f public accounts, civil service and public
accountability, andprocurement are amongthe key reform targets.

2.      A preliminary Provincial Financial Accountability Profile was prepared for the NWFP province
before the first provincial SAC and based on its findings, a Reform Programhas been implemented inthe
run-upto SAC1and SAC2. Morerecentlya full ProvincialFinancialAccountability Assessment (PFAA)
was completed by January 2004 that feeds into the main Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) report for Pakistan. This assessment covers accountability issues for all tiers o f government in
the province. Below follows a summary of main findings inthe PFAA and an overview o f agreed reforms
ahead inthis area.

Accountability framework

3.       The accountability framework inNWFP follows essentially the federal system and i s designed to
support the achievement of the economic objectives set through various policies, action plans and strategy
papers of the provincial government. Budget is debated and approved by the legislature and sent back to
the line departments for execution. Board o f Revenue and Excise & Taxation are two major revenue
administration departments. All receipts are deposited with the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) or the
National Bank o f Palustan acting as an agent o f SBP. The overall funds are managed into two accounts
including the Provincial Consolidated Fund and Public Account.           Based on a medium-term budget
framework the required inputsto meet medium-term objectives are translated into the annual expenditure
budget.   Line departments give their separate budget proposals for the development and recurrent
components o f the budget. The development projects are appraised and evaluated by the Planning and
DevelopmentDepartment whereas the overall budget is compiled at the Finance Department. The overall
funds are managed into two accounts - the Provincial Consolidated Fundand the Public Account. There
is also a separate Food Account. With a few exceptions, all expenditure bills are submitted to the District
Accounts Offices / Treasury Offices which, after the pre-audit and budgetary scrutiny, issue cheques for
payment. Later these offices maintain the accounts o f the provincial government. The Auditor General
of Palustan (AGP), through the Provincial and District audit infrastructure, perfoms the statutory audit as
required under the Constitution and submits his reports to the legislature (i.e. the provincial assembly).
Public Accounts Committee i s mandatedby the legislature to perform a detailed legislative scrutiny.

4.       Achievements and Outstanding Issues under the Medium-Term Reform Program: In
general, public financial management in NWFP is improving under the on-going reform initiatives but
results remain mixed across the overall government financial management system. Among the key areas
o f reform measures in the financial accountability area, NWFP has demonstrated its commitment to
buildingon the achievements registered since the SAC1was initiated. These achievements have covered
subject areas in budgeting and budget execution, accounting, internal control and financial reporting,
external auditing, and legislative oversight. As being only one o f two provinces in Pakistan that has
carried out a complete provincial financial accountability assessment (PFAA), NWFP has owned up to
the assessed gaps and has taken upon itself to design a framework o f a time bound action-plan to
remedyingthose identified gaps.

5.       The framework for improving the accountability domain, as delineated in the PFAA i s covered
under the following headings: (i)  Budget preparation and execution; (ii)   Accounting, financial reporting,
and internal controls; (iii)External auditing; and (iv) Legislative oversight.

                                                                                                   Annex E
                                                                                                Page 2 of 4

6.       Budget preparation and execution: The Budget preparation process is encumbered by a
combination ofreliance on the federal government for upto 90% ofreceipts and a high share of recurrent
expenditures. It leaves little fiscal space for development expenditures and new spending priorities.
There i s a need to strengthen the relationship between the long term planning framework and yearly
budgets. The existing overlap between the provincial and district budgets i s an issue that could weaken
financial accountability outcomes. Budgetary process i s more procedural and incremental innature and
not directly based on the desiredperformance outcomes. This could be obviated by the introduction of
performance based budgeting under concept of a medium term budget framework that the province has
already initiated. There is dearth of specialized people in finance and planning offices at the local
government level to support critical capacity needs in the devolution process. In the area of budget
execution, there are inherent weaknesses in monitoring spending programs, outcomes, due to timeliness
of information availability as well as weak information generation of actual versus plannedexpenditures.

7.       Accounting,Jinancial reporting, and internal controls: The lack of progress inresolving difficult
management and organization issues involving both federal and provincial accounting staff together with
the low technical capacity of staffhasbeenan inhibitingfactor inthe further enhancementofthe progress
already registered inthe province. Financial management systems are largely manual except for some in-
house computerizationactivities in 17 out of the 24 districts and roll-out of the new automated accounting
system under PIFRA that i s currently at the pilot stage. Inthe short to medium term, hybrid financial
records will remain cumbersome and lack the accessibility and flexibility o f on-line reporting. The
internal audit function, established in 19provincial departments, i s weak and needs to be revitalized with
additional resources along with an enhancedrole based on internationalbenchmarks. An internal audit
manual has been produced under the auspices of the PIFRA project to support the progressive
establishment of functional internal audit units at the federal governments level. The province needs to
embrace the opportunities offered by this development and strengthenits internal audit function. At the
district and sub-district levels, financial accountability i s governed by different rules and procedures.
Notwithstanding these shortcomings, NWFP stands out as one province inPakistan that has made a most
substantial progress inthe implementation o f the PIFRA particularly because of the siting of the initial
pilot sites inthe province as well as beingproactive inembracing the financial managementproject.

8.       External Auditing: This function operates under the direct responsibility o f the AGP. Improved
capacity has already been developed at the provincial level but local audit lacks capacity and power to
audit to the same standards as the AGP. A District Audit infrastructure has been established, during2003,
under the responsibility of the Director General, District Audit. This new office will support the
decentralization initiative for district governments, and over time for the lower levels of government. In
the short run however, and before the district audit infrastructure, under the aegis o f the AGP, i s
strengthened and matures, timeliness inthe production o f audit reports will continue to be affected.

9.       Legislative Oversight: Oversight by the provincial assembly of budget activities is weak due to
limited technical capacity.      The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Assembly has been
reconstituted after a long period o f break but the Committee has not, so far, made meaningful progress in
reviewing audited reports and accounts of the Auditor General o f Pakistan. The situation stands
compounded by the fact that the information received by the PAC i s often complex, difficult to
understand, and less timely. There i s also weak enforcement and implementation of the oversight
recommendations.

 10.     Main Recommendations of the PFAA: The NWFP PFAA was finalized on 30 January 2004
and included a set o f actions required to be pursued as part o f the province's overall financial
management reform program. These measures, while linked to action programs under the remit o f the
federal government, also contain stand-alone actions that the province needs to implement in order to

                                                                                                  Annex E
                                                                                                Page 3 of 4

further enhance its accountability process and outcomes. The framework of key actions, as contained in
the summarized action matrix below, are delineated as follows:

        Strengthen the budget process through training of staff on budget execution, and firm up the
        introduction of the MTBF and performance budgeting techniques as well as delegate the budget
        making process for local governments to local authorities consistent with the Local Government
        Ordinance.
        Improvement in the reconciliation framework and status o f receipts, expenditures, suspense
        accounts, and intergovernmental accounts, and progressive closure of Personal Ledger Accounts
        and creation of no new ones.
        Development of a strong internal control framework in all tiers of government and establishment
        of internal audit functions in all provincial departments with potentialities for roll-out to lover
        layers of government.
        Resolutiono fthe dual control o f DAOsby the Finance Department and the Accountant General's
        Department to allow for uniformprocesses, directives, and accounting results.
        Holding o f regular and punctual DAC meetings to resolve audit paragraphs in a timely manner
        and thus allow for earlier releases of audit reports and accounts to the provincial Assembly.
    m   Timelypresentation of audit reports and accountsto the Assembly bythe Govemor to ensurethat
        the PAC carries out its reviews thereof ina more expeditious and timely manner.
    m   Strengthen the PAC Secretariat, improve the capacity o f PAC members, and convene regular
        PAC meetingsto review and clear backlogs of audit reports and accounts.
    m   Establishment of a systematic mechanism to ensure implementation and follow-up of PAC
        recommendations.

 11.    The assessment concludes that there is a wide range of opportunities for introducing institutional
reforms for strengthening public financial accountability in NWFP despite substantial progress having
been already achieved.

 12.    The government has made satisfactory progress in the reform agenda agreed under the World
Bank's first Structural Adjustment Credit to the province and some of the summary recommendations
given above formed part o f the extension of the reform measures of the program. These reform measures,
when judiciously implemented, would help to strengthen the systems and capacity requiredto provide
enhanced coverage to the fiduciary risks that may be associated with adjustment lending. The system in
place, however, does provide reasonable safeguards for reliance on government financial accountability
systems to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended.

   PAKISTAN-IMF StaffAssessment of RecentDevelopmentsandNear-TermOutlook

Macroeconomicdevelopments and policies

1.      Macroeconomic performance continues to be favorable, and the outlook i s positive. Economic
growth i s expected to reach close to 6 percent in 2003/04 (July-June). Growth is broad-based, but most
pronounced in the export-oriented, large-scale manufacturing. For 2004/05, a growth rate o f 6 percent
could very well be realized, buildingon the current momentum, but provided that external demand and
local weather conditions remain supportive. Sustaining or raising this growth rate over the medium term,
as envisaged by the authorities, will require a substantial increase in private and public investment,
accompanied by significant improvements in productivity. Average annual inflation i s projected about
4 percent in2003/04 and 5 percent in2004/05. However, 12-month inflation has accelerated to 6 percent
inApril 2004. Price pressures stem from strong domestic and external demand, highcapacity utilization
in some sectors, risingpetroleum prices, and pressures emanating from the partial liberalization of the
wheat market.

2.      External vulnerabilities have been further reduced. Exports continued to show strong growth in
2003/04, while private transfers declined somewhat, but remained sizable. Imports grew even more
rapidly, with a shift toward raw materials and machinery. Still, the current account (excluding official
transfers) i s projectedto remain in surplus (about 2 percent o f GDP). The State Bank o f Palustan (SBP)
absorbed part of the foreign exchange inflows and its gross official reserves increased to $11 billion by
end-March 2004, equivalent to over seven months of imports. Consequently, the Palustani rupee has
remained largely stable in the past few months. For 2004/05, the current account surplus i s projected to
diminishfixther, and the build-up of international reserves would slow. Reflecting early repayments of
$1.1 billion in expensive Asian Development Bank loans and lower-than-expected program and project
financing, Pakistan's extemal public and publicly guaranteeddebt is estimated to fall by three percentage
points to 44 percent of GDP this year. Pakistan also successfully re-entered the international capital
markets with the issuance of a $500 million five-year Eurobond with a 6% percent coupon in February
2004.

3.      Fiscal objectives for 2003/04 are expected to be met. The overall deficit (excluding grants) should
be contained to 4 percent of GDP, with Central Board of Revenue collection somewhat ahead of
projections andmost expenditures lower than budgeted, except for defense spending. Social- and poverty-
related expenditures are expected to reach 5.4percent o f GDP, up from 5.2percent of GDP in the
previous year. The public debt ratio i s projected to fall to 84percent o f GDP. The authorities have
indicatedthat the 2004/05 budget would be based on continuedfiscal prudence, and carefully balance the
need for increased social and development spending and further debt reduction. To this end, social and
development expenditures would be raised by about 0.2 percent of GDP, and Central Board of Revenue
collection i s projected to increase by a similar amount, leaving the overall deficit (excluding grants)
unchanged at 4 percent of GDP.

4.       With a continued increase in net foreign assets, broad money growth could reach 17.5 percent in
2003/04. h v a t e sector credit growth accelerated sharply to 29 percent year-on-year at end-March 2004,
reflecting the strong economic recovery, combined with low interest rates and ample liquidity in banks.
With highmoney and credit growth-as        well as a surging stock market and real estate prices-the   SBP
has appropriately started to tighten monetary policy modestly, and short-term interest rates have begun to
edge up. For the months ahead, the SBP will probably need to further tighten monetary policy to slow
monetary expansion and contain further price pressures, thus ensuring that the inflationtarget for 2004/05
can be met.

Structural reforms

5.       Good progress was made in advancing structural reforms, inparticular inthe fiscal and financial
sectors. However, some delays occurred inenergy sector reforms.

6.       Fiscal reforms focused on improving revenue administration and budgeting. Universal
self-assessment for income tax was introduced as of tax year 2002/03, inter alia to minimize taxpayers'
interaction with tax officials. A new sales tax office in Karachi became operational in October 2003.
Additional large taxpayer units and medium taxpayer offices are being set-up in major cities. A pilot
customs house will shortly open in Karachi. Meanwhile, corporate income tax rates will be reduced
further asplannedwith a view to aligning all top income tax rates at 35 percent. Inaddition, some import
duties on raw materials andmachinery will be reduced to help foster investment. A medium-termbudget
framework i s being developed with assistance of the U.K. Department for International Development.
The 2004/05 federal budget will be based on the new accounting model which will subsequently also be
fully adopted in the provinces. A draft fiscal responsibility law has been submitted to parliament in
October 2003 and would hopefully be approved soon to institutionalize the current prudent approach to
fiscal policies. The law would mandate, among others, reduction o fpublic debt to 60 percent of GDP over
the next decade. Inaddition, the authorities should pushaheadwith the.preparationofa `benami' law that
would make illegal this practice of holding or selling an asset inthe name of one person for the benefit of
another.

7.       The recent Financial System Stability Assessment found good compliance with international
supervisory standards and considered the financial system to be fundamentally sound, though the
securities market could be vulnerable to systemic risk.The modernization o f Pakistan's banlung sector i s
continuing. The government sold a majority stake in Habib Bank Limited in December 2003, and now
over three quarters of banlung system assets are inprivate hands. As a result of the transformation of a
predominantly state-owned and weak banking system into one that i s predominantly privately owned,
financial  soundness indicators have greatly improved in recent years, with banks showing greater
resilience to credit, market, and liquidity risks. As next steps, the authorities should develop a strategy for
the privatization of National Bank of Pakistan, and resolve Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan as
well as Allied Bank o f Pakistan Limitedin a least cost manner. The authorities have prepared a revised
formula which links the semiannual adjustment of National Savings Scheme (NSS) rates more directly to
changes in Pakistan Investment Bond yields. Still, a subsidy element will remain in NSS rates.
Submission to parliament o f the draft anti-money laundering law, which had previously been envisaged
for January 2004, should now be on top of the authorities' agenda.

8.       Progress in energy sector reforms continues to be mixed. Petroleum prices have been adjusted
fortnightly largely in line with international price movements, though on some occasions, petroleum
development surcharge rates were varied to bufferthe impact on consumer prices. Reforms inthe power
sector have proven to be more difficult-politically     as well as technically-and     are proceeding slowly.
Notably, delays occurred inthe formulation and implementationo f the govemment's electricity tariff and
subsidy policy and a framework for the setting of regional electricity tariffs. Still, the Water and Power
Development Authority and the Karachi Electric Supply Company did meet the end-December 2003
accrual balance targets set in their Financial Improvement Plans by considerable margins, because of
better availability of low cost hydro-power and reduced operational losses.

Status ofFundrelations

9.       Palustan's request for a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reductionand Growth Facility
 (PRGF), with access of 100percent of quota (SDR 1.03 billion), was approved by the ExecutiveBoard on
December 6, 2001. The Executive Board concluded the sixth and seventh review under the PRGF on

                                                                                                  Annex J
                                                                                                Page 3 of 3
