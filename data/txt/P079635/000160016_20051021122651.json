Pakistan has borne the brunt of the earthquake,\n            especially 5 northeastern districts of the North West\n            Frontier Province (NWFP) and three districts covering most\n            of had Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with enormous loss of life\n            and devastation of infrastructure and property.  The Bank is\n            preparing a proposed package of US$ 470 million to help\n            Pakistan deal with the reconstruction effort and safeguard\n            the on-going reform and poverty reduction program, which\n            will include supplemental financing of US$ 150 million under\n            the Poverty Reduction Support Program (PRSC 1) and of US$ 50\n            million under the Second Structural Adjustment Credit for\n            the North West Frontier Province (NWFP SAC 2). This report\n            covers the proposed Supplemental Financing of US$ 50\n            million, which will support the sustained implementation of\n            the NWFP SAC2 reform program, and help finance part of the\n            gap in resources incurred as a result of the earthquake. The\n            NWFP SAC 2 is the second in a series of three operations to\n            support the implementation of the Government of NWFP's\n            Provincial Reform Program. The NWFP SAC 2 has been\n            supporting implementation of the provincial\n            government's reform program, and is based on five\n            pillars: (1) Accelerating economic growth and promoting\n            private sector development; (2) Accelerating human\n            development and improving social service delivery; (3)\n            Fiscal reforms; (4) Governance reforms in public financial\n            management and procurement; and (5) Reforms to achieve an\n            efficient, accountable, and service oriented civil service.\n            It is critical that the provincial fiscal framework remains\n            sustainable while relief and rehabilitation takes place.\n            Supplemental program support will be an important source of\n            budget financing for the Government as it will provide\n            financing at a time when the impact of the disaster on\n            government revenues is unknown; and there is an urgent need\n            for additional government expenditure. Supplemental\n            financing for NWFP SAC 2 will thus complement the support\n            for short term medium-term rehabilitation that will be\n            provided through the restructuring and reprogramming of\n            ongoing operations in the Bank's portfolio. It will\n            also complement the assistance provided by other\n            multilateral, in particular the ADB, and bilateral agencies.\n            Finally, the Supplemental Financing will contribute to\n            minimizing the risks to the overall reform program, maintain\n            the integrity of the transition to, and the preparation of,\n            the follow up operation-the first NWFP Development Policy Credit."}, "docdt": "2005-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
