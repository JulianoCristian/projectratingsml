sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            Among the lessons cited were the following: 1) Monitoring a\n            program must measure not only what has been accomplished,\n            but also what has not. 2) A large part of SAC2 funds were\n            spent on educational and health facilities; subsequent\n            operations must guarantees adequate funds for maintenance\n            and carry out that maintenance. 3) Provincial adjustment\n            loans can be critical to improving social services.  4) It\n            is better to proceed with a reform program credit even with\n            the risks of sub-national lending, new elections and\n            decentralization, if there is borrower ownership. 5) Timely\n            and reliable monitoring and evaluation depends on regular\n            updating of performance indicators and site visits to verify\n            data. 6) Improving service delivery requires the creation of\n            a district service. 7) Factor in higher revenue transfers\n            from changes in National Finance Commission (NFC) Awards\n            into the fiscal program only when an agreement on the NFC\n            materializes. 8) Capacity building efforts need to track\n            changes in levels of responsibility resulting from decentralization."}, "docdt": "2005-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
