The components are: 1) The\n            institutional support for program, and project management,\n            will provide foreign consulting, technical assistance, and\n            training to strengthen the Technical Privatization Office,\n            and concerned ministries, in privatization management.\n            Construction works will upgrade facilities, and equipment\n            supply will be procured. 2) The transactions support for\n            large enterprises, include financial/legal advisory services\n            for the sale of large scale enterprise assets. Thus, it is\n            expected that international consultants will address\n            associated policy, and regulatory issues towards competitive\n            market practices, on the sale of at least three of the five\n            largest government enterprises. 3) The transactions support\n            for small, and medium enterprises, will provide financial,\n            and legal advisory services, for sale preparations of some\n            fifty small/medium enterprise assets, as well as for\n            marketing, and procurement of those assets, including the\n            necessary associated policy, and regulatory practice\n            services. 4) The pre-privatization strategies for large\n            enterprises, encompass the process, and methodology for the\n            privatization of the five large enterprises, initiating\n            comprehensive policy, and institutional frameworks."}, "docdt": "1999-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
