This sixth statutory visit\n            to Chad took place five months after the beginning of oil\n            production, and two months after the first exports from the\n            offshore terminal off the Cameroonian coast. The mission\n            focused on the state of preparation of the Government for\n            managing and disbursing the oil revenues. It also continued\n            its oversight of the effectiveness of monitoring by the\n            Government agencies and examined progress in the various\n            projects and instruments for local and regional development.\n            Recommendations included the following: The oil company\n            should adhere to the standards and practices in the\n            operational phase; ensure that contractors and\n            sub-contractors adhere strictly to the Environmental\n            Management Plan; provide on-site supervisors needed\n            information and training; minimize environmental impacts and\n            disseminate information to the public about water quality\n            management, waste management, dust control, drilling mud,\n            soil restoration, worker health and hygiene, security and\n            potential dangers, accidental oil spills, enclave zones\n            studies, and business opportunities. Further recommendations\n            were made involving the regional development plan,\n            implementation of \"emergency measures\" projects,\n            decentralization, and consultation with civil society organizations."}, "docdt": "2004-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
