                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to improve the reliability and quality of medium voltage service to targeted retail electricity distribution systems.The project will
                         achieve this though investment in rehabilitating and increasing the capacity of existing distribution lines and substations and standardizing them to 22, 35 and 110
                         kilovolts (kV) . It will enable distribute systems to meet the growing demand more efficiently, provide better quality and quantity of electric power for productive uses,
                         and reduce power system losses. Technical assistance will complement the physical investment by supporting the development of the PCs into modern power
                         distribution utilities.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is making satisfactory progress. The project is on track to meet its development objectives. The construction work on majority of the 110kV lines and
                         substations is still on track to be completed by December 2012, i.e. 6 months ahead of the credit closing date. The PCs were able to develop/reinforce a closer collaboration with local
                         authorities in terms of land acquisition and compensation. Disbursements have improved since the last supervision mission, but there still is need for the PCs to further speed up their
                         disbursement.
