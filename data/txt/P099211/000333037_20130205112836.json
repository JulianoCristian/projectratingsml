of existing distribution lines\n            and substations and standardizing them to enable them to\n            meet the growing demand more efficiently, provide better\n            quality and quantity of electric power for productive uses,\n            and reduce power system losses. This environmental\n            assessment (EA) document evaluated impacts, as follows:\n            noise; dust; solid waste disposal; contamination to surface\n            water bodies; project location; maximum number of workers at\n            every construction site; means of transportation of\n            materials, equipment and machinery to the construction\n            sites; temporary and permanent land acquisition; number of\n            affected households; and Vietnamese laws and regulations. As\n            a result of this assessment the EA suggests mitigation\n            measures, including: avoid vegetation clearing as much as\n            possible; forbid use of herbicides and defoliants; cover\n            construction materials with canvas when transported on roads\n            to avoid spillage; water spray at the construction site near\n            residential areas to avoid dust propagation; to avoid noise\n            and vibration utilize machinery at permitted noise level;\n            hold public consultation to give notice of construction in\n            the evening hours; compensate for losses to agricultural\n            production, in accordance with policies of the Bank and\n            Vietnamese laws; inform local authorities and local people\n            of the date and time of electrical generation and danger\n            when power lines are live to avoid unfortunate tragedies;\n            and finally, comply with Vietnam's environmental\n            policy, legislation, institutional, regulatory framework,\n            international agreements relative to the protection of the\n            environment of which Vietnam is a signatory, and compliance\n            with the Bank's environmental, natural habitat areas,\n            and cultural heritages operational safeguards directives."}, "docdt": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
