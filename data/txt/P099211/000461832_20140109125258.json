Vietnam had an overall satisfactory outcome with the\n            performances of the Bank and the borrower being deemed\n            satisfactory as well. All six project development objective\n            indicators were fully achieved, as were the two intermediate\n            outcome indicators. The project objectives and design were\n            felt to be highly relevant to the development priorities of\n            the country. Significant lessons learned during project\n            implementation include: 1) selection of works contractors is\n            critical to successful delivery; 2) the manufacture and\n            delivery of equipment should be properly sequenced with\n            civil works; 3) project management is a core skill for any\n            power distribution company, and requires a range of skills;\n            4) the coordination between the authorities involved in the\n            project implementation needs to be strengthened further; 5)\n            significant delays in the procurement of goods have a very\n            negative impact on construction and the delivery of improved\n            services; 6) early, comprehensive, effective and on-going\n            engagement by power companies with all levels of local\n            government and with affected persons is essential to\n            resolving land acquisition and clearances; 7) economic\n            slowdowns can result in dramatic reductions in forecast load\n            growth; 8) community supervision of environmental safeguards\n            is a highly effective means of ensuring community ownership,\n            minimizing disputes, and having rapid and ongoing compliance\n            with environmental management plans; and 9) flexibility is\n            essential when a project has a large numbers of\n            sub-components that have to be implemented in difficult\n            areas over a long period of time."}, "docdt": "2013-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
