                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to improve the reliability and quality of medium voltage service to targeted retail electricity distribution systems.The project will
                         achieve this though investment in rehabilitating and increasing the capacity of existing distribution lines and substations and standardizing them to 22, 35 and 110
                         kilovolts (kV) . It will enable distribute systems to meet the growing demand more efficiently, provide better quality and quantity of electric power for productive uses,
                         and reduce power system losses. Technical assistance will complement the physical investment by supporting the development of the PCs into modern power
                         distribution utilities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Achievement of the PDO is highly likely. Project implementation progress is satisfactory and remaining construction works are expected to be completed by the project closing date of
                         June 30, 2013. Targets for 47 out of 48 key performance indicators have already been achieved and/or exceeded. The Project contributed to improvement of reliability and quality of
                         Medium Voltage (MV) service, as demonstrated by significant reductions achieved in project areas in: (i) interruption of MV service at MV/(Low Voltage) LV transformers; (ii) MV
                         system losses ; (iii) number and duration of voltage excursions outside normal ranges at MV/LV transformers; and (iv) overloading of MV lines. The average losses of MV system in
                         the project area are reduced from 6.41% to 4.74% compared to the target of 5.1%. The average percentage of MV lines overloaded in the project area is reduced from 12.5% to
                         2.33% compared to the target of 4.3%. In total, 3,950.7 km and 621,200 kVA of 22kV-35kV power lines and distribution transformer substations have been built and installed
                         compared to the target of 1,705km and 215,634kVA. Capacity of the 6 PCs has been improved and sound regulations and procedures of internal financial audit have been in place.
