This environmental\n            assessment (EA) document evaluated impacts, as follows:\n            noise; dust; solid waste disposal; contamination to surface\n            water bodies; project location; maximum number of workers at\n            every construction site; means of transportation of\n            materials, equipment and machinery to the construction\n            sites; temporary and permanent land acquisition; number of\n            affected households; and Vietnamese laws and regulations. As\n            a result of this assessment the EA suggests mitigation\n            measures, including: avoid vegetation clearing as much as\n            possible; forbid use of herbicides and defoliants; cover\n            construction materials with canvas when transported on roads\n            to avoid spillage; water spray at the construction site near\n            residential areas to avoid dust propagation; to avoid noise\n            and vibration utilize machinery at permitted noise level;\n            hold public consultation to give notice of construction in\n            the evening hours; compensate for losses to agricultural\n            production, in accordance with policies of the Bank and\n            Vietnamese laws; inform local authorities and local people\n            of the date and time of electrical generation and danger\n            when power lines are live to avoid unfortunate tragedies;\n            and finally, comply with Vietnam's environmental\n            policy, legislation, institutional, regulatory framework,\n            international agreements relative to the protection of the\n            environment of which Vietnam is a signatory, and compliance\n            with the Bank's environmental, natural habitat areas,\n            and cultural heritages operational safeguards directives."}, "docdt": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
