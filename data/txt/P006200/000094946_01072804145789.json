The Social Investment\n            Fund managed to implement social investments on a large\n            scale, was able to reach the poor, in all cases improved\n            physical infrastructure, and generated positive final\n            outcomes with its investments in health and water. The\n            lessons learned include: a) A lack of impact on school\n            achievement can be resolved by working more closely with the\n            Ministry of Education to design integrated interventions\n            that include infrastructure and teaching processes. b) High\n            administrative costs can be reduced by maintaining greater\n            stability in the amount of resources allocated to the Fund.\n            It is useful to explore mechanisms to provide greater\n            flexibility in staffing so that the SIF can adjust to\n            variation in demand. c) It is important to review the\n            subproject cycle and eliminate unnecessary steps in order to\n            avoid delays attributable to process within the Fondo Social\n            de Emergencia project cycle that are excessively expensive.\n            d) Delays due to the lack of counterpart resources from the\n            municipalities can be avoided by allocating more resources\n            to the municipalities. e) Sector ministries should be\n            involved in working with the SIF to maintain consistency of\n            sectoral policies."}, "docdt": "2001-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
