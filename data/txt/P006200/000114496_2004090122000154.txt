Dear Ms. Johansson :
     BOLIVIA   Swedish Administration Agreement Related to the
               Second Social Investment Fund (Cr. 2532-BO)
               Second Amendment of TF24848
1.
We refer to the Administration Agreement dated August 4, 1994 between the 
Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (Sweden) and the International Development 
Association (the Association) for the administration of certain funds to be made 
available by Sweden in respect of the Second Social Investment Fund Project in 
Bolivia.
2.
The Closing Date of the Swedish Grant Agreement dated September 7, 1994 between 
the Republic of Bolivia and the Association as administrator of grant funds provided 
by Sweden is June 30, 1996.  The Association has agreed to extend such Closing Date to 
June 30, 1997 because of some disbursement delays for investment in health.  
Therefore, we propose to replace the date "June 30, 1996" referred to in Section 5.01 
of the Administration Agreement, by the date "June 30, 1997". This amendment will 
enable the Administration Agreement to remain valid until June 30, 1997.
3.
This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall 
be an original, and shall become effective on the date upon which the Association 
dispatches to Sweden notice that the Association has received one fully executed 
original of this amendment letter.
4.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
the two counterparts of this amendment letter. Upon your confirmation, please return 
one fully executed original to us.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
