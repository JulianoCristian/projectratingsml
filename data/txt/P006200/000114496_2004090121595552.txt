Dear Mrs. Lewin:
Re:
BOLIVIA: Swedish Administration Agreement
First Amendment (TF24848)
(Related to Second Social Investment Fund (Cr. 2532-BO))
1.
We refer to the Administration Agreement dated August 4, 1994 between the 
Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (Sweden) and the International Development 
Association for the administration of certain funds to be made available by Sweden in 
respect of the Second Social Investment Fund Project in Bolivia.
2. 
The Closing Date of the Swedish Grant Agreement dated September 7,
1994 between the Republic of Bolivia and the Association as administrator of grant 
funds provided by Sweden is June 30, 1995. The Association has agreed to extend such 
Closing Date to June 3 )0, 1996 because the first disbursement of funds under such 
grant was received one month ago. Therefore, we propose to replace the date "June 30, 
1995" referred to in Section 5.01 of the Administration Agreement, by the date "June 
30, 1996". This amendment will enable the Administration Agreement to remain valid 
until June 30, 1996.
3.
This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall 
be an original, and shall become effective on the date upon which the Association 
dispatches to Sweden notice that the Association has received one fully executed 
original of this amendment letter.
4.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
the two counterparts of this amendment letter. Upon your conf~rrriation, please return 
one fully executed original to us.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
