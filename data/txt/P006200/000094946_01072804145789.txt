3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objective of the proposed operation was to continue assisting the Government to
improve coverage and quality of health, water supply, sanitation and education services targeting
primarily the rural poor, including indigenous peoples, disadvantaged women and children.
Strategies adopted to achieve this objective include: (i) emphasizing basic and preventive health
care, primary education and basic sanitation and water supply; (ii) further refining targeting
mechanisms; and (iii) encouraging increased responsibility of local governments and institutions,
communities, private sector agencies and NGOs.
This project was a repeater project following on from the first Social Investment Project (Loan
2127-BO), that in turn, followed the Emergency Social Fund (ESF) Projects I and II (Loans
1829-BO and 1882-BO). It followed a a standardized approach (the subproject cycle) that was
little changed from that originally pioneered for demand-driven social funds in the ESF. As such,
the project was not excessively demanding, complex or risky for the implementing agency.
With the accumulated experience of having invested more than $3.5 billion in more than 98 social
fund projects around the world (as of May, 2001), there is an appreciation within the World Bank
that Social Funds have a potentially key role to play in the development of an effective
decentralized system of delivery of public services. Social funds could contribute to or retard the
development of such a system, depending on how they interact with local governments and sector
ministries. Should Bolivia's Second Social Investment Fund project have been designed with a
broader objective of supporting such a decentralized system? Probably not. Given the weak
state of the sector ministries at the time of project preparation and the fact that the Popular
Participation Law that created and financed muncipal governments was not in effect, the narrow
focus on implementing subprojects was appropriate. At the time of preparation, it had not yet
been demonstrated that the approach developed for an emergency program to alleviate the social
costs of adjustment (focusing mainly on creating employment) could also be applied to improve
coverage and quality of health, water supply, sanitation and education services.
However, the larger task of developing an effective decentralized system of service delivery
remains pending. Recently, substantial progress has been made in this area, drawing upon the
years of experience that the country now has with the operation of the Popular Participation Law,
with different sectoral reform programs and with the operation of the Social Investment Fund and
other funds. The more comprehensive approach to decentralization has been supported by IDA's
Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit approved by the Bank's Board in May 2001 and
cofinanced by several bilateral donors. The changes to the operation of the Social Investmnent
Fund that result from trying to meet this more comprehensive objective are discussed later in the
section on sustainability.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised during the project.
3.3 Original Components:
The operation consisted of: (i) subprojects (US$53.9 million) in the health, water supply,
sanitation and education sectors including subprojects for institutional support to agencies
-2-



requesting subprojects and: (ii) an institutional development component which includes
administrative support to SIF (salaries, training and travel expenses for SIF's staff-US$13.3
million), vehicles, office equipment, computers and miscellaneious expenses (US$ 1.8 milion) and
technical assistance, including studies (US$ 1.0 million).
Education subprojects involved either repairing existing schools or constructing new schools,
usually accompanied by the provision of new desks, blackboards and playgrounds. In many cases,
new schools were constructed in the same location as the old schools, with the older facilities
used for storage or, in some cases, adapted to provide housing for teachers.
Health subprojects consisted of repairing existing health centers and constructing new facilities.
The SIF worked with prototypical designs that included a waiting room, a room for outpatient
consultations, a room for in-patients with several beds, a space for a pharmacy, bathrooms and a
meeting room to give presentations on health topics. The SIF also provided medicines, furniture
and medical equipment. In addition, the SIF provided a motorcycle to allow health personnel to
conduct more house visits and radios to call for ambulances and to keep in contact with other
health centers. Where centers did not have electricity, the SIF provided solar panels to power the
radio, lights and a refrigerator used to store medicines and vaccines. Finally, drinking water was
made available and showers were typically installed.
SIF water supply investments consisted of providing financing for small scale potable water
systems. The specific water supply system design varied according to the particular geographical
location. Initially, the infrastructure investment was not accompanied by adequate training, but in
later years with the Bank-financed Rural Water and Sanitation Project (PROSABAR) greater
effort was made to provide training.
3.4 Revised Components:
Although the amounts assinged to the different components changed slightly over the course of
the project (particularly with the Trust Funds), there was no change in the nature of the activities
within a component.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry was satisfactory. It took note of the results of the midterm review of the First
Social Investment Fund project and incorporated actions to respond to problems detected during
that review. One of the key lessons that was incorporated in the project was the need to carry out
pro-active promotion in poor areas to help those areas prepare subproject proposals. It is
common in demand-driven social funds for there to be more proposals from richer communities
than from poorer communities since wealthier communities have greater capacity to prepare
proposals. The attention paid to promotion strategies in the design undoubtedly contributed to
the relatively good targeting of overall FIS investments.
A second important aspect of the quality at entry was that provisions were made for an impact
evaluation study at the beginning of the project. The initial design work for the impact evaluation
began with the First Social Investment Project, but the baseline survey was carried out at the
beginning of the Second Social Investment Project. The project is one of the rare Bank social
sector projects that has attempted to measure impact and one of the even rarer Bank social sector
- 3 -



projects that has baseline and follow-up data for an intervention group and a control group.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
In this section, the objective of improving coverage of health, water supply, sanitation and
education services targeting primarily the rural poor is considered. In the next section, the impact
of the investments in education, health and water subprojects is considered.
Unfortunately, over the time period of the Second Social Investment Fund project, there
were no national household surveys that could be used to measure improvements in coverage
rates. However, it is clear that the operations of the SIF were on a large scale, amounting to
roughly 25 percent of all public investment over the period 1993 to 1998. The ability to deliver
social services at a significant scale, while still generating an impact (see below) is no small
accomplishment. The distribution of investments of the SIF over different sectors and years is
presented in Table 1.

Tihere is somewhat more information available to measure SIF's success in poverty
targeting than there is to measure its effect on coverage rates. Here the results are quite positive.
The SIF has managed to target its expenditures in the poorest municipalities, as indicated in table
2. The municipalities with a poverty index greater than 80 account for 42% of Bolivia's
population, but received 63% of total FIS expenditures. In contrast, the distribution of total
municipal expenditures from co-participation funds and other sources is not pro-poor. The
poorest municipalities accounted for only 22 percent of total municipal expenditure in 1996.

While FIS expenditures were pro-poor, there was substantial variation in the per capita
expenditures within poverty categories, as shown in Table 3. For the poorest municipalities, the
municipality in the 75th percentile received roughly 8 times more than that received by

municipality in the 25th percentile.

Moreover, the variation in FIS expenditure per capita is not easily explained by readily observable
variables. Regressions run of the effect of a set of municipal characteristics on per capita FIS
expenditure (not reported) had very little power to explain the variation.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Overview of impact of investments in subproiects component
The main results on impact are as follows. While the social fund succeeded in improving
the quality of the educational infrastructure (measured some three years after the intervention),
there was very little improvement in educational outcomes. In contrast, the interventions in health
clinics, perhaps because they went beyond simply improvements in physical infrastructure,
improved utilization rates and were associated with substantial declines in child mortality. The
investments in small community water systems did not have a major impact on the physical quality
of the water, but did improve access and the quantity of water. This improvement in quantity
appears to have been sufficient to generate declines in child mortality of the same order observed
with the health interventions.
The data and methodology used and results related to the SIF impact are discussed in
Newman et al (2000), "An Impact Evaluation of Education, Health and Water Supply
Investments of the Bolivian Social Investment Fund". More detail can also be found in the
CD-ROM on the Bolivian Social Investment Fund, prepared as part of this Intensive Learning
ICR. The impact results for each sector investment are summarized below.
Impact of education investments
The manner in which the education subprojects were implemented in the two regions
selected for the evaluation (the Chaco and the Resto Rural) led to two different evaluation designs
that were applied at the sampling and baseline data collection stage in 1993: an experimental
design in the Chaco region and a matched comparison in Resto Rural.
In the Chaco region, the German Institute for Reconstruction and Development (KfW)
- 5 -



had, in 1991, earmarked funding for education interventions. However, the process for
promoting SIF interventions in select communities had not been initiated and funding was not
sufficient to reach all schools in the region. This situation provided an opportunity for assessing
the need in schools for a SIF intervention and for applying a random selection process to select
among equally eligible schools which schools would receive active promotion for a SIF
intervention.
The randomization was on eligibility to receive the intervention. Even after SIF promoted
the education projects among eligible communities, the communities still had to make proposals
to receive funding and not all communities that were eligible and selected for active SIF
promotion ended up receiving a SIF education subproject. As is discussed in Newman et al, the
randomization on eligibility is sufficient to measure all the impact measures of interest. There was
some contamination in the original randomization design, in that some schools that were not
supposed to receive the intervention actually did receive it. However, the problem was minor and
the paper shows that the cost of the contamination is that one has to accept a rather more
imprecise estimate of the impact. It is possible to bound the estimate between a lower bound and
upper bound estimate and this is what is shown in Table 4 below.

In many cases in the school-level outcome variables, not only is the upper bound
estimate of the impact signficiantly different from zero (at the 5 percent level), but the
lower bound estimate of the impact is also significant. In contrast, for only one variable
among the students' educational outcomes (that of the drop-out rate measured using
household data) is the impact significantly different from zero (and then only at the 10 %
level).
In the Resto Rural region schools had already been selected for SIF interventions, making
randomization impossible. Therefore, treatment schools were sampled from the list of all schools
designated for SIF interventions, and a comparison group was constructed by matching the
sample of SIF treatment group schools to non-SIF schools. Once follow-up data were collected
and the impact analysis conducted, the matching was refined using observed characteristics from
pre-intervention data. The treatment group observations receiving the intervention were matched
to control observations on the basis of a constructed propensity score that estimates the
probability of receiving an intervention (See Baker (2000), "Evaluating the Impact of
Development Projects on Poverty: A Handbook for Practitioners" for a description of propensity
score matching). In effect, the matching produces a reweighting of the original control group so
as to more closely match the distribution of the intervention group prior to the intervention. These
weights were then applied to the post intervention data to provide an estimate of the
counterfactual - what the value in the treatment schools would have been in the absence of the
intervention. The results after the matching process are reproduced below.
The 1993 data illustrate that, after matching, there are no significant differences in the
results between the intervention and the control group. This is as it should be since the
intervention had not yet taken place at that time. Although not reported here, without matching,
there were some differences in the variables prior to the interventions, suggesting that the
approach followed in constructing a control group from census data was only partially successful
in removing pre-intervention differerences. The absence of significant differences with the
matched data gives some confidence that the matching process was successful in removing
pre-intervention differences.
The results for 1997 (after the intervention) indicates that the school-level outcomes
were significantly better for the schools with the intervention than for the control schools.
However, only for the drop-out rate and only at the 10% level is there a signficiantly better
outcome in students' educational outcomes in the schools with an intervention as compared
with the control group. Thus, the pattern is the same as with the randomization results
from the Chaco sample.

Impact of health interventions
When the original evaluation design was established for assessing the impact of health
interventions it was expected that the SIF would invest in all rural health clinics in the Chaco and
Resto Rural regions. Without the benefit of a control group, the original evaluation design
selected was that of a reflexive comparison. This type of evaluation uses the values of the same
population at an earlier time period as a comparison against the values observed in the later time
period and is considered one of the least methodologically rigorous evaluation methods
(Grossman 1994).
Whereas German financing allowed for the SIF to carry out the bulk of its planned health
investments in the Chaco, financial limitations prevented SIF from completing its goal of investing
in all of the Resto Rural region health centers. This change in implementation allowed outcomes
from the intervention group that had received the planned investments to be compared to a
control group that had not received SIF interventions. There remained the question of whether the
health clinics that received the SIF interventions were different in some systematic way from those
that did not, thereby calling into question whether differences observed after the intervention
might not be due to pre-existing differences. In discussions with SIF management in 1999 it
proved impossible to identify the criteria employed to select which health centers would receive
the interventions. However, an examination of the baseline data revealed significant differences in
the characteristics of those that received the intervention and those that did not. To adjust for this
difference, a similar propensity matching procedure was carried out to that employed with the
education data in the Resto Rural area. Indeed, the only difference in the education and health
cases relates to the starting point. In education, an initial control group was constructed using
census data and administrative data. The propensity matching procedure was employed to
reweight the control group and to improve the match with the distribution of the intervention
group. In health, there was no initial control group constructed. The original control group
consisted of those that simply did not receive an intervention and the propensity matching
approach was used to adjust for pre-existing differences.

The results in Table 6 (after matching) indicate that, as in education, the SIF investments brought
about a significant improvement in the physical characteristics of the facilities. In addition, there
was a significant improvement in prenatal control and in births attended, two important factors
affecting child mortality.
The impact evaluation drew upon sufficiently large household surveys (see Annex 8) to
allow the detection of an effect of the intervention on child mortality. Three different methods
were used to suggest that a reduction in mortality has taken place in the areas served by health
clinics receiving a SIF intervention. Table 7 presents information on the percentage (and absolute
number) of children who died who were born 1O years prior to the survey, based on retrospective
questions in the household surveys. The results, prior to matching, illustrate that there were a
significantly greater number of deaths among the intervention group prior to the intervention, but
a significantly lower number of deaths among the intervention group after the intervention. The
lower part of Table 7 presents the results after matching. The matching procedure used the same
procedure (and implicit weights) as in the analysis of the impact of the SIF intervention on
infrastructure and utilization. As had been the case in Table 6, the matching procedure served to
eliminate the pre-intervention differences. However, the post intervention differences remain.
Those in the area of influence of a clinic that received SIF investments had significantly lower
mortality.

Table 8 presents life table estimates for the change in mortality using only the households
for which survey data are available in both 1993 and 1997. For this reason the sample size is
smaller and no matching was done. The under 5 mortality rates in this SIF impact evaluation
sample covering the period 1988-1993 are close to the rates reported in the 1994 National
Demographic and Health Survey for the 1989-1994 period. As with the previous table, one
observes a pattern of a significant reduction in mortality among the intervention group from 1993
to 1997. Among the control group, there is no decline. If anything, there is an increase in
mortality.

The third approach to measuring the change in mortality is to estimate a Cox proportional
hazard function and to use the estimated coefficients to calculate under 5 mortality rates. The
advantage of using a hazard model is differences in characteristics of the parents and children can
be controlled for and the estimation procedure can take account of the fact that children of
different ages have different lenghts of exposure to the risk of dying. The estimated effects of
different characteristics on the risk of dying are presented in Table 9. Among the characteristics
included in the hazard function is whether or not the child was in an area of influence of a health
clinic that received a SIF intervention. From these estimated relations, one can compare
estimated child mortality rates for children in the intervention group and in the control group.
There are no significant differences in 1993 (the intervention variable is not significant), but there
- 13 -



is significantly lower under 5 mortality among the intervention group after the intervention.

* Significant at 5% level
The three approaches all show a similar pattern of declining under 5 mortality (from
high levels) in the intervention group. The Cox proportional hazard estimates are the most
accurate and they show a 26 % decline in under 5 mortality rates among children who
lived in areas where health clinics received a SIF investment.
While there is certainly some robustness in the finding of lower mortality among the
intervention group, there is always the possibility that there could be some other explanantion for
the apparently lower mortality among children in areas served by clinics that received a SIF
investment. One possibility is that the intervention group could have received other interventions,
not provided by the SIF, that could have led to lower mortality. A separate analysis (not reported
- 14 -



here) indicated that the control group actually received more non-SIF water interventions than the
intervention group and there were no significant differences in non-SIF financed sanitation
projects. Furthermore, a regression of the difference between 1997 and 1993 in availability of
piped water, adequacy of water throughout the day and year, distance to water supply and
adequate sanitation facilities on the intervention dummy revealed no significant differences the
intervention and the control group.
Finally, if the reduction in child mortality had something to do with the services provided
in the clinics, one would expect greater reductions in mortality among those that used the clinics
than among those that did not. This was indeed the case. Child mortality among those families
with at least one prenatal checkup before the last birth was significantly lower in the treatment
group than the control group in 1997, but not in 1993. This strongly suggested that there was
something associated with the health clinic after the intervention that was accounting for the
observed lower child mortality.
impact of investments in water
At the tirne of the baseline survey, 18 water and sanitation projects were planned for the
Chaco and Resto Rural regions. These projects consisted of water supply investments designed to
benefit all households within the intervention area. Project sites were selected based on the
availability of a water source and having a beneficiary population concentrated enough to allow
for economies of scale to be achieved.
No specific control group was constructed ex ante. Rather, the impact was measured by
comparing the situation before and after the SIF intervention. Provided that the communities
receiving the water intervention were similar to the control group used in the health sample, a
reasonable approximation to values of the variables that would have prevailed in the absence of
the intervention would be the values of the control group for the health sample. Indeed, the
overall child mortality rates for the health control group in 1993 were similar to the mortality rates
of the water sample in 1993.
The main impact of the SIF investment in water was the reduction in the distance to water
source and, in the case of the Resto Rural area, a substantial improvement in the adequacy of
sanitary services. Unfortunately, data on the quantity of water consumption was only collected
for 1997, making it impossible to measure the improvement in this important variable.
In addition to measuring the changes in these key variables, a test of water quality of the
old and new sources of the 18 SIF water projects was carried out. The results showed that there
was surprisingly little improvement. In the old system 9 out of 15 of the projects where samples
could be taken indicated the presence of fecal contamination. In the new system, 7 out of the 14
projects where samples were taken indicated the presence of fecal contamination. In both the old
and the new systems, there was a complete absence of residual chloride, suggesting that no
chlorination took place. In interviews conducted among the beneficiaries it appeared that the
following factors explained the relative lack of improvement in water quality:
- 15-



*     Lack of training of the personnel designated by the community for the maintenance of the
system. This training should have covered the need for periodic cleaning of the tanks, repairs of
the tubes, procedures for disinfecting water, administration of resources obtained for payment,
and chlorination;
*     Lack of meters to measure water quantity that would have made it easier to collect
adequate resources to ensure sustainability; and
*     In some cases inappropriate materials (tubes designed for oil and not water) and poor
quality of the work (resulting in a coarse finish that made cleaning more difficult).
Upon presenting the results of the findings of the measurement of water quality to SIF
representatives, they acknowledged that their initial water projects did have problems, mostly
attributable to the fact that the infrastructure was provided without adequate training. However,
they explained that, with the assistance of the Bank-funded PROSABAR project, this problem had
been resolved. To check this a second analysis of water quality was carried out, using the same
approach but covering more recent projects.
In the second study, significant levels of fecal contamination were found in 10 out of 18
old sources of water. In contrast, only 2 out of 15 new projects indicated the presence of fecal
contamination. Whereas in the original study the beneficiaries received little training, in this
second sample all communities had received training through the PROSABAR program. The
only disturbing finding was that in none of the more recent projects was there any chlorination of
the water taking place. This could cause problems down the road if there is a deterioration in
maintenance or an outside source of contamination.
In a review of several studies of the health impact of improved water supply and sanitation
facilities, Esrey et al (1990) suggest that the expected reduction in child mortality from improved
water supply and sanitation is on the order of 55 to 60 percent. They point out that to maximize
the health impacts of water projects, the water supply should be as close to the home as possible -
to increase the quantity of water available for hygiene practices. They also conclude that in
achieving broad health impacts, safe excreta disposal and proper use of water for personal and
domestic hygiene appear to be more important that drinking water quality. The results from the
water and sanitation investments of the SIF are consistent with these findings.

Table 10 illustrates that there was a significant reduction in the percentage of deaths
under 5. Converting these results to under five mortality rates by estimating a Cox
proportional hazard model (as in the health case), the reduction is from 105 to 61, a
reduction of 41 percent.

Not applicable.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact is harder to guage than the impact of the subprojects
as there are no objective indicators that were defined that could be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of the institutional strengthening component of the project. On balance, it is
probably fair to conclude that the impact of the institutional strengthening component was
satisfactory. The SIF adapted well to the substantial changes in the decentralization environment
brought about by the Popular Participation Law and the Administrative Decentralization Law.
The SIF adapted its procedures to the new functions of the municipalities and was instrumental in
ensuring that social expenditures did not decline after the increased decentralization (in contrast to
the experience in other countries following a decentralization effort). Other positive aspects of
the institutional development was that the SIF was able to maintain a good level of technical
competence throughout the life of the project. Excessive turnover of staff became a problem only
towards the end of the project. The institution was also able to carry out a limited amount of
- 17 -



decentralization of functions to regional offices, without lowering standards.
Less positive institutional developments include some perceived politicization of the
staffing and some problems with the transparency of operations. As mentioned in the targeting
section, municipalities that had similar characteristics often received substantially different
amounts of SIF resources. There were no clearly articulated reasons why this should have been
so, giving rise to doubts about the allocation mechanism. This differential treatment of
municipalities is a feature that will be corrected in the new institutional arrangements under the
general direction of the Unified Directory of Funds.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
There were no main factors that lay completely outside the control of the government or the
implementing agency.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
One factor that was partly outside of the control of the national government and the SIF was the
problem of availability of counterpart funds from the municipal governments. Under the Popular
Participation Law municipalities received 20 percent of general tax revenue which could be used
for their own expenditures or could be applied to counterpart financing requirements. At times,
the municipal governments did not do an adequate job projecting the counterpart financing
requirements of al the projects that they agreed to cofinance. The SIF projects were not the only
projects that required co-financing. The problem was particularly acute during downturns in the
economy (when the absolute amount of resources made available to the municipalities declined)
and when there was a transition in mayors (where the new mayor might find the future budget
committed to projects agreed to by the previous administration). The lack of counterpartpart
fiancing or the delays in making the counterpart financing available to the SIF delayed the
execution of the project. This delay was often perceived by the beneficiaries to be a problem with
the SIF, when in fact it was a problem of poor planning on the part of municipal governments.
The government could have taken some action to reduce the severity of the problem of lack of
counterpart financing from the municipalities by making the counterpart financing required of
municipalities vary over the business cycle. During periods of economic downturn (for example,
1999 and 2000) the government could have lowered the counterpart financing requirements from
municipalities. Because municipalities receive a smaller transfer when general tax revenues
decline, they are not able to meet counterpart financing requirements, causing projects to fall
behind in execution and available international resources to lie undisbursed. By reducing the
counterpart financing requirements during bad times and raising them in good times, a
countercyclical pattern is promoted, instead of the current undesireable procyclical pattern.
A second factor that affected implementation was the substantial fluctuation in the amount of
money that was channeled through the SIF from year to year. This affected the administrative
costs as a percentage of total costs. The SIF, as an institution, was established with a certain
capacity to process subprojects proposals. Much of this capacity involved fixed costs, at least in
the short-tern, in terms of the personnel, vehicles and regional offices. To the extent that less
- 18 -



money was channeled through the SIF, administrative costs rose. Greater predictability in the
amount of resources channeled through the Social Investment Fund would have allowed the SIF
to better control their adminstrative costs.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The generally positive impacts achieved in this project are largely due to having a
competent and committed staff, working under a standardized model (that of the subproject
cycle), where the SIF promoted the investments, evaluated them and contracted the private sector
to execute them. In effect, the SIF could be viewed as a standardized production process,
producing a limited set of investment projects that had been predefined in their menu.
This approach, replicated around the world, allowed the SIF to finance social sector
investments on a large scale with an adequate level of quality. However, the manner in which the
production process operated had some problems. Foremost among them was an inadequate role
of the sector ministries. The SIF was often criticized for an overly engineering view of the world
- one that equated social sector investments with infrastructure with insufficient attention paid to
the software aspects of the interventions. This was certainly the case with the education
investments of the SIF, less so with the health investments. At the beginning of the period of the
project, the sector ministries were weak and SIF took on the task of setting sector policies. By
the end of the period, as a result of reform efforts in the Ministries of Health, Education and
Housing, the sector ministries became increasingly assertive in wanting to wrest control from SIF
staff in setting sector policies (i.e. what type of investments should be made and where they
should be made). It is fair to say that throughout the period of the project there was never really a
smooth working relation among the sector ministries and the SIF. Subsequent to the project,
specific investment projects channeled through the sector ministries, but making use of the
services of SIF were developed and this improved the working relationship and (probably) the
effectiveness.
A second problem with the manner in which the production process operated was that
there was less than optimal feedback. Although the SIF did more self-analysis than most
Bank-financed projects, the information that was collected did not always get fed back into the
day-to-day working activities. For example, the information on the variation in costs was only
analyzed at the end of the project, in connection with the ICR and a study on Social Funds
throughout the world. Yet, tracking the variation in costs could have provided useful information
on how to become more efficient. More work could also have been done tracking the time that
subprojects took to pass through different stages of the subproject cycle and using that
information to avoid bottlenecks.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
There were no significant changes in the costs and financing of the project from what was
anticipated at the beginning of the project. As this project financed a large number of relatively
small subprojects, cost overruns in one subproject project would not be expected to have major
effects on the overall project costs. The most that would happen would be that the total number
of subprojects financed would be less than anticipated.
The extent of cost overruns in the individual subprojects was low. On average,
- 19 -



unexpected costs reflected in change orders amounted to roughly 3.5% of the original amount of
the contract.
There was, however, considerable variation in the cost per beneficiary in the
subprojects, particularly in the health subprojects (as shown in Table 11). If the SIF had been
able to exclude the five percent of the subprojects with the highest cost per beneficiary, this
would have reduced total costs between 5 and 35 percent, depending on the type of subproject.
This suggests that there may have been some scope for controlling costs that was not realized.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
There are two aspects to the sustainability of the project: a) the sustainability of the supbprojects
fimanced by the Social Investment Fund; and b) the sustainability of the institution itself.
It is likely that the subprojects wili be maintained. They were built to a relatively high standard -
with an expected life of 20-25 years, depending on the investment. In site visits conducted as part
of the impact evaluation study, the physical infrastructure appeared to be holding up well some
three years after the projects were completed. This can be seen in the videos contained in the
CD-ROM produced as part of this intensive learning ICR. How long the physical infrastructure
will hold up depends on the action of municipalities for, under the Bolivian system, this
responsibility rests with them. The municipalities have resources, but not all attach sufficient
importance to maintenance. Under the new Unified Directory of Funds, incentives for the
municipalities to carry out maintenance will be introduced as a condition to receive continued
access to cofinancing from the national government. This should help ensure sustainability of the
subproject investments.
The sustainability of the Social Investment Fund as an institution is highly likely, although it will
- 20 -



go through a natural evolution as described below.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Bolivia is the birthplace of Social Funds and has always been ahead of other countries in
introducing modifications to the Social Fund model. The Emergency Social Fund was the first
Social Fund and introduced the subproject cycle and contracting of private firms to carry out the
investment as a means of rapidly carrying out investments on a large scale, primarily to generate
employment during structural adjustment. The First and Second Social Investment Projects
demonstrated that this approach could be used to deliver social services in areas where previously
the government had not had much of a presence. Reforms in the social sector ministries and in
the decentralized system of government that gave more power and resources to local
governments required the Social Fund to adapt to the new arrangements. Some adaptation took
place during the Second Social Investment Fund project.
Further modifications are now being made to the operation of the Social Investment Fund
in order to foster better integratation within a decentralized social service delivery system. In the
new system, municipalities will continue to have the main responsibility for investing. Sectoral
ministries are to have a normative role and will be involved in quality assurance, but not in
executing investments. The Social Investment Fund, or rather its successor, will become less
important as an instrument to finance the bulk of social infrastructure in the country. It will be
used strategically as a vehicle to help ensure that investments made by municipalities are in line
with national priorities. It will also provide assistance to the smaller municipalities in reviewing
technical specifications and helping them with administrative arrangements. With 314
municipalities in a population of roughly 8 million people, there are some municipalities that are
too small to justify the fixed costs associated with having an adequate administrative structure to
ensure quality investments.
The specific changes are as follows: First, the Social Investment Fund is being merged
with the Rural Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo Campesino) under a single board of
directors to form the National Compensation Program. This new fund will provide incentives for
municipalities to invest in national priority areas. To this end, the municipalities will be presented
with a single set of counterpart financing requirements (i.e. prices) for co-financing of a limited set
of activities defined in a menu. The menu of eligible activities is defined in conjunction with the
sectoral ministries. The consolidation of the two funds and the presentation of a unified set of
prices responds to a weakness presented by the existence of multiple funding sources that require
counterpart financing. Because the counterpart financing requirements were set independently,
the net effect of the different counterpart financing rates did not necessarily reflect overall national
priorities.
Second, the requests for funding will be made once a year as part of the annual budgetary
cycle. Previously, requests were made throughout the year. With their weak management,
municipalities did not always keep track of their implied counterpart financing obligations and this
led to over commitments. Third, the resources that will flow to any given municipality, whether
through an unconditioned or conditioned transfer, will be determined by transparent formula
based on poverty levels in the municipality. This responds to one of the criticisms made of the
Social Investment Fund in Bolivia that there has been too much discretion and arbitrariness in
- 21 -



their assignment of funds. Fourth, the government is introducing a system that taxes the
resources the municipalities would receive outside of the National Compensation System. This
would reduce the incentives for mayors to go directly to international donors to solicit projects,
an action that distorts the poverty-focus of the overall investment program.
The changes being made to the system are being supported by IDA and other donors
through a Decentralization Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit (BO-3057) and through
the modification of existing IDA education, health and rural development projects which rely on
the Social Investment Fund to channel investments (BO-3096, BO-3244 and BO-3065).
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance was satisfactory. Particularly noteworthy was the rapid preparation time (2
months). This allowed the SIF to recover rapidly from a problem that arose under the First
Social Investment Project, namely that the pace of subproject approvals far surpassed the amount
of money available to finance the subprojects. Subproject approvals had to be suspended for
roughly a year, but this could have been longer had the Second Social Investment Project not
been prepared so quickly. Despite the rapid preparation time, the quality of the SAR and the
subsequent implementation of the project did not suffer.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance in supervision was satisfactory. This rating is based on three factors. First, the
Bank took the initiative to transfer responsibility for supervision to the field which, as the
borrower noted, resulted in a more rapid tumaround time for nonobjections. Second, a
considerable amount of technical assistance was provided to the SIF through the field-based
supervision and transmitted in comprehensive aide-memoires prepared during the supervision
missions. Moreover, supervision missions included representatives from other donors. Finally,
the Bank provided technical assistance from outside the region to assist in the implemenation of
the impact evaluation study.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance was satisfactory. The borrower readily incorporated lessons from the
midterm review of the First Social Investment Fund Project into the design of the Second Project.
Moreover, staff from the Social Investment Fund worked hard to deliver the Second Project in a
short time.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance was satisfactory. There could have been more
oversight of the SIF on the part of the Ministry of Presidency to review relations between the
sector ministries and the SIF. And there could have been greater predictability of resources
channeled through the SIF.
- 22 -



7.6 Implementing Agency:
Performance of the implementing agency was satisfactory, bordering on highly satisfactory.
Particularly noteworthy was the effort made by staff to adapt to the Popular Participation Law
and the effort made to carry out the impact evaluation. Establishing better working relations with
sector ministries to ensure better outcomes (particularly in education) and building in more
feedback mechanisms into the production process would have pushed the rating to highly
satisfactory. Better working arrangements with the Ministry of Education were established, but
this came after the project with the implementation of the Education Quality Project.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The most important lessons were presented in the section on achievement of objectives and
outputs - namely that the Social Investment Fund managed to implement social investments on a
large scale, was able to reach the poor, in all cases improved physical infrastructure and generated
positive final outcomes with its investments in health and water. The SIF was able to achieve
these results while operating at a reasonable level of efficiency.
However, several problems were also detected. The following table summarizes some of the
principal problems encountered and sets out possible solutions.
Problem                                Possible Solution
1. Lack of impact on school achievement.    1. Work more closely with the Ministry of
Education to design integrated interventions
that  include  infrastructure  and  teaching
processes. (Solution in progress).
2. High administrative costs.            2. Maintain greater stability in the amount of
resources allocated to the Fund. Explore
mechanisms to provide greater flexibility in
staffing so that the SIF can adjust to variation
in demand. (Solution pending).
3. Delays attributable to processes within  3. Review the subproject cycle and eliminate
the FIS project cycle that are excessively  unnecessary steps. Take into account the views
expensive.                               of the municipalities (clients) and try to design
a cycle that minimizes costs (time and effort)
with respect to work with the SIF. (Solution
pending).

It is important to note that there have been several detailed studies of the SIF, looking at
its role in decentralization and looking in some detail at its subproject cycle. Some of this work
has been done in conjunction with afore-mentioned IDA financed sectoral projects that rely on
SIF to carry out investments. However, the greater part of the analysis of SIF's role in the
decentralized system of investment has been carried out and will continue to be carried out in the
future as part as the IDA and multi-donor supported Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit.

Objetivos y Descripci6n del Proyecto
El 8 de Diciembre de 1993 el Gobiemo de Bolivia firm6 un convenio de credito con la Asociacion
- 24 -



Internacional de Fomento (AIF), para el Segundo Proyecto del Fondo de Inversi6n Social (FIS).
La fecha de cierre del proyecto, inicialmente prevista el 31 de diciembre de 1997, fue el 31 de
diciembre de 1998.
Los objetivos del Proyecto fueron: (a) mejorar la cobertura y calidad de la entrega de servicios
basicos en los sectores de educaci6n, salud, suministro de agua y saneamiento, enfocandose
principalmente en las zonas rurales de pobreza; y (b) fortalecer la capacidad institucional del FIS.
El Proyecto contempl6 dos componentes, el primero de inversi6n sectorial que incluy6
sub-proyectos en los sectores mencionados, y un segundo componente de fortalecimiento
institucional del FIS. El monto del credito fue de 28,300,000 de Derechos Especiales de Giro
(DEG's).
Durante la ejecuci6n del Proyecto se realizaron cambios importantes en el entorno institucional,
los mas importantes fueron: (a) la Ley de Participaci6n Popular (1994), que transfiere recursos de
coparticipaci6n tributaria a los municipios, el FIS ayud6 a consolidar la accion municipal
trabajando con los municipios en planes de intervenci6n y cofinanciamiento; (b) la Ley y proyecto
de Reforma Educativa (1994), que estableci6 nuevas metodologias de ensefianza, entonces se
presentaron necesidades de infraestructura y mobiliario que fueron cubiertas por el FIS; y (c) la
Ley de Descentralizaci6n Administrativa (1995), que estableci6 la nueva estructura organizativa
del Poder Ejecutivo a nivel departamental, el FIS pas6 a interactuar con las Direcciones
Departamentales de Salud, Educaci6n y Unidades de Agua y Saneamiento Basico, ahora
dependientes de las Prefecturas.
En 1996 el FIS dio el paso inicial hacia la desconcentraci6n adrministrativa transfiriendo ciertas
funciones a sus oficinas departamentales. Dentro de todo este cambio en el entomo institucional,
las relaciones FIS-municipio-comunidad han sido mas intensas. El FIS ha demostrado eficiencia
operativa comparativamente superior, sin embargo, es necesaria una participaci6n mas directa de
los ministerios de linea para que la inversi6n responda de cerca las lineas estrategicas sectoriales y
nacionales. Actualmente existen acuerdos basicos al respecto.
Resultados
1.    Evaluaciones internas del FIS
Estas evaluaciones se basan en muestras no estadisticas de proyectos representativos y la
aplicaci6n de metodos de evaluaci6n rapida de naturaleza cualitativa. Los resultados fueron:
Atenci6n Primaria en Salud
Las intervenciones estuvieron dirigidas a 85 municipios, posteriormente la intervenci6n fue
ampliada a 129 municipios dentro de los 178 priorizados por autoridades del sector. Los
componentes de intervenci6n respondieron a carencias que eran evidentes en los centros de salud.
La intervenci6n permiti6 mejores condiciones basicas para la prestaci6n de servicios de salud
pu6blica y preventiva, sobre todo en el area rural. El equipamiento entregado a los centros de salud
- 25 -



fue considerado apropiado y de buena calidad, aunque inicialmente hubieron demoras en la
entrega que ocasionaron desfases luego superados. Los medicamentos esenciales de bajo costo
provistos por el proyecto constituyeron un importante aporte a esos centros de salud,
tradicionalmente limitados de este recurso. Los componentes de capacitaci6n fueron
implementados s6lo en algunos Distritos debido a la ausencia de un plan normativo nacional.
Una evaluaci6n preliminar efectuada por el FIS, sefiala que se han incrementado las consultas
generales en los centros intervenidos, especialmente en zonas rurales. Los centros de salud
equipados por el FIS estan facilitando el sostenimiento de altas coberturas de vacunaci6n con
primeras dosis asi como la aplicaci6n de vacunas de refuerzo, por encima de los registrados en los
centros no intervenidos. Tambien se increment6 la atenci6n pre-natal y el parto atendido por
personal capacitado. La infraestructura, equipos y otros suministros proporcionados por el FIS se
constituyen en una condici6n previa para la Reforma de la Salud encarada actualmente.
Agua Potable
Los componentes de intervenci6n previstos para el sub-programa han sido considerados
adecuados para alcanzar los objetivos planteados por el mismo. Los proyectos de agua potable
tienen mejores disefios que en afios anteriores, aunque se requiere profundizar mas sobre la
purificaci6n. La intervenci6n se ha dado en poblaciones con menos de 5,000 habitantes. Se estima
que con el proyecto 291,556 personas recibieron un sistema nuevo o mejorado de agua. En
general, los beneficiarios con sistemas de agua han abandonado sus fuentes de abastecimiento
tradicionales (rios, arroyos y pozos) generalmente expuestas a la contaminaci6n. La calidad del
agua de consumo ha mejorado. El acceso al abastecimiento de agua ha permitido a mujeres y
ninios, tradicionalmente responsables de esta labor, tener mayor disponible para actividades
productivas y educativas. Tambien se ha afectado positivamente la disminuci6n de casos de
enfermedad de origen hidrico (como diarreas). Se requiere esfuerzo permanente para la
consolidaci6n de las organizaciones locales para asegurar la continuidad del servicio, la
ampliaci6n y mejoramiento. Los proyectos de capacitaci6n tiene este potencial.
Alcantarillado Sanitario y Letrinas
Los proyectos de alcantarillado sanitario son mas sensibles a la situacion socioecon6mica de las
poblaciones beneficiarias, en estos casos se deben considerar otras opciones tecnol6gicas de bajo
costo de inversi6n y funcionamiento. Los sistemas de alcantarillado entregados permiten el acceso
potencial a este servicio a 70,857 personas aproximadamente. Los sistemas de recolecci6n de
aguas servidas en funcionamiento permitieron sanear patios, cunetas y arroyos, muchas de ellos
contaminados. En los hogares en que se construyeron instalaciones intra-domiciliarias los nifios
tienen mayores oportunidades de modificar y adquirir habitos de higiene precautelando su salud.
Escuelas de Educaci6n Formal
En este caso la intervenci6n estuvo dirigida inicialmente a 351 nuicleos educativos priorizados
para una primera etapa por la Reforma Educativa, posteriormente la intervenci6n fue ampliada
hacia otros nuicleos que se beneficiaron con actividades de reforzamiento. El cambio de la
- 26 -



metodologia de ensefianza establecido en la Reforma Educativa repercuti6 en las caracteristicas
de infraestructura y mobiliario, caracteristicas que fueron atendidas por el FIS. La modulaci6n de
ambientes y la propuesta del proyecto arquitect6nico han sido otorgadas por el FIS a los
municipios sin costo, constituyendose en un importante aporte. Se estima que al menos 116,537
alumnos se beneficiaron con escuelas multi-grado y escuelas centrales entregadas al servicio. La
intervenci6n del FIS estuvo dirigida a la renovacion de escuelas existentes, no incidiendo
sustancialmente en el incremento de grados o la creaci6n de nuevos establecimientos. Con el
proyecto, se han ejecutado cinco Centros de recursos Pedag6gicos Integrales (con laboratorios,
talleres, bibliotecas, etc.), en una fase experimental.
Internados Rurales
Dada la dispersi6n de las poblaciones y la baja poblaci6n escolar en cada comunidad, el proyecto
ha aprobado 11 internados rurales. Los intemados en los que el FIS ha fortalecido el
mejoramiento de la infraestructura y equipamiento, y ademas fmanciado el funcionamiento y
capacitaci6n en los primeros meses de su puesta en marcha, muestran logros significativos. El
proyecto favorece a 3,422 nifios y jovenes internos por afno. Estos internos reciben alimentaci6n
apropiada, habitan ambientes adecuados, cuentan con facilidades sanitarias y se supervisa su salud
y bienestar, en general de mejor calidad que la recibida en sus propios hogares. Los internados
estan ubicados en municipios pequefios con indices de desarrollo humano bajos, por lo que existe
necesidad de subvenci6n.
Educaci6n No-Formal
Algunos proyectos de Capacitaci6n a Mujeres y de Capacitaci6n para la Producci6n Agropecuaria
contuvieron demasiados temas y requieren ser ajustados a un solo y s6lido prop6sito. Los
proyectos urbano marginales de capacitaci6n para la inserci6n laboral han sido afectados por un
mercado laboral disminuido por la crisis y altos niveles de desempleo. Los proyectos de
capacitaci6n para la producci6n en general necesitan ofrecer a los capacitados una s6lida
vinculaci6n con instituciones y organizaciones que apoyan estas actividades. Por otra parte, se
considera necesario abrir la fonnulaci6n de estos proyectos a una mayor competencia. Los
proyectos exitosos observados tiene en comuin caracteristicas como: formulaci6n y diseno
participativo, sistemas de seguimiento y auto-evaluaci6n permanente, vinculaci6n con otras
organizaciones de fomento y transferencia gradual y supervisada.
2.    Evaluaci6n de Impacto
El estudio cuantitativo de evaluacion de impacto debe ser entregado por un consultor
pr6ximamente.
Lecciones Aprendidas
En el disenlo: en ausencia de politicas, planes estrategicos y metas sectoriales, el FIS se plante6 en
los documentos operativos objetivos especificos que, por no ser de linea, resultaron altamente
dependientes de factores externos y de los sectores.
- 27 -



En la ejecuci6n: el FIS ha demostrado una eficiencia relativa, es ciertamente una instituci6n con
capacidad para el cumplimiento de metas de ejecuci6n fisica y financiera. Sin embargo, se espera
del FIS una mayor eficiencia sobre todo en el control de sus gastos corrientes a traves de un
diseiio organizativo mas flexible a su cartera y la revisi6n de sus procesos para hacerlos mas
desconcentrados y participativos.
Otras lecciones: el Proyecto no resalt6 suficientemente el aspecto de fortalecimniento de las
capacidades locales y municipales para posibilitar a estos asumir en mejores condiciones la
responsabilidad que les compete en el funcionamiento y mantenimiento de los servicios
entregados. Los proyectos actuales enfatizan este aspecto. Por otra parte, se sugiere avanzar en la
desconcentraci6n institucional.
Aplicacion de las Lecciones Aprendidas
Los creditos aplicados a partir de 1999 consideran una importante revisi6n en las formas de
intervenci6n que involucra mas a los ministerios sectoriales, a los actores locales, comunales,
municipales y regionales, la aprobaci6n de los proyectos en Consejos Departamentales, mayor
participaci6n de los involucrados durante la ejecuci6n de los proyectos y el fortalecimiento de
capacidades para la operaci6n y mantenimiento local.
Evaluaci6n al Desempeilo del Banco Mundial en el Convenio de Credito AIF-2532
El FIS considera que el desempeiio del Banco Mundial fue 6ptimo, principalmente por la
descentralizaci6n a la representaci6n en Bolivia de muchos procesos que antes debian pasar por la
sede en Washington. Esto permiti6 una eficiente, agil y oportuna atenci6n a las consultas y
soluci6n de problemas. El acompaiarniento cercano y las decisiones oportunas contribuyeron para
que el FIS pueda adaptarse al nuevo marco institucional. Bajo el liderazgo del Banco Mundial el
resto de las agencias que participaron en el cofmanciamiento del credito se adscribieron a los
acuerdos arribados, posibilitando la adopci6n de medidas mas flexibles. Las evaluaciones
realizadas por el Banco Mundial permitieron retroalimentar nuevos fmanciamientos.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
Estimates of the impact of SIF investments were presented in the section of achievement of
objective and outputs. These were not converted to dollar amounts, due to the difficulties in
doing so.
To look at the question of economic costs and benefits, cost comparisons were made in
constructing classrooms and smalU water projects. Unfortunately, NGOs and other agencies that
were involved in constructing health clinics did not have readily available cost data that would
have enable a comparison to be made.
SIF's costs of constructing a classroom were compared to those of a large NGO, Plan
International Altiplano (PIA). Both institutions constructed classrooms of similar size - the
average size of SIF classrooms being around 52 square meters while PIA's classrooms were
approximately 54 square meters. The direct costs of constructing (not counting administrative
costs which were not available for PIA), depended on three factors:
1)    The use of material. Here, the SIF tended to use less material to construct a classroom of
similar size.
2)    The prices paid for the material. PIA apparently paid considerably lower prices for the
material than did the SIF. This could be due to a number of factors, including the type of location
where the school was constructed.
3)    The type of construction. The SIF typically contracted with a private firm, whereas PIA
ususally relied on autoconstruction.
The effects of these different factors on total costs can be seen in Table A3.1. The second and
third rows provide a comparison of the costs of PIA and SIF, where each agency follows their
own pattern in use of material, prices obtained and modality of construction. On the basis of this
comparison, the SIF classrooms are roughly 10 percent more expensive to construct.

The other two rows present the results of hypothetical scenarios. If SIF classrooms were to
be build with autoconstruction, paying the prices that PIA paid but making the efficient use of
material typically found in SIF construction (shown in the first row), the SIF classrooms would be
cheaper. If PIA schools contracted the work out (and were able to obtain the same efficiency in
the use of material as the SIF but still obtain cheaper prices (shown in the fourth row), their price
of constructing a classroom would be roughly that of the SIF.
A cost study prepared by the UNDP-World Bank financed Water and Sanitation Network
provides information on the direct and indirect costs of providing small water projects. The data
are presented in Table A3.2.

Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results
SIF staff conducted several qualitative beneficiary surveys over the course of the project.
The results are discussed in the agency's report and are summarized in the borrower's comment
section of the ICR. A more detailed presentation of the results is contained in the CD-ROM. In
addition to the qualitative surveys, a major effort was mounted to conduct an impact evaluation
study. The results are discussed in the section on the achievement of objectives and outputs in the
main body of the ICR. This annex discusses the survey data used to generate those results.
Data for the impact evaluation were collected at two points in time, during a baseline
survey in 1993 and a follow-up survey extended over late 1997 and early 1998 (referred to as
1997 data in the ICR). In both years, data were collected from 5 provinces in the Chaco region
and 17 provinces in select rural areas, called the Resto Rural in this analysis.
The data collected for the evaluation reflect the three types of investments considered:
health care, education and water supply. Five types of data collection instruments were used in
the evaluation: facilities surveys, household surveys, community surveys, water quality samples
and student achievement tests. Data were collected from both treatment and comparison groups
using each of these instruments.
Household Survey Data
The household survey consists of three subsamples. The first is a random sample of all
households in the Chaco and Resto Rural regions that also serves as the sample for the health
component, the second is a sample of households that live near the schools in the treatment or
control group for the education component, and the third consists of households in the area of
influence of water and sanitation projects. The household survey gathered informnation on a
variety of aspects including: household composition, household consumption in order to
generate a measure of poverty to assess targeting, the household's involvement with the SIF
project, individual household member's access to social services, and health and education
outcome measures. In 1997, an effort was made to interview the samne households as in 1993.
Sixty five percent of the 1997 sample consists of households which were also included in 1993.
When the household could not be traced, it was usually replaced by a household living nearby the
one selected in 1993.

Facilities Survea Data
Schools
The school survey used two questionnaires, one for the director and one for each teacher
separately. It gathered information on infrastructure, equipment, teaching methods, and dropout
and repetition rates of students.
Table A8.2 presents the sample size for education projects in the Chaco region. For the
Chaco region in 1993, the sample of schools surveyed was drawn from the group of schools
primary and secondary schools that had been randomly selected as being eligible (the treatment
group) or not eligible (the control group) for receiving active promotion of the SIF intervention.
In 1997 it appeared that half of the eligible surveyed schools had succeeded in obtaining a SIF
intervention. Because the number of schools from the original sample which received an
intervention was deemed small, it was decided to augment the sample of treatment schools by
selecting schools from the universe of schools that had participated in the random assignment, had
been selected to receive active promotion for a SIF intervention, but had not been surveyed in
1993. The additional schools were randomly drawn from the the set of schools which had
obtained a SIF intervention by 1997. Since they had been subject to the original randomization
process, it was assumed that their average characteristics would not be significantly different from
the other schools included in the random assignment. The original design was contaminated by
three schools which were classified as non-eligible for active promotion but which had been able
to obtain an intervention irrespectively.

In the Resto Rural, the sample consisted of a random sample of intervened schools along
with a group of schools with similar characteristics that did not receive investments. The sample
is presented in Table A8.3. Note that in comparison to the case for El Chaco, the selection of
schools to appear in the sample was made after the decision to make an intervention. Thus, there
are no schools that were eligible but did not receive an intervention in the Resto Rural region.

Health Centers
The health facility survey gathered information on the quality of the infrastructure, staffing
and visits to the center. Since the SIF planned to intervene in all health centers in the Chaco and
the Resto Rural, all were included in the survey. The survey distinguishes between health centers
at the sector, area and district levels. Sector health centers are typically very small, providing basic
health care. Area-level health centers provide more sophisticated care and serve a larger
geographical region. District-level health centers are hospitals, the largest type of facility. The
larger the health center, the more detailed the questionnaire that was administered. The
questionnaires are, however, comparable and collected similar types of information. Sample sizes
are presented in Table A8.4.

Other Data
Mathematics and language achievement tests were applied in the follow-up survey in
schools in the Chaco and Resto Rural region. They could not be applied at the time of the
baseline survey because they were developed and introduced as part of the Education Reform
Program launched in 1994. However, the equivalency between the treatment and comparison
groups established during the evaluation design stage in 1993, particularly through the application
- 42 -



of the experimental design in the Chaco region, supports the assumption that the treatment and
control groups would not have registered significantly different test scores in 1993.
A community survey collected data from community leaders on a range of topics, from the
quality of the infrastructure and distance to facilities to the presence of local organizations.
At the time of the baseline survey the SIF was just beginning to invest in rural water
projects. The 18 projects that are in the survey constitute the universe of projects that were
considered for funding in 1992. Since then, the SIF has greatly expanded its work in water and
sanitation. For these 18 projects baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted to gather
characteristics of the households. A community survey was also collected in the areas that
received the water projects, but there was no specific facility questionnaire as was the case in
education and health.
In addition to these surveys, a test of the water quality of the old source of drinking water
and the new, social-fund financed source was carried out. This involved tests carried out in situ
using portable equipment and additional tests carried out in one of the main laboratories for this
purpose in Bolivia.

Annex 9. Stakeholder Workshop Results
There were several workshops held both inside and outside of the country to discuss the results of
the impact evaluation and the cost study.
Stakeholder workshops in country
1. Workshops held for representatives of sector ministries, Ministry of Finance and SIF
(La Paz, week of July 2, 1999)
A series of workshops were held with representatives of the Ministry of Education, Health and
Housing, together with SIF staff and observers of the Ministry of Finance. The main objective
was to discuss preliminary findings of the impact evaluation. There was considerable discussion
as to why there were not stronger results on education. The Ministry of Education felt that the
results of the study were important for they demonstrated that infrastructure investments alone
were not enough to generate improvements in educational outcomes. A closer integration of
investment in physical infrastructure, channeled through the SIF, and software-related investments
was called for. The IDA-supported Education Quality and Equity Strengthening Project has
served as the vehicle to forge a new working relationship between the Ministry of Education and
the SIF.
There was considerable skepticism expressed about the preliminary results presented at the
workshop that suggested a positive effect of the health investments on child mortality. This
prompted the more extensive analysis, using the three different methodological approaches and
the checks of the robustness of the results that are reported in this ICR. The more extensive
analysis confirmed the findings that the health investments apparently have led to a substantial
decline in mortality among the beneficiaries of SIF health investments.
In the first workshop, the mortality effects of the water investments were not presented.
However, results were presented from the first study of water quality that suggested that there
had not been much improvement in the quality of water between the old and the new source. This
prompted a discussion of the lessons learned from the early water investments, mainly that it was
essential to accompany the investment with training. It was decided to conduct a second test of
water quality to see whether any improvement could be seen with the more recent investments.
2. Workshop held for sector ministries, Ministry of Finance, SIF and international donors
(March 14, 2000)
A second workshop was held on March 14, 2000 where revised results of the impact
evaluation study and results of a cost study were presented to the same participants as in the first
workshop, together with considerable representation of the international donor community (KfW,
Sweden, Denmark, IDB, GTZ, Holland and USAID). The results were roughly the same as
presented in this ICR.
3. Future dissemination - August 2001. A more public presentation is planned for August
- 44 -



2001 where the CD-ROM will be made available to the public.
Presentations outside of the countrv
In addition to the workshops and dissemination within Bolivia, presentations of the results of the
Impact Evaluation study have been made on two occasions at the World Bank Office in
Washington (a seminar presentation on March 19, 1999 and a presentation at HD Week on
February 7, 2000). Many of the results from the Bolivia work have also made their way into the
comparative study on Social Investment Funds entitled "Evaluating Social Fund Performance",
prepared by Laura Rawlings, Lynne Sherbume-Benz and Julie Van Domelen as part of the SIF
2000 study.
Fianlly, the impact evaluation approach and results were presented at the South Asia Regional
Poverty Monitoring & Evaluation Workshop, sponsored by the World Bank in New Delhi, June
8-10, 2000
