follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to global environment outcome\n            was high; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: the project outcomes have\n            demonstrated that it is possible to develop an appropriate\n            community approach to improved natural resources management\n            in the Sahelian context. A pilot project must be ambitious,\n            but realistic and in phase with the capacities required for\n            implementation. In a situation where a project is\n            co-financed, the formalization of responsibilities of each\n            donor is essential to avoid ambiguities and delays during\n            the implementation process. Proper preparation of an\n            operation (quality at the entry) is a key to good execution.\n            It is risky to design a project in a way that the\n            achievement of its development objective depends on the\n            outputs of complementary operations. This is an important\n            risk that should be addressed during the project design.\n            Sustainable, transformational changes involving behavior\n            changes take medium to long term to become visible.\n            Participatory and decentralized management of natural\n            resources can be effective and sustainable if it fully takes\n            into account the primary rights of the users while\n            simultaneously integrating the space management in a\n            coherent diagram."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
