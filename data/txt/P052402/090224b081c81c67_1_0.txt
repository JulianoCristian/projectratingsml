                         a military coup occurred in Mali and the World Bank suspended its activities and missions in the country since March 22, 2012. The mission of September 2011 was marked by an
                         important event namely, the transfer of project field activities management to the Association of Municipalities of the Gourma; the three components called of ground to be managed

                         association level. An action plan was agreed by the mission with the Association and implementation results of the performance should be evaluated in April 2012
                         All operations in Mali have been suspended since March 22, 2012, following the military coup.
                         As the closing date is for December 2012, the project team is now preparing the draft of government ICR to be validated in a workshop
                         before sending to the World Bank. A draft version of this government ICR is already available.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         All operations in Mali have been suspended since March 22, 2012, following the military coup.
                         As the closing date is for December 2012, the project is now preparing the draft of government ICR to be validated in a workshop
                         before sending to the World Bank. A draft version of this government ICR is already available.
