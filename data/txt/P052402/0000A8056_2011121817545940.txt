                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The restructuring of the project has not changed the implementing rules defined in the Project design. The Project Management Unit or National Coordination, while ensuring overall
                         coordination, is responsible for the implementation of Component 4, Capacity Building for public institutions to support the decentralized management of biodiversity and the
                         monitoring / evaluation system.The implementation of three other components known components on the ground remains the responsibility of the private operator with the #Cellule
                         de mise en oeuvre# (CMO) as a pool of experts based on the field at Douentza to conduct daily activities. The process of creating the #Association Inter-communal du Gourma (AIG)
                         # started a few years ago has resulted in July 2010 to create the AIG named Assyhar whose creative acts have been published in the #Journal Officiel du Mali# and the game's
                         official records sent to the World Bank
                         The World Bank Team has assessed the capabilities of the AIG / Assyhar in May 2011 and the conclusions are going to transfer the management responsibility of field activities to
                         AIG / Assyhar while ensuring a continuous reinforcement of its capacity as its technical arm, the #Cellule de mise en oeuvre# (CMO) is still in place.
