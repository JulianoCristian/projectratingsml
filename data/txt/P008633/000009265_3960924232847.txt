SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Portugal
Forestry Proiect (Loan 1 853-PO)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on
Portugal - Forestry Project (Loan 1 853-PO)" prepared by the Europe and Central Asia
Regional Office with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The project achieved most of its afforestation objective after a three year
extension and a forestry sub-sector study was completed, but institutional
achievements were limited and the credit component failed. On balance, the project
is rated marginally satisfactory. However, its sustainability is uncertain. The project
was overtaken by a Forestry Action Plan, implemented since 1986 with European
Economic Community grants. This changed the financial and institutional framework
within which the project had been designed. Unfortunately, the project was never
restructured.
The PCR understates the deficiencies of Bank supervision. A re-estimated
economic rate of return is not available. An audit will be conducted.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PORTUGAL
FORESTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 1853-PO)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) is for the Forestry Project in
Portugal, for which Loan 1853-PO for US$50.0 million equivalent was approved on
May 27, 1980. The loan was closed officially on September 30, 1989, three years
behind schedule, with a total disbursement of US$37.58 million and cancellations
totalling US$12.42 million; in fact, the books were kept open until March 31,
1990 to accommodate final disbursement, which occurred on March 27, 1990
(Table 2).
The PCR was prepared by the former Agriculture Technical Division of the
Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (EMENA) (Preface, Evaluation
Summary and Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).  It is based on the
Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements, Supervision Reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, Project Progress Reports and
the Borrower's Completion Report of June 1990.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

FORESTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 1853-PO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
ObJectives
1.    The objectives of the project were to:
(a)   increase  foreign  exchange  earnings  (and  savings)  and promote
economic growth by increasing forest production on marginal lands;
(b)   promote institution building by establishing a Forestry Extension
Service within the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP);
(c)   prepare a long-term integrated strategy for development of the
forestry sub-sector; and
(d)   improve incomes of poor, smallholder forest owners.
At the outset (1980), the project comprisedt
(a)   establishment of about 150,000 ha of new plantation forests by
expanding on-going afforestation programs, of which 90,000 ha would
be implemented by the Directorate General of Forests (DGF) and the
remaining 60,000 ha by the Cellulose and Paper Company of Portugal
(PORTUCEL);
(b)   technical assistance and training to:
(i) establish the basis for a Forest Extension Service within DGF
and training of forest extenoionists; and
(ii) prepare an in-depth study of the forestry sub-sector, with
special emphasis on the potential, needs, and approaches for
improvement of existing private and baldios (community)
forests, and define a long-term strategy for the development
of forests and forest industries;
(c)   the provision of credit for pilot scale integrated extraction,
forest management and marketing operations by associations or
cooperatives of small private forest owners; and



- iv -
(d)   the establishment of a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to coordinate
project   implementation,   progress   reporting,   monitoring  and
evaluation functions.
Imolementation ExDerience
2.    The project was prepared in January 1979 and appraised in October/November
1979. The loan was negotiated in April, 1980 and the project became effective
in March 1981. The original loan of US$50.0 million could not be fully utilized.
Although the physical targets were slightly reduced (plantation establishment was
changed to 130,000 ha) and some objectives were added (e.g. procurement of fire
detection equipment, short-term training, activities to improve natural
regeneration and range management), the major reason for less-than-estimated
dollar expenditure was that during project implementation, there was a large
devaluation of the escudo from 50 per US dollar at appraisal to about 160 by the
time the project was completed. The project closed officially in September 1989,
three years behind schedule, and cancellations totalled $12.42 million.
3.    Although plagued by shortages of staff, equipment and local finance
throughout much of its implementation, the project achieved many of its major
objectives but frequently only in part and, invariably, later than planned.
Result
4.    Defining a long-term development strategy for forestry and forest indus-
tries through the sub-sector study was a success; it resulted in the
establishment of an Interministerial Coordinating Committee for the Forestry Sub-
sector that was responsible for the formulation of policy, coordination of
development activities and monitoring of progress. Creation of the PCU was also
successful, but the Unit was disbanded, without warning in December 1986 before
the project ended and when there would have been advantage to retaining
monitoring and evaluation functions for activities of DGF.
5.    Some 87% of the revised plantation establishment target was eventually
achieved, but involved combining the European Community's (EC) grant funds and
the Bank's loan to meet financial shortfalls. A Forest Extension Service was
formed, but its members, although well-trained, were employed part-time and
already had full time work in forestry.   The pilot credit scheme was not
utilized.
6.    The Financial Rate of Return  (FRR)  to plantation establishment was
calculated comprising costs and prices for plantations at the time of appraisal
(1979) at 18.0%. The ex-vost FRR of only 9.3%, reflected timber prices rising
less than the SAR anticipated and the increase in plantation establishment costs
with the introduction of the EC's scheme in 1986.



Sustainabilitv
7.    Management of all forestry projects is committed to sustainability.  The
plantations are on marginal land and are not likely to be replaced by
agricultural crops.
8.    Bank performance could have been improved by greater flexibility in
preparation (e.g., more attention to the fire hazard in Portuguese forestry would
have prompted an earlier component for improvement of natural regeneration) and
in supervision (e.g., inclusion of additional technical skills would have
provided a further viewpoint on solutions to project problems).
9.    Performance of DGF personnel was good, but would have been improved by
greater consultation with Bank staff before substantive decisions were taken.
Findings and Lessons Learned
10.   (i)   Careful  and  realistic  project  preparation  is  essential,  with
adequate surveys of r-sources available, full consideration of
technical and socio-eccnomic problems, and complete assessment of
all project proposals and country institutional capabilities.
(ii)  Inadequacy of complementary financing was a major cause of financial
difficulty.   The possible use of executive bodies other than
Government, conditionality in loan agreements and constant vigilance
to ensure the budgets contain adequate funds are required to avoid
this situation.
(iii) Continuity in Bank and project management staff has a very positive
effect on project execution.
(iv)  Supervision mission staff should occasionally include additional
technical skills (e.g., an economist) to provide a fresh viewpoint
on solutions to project problems.
(v) Provisions in the Loan Agreement that require Bank approval of
changes in project organization should be strictly followed.
(vi)  A credit  scheme  for private  farmers  needs  to  consider  every
possibility in regard to its use if it is to be successful, e.g., if
the scheme is for purchase of equipment, one should consider how
much the equipment will be used each year re how long the payment of
the loan will be.

Backaround
1.    The 1980 national forest inventory showed that Portugal had approximately
2.97 million ha of forest (33.4% of the land area), comprising 1.37 million ha
of conifers (mainly Pinuj 2inaster in the north and west), 0.22 million ha of
eucalypts (primarily  .  lobulous in the west), 0.63 million ha of cork oak
(Ouercus amber) in the south west and 0.55 million ha of holm oak (Q. ilex) in
the south east. (In the 1990 inventory, Portugal had 3.21 million ha of forest
(34.0% of the land area), comprising 1.34 million ha of conifers, 0.50 million
ha of eucalypts, 0.66 million ha of cork oak and 0.46 million ha of holm oak).
The balance of 0.2 million ha comprised various broadleaved species and mixed
forests scattered throughout the country.
2.    In 1981, only 2.5% (75,000 ha) war  Stated-owned, 8.7% (259,000 ha) was
communal and 88.8% (2,634,000 ha) was private. Most eucalypts and 78.0% of the
pine forest were privately owned. The wood-based industry was well-developed and
appeared in balance with its domestic supply of raw materials.  It made the
following contributions to the national economy: pulp and paper: 38%; cork
products: 34%; sawmilling: 15%; resin products: 11%; and wood-based panels: 2%.
3.    The import/export balance was positive.   The value of forest product
exports in 1981 amounted to Esc. 43.0 billion (US$640 million), which was
approximately 60% of agricultural exports and 20% of total exports. Over the
decade 1971-80, the unit values of the various products had increased five times
in nominal terms, except cork, which had increased tenfold. Import substitution
during that period generated some Esc. 19.0 billion (US$257 million) savings in
foreign exchange.
4.    In 1979, there were three pulpmill companies:  PORTUCEL (a State-owned
majority), CELBI (a Swedish-owned majority) and CAIMA (a British-owned majority).
Each had a forestry division and the capacity to undertake afforestation, forest
management and exploitation. Formation of a fourth company, SOPORCEL (a private
Portuguese-owned majority), was under active consideration.



-  2  -
5.    In brief,  Government strategy for developing the forestry sub-sector
involved increasing the wood supply for industry from new and existing forests.
Afforestation was required for new forests or replacement of existing forests,
whilst increased production of existing forests involved improving forest
management.
6.    Government targets of 50,000 ha/year of afforestation and 120,000 ha/year
of  improved  forest  management  were  regarded  as  too  ambitious.    Recent
afforestation had not exceeded 15,000 ha/year and improvement of management,
especially among private farmers, was considered to require a period of technical
assistance, extension and institution building before significant investment
could be absorbed.
7.    With the aim, therefore,  of "helping Government to realize the full
potential of the sub-sector, by alleviating its different constraints", the
objectives (para. 8) were set at a combined total of 30,000 ha/year by the third
year of a six-year project for afforestation by both the Directorate General of
Forests (DGF) and the Government-controlled pulpmills (PORTUCEL). In addition,
the project would support forest management, after technical assistance, training
and extension for DGF and private farmers, in the early half of the 1980's. A
second phase was to follow, in which the Government would apply the experience
gained under the first (para. 12).
Proiect Obiectives and DescriDtion
8.    The objectives of the project were to:
(a)   increase  foreign  exchange  earnings  (and  savings)  and  promote
economic growth by increasing forest production on marginal lands;
(b)   promote institution building by establishing a Forestry Extension
Service within the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP);
(c)   prepare  a  long-term,  integrated  development  strategy  for the
forestry sub-sector; and
(d)   improve the incomes of poor, smallholder forest owners.
9.    The project consisted of:
(a)   establishment of about 150,000 ha of new plantation forests by
expanding the on-going afforestation programs, of which 90,000 ha
would be implemented by DGF and the remaining 60,000 ha by PORTUCEL;
(b)   technical assistance and training to:
(i) establish a Forest Extension Service within DGF and training
of forest extensionists; and
(ii) prepare an in-depth study of the forestry sub-sector, with
special emphasis on the potential, needs, and approaches for



improvement of existing private and baldios (community)
forests, and define a long-term strategy for development of
forests and forest industries;
(c)   provision of credit for pilot-scale integrated extraction, forest
management and marketing operations by associations or cooperatives
of small private forest owners; and
(d)   the establishment of a Project Coordinating Unit to coordinate
implementation, progress reporting, monitoring and evaluation
functions.
Prolect Desian and Oraanization
10.   The sub-sectoral problems which the project was to address were: (1)
Fragmentation of land ownership in the private sector, which complicated road
construction and timber harvesting and which was to be solved by adequate
incentives to form forestry associations or cooperatives; (2) Unsatisfactory
marketing organization, whereby independent logging contractors removed the best
trees with no regard to future yields, and which was to be addressed by farmers
marketing their own produce; (3) Lack of a small farmer forest extension
services; (4) Uncertainty over the land (agrarian) reform Law at the time of
acquisition of land for afforestation; and (5) Forest fires which had been a
worsening problem since 1968. Burning of older stands caused tree deaths, with
little timber lost if salvage fellings were done speedily and natural
regeneration occurred in the burned area, but a second fire in young trees caused
total losses.  Fire losses were to be reduced by increased patrolling, more
lookouts, etc.
11.   These  problems  were  more  difficult  to  solve  than  expected.    The
difficulties of persuading farmers to join cooperatives or take loans for
silviculture/logging equipment were underestimated. Reduced fire losses needed
thinning and pruning of naturally regenerated trees when young (5-8 years),
thereby reducing the trees combustubility and enabling fire-fighters to enter
them.
12.   The project was designed in two phases (para. 7). The first was to occupy
six years and comprised components that were relatively easy to implement, given
the experience and capability of DGF, e.g., expansion of the on-going
afforestation program and institution-building component for training and studies
in preparation for the more ambitious Phase II. The second phase would focus on
more complex components on which the Government had no previous implementation
experience. It would improve productivity of existing forests and was expected
to include provision of credit for forest cooperatives and associations and the
active participation of a Forestry Extension Service established under the first
phase.'
Although considered in some detail (1983-89), the Government finally
rejected Phase II of the Project. In early 1992, however, the subject
was re-raised.



13.   There was only one previous project in the agriculture sector (Table 1) and
it provided no guidance on the project's preparation or implementation.   The
project concept was innovative for Portugal -- e.g., plantations were to be
established at a wider spacing than usual (3m x 3m, primarily to enable
mechanized weeding). The scope and scale of the project were commensurate with
its objectives. The project was generally well-prepared and its timing was very
appropriate.
Proiect Implementation
14.   In early 1981, severe cuts in public sector expenditure and a freeze of
staff recruitment affected project implementation for the next five years. This
situation could not have been foreseen.
15.   The project's four objectives (para. 8) are related to the project's four
components (para. 9) i.e., forest production on marginal lands is directly
related to plantation establishment by DGF and PORTUCEL. The establishment of
a Forestry Extension Service is the first outcome of the technical assistance and
training component and the forestry sub-sector development strategy is the
second. Every component contributed to achievement of the last objective, i.e.,
Improving income of poor smallholder forest owners. This section, therefore,
will deal primarily with the implementation of the four major project components.
16.   The olantation establishment component was financially the most important -
certainly the most time consuming. It achieved many of its revised objectives
(Table 5c), but only by combining the European Community's (EC) grant funds of
the Portuguese Forest Action Plan (PAF) and those of the World Bank's loan and
extending the project by three years. Annual physical targets and achievements
for plantations, roads and firebreaks are shown in Table 4.
17.   Plantation establishment by DGF was plagued by shortages of staff,
equipment and finance throughout much of its implementation. Only half of the
equipment listed in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was procured because of the
private sector's unused capacity. DGF used about half its own equipment and half
private sector, with an inevitable increase in immediate costs because no
allowance had been made for the private sector's profit margin. Approval of the
Government budget was invariably late, particularly in 1981, the start of the
project when it was seven months late.  In subsequent years approved, unused
funds could be carried over one or more years. Although equipment operators and
foremen were transferred to the afforestation brigades (in much smaller numbers
than planned in the SAR) no graduates or technicians were transferred. Passage
of the Organic Law, in May 1985, confirmed that staff could not be transferred
as it was against Government policyl Contractors were finally used instead, in
September 1985, although the idea had administrative obstacles initially. The
loan period was extended twice to September 1988.  Meanwhile, the EC's grant
money became available on January 1, 1987 and was paying 75% of the total cost
of the project by July 1988.  Under EC regulations, it was not possible for
private owners to reimburse EC grant funds for reforestation undertaken on their
land. After much discussion, the loan period was extended by a third and final
year and the loan was used to finance tree planting on community land (baldios)
on which cost recovery was assured.



18.   Plantation establishment by PORTUCEL fell short of targets because of
difficulties in obtaining sufficient land on which to plant trees, either by
renting or outright purchase. Legislation existed to ease land acquisition for
afforestation, but Government was reluctant to enforce it as it was considered
too coercivel 2 SOPORCEL (the Portuguese Pulpmill Company) was offered a Bank
loan to plant some 12,000 ha, to boost the PORTUCEL total, but in December 1985
SOPORCEL finally withdrew as the conditions were considered too onerous. At the
end of the original loan period (September 1986), PORTUCEL repaid its loan and
the unallocated portion to the Government (US$12.0 million) to avoid assuming
further foreign risks.  The Government then cancelled this sum from the loan
agreement.
19.   Technical assistance and training was a partial success for the Forestry
Extension Service and a more complete success for the Forestry Sub-sector
development strategy. The extension consultant trained 11 forest technicians,
which included a tour to Scandinavia, and they served as the nucleus of the
Forestry Extension Service. He also prepared papers on the organization of the
Service, of Forestry Associations and use of credit in forestry. Formation of
the Service was delayed by the Organic Law but, finally, in late 1984, the scheme
was launched with most of the trained extensionists (two had been employed by the
pulpmill companies) and a coordinator in Lisbon. By October 1986, approximately
50 extension workers were employed in forestry (they were trained for 6 months
at the Lousa Training Center) but they continued to be employed only part-time,
i.e., they had full-time jobs in forestry. By January 1987, the EC was paying
65% of the cost of extension.
20.   An FAO Trust Fund, supported by the project, was used to finance the
Portuouese Forestry Sub-sector Study for which local and overseas consultants
prepared some 21 papers. In spite of an initial six months' delay in funding,
the Portuguese and English versions of the study were published in November 1982.
It was widely circulated to other Government Departments and the forest industry
and was very well received.  The recommendations on sub-sector development,
institution strengthening, sector planning, industrial development, forestry
cooperatives, pricing policy and multiple use formed the basis for Forestry II.
As a result, an Interministerial Coordinating Committee for the Forestry Sub-
sector was established in March 1983, and was responsible for the formulation of
overall policy, the coordination of development activities and monitoring of
progress. The Committee still exists, although its name has changed.  It has
achieved very little and requires reactivating.
21.   By any standards,  the Dilot credit scheme to purchase equipment for
extraction, management or marketing by Forest Cooperatives or Associations was
a failure. Following various studies by Government's Agricultural and Fisheries
Development Fund (IFADAP), the scheme was launched in early 1984.  Various
inquiries, by potential borrowers, were made for sizeable loans (Esc. 4.7-6.4
million), but no loans were made. IFADAP staff considered that the comparatively
high rate of interest was not a deterrent. A subsequent study (the results of
2     Limited afforestation by PORTUCEL after 1986 suggests that land
acquisition has continued to be constraint: 1986/87: 1,877 ha; 1987/88:
3,265 ha; 1988/89: 3,668 ha; 1989/90: 3,562 ha; 1990/91: 1,766 ha.



- 6 -
which the writer of the PCR fully accepts) suggests that the loan repayment
period (five years) was far too short, relative to the use of the equipment under
Portuguese conditions.
22.   The Proiect Coordinatina Unit   was established on July 9, 1980.   It
comprised six professionals and two support staff. It coordinated and monitored
the project, prepared progress reports, arranged for auditing project accounts,
pursued the pilot credit scheme, in 1985-86, and prepared the document, in
Portuguese, on Forestry Phase II (January 1986). No further action was taken to
obtain a loan for the latter as EC money for forest development was available as
a grant. The PCU was unexpectedly disbanded, in December 1986, because PORTUCEL
had withdrawn from the project and "no further coordination was required". The
Director was re-instated for a few months at the end of the present project to
prepare a combined progress report for the period that was not covered and a
completion report, published in June 1990.
Prolect Results
23.   Although the project implementation period was increased from six to nine
years and PORTUCEL withdrew in March 1987, the project achieved most of its
objectives. The notable exception is the pilot credit scheme (para 21), which,
in fact, was the predecessor of the recently approved scheme of the EC for
purchase of forest exploitation equipment. The exchange rate US Dollars/Escudos
increased substantially during the project period so that the amount of Escudos
available was greatly increased. As a result, project financing in escudos was
adequate to cover additional goods and services and, in particular, equipment for
fire detection, short-term training, treatment of natural regeneration and range
management. Table 5(c) lists the project components at the start and end of the
project.
24.   The economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated, in the SAR, at about 19%.
It was not possible to calculate an ERR at the end of the project to compare with
this figure as PORTUCEL's cost data for the period had been destroyed.   To
provide an indicative comparison of ex-ante and ex-post performance, financial
rates of return (FRR) were calculated at cost and prices at appraisal (1979)
compared to figures for 1989. The ex-ante FRR (1979) was 18.0% compared to the
ex-post figure of 9.3% (Annex, Part III).  The difference is explained by timber
prices rising less than the SAR had anticipated and the increase in costs of
plantation establishment following the introduction of the European Communities
scheme (PAF) in 1986.
25.   Foreign exchange earnings and forest production on marginal lands will
undoubtedly be increased but it is too early (eucalypts have rotations of 10-12
years and pines of 30 years) to say by how much. Institution building has been
promoted and an integrated strategy for the development of forestry sub-sector
has been prepared, but incomes of smallholder forest owners have been improved
by rural employment for afforestation rather than use of the pilot credit scheme
for procurement of forest exploitation and management equipment (para. 21). In
spite of the effect of forest fires, the creation of some 75,770 ha of conifers,
35,560 ha of eucalypts and 8,200 ha of other broadleaved species has had a very
positive effect on forest development in Portugal.



26.   Although the project may not have achieved all of ito objectives in a
timely manner, it did provide the basis for several subsequent initiatives in
Portuguese forestry, namely:
(a)   the formation of Forestry Associations for Afforestation and the
recently-approved European Community scheme for purchase of forest
exploitation equipment;
(b)   development of the DGF extension service since late 1984;
(C)   the  formation  of the  forest  sapeur-DomDier's  (fire-fighter's)
brigade in DGF and its operations to control forest fires; and
(d)   establishment  of  the  Monitoring  Groups  in the  five  regional
headquarters and in the Planning Division, in Lisbon, for the
European Community's action program for Portuguese Forestry (PAF).
Proiect Sustainabilitv
27.   Both DGF and PORTUCEL are committed to sustainability of yields of their
forestry plantations, which for conifers will be spread over 30 years and for
eucalypts will be four rotations, spread over 48 years. The yield will vary
slightly but is expected to be acceptable throughout the plantation's life. The
plantations are on marginal land and not likely to be displaced by agricultural
crops. on the contrary, some Portuguese crop land is likely to be afforested,
in accordance with the European Community's policy.
Bank Performance
28.   Bank performance throughout the project was consistent, but there were
three subjects in which the situation could have been improved:
(a)   The need to improve the source of raw material and combat the
forest fire hazard in Portugal should have prompted at least some
effort in a component for improvement (thinning and brashing 3) of
naturally regenerated pine.
(b)   There would have been merit in occasionally including additional
technical skills in supervision missions, e.g., an economist, who
could have provided an economic dimension to project problems and
solutions.
(C)   Long delays in implementation resulting from shortages of staff,
finance and equipment for planting, could have been circumvented by
early use of private contractors.
Pruning the lower branches of a tree.



Borrower Performance
29.   Performance by DGF/PORTUCEL/IFADAP/PCU was generally of a high standard,
as a result of the continuity and competence of project management. An exception
was the haste with which DGF disbanded the PCU in December 1986 before the
project was closed. The Unit had numerous on-going functions and there would
have been advantage in retaining a monitoring and evaluation function for DGF's
operations. A second issue, to which there is no simple solution, concerns the
disparity in incomes between personnel of DGF and the pulpmill companies (the
latter were some 40% higher). Members of DGF were attracted to the companies
(some 8-10 members of DGF transferred during the project period) and made project
planning more difficult.
Proiect Relationship
30.   The relationship between the Ministry, DGF, PCU and the Bank's staff was
excellent. The consistency of staff representation of both the Borrower (the
Project Manager was a member of the PCU staff throughout the project period) and
the Bank (one member of the staff had been consistently associated with the
project throughout supervision) proved especially useful throughout the
implementation up to and including preparation of this PCR.
Consultancv service
31.   The standard of consulting services (both nationally and internationally)
was generally good.   It included assistance with the sub-sector study, the
project outline for Forestry II and training under the project. Contractors used
for land preparation and plantation maintenance by both DGF and PORTUCEL and
suppliers of equipment and vehicles, mainly in the initial stages of the project,
performed well.
Proiect Documentation and Data
32.   Preparation and standards of project documentation (i.e., the six monthly
progress reports and terms of reference for consultants) were generally good.
There were delays in progress reports towards the end of the project. Reprinting
of the Loan Agreement, following revisions of 1984/85, took an inordinate amount
of time. The SAR was satisfactory, but would have been improved if background/
supporting data had been included in an implementation volume.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PORTUGAL
FORESTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 1853-PO)
PART II:   KEY PROJECT ISSUES FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVES
(a)   We have checked through the factual information contained in Part III of
the draft Project Completion Report and confirm that we are satisfied with the
accuracy and adequacy of the data that it contains.
(b)   We have also checked carefully through the analysis of Part I of the draft
Project Completion Report with the author and have the following comments to
make.
(i)  Para, l.    The results of the 1980 national forest inventory are
accurate but do not, of course, convey the extreme changes confirmed
by the 1990 figures. We consider that there would be advantage to
including the data from the 1990 national forest inventory for
comparison.
(ii)  Para    14    There  were  severe  cuts  in expenditure  and  staff
recruitment in 1981, but the month is unclear and we suggest that
"August 1981" be replaced by "early 1981".
(iii)  Para   18  PORTUCEL's failure to have met its planting targets under
the project may have been caused in part by its disenchantment with
the Loan's conditions.  It is suggested that its annual planting
achievements for 1986/87, 1987/88, 1988/89 and 1989/90 be included
for comparison as a footnote.
(iv)  Para, 20.   The Interministerial Coordinating Committee for the
Forestry Sub-sector still exists and has the same terms of
reference, although it has changed its name.   It has, however,
achieved very little and needs reactivating.
(v)  Para  21   The reasons given for the failure of the Pilot Credit
Scheme are correct, but may have been further influenced by the high
rate of interest.  This point should be checked with the IFADAF
personnel.
(vi)  Para  23   Although the project may not have achieved all of its
objectives in a timely manner it did provide the basis for several
subsequent initiatives in Portuguese forestry, namely:
V This section was prepared by the Government of Portugal, Directorate General.



- 10 -
1.    the formation of Forestry Associations for Afforestation and
the recently approved European Community scheme for purchase
of forest exploitation equipment;
2.    the DGF's Extension development since late 1984;
3.    the Sapeur-Pompier's formation in DGF and its operations to
control forest fires; and
4.    the Monitoring Groups in the five regional headquarters and in
the Planning Division, in Lisbon, for the European Community's
action program for Portuguese Forestry (PAF).
Reference to these developments should be made under Project Results.
(vii)  Para   24    It was explained that the content of this paragraph will
probably require a complete revision when the forest economist has
calculated the project's economic rate of return  .
(viii)  Para  25   The data and observation are correct but this paragraph
should include reference to the area of forest (broken down into
conifers, eucalytps and other broadleaved species) destroyed by fire
during the project period (1981-89). This information will be sent
to the World Bank by fax at the end of the week v/.
(ix)  Para  26   A penultimate sentence should be inserted to state: "On
the contrary, some Portuguese farming land is likely to be
afforeated, in accordance with the European Community's policy".
(c), (d) and (e). We have nothing further to add to the remarks already
made in the draft Project Completion Report on these subjects and that have our
complete agreement. We would suggest two further lessons from the Bank and the
Borrower's performance:
(i) Supervision missLon staff should occasionally include an additional
technician to provide a fresh viewpoint on solutions to project
problems.
(ii) As stated in the Loan Agreement, in projects that are financed by
the World Bank, changes should not be made that will affect the
project's organization without first consulting the Bank.

The Forest economist could not calculate an economic rate of return for
the project as PORTUCEL's cost data were not available (para. 24).

used.

Notes
1/  PAF (European Consunity Forestry Action Program) afforestation activities were countrywide, not only in project area, shoun as 1988/89 but, in fact, 1986-
89.  In addition, it accounted for 41,522 hectares of improvements to young naturally regerated woodland (mainly pine) such as thiming and pruning. Aended
Loan Agreement stated DGF should establish about 3,750 km of access road and firebreaks (actually did 5,036 km or 134.3X of target) and PORTUCEL should do
2,200 kim (actually did 2,898 km or 131.7X of target).

Ex-Post Investment Appraisal
It is not pcssible to calculate ex-post economic indicators that are
comparable with the ex-ante values presented in the Staff Appraisal Report
(para.5.09).  Actual costs are not available, year by year, for the PORTUCEL
component, and the level of aggregation is so high as to make it impossible to
apply the shadow wage rates and border cost equivalents used in the ex-ante
appraisal.
In order to provide an indicative comparison of ex-ante and ex-post
performance, financial rates of return have been calculated using the following
data.
For the ex-ante cash flow:
-     the forecast expenditure for the DGEF and PORTUCEL
components of the afforestation program and related works
(SAR, Annex 1, Table T-4)
-     the forecast timber harvest (SAR, Annex 1, Table T-10)
-     the farmgate prices given in paragraph 5.07 of the SAR  (Eac.
1,210/st ub for pine and hardwood roundwood, and Esc. 1.680/st ub
for eucalyptus), but excluding the project real price rise of 1.5%
per year, which seems dubious on present evidence.
For the ex-post cash flow:
cash flow models (Table 9A), based on actual afforestation costs in
1989, and current farmgate roundwood prices of: Esc. 3,000/st ub for
Eucalyptus plywood; Esc. 2,000/st ub for conifer pulpwood and Esc.
6,000/m3 for conifer sawlogs; Esc. 5,000/ton for hardwood fuelwood,
Esc. 6,000/m3 for small hardwood sawlogs, and Esc. 15,000/m3 for
large hardwood sawlogs;
-  the actual areas afforested (PCR, Table 9B)
Rates of return on these assumptions were 18.0% ex-ante and 9.3% ex-post
