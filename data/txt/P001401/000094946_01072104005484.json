Key lessons focus on: 1) quality at\n            entry, as an essential element in project design. It is\n            re-emphasized that consultations at preparation, with\n            stakeholders, particularly the private sector, facilitates\n            the understanding of reforms. Moreover, political risk\n            assessments should be adequately reviewed at preparation, to\n            consider political realities which may preclude successful\n            completion; 2) the need for strong, and consistent\n            government commitment, and ownership of the privatization\n            program to achieve success; 3) the need for a strong\n            privatization agency, supported by skilled staff, and\n            empowered with the appropriate authority to implement\n            reforms. The Project Unit was not an agency, rather a unit\n            under the Ministry of Finance, and was subject to political\n            approval, and endorsements, reducing its ability to prod\n            reform. Given that institutional capacity is a slow process,\n            expectations should be modest, rather, attention should be\n            geared towards monitoring, and reporting on the impact of\n            privatization. This is paramount to demonstrate that the\n            processes are delivering the benefits promised, to maintain\n            consensus, and keep up the momentum of reforms; and, 4)\n            public awareness, stakeholder participation, and consensus\n            approach as essential in policy design, and reform implementation."}, "docdt": "2001-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
