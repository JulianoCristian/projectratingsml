Appraisal of the Port of Calcutta Rehabilitation and Improvement Project
Summary
a.        This report covers an appraisal of a project for the rehabilitation
and improvement of the Port of Calcutta, submitted to the Bank by the Govern-
ment of India as a basis for a loan equivalent to about $29 million.
b.        The Commissioners for the Port of Calcutta (CPC) consisting of 24
members, is an autonomous authority under the control of the Government of
India.  It represents a variety of local interests and, in managing the port,
exercises a high degree of independence of the Government. Both the chief
executive officer, who is the Chairman of the Commission, and his senior
staff are competent, with sufficient experience to carry out the execution
of this Project.
c.        The Project consists of the conversion of several old King Georgets
Dock berths into three new general cargo berths with transit sheds, ore oil
berth and one laying-up berth.  Several berths in Kidderpore Docks will also
be improved and the ouay walls in twelve other berths reconditioned and
strengthened.  Electric cranes and lifts, miechanical cargo-handling equipment,
two floating cranes and other miscellaneous minor equipment are included.  The
existing railroad marshalling yard is to be improved and extended and addi-
tional railway equipment acquired.  The navigability of the River Hooghly in
the Fulta Point region is to be improved by cutting back Fu\lta Point and by
river training works. Most of the requirements are for rehabilitation and
improvement rather than the development of additional new facilities in the
port.
d.        CPC's record of net earnings since the end of the Second World
War has been erratic and at times poor. Th-ere has been a tendency to under-
state costs. No depreciation as such was charged and this has been reflected
in a lack of adequate replacement of the port's deteriorating properties.
However, there has been a marked improvement in the profitability of the port's
operations during the past two years. The stated net earnings during the
latest fiscal year (1957) were 12.7 million rupees, and those for the first
*        nine months of the fiscal year 1958 were relatively better.
e.        CPC's latest audited balance sheet (March 31, 1957) shows a rea-
sonably satisfactory condition. There are current assets of about 84h million
rupees, of which some 49 million rupees are in cash and government securities
available as working capital or for the Project. This is exclusive of other
earmarked funds totalling 10.4 million rupees.  If a loan is made for this
Project,the CPC should be the borrower.  The cost estimates andengineering
aspects of the proposed Project have been examined and are satisfactory.
Procurement is normally on the basis of international competitive bidding.
The total cost of the Project amounts to the equivalent of about $59 million,
of which the equivalent of $29 million is required in .oreign currency.



- i~i -
f.        The present indebtedness of th1e port amounts to 256.2 million
rupees, as compared to reserves aind surplus of 271.5 million rupees. All
long-term loans have, according to the provisions of the Calcutta Port Act,
a first claim on the property and income of the port.  A loan granted by
the Bank would enjoy the same security.
g.        It is estimated that the entire Project will be completed in 5
years. Disbursements in foreign currencies are scheduled over the full
5-year period.
h.        It is proposed that the foreign currency requirement of the
Project, be met by a Bank loan equivalent to w29 mill on.  The local
currency requirements can be met from the Commissioners' oawn funds and
from Government loans.
i.        On the basis of present traffic forecasts it can reasonably be
assumed that the f2oilLe3 to be provided by the Projec±, will be e2fec-
tively utilized.  Th.e mod rniza  Don of the port facilit-s will resul.t in
a more efficient and eco;-on-,ical operation of: the pcrt arKi in a sligCt
increase in handling capacity,  a quicker turnround of ves5sels will result,
which will help to alleviate the present congestion problem.
j.        The Project is suitable as a basi- for a Bank loan equivalent
to $29 million.  An appropri ate loan period would be 20 years, including
five years  grace during construction.



I. INTRODUCTION
This report covers an appraisal of a Project for the rehabilitation
and improvement of the Port of Calcutta submitted to the Bank in June 1957 as
a basis for a loan. This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission
which visited the port in October-November, 1957, and on information supplied
by the Port Commissioners and the Ministry of Transport.
II.  THE PORT OF CALCUTTA
A. General
1.        Calcutta has been growing rapidly since the late 17th Century,
and has become one of the world's largest cities (about 4 million inhab-
itants). It also ranks awnoug the twenty largest ports. The original
advantages of being sited on the -Hooghly River, a main nouth of th.e Ganges,
have been in recent decades negated both by the difficult -a:pproach of some
120 miles from the Bay of Bengal weth sandbarks at the estuary and 11 major
sandbars, and by the increasing size of modern ships. Today navigation for
ships of a draft above 26 feet is practically impossible and thus modern
vessels of 10,000 tons or more, when fully loaded, are excluded from trading
in the Port of Calcutta.
2.        Calcutta has prospered in spite of this and its hinterland has
remained one of the most. economically important regions in India.  It is
not only India's most densely populated area, but has achieved a high degree
of agricultural development, as well as rapid industrial growth in more
recent years.
3.        Seaborne traffic through the port has increased with the subst.an-
tial economic growth which has taken place since the middle of the 19th Cen*
tiuy. Berthing facilities which, prior to 188h, were limited to eight. wharves
of open construction, have been supplemnented by jetties, riverside wharves,
and two dock systems until a total of 42 berths are now available.  The most
recent improvement was the construction of three new general cargo berths
at Kidderpore Docks during the Second World Wlar (see paragraph 12).
4.        Partition created problems for the Port of Calcutta.  Its raw jute
trade was practically wTiped out and its supporting inland watenrTays were
seriously disrupted. The refugee problem has caused serious over-crowding
in the city itself. A neighboring port has been developed at Chittagong in
East Pakistan.  None of these difficulties are seriously threatening the
economic existence of the Port of Calcutta. Its future importance is allied
with the expanding trade of the Ganges Valley, the extensive schemes of the
Damodar Valley Corporation, and the impressive industrial development taking
place in the rest of its hinterland. The scope of these developments as well
as their effect on the prospects for the growth of traffic through the port
is discussed in Section III.



B. Organization and Management
5.        The Port of Calcutta is administered by a body of public and
private citizens called the Commissioners for the Port of CalcuttakCPC).
This body, although subject to the control of the Central Government has
substantial power over its most important affairs. Its day-to-day opera-
tions are not subject to outsi-de interference. It has the power to make
its oini financial arrangements, to set port charges and to plan its annual
budgets with only a final approval necessary from the Central Government's
Ministry of Transport. All appointments involving salaries of one thousand
rupees per month or more, the planning of major capital works and the placing
oL orders involving more than 700,000 rupees, must ultimately receive the ,in-
istry of Transport's approval. The jurisdiction of the CPC extfends beyond
the northern and southern limits of the port, (as shown in Drawing Appendix
C) running from a line of latitude 78 miles from the south of Saugor Island
to a point upstream 76 miles north of Calcutta.
7.        In addition to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman (whose seat is at
present vacant) there are 22 Com,issioners representing a wide variety of
interests:
Elected by the various business chambers in Calcutta                10
Elected oy Calcutta Corporation and by Howrah Irunicipality          2
The Commissioner of the Calcutta Corroration                         1
General Ananager, Eastern Railroad & Director of Rail Movements    2
Representative of Indian Shipowmers Association                      1
Representative of West Bengal Government                             1
Labor members nominated by Central Government                        2
Collector of Customs                                                 1
Principal Officer M1,ercantile iIarine Department                    1
Calcutta District Representative of the IMinistry of Defense         1
22
C. Labor
8.        The problem of labor in the Port of Calcutta is complicated,
inasmuch as work on board ship is performed by stevedoring labor, whose
employment is regulated under the Dock Labor Board Scheme, whilst shore
labor is all employed directly by the Port Commissioners. The Dock Labor
Board has some 10.645 men in its employ while the Port Commissioners have
12,264 workers handling the cargo. Different unions represent each group.
To a certain extent the problem is helped by having the Chairman of the
Port as Chairman of the Dock Labor Board. However, the bulk of the shore
labor is on a piece-rate basis, whereas the stevedore labor working the
ships is entirely on a time-rate basis. A scheme is being worked out which
will bring both groups under a full piece-rate system, and is likely to be
implemented during the first half of 1958.
9.        Since World War II, productivity of labor has been poor but in
more receiat months, due to the good work of both management and labor,
considerable improvement has been effected.  The rate of handling general



cargo is almost on a par wiith that now being achieved in Bombay and M4adras.
During the month of September an average of 579 tons of general cargo imports
-were handled per ship per day (of 3 shifts) ar.d 414 tons of general cargo
exports per ship per day (see Appendix Tables 3 and 4 for type of cargo).
These rates Till probably not be significantly improved upon until modern-
ization of the port's facilities has been completed and the piece-rate
scheme shows result,s.
10.       The introduction of a piece-rate system in Bombay has already
shown excellent results.  The productivity of labor went up about 5C%
after the system was introduced. Such an improvement can hardly be ex-
pected in Calcutta, inasmuch as productivity has already gone up substan-
tially.  For example, the average productivity of piece-rate shore labor
is already double what it was in mid-1956 (see Appendix Table 1). It is
considered that once the newr piece-rat-e scheme is introduced productivity
of labor in general in Calcutta may go up a further 15% or at a maximum
about 25%.
11.       Improvement in the handling of bulk cargo will be more gradual.
Results of mechanization ha-re so far been promising but _'bor has been
resisting further mechanization.  Coal is being loaded manually at two
berths at a rat.e of 700 tons per shift of 8 hours (see Appendix Table 2),
wxThile at the rrechanieal coal berth which has recently been installed, coal
is loaded at the rate of 2,500 tons per shift of 8 hours, i.e. over three
times as fast.  It is est.imated that elimination of delays to coal shins
through this mechanization may result in savings at the rate of about
200,000 per year for the coastal coal trade.
D. Existing Port Facilities
12.       There are in the Port of Calcutta (see Drawjing Appendix B) 42
berths, consisting of five remaining berths at the Calcutta jetties, 25
in Kidderpore Dock, 5 Garden Reach jetties and 7 in King Georwe's Dock.
These facilities have a capacity for handling between 8 and 8y million
tons of cargo a year, of which half is bulk cargo.  In the past more cargo
than this has been handled but these higher rates were achieved only at
the expense of unusually high costs.  Durine the war tonnages up to
11,000,000 tons, for the most part military cargo, wiere handled but without
regard to cost. This level of operations has again been achieved in recent
months although again at high cost. For example, 930,000 tons were handled
during September of 1957 but many of the ships unloaded cargoes at moorings
which involved expensive double handling as well as additional risk of
damage to both ships and cargo. This may be especially costly in the Hooghly
because the moorings as wiell as the riverside berths in the river bear the
full force of bore tides. These tides, which are occuring more and more
frequently (15 times during September 1957), make the river dangerous and
seriously interfere with cargo handling. Consequently, although berthing
space for 42 ships and moorings for an additional 60 are nominally available,
only 32 berths and 14 buoys are suitable for full time use.



-4-
13.       Its geographical location on a difficult river makes it essential
for the Port of Calcutta to have a relatively large and efficient fleet of
floating craft engaged on navigational and river conservation duties. At
the present time there are roughly 90 vessels in this service. The over-
aged condition of many of these vessels is a serious limitation to the
expeditious handling of shiDs. Because Calcutta is a terminal port with
a substantial amount of cargo to be discharged and loaded per ship (in
September 1957, 7,000 tons per ship), and the use of shipst derricks is
often not feasible, a large number of cranes are also needed. In Calcutta
there are normally five quay cranes per berth as well as additional yard
cranes at import berths, At the present time there are 239 cranes in the
King George's and Kidderpore Dock systems, of which 149 are antiquated and
hydraulically operated. IWith such cranes, highly efficient cargo handling
operations are not possible.
14.       Heavy lifts (packages over five tons) create an especially difficult
problem for the Port of Calcutta which now has four floating cranes from 20
to 60 tons capacity, three of which are over 30 years old and inefficient.
In addition, a 200-ton shore crane has just been installed and a very old
100-ton sheer legs is avTailable. With this equipment the port is now han-
dling about 185,000 tons of heavy lifts annually, but not without serious
delays partly due to the lack of storage areas and railwfay wagons slitable
.for heavy lifts, but also due to thie inefficient equipment available. These
delays cause congestion which is reflected in hold-ups to other cargo han-
dling. Similarly, a shortage of otiher types of cargo handling equipment
sets a limit on the overall level of operations in the port. For instance,
there are only six fork-lift trucks (with 12 more on order) and 21 mobile
cranes available for use throughout the port.
E. Amount of Traffic Handled by the Port
15.       Total traffic during the past two years has varied between eight
and nine million tons per year, or at about the same level as before the
Second World War, and two million tons lower than the wartime peak. How-
ever, the composition of this traffic has changed, wqith general cargo
imports growing rapidly and with the export of raw jute which in the prewar
period amounted to about 650,000 tons eliminated.  Bulk shipments have
remained fairly constant. Iron, steel and machinery imports have increased
by 400% and food graens by 150% since 1938-1939 (for details see Appendix
Table 5). The handling of such cargo as machinery and steel requires ad-
ditional time and skill and is a much greater problem in clearance to the
railway and customs authorities, providing one of the basic causes of
congestion in the port.
F. Congestion in the Port
16.       It has been estimated that from October 1956 to October 1957
there have been, on the average, at least 15 ships waiting at the mouth
of the Hooghly, indicating a loss of about 5,400 ship days a year at a
cost of approximately $2,000 each per day, or roughly $10,000,000 a year.
It is because of this that the shipping companies are now considering an



increase in their freight rates to Calcutta. According to published reports,
the direct cost of port congestion to the Government, as measured by demurrage
on cargo being imported for its owm account, has been as much as  o5,000,000
per year.
17.       The congestion at the Port of Calcutta is not temporary and cannot
be easily relieved.  It is only through the very competent combined efforts
of the leading port officials that the congestion has been improved, at least
for shipping. However, the congestion on the quays and in the sheds shows
little improvement.  For example, at the end of October 1957 there were
roughly 3,350 heavy lifts lying in the dock area and only about 680 were
even booked for removal on the railroads.
18.       Congestion is due to an increase in the tonnage of cargo being
handled by the port combined wit.h a decrease in the productivity of labor;
a change in the pattern of traffic; the grow,ing inefficiency of the mechan-
ical equipment employed; tche bunching of ships; and the increase in the size
of visiting ships.
19.       The growing quantify of difficult and heavy cargo such as machinery,
iron and steel is the most i mportant cause of congestion.  However, an ad-
ditional contributing cause is the bunching of ships and the increase in their
size.  In theory the arrival of ships can be phased, but bad weather, low
wat.er, and del2yr in other po5rts break up schecales, and with no reserve in
berthing accomn,Ddation in Calcutta shipping quickly becomes congested.  The
increase in the size of ships, especially in their draft, adds to the dLf-
ficulty.  The maximum draft permissible on the Hooghly is 26 feet, and this
is inadequate for many modern ves:-els.  Furthermore, water to the de-pnh of
26 feet is not always available and ships mast wait or be diverted to other
ports sLch as Madras or Vizagapatam to lighten their cargo or complete their
loading. It is noted that on 130 days of last year ships with a draft of
24 feet or over could not enter the port and on 97 days such ships could
not leave the port.
20.       The elimination of congestion in the Port of Calcutta requires a
two-fold program. The first is to make the port more efficient, permitting
the handling of slightly more traffic with a faster turnrouind of ships.
The Project now proposed is designed to meet this requirement. The second
is the long-term problem of meeting the needs of a growing volume of traffic.
Consideration of the development of a satellite port (discussed in para-
graphs hl-43) centers around this problem but does not directly affect the
present Project.

III.  TRAFFIC PROSPECTS
21.       Generally speaking, the rapid development in the hinterland of
Calcutta presages a steady expansion of future port traffic.  The fact
that there has been no substantial change in the level of traffic during
the past years is attributable to the shortcomings of the existing
facilities. It is estimated that traffic will increase in the Port of
Calcutta more or less as capacity becomes available.  The dermand for
imported machinery, equipment and steel is expected to continue to rise
during the Second iive-Year Plan although the foreign exchange crisis may
prevent the importation of some capital goods.  Chemrical imports are
expected to rise subst2ntially during the next ten years, as is other
general cargo. Total general cargo imports wiThich amounted to approximately
1,600,000 tons in 1938 had reached a level of 2,700,000 tons by 1956-1957
and are expected to continue to rise to 3,200,000 tons by 1960-1961.
General cargo ex-ports arc  also expected to grow substantially from
1,600,000 tons in 1956-1.^57 to 2,600,000 tons by 1965-1966.  in fact, the
forecast growth in all general cargo is from the current level of slightly
over 4,000,000 tons to almost 6,000,000 torns by 1965-1966. Thereafter,
growth will probably be restricted by the capacity to handle such
commodities.
22.       The forecast of the gro-oTth in Calcutta's trade in bulk commodities
is greatly limited by the facilities that dll be available. A substantial
growth in coastal trade especially in salt, coal and petroleum (see Appendix
Table 14), can be forecast, especially if the Government stimulates the
development of coastal shipping, There is little doubt that the coal traffic
can grow to a level of 3,000,0;)0 tons or higher as facilities permrL.t
There are several difficulties in forecasting the level of other bulk
traffic.  Trade in petroleum may depend on developments in Assam.  Exports
of iron ore will depend on what facilities are developed in the Calcutta
area during the next decade. it is, nonetheless, expected that there will
be a growth in bulk traffic from a);out 4,600,000 tons in 1956-1957 to
almost 6,000,000 tons by 1965-1966 on the basis of the improvements made
by CPC. Growth beyond this amotunt would require additional port capacity.
It is thus concluded that the volume of trade going throuJh the Port of
Calcutta will probably amount to 11 million tons by 1960-1961 and almost
12 million tons by 196)-1966.  (See Appendix Tabhle 5).
23.       On the basis of estimates of the increase in capacity resulting
from the present project (see Appendix Table 13), the port facilities
should be fully utilized at the end of the construction period and, as no
reserve capacity is planned, the port will probably continue to be
threatened with congestion. The present rehabilitation and improvement
project will thus help relieve congestion but is no solution for the long-
term port problem facing Calcutta.
IV. THE PR0POSED PROJECT
24.       The rehabilitation and improvement of the Port of Calcutta involves
an expenditure of roughly $29 million in foreign and $30 million
(Rs.142 million) in local currency, or a total of $59 million (Rs.280 million).



- 7-
The Project includes the following:
i)  improvement of berthing capacity (quay walls, sheds, ware-
houses, cranes, mechanical handling equipment, supply of
water and electricity) at a cost of $13.8 million
(Rs.65.8 million) in local currency and $7.2 million in
foreign currency, or a total of 4p21.0 million (Rs.100.1 million).
ii) Improvement of the River Hooghly (dredging and training works)
including the entrance to King George's Dock,at a cost of
$4.9 million (Rs.23.1 million) in local currency and
$,6.5 million in foreign currency or a total of $11.4 million
(Rs.54.2 million).
iii) Improvement of railway facilities (locomotives, wagons,
railway yard, and repair shop) at a cost of $L.6 million
(Rs.21.7 rmillion) in local currency and $1.7 million in
foreign rurrency, or a total of $6.3 million (Rs.290.7 million).
iv) Replacement of floating craft (survey vessels, dredgers, tugs,
launches, lighters, pilot vessels, etc.) at a cost of $1.9
million (Rs.9.1 mill on) of local currency and $9.8 million
of foreign currency, or a total of $11.7 million (Rs.5_06
rillion).
v)  11iscellaneous Project items (tea warehouse, fire protection
works, consultantts fees and contingencies) at a cost of
$4.z.7 million (Rs.22.2 million) of local currency and $3.8
maillion of foreign currency, or a total of $8.5 millioil
(Rs.4O0.4 million).
V. CO12ENTS CN THE2 PROJECT
A.  Improvements of berthing capacity
25.      King George's Dock - Several improvements in the capacity of
iing George's Dock are included in the Project (see Draw.ring, Appendix B).
An old oil berth is being converted into a general cargo berth and a new
oil berth is being built nearer Calcutta's storaj..e tank area (Appendix A,
Item 1). A shallow draft berth of war construction is being developed
into a modern general cargo berth ;,.ith a two-stcrey transit shed
(Appendix A, Item 2).  Two new berths are being constructed, one for
general cargo and the other as a repair berth (Apoendix A, Item 3).
The approximate cost of these improvearents is $8.6 million (Rs.bl million),
$1,360,000 being in foreign currency.  it is expected that this modest
increase in berthing capacity will not only enable the port to handle an
additional 180,000 tons of cargo per annum, but ,ill also pe-ait more
expeditious handling of cargo, eliminating some congestion.



- 8 -
26.      Rehabilitation of Kidderpore Docks - Many of the berths in the
Kidderpore Docks require reconditioning andmodernization. One of the
berths is being extended to permit its use by longer modern ships.
(Appendix A, No. 4).  Twelve berths are 70 years old and are now due for
reconstruction.  W-ithout the urgent repairs and strengt]hening: now proposed
(Appendix A, No. 5) at a cost of Rs. 30 million ($2,050,000 in foreign
currency), these berths wTill not be safe for deep draft vessels or for the
modern electric cranes which are to replace the existing 40-year-old
kydraulic cranes.  The proposal to strengthen these quay walls and to
acquire 56 electric cranes is essential if the turnround of ships in the
Kidderpore Dock is to be improved.
27.      Mechanization of cargo handling - Calcutta is in t.he early stages
of mechanizing the handling of general cargo.  This has to be done gradually
to avoid serious labor troubles. Labor is still cheap in Calcutta and the
job of loading and discharging cargo can probably be done more economically
by hand as far as the port's finances are concerned. However, that part
of' operations which affects the turnround of ships is costly for the Indian
economy and eventually results in higher freight rates.  At the present
time there are only eight berths in the port that are evon partly mechanized.
It is proposed to give these berths some additional miiechanical equipment,
including nine mobile cranes and 12 fork lifts, which will increase the
rate of handling at these berths.  The total requested for mechanical
handling equi-'rinent is about $1,000,000 all in foreign exchange.
28.      Floating cranes - The existing cranes are overworked and two of
capacity below 60 tons  are 33 and 52 years old and their replacement is
necessary as the cost of maintenance and repair is prohibitive. It is
proposed that two floating cranes of 30 and 60 tons be obtained in order
to relieve much of the congestion. These cranes will cost about
$1,900,000 all ln foreign exchange, and are justified in terms of the
port's necessary reha,bilitation.
29.      Improvement of water supply - The supply of fresh water in the
Port of Calcutta has been totally inadequate for a number of years.  During
the period August-September 1957 the port was able to supply only 70%
of the water actually requested.  Unless the port can provide a better
water supply, some ships have already indicated that they will stop using
the Port of Calcutta as a regular port of call. It is proposed that tube
wells be sunk at suitable points, overhead tanks be erected, pnuping and
chlorination facilities installed and distribution arranged.
30.      This improvement in the water supply system wTill cost $1.2 million
(Rs.5.9 million), of w-hich $200,000 is in foreign exchange. It is
anticipated that enough w;rater to meet the portts requirements can be
supplied at a price acceptable to the shipping companies and sufficient
to cover the full costs of the Project including interest on all the
capital.
B.   The improvement of the River Hooghly - Pulta Point Scheme
31.      Intensified dredging and execution of river training works are
necessary to maintain the regime of the River Hooghly. The increased



dredging has made the operation of the port more costly. The first
river training work undertaken as a result of model experiments by the
Central WJater and Power Research Station in Poona, was the construction
of a spur at Akra (see Appendix C Hap) which proved a success.  It is
now proposed to improve the flow conditions in the area by training works
and dredging at Fulta Point, which will improve the accessibility of
Calcutta for deeper draft ships because of the removal of three bars
which have in recent years been the governing bars for 70% of the time.
32.      In spite of very extensive maintenance dredging in the Fulta Point
reach of the river, navigable depths over the bars during much of each
year are decreasing, and it is apparent that the goal of the Port Comnis-
sioners to ensure access to the Port of Calcutta throughout the year to
vessels draiing 26 feet camnot be attained at an allowable cost bir dredging
alone.  lThe mrodel tests upon which the design of the Fulta Point improve-
ments is based indicate that a considerable improvement will be effected
in the navigable channel, and  the satisfactory results of the Akra spur
construction permit a feelinE of confidence in the predicted results of
the Fulta Point works. It is expected that greater depths can be
maintafined with a greatly reduced amount of dredging, that navigation
in this danFerous stretch of the river will becormie easier and safer, and
that the better depths will enable many ships to carry a greater volume
of cargo and will reduce delays to vessels which now have to aw,rait high
tides to cross the bars, with consequent savings to shipping. Although
the estimated cost of the works is high (Rs.49.3 million, $10.3 million
equivalent of which $6 million equivalent will be foreign exchange), the
Project is considered to be justifiable in view of the importance of the
Port of Calcutta to the economy of India.
33.      Entrance to King George's Dock - NTavigation of the entrance for
vessels leaving laing George's Dock on the strength of the flood tide is
very hazardous, because of the alignmient of the approach jetty.  At the
present time only two deep draft vessels a day can be taken out of the
dock.  After the approach Jetty is realianed, as recommended by the Poona
Research Station, and the bull nose on the upstream side of the entrance
renoved, it will be possible to take out at least one more deep laden ship
per day, thus increasing the entrance capacity by 50%. The forei_n
currency requirements for this work is about $500,000.
C.   lfmprovement of railway facilities
34.      About three-quarters of all port traffic is rail borne and the
present locormotive capacity is insufficient to clea:- the congestion at the
quays, sheds and storage areas.  Line new diesel locomotives are required
to speed up this work (see Appendix A, No. 16).
35.      Improvement of railway marshalling yard - The inadequacy of the
existing railway marshalling facilities is one of the most serious problems
facing the Port of Calcutta. The present railway yard does not allow for
continuous fornard movement, incoming trains have to wait for outgoing
ones, all switches are handosperated, and the yard can only accormmodate
trains with a maximum of 60 wagons each. It is proposed to extend the



- 10 -
yard to accommodate modern heavy trains of up to 70 wagons and to deal
with the marshalling, of wagons efficiently. Such an expansion necessitates
the diversion of the main Budge Budge line.
36.      The Budge Budge diversion plus the provision of a new himp
marshalling yard and the reconstruction of the ilajerhat Bridge will require
about $800,000 in foreign currency.  The layout is well desiEned and the
daily receiving capacity wi,ll be increased from 600 to 1,300 wagons.  On
the basis of projected traffic the new yard will adequately deal with all
railway requirements.
D.   Replacement of floating craft
37.      The proposals cover a relatively large number of floating craft
w4hich will replace over-aged and uneconomical ships now being used by the
port. As stated above, in a river port such as Calcutta more -'loating
craft are necessary than might be thought normal, because of the peculiar
difficulties caused by the River T-oo 7hly.  Operational requirements have
been increasing in recent years due to severe shoaling of some of the main
bars.  This has necessitated vastly increased dredging efforts as well as
additional coimnitments for maintenance and survey. The need for renewals
of, and additions to, the existing fleet was knoUn before the Second World
Wlar but the outbreak of hostilities made this impossible.  Furtheinore,
during the war traffic -,as heavy and rmost vessels and craft had to be
worked at full capacity, often -without adequate maintenance.  Such treatment
further accelerated their deterioration and, as a result, soon after the
war the replacemenit of the port's floating craft presented a very serious
problem.  The amount of capital required was very great and, therefore, the
replacement program had, of n-ecessity, to be phased. It is now prwposed
that a substantial number of vessels be replaced as follows:  1 salvage
tug-cum-despatch vessel, 1 bucket dredger with two attendant hopper barges,
1 pilot vessel, 2 firefloats w.ith attendant barges, 2 anchor vessels, 3
launches, 1 suction dredger and a number of minor vessels.  There is
ample justification for the inclusion of each of these items in the rehabili-
tation project. The total cost is Rs.55.6 million ($11.7 million
equivalent) of which )9.8 million equivalent is in foreign currency.
38.      Ship repair facilities - The existing ship repair facilities for
the port's craft are not proving adequate to maintain the 90 vessels
which are now in service. Even after all the proposed replacements have
been made, a large proportion will still be old vessels, and a substantial
amount of shaip repairing will continue to be necessary.  4loreover, the
time which is now required for repair is, in general, too long and w-rill be
considerably improved after this modernization program is effected.  The
proposal to improve the facilities for ship repairs at a cost in foreign
currency of $250,000 is thus justified (Appendix A, No. 25).
E.  !Hiscellaneous Projects and Contingencies
39.      New tea warehouse - Approximately 500 million pounds of tea
moved into the Port of Calcutta in the year 1956-1957, of which 80% was
shipped overseas. Of the total overseas shipment approximately 62% was



- 21 -
sold by auction in Calcutta.   The accommodation area available today for
the reception, storage, and processing of tea is a1'out 2,900,000 sq. ft.,
but over half of the area is in temporary sheds.   The Port Authority and
the Tea Board agree that it will be necessary to build additional warehouse
accommodation of a7pproximately 600,000 sq. ft.   The cost of constructing
the warehouse is estimated at t2.5 million (Rs. 11.5 million), including a
foreign exchange requirement of k!720,000 (see Appendix A, Item 28).
Estimeted annual revenue at present rates (the Tea Board agrees to guarantee
this amount of annual revenue) will be sufficient to cover all out-of-pocket
expenditure to the Port Commissioners for operation of the new warehouse,
plus interest, depreciation and all maintenance charges, plus a 7% return
on capital investment. The new tea warehouse is considered a justifiable
project.
40.    Contingencies. Enaineering and Ececution -  An amount of Rs. 12.9
million (02.7 million equivalent) of foreign currency and an equal amount of
local currency has been added for such contingencies as price increases,
underestimating of costs, and ather unforeseen circumstances.   The total
amounts to slightly over 10% of requirements. This is sufficient as the
cost estimates are reasonably firm and in many instance, based on accepted
tenders. In addition to contingencies an amount of $35G,000 has been pro->:
vided for engineering costs, such as consulting engineers' fees, supervision
and inspection, and approximately 7% for spares has been included in all items
of mechanical equipment.   The cost estimates and engineering aspects of the
proposed Project have been examined and are satisfactory.   Procurement is
normally on the basis of international competitive bidding.   The management
of the port is entirely competent to supervise the execution of the Project.
The port's consulting engineers, Messrs. Rendel, Palmer and Tritton, have
been consulted on all major technical questions relating to civil engineering
work and mechanical equipment.   They will continue to be consulted where
necessary in the preparation of specifications for such major items and in
the analysis of tenders relating thereto.
F.     Lone-term aspects of the Project
41.    As noted above, after the rehabilitation of the port is completed, there
will still be no reserve capacity in Calcutta and the port will probably con-
tinue to be threatened with congestion. Because of the restricted area of the
port, only limited possibilities exist for further expansion of its capacity.
Furthermore, the port will still be seriously hampered by its inability to
handle modern vessels of drafts greater than 26 feet. This is considered one
of the most serious transportation bottlenecks confronting the Indian economy.
42.    India is, of course, aware of this port problem now facing Calcutta.
Proposals have been made and rejected for a navigable canal between Calcutta
and Diamond Harbor, about half way between Calcutta and the sea on the left
bank of the Hooghly (see Appendix C). Other preliminary studies have been
made with the idea of building a new port near Geonkhali, a village almost
opposite Diamond Harbor.   The Director of the Research Station at Poona
expressed the opinion recently that it would not be possible to maintain a
depth in the river of more than 26 feet.   For this reason the Government
seems to be abandoning the idea of a new port at Geonkhali.



_ 12 -
43.      Because of the great importance of Tnis suoJec, .-everay
suggestions have been made concerning the long-term development of ports
in India and especially in the Calcutta area:
i)  A newi study of the capacity of the existing Port of Calcutta
should be made with regard to a further mechanization of the
handling of cargo.
ii)  The possibility of the further development of ling George's
Dock should be studied thoroughly. However, it seems that
the traffic conditions in the port area today are such
that it is doubtful whether much a:,ditional traffic from
new berths could be accommodated.
iii)  Further detailed study for a new port near Geonkhali is
advisable in order to determine whether accessibility to
deerer draft ships would be possible.  If the draft of ships
is definitely limited to 26 feet, then an investigation of
an articicial port further to the south is strongly suggested.
It is k-noin that this will be a very- difficult and expensive
Project (siltation, fast currents, cyclones, tidal waves,
etc.) but the increasingly important hinterland of Calcutta
needs better port facilities than can be provided by a port
with the present limitations.
iv)  If a new port is practicable, permitting ships to enter with
a draft of 36 to 4C feet, then it lioud be very important
for i,;s economical justification to give this port a basic
traffic in bulk comnmodities, such as the exportation of iron
ore in quantitvies of, say, six to eight million tons and
coal in quantities of four to six million tons.  The question
o-f wlhether crude or refined petroleum products could be
handled would also require further studny.  This would not
rule out the early establishment at Vizagapataam of
facilities for handling, say two to fo-r million tons of ore,
but if it proves that India can export much greater quantities
of ore a-nd also of coal, then the possibilities of a deep
liater port in the Calcutta area should be studied
thoroughly before additional ore-handling facilities are
built at Vizagapatan or neiw railway connections provided
thereto. The Government of India has indicated that it
intends to undertake such a study as soon as possible.

VI. PLAN FOR FINANCING THE PROJECT
44.       The investment required for this Project amounts to Rs. 280 million
($59 million equivalent) spread over the period 1957-1958 to 1962-1963. The
phasing of the expenditures is estimated as follows:
Exmenditures in million rupees
1957-   1958-   1959-   1960-   1961-   1962-   Total
1958    1259    1960    192U     122    1963
Foreign currency   6.1      9.1    42.3    39.2    33.3      8.0    138.0
Local currency    16.1    25.7    0.0    27.5    2 25    10.2    ;12.0
Total             22.2    34.8    82.3    66.7    55.8    18.2    280.0
Foreign currency
(in million dollar
equivalent)       1.3      1.9     8.9     8.2      7.0     1.7      29.0
45.       It is proposed to finance the foreign curr-ncy requirerients out of
the proceeds of an IBRD loan in the equivalent of s`29 million (Rs. 138 milliin)
to be made to CFO.  The loan, which is reflected in the forecasts given in
Appendix Table 8 (see below) has been assumed for calculation purposes only,
to have a term of 20 years including a five-year period of grace and to have
an interest rate of 5^%.
46.       The local currency requirements amount to approximately i30 million
equivalent (Rs. 142 million).  The information presented in Appendix Table 8
shows that on the basis of current income projections and loans already granted
CPC by the Government of India, the local currency requirements of the Project
can be met with no deterioration in the portts present reserve position.
Recent Financial History
47.       The earnings record of the COC since the end of the Second World
War, as shown in Appendix Table 11, has been erratic and at times poor. Net
after interest charges and .odest allowances for amortization of debt (in
lieu of depreciation) has averaged only Rs. 1.6 million per year or a total
of Rs. 17.7 million for the entire 11-year period. Five of the eleven years
were years of rather substantial deficits - 95% of net operating income for
the whole period was required merely to service debt, and most of this was
for interest requirements which are unusually low because of the interest-
free period on Government loans. The cost of maintenance, dredging, and re-
pairs has increased from 16.7% of total operating costs in 1947 to 23.4% in
1957.  This increased expenditure on maintenance and repair is largely attri-
butable to the poor physical condition of the port's facilities and the fact
that rehabilitation has been long overdue.



- 14 -
48.       During the Second iliorld "ar the port's facilities were used in-
tensely with indifferent maintenance and meagre replacement. Some steps
have recently been taken to improve the situation but the ravages of that
period have not yet been wiped out. Investment in new port facilities has
increased slowly during the past d-cade. During the First Five-Year Plan
and the first year (fiscal 1957) of the Second Five-Year ?lan, CPC's capi-
tal expenditures amounted to roughly Rs. 90 million, of which about three-
quarters was financed through Government loans on very generous terms (e.g.
eight years free of interest and amortization) and one-quarter came from
internal resources.
49.       Additional investment would have required more internal financial
resources. OPC has not been generating such resources in part because of an
inadequate depreciation policy. A more realistic level of depreciation
charges would have resulted in substantially more funds for capital invest-
ment. For this reason the Commissioners intend to undertake a study of the
proper level of depreciation.
Port Charges
50.       The current charges of the CPC are about double their prewar leval,
indicating a substantial lag in comparison with the rise in the general price
level.  Although it is doubtful if rates can be raised as long as congastiml
continues, CPO has indicated that there can be an increase in port charges
and that an increase will be put into effect at some future date if that
should be found necessary.
Current Financial Situation
51.       CPC's latest audited balance sheet (March 31, 1957) shows a reason-
ably satisfactory condition. There are current assets of about Rs. 84 mil-
lion, of which some Rs. 49 million are in cash and government securities avail-
able as working capital and for the Project. This amount is exclusive of
other earmarked funds totalling Rs. 10.4 million (see Appendix Table 12).
52.       There has been a marked improvement in the profitability of the
port's operations during the past two years. The port's net earnings during
the latest fiscal year (1957) were Rs. 12.7 million. The first nine months
of the current fiscal year were relatively better. Although the debt-service
coverage during the past 11 years has averaged 1.1 the ratio for the past two
fiscal years has been 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. Total debt presently repres-
ents 49¢% of combined debt and equity.
Financial Projections
53.       The financial forecasts presented in Appendix Table 10 are modifica-
tions of projections prepared by the COC. They are based on a reasonable
growth of traffic during the next six years (see Appendix Table 5). No in-
crease in port charges has been assumed in these calculations although they
may be forthcoming. Gross revenue is expected to increase by 20"p over that
currently being achieved by the port. Some improvement in efficiency is ex-
pected as the result of the new Project.  This should result in an improvement



- 15 -
in the net operating income before interest and depreciation from 28% of
gross revenue during the first half of the current fiscal year to 31% dur-
ing the fiscal year of 1964. Depreciation provisions are assumed for cal-
culating purposes to increase slowly to a depreciation charge of over 9% of
gross revenue by 1964.                                       The projected in-
come should be sufficient to show a debt-service coverage of 1.5 in 1963 -
1964 when rpaynent on the proposed IBRD loan is due to begin.  Including
the proposed IBRD loan of $29 million, by Mar .31, 1963, the total debt of the
CPC would represent 51% of combined debt and equity.
VII. ECONiOMIC JUSTIFTEATICO
54.       Approximately 65% of the funds to be invested in this project or
the equivalent of about $38 million equivalent are required to replace equip-
ment which has passed its useful economic life or improve existing facilities.
This investment is necessary to maintain the present level of traffic.
55.       The renmaining $21 million equivalent will result in a modest in-
crease in the annual handling capacity of the port of 1,700,000 tons (see
Aprendix Table 13). Based on the current average net profit of approximatGely
P.s. 3 per ton of cargo, the return on the capital invested in this expansion
would be over 5%. However, as this expansion will help relieve congestion in
the port, which will save many millions of dollars for India, the real econom-
ic return on this investment will undoubtedly be very high. As noted in para-
graph 16, the cost of congestion may be as high as $10 million annually which
would thus indicate an economic return of over 15%.
56.       The economic benefits of this Project muE't be mreasured in terms of
the contribution it makes towards solving a transportation problem facing
the Calcutta area. The Project raises the portts capacity sufficiently to
offer at least some relief for the next decade. However, the Project is
mostly for rehabilitation and improvement and is not intended as a solution
to the transportation bottleneck which is expected in the Calcutta Port.
The seriousness of this problem is emphasized both by the importance of the
area and the dynamic growth which has been taking place in Calcutta's hinter-
land.
57.       Calcutta is the main port serving a large and populous area of
India which includes all of Indiats jute mills as well as over 80% of the
countryts output of tea; these two commodities are India's most important
exports.  In fact, the Port of Calcutta handles 45% of all of India's gen-
eral -argo, both exports and imports, despite the condition of the port's
facilities.
58.       The potential of this area stems both from its agricultural re-
sources as well as its mineral resources. The Damodar Valley program will
result in important improvements in industrial and agricultural expansion.
More than 50% of all of the rice Iroduced in India now comes from Calcutta's
hinterland.  Over 60%o of India's lac, an important export commodity, and much
of India's exportable hides and skins as well as oil seed oroduction such as



- 16 -
linseed, sesame, mustard and rape come frorm here. Thus, although Calcutta's
hinterland is increasingly industrializing much of its present economic im-
portance still depends in large part on its agricultural resources.
59.       This area is now being called the future Ruhr of India, a trib-
ute to its rapidly developing iron and steel industry. Calcutta's hinter-
land contains most of India's coal and ore reserves and the greatest number
of existing mines and quarries. Consequently, practically all of India's
existing steel capacity has been located within a few hundred miles of Cal-
cutta (see Appendix D). Furthermore, most of the planned expansion which
is expected to result in 4.5 million tons of saleable steel by the early
1960's will also be in the area. This complex of coal, ore and steel is the
base for a significant future growth of numerous engineering and chemical
industries. The variety of new enterprises in this area is already impres-
sive, for example, the locomrotive factories at Tatanagar and Chittaranjan,
the Sindt-ifertilizer factory, the Bihar smp:rphosphate factory, the steel
pipe plant at Jamshedpur, the telephone cable plant at Rupharainpur, a wire
and wire products mill, a tinplate factory, and an agricultural implements
factory. This region is alrcady the fastest growing section of India. The
output of the two industries that have been particularly important in Cal-
cutta's hinterland, the chemical and engineering industries, is at present
growing at the rate of 20% and 15% per year respectively, whereas overall
industrial output in India has recently been growing at the rate of 8% or
9%' per annum.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND MCMkENDATIMNS
60.       The project for the rehabilitation and improvement of the Port
of Calcutta is sound and justified because it maintains a facility vitally
necessary for the continued growth of the most important economic region in
India. It will help reduce congestion by speeding up the turnaround of
ships and significantly reduce the cost of handling cargo in the port. Fur-
thermore, it will result in some increase in the portts capacity which is
necessary to meet the  -rowth in traffic expected during the next few years.
It is recommended that a loan equivalent to $29 million be made to CPC to
cover the foreign exchange costs of the project. A term of 20 years with
a grace period of five years is considered appropriate for such a loan.
61.       The potential for economic growth of Calcutta's hinterland is
such that longer term port development must be considered.  At the end
of the construction period, if traffic grows as is expected, there will
still be no reserve capacity and the port will continue to be threatened
with congestion. M4oreover, it will still not be possible to handle ships
of a draft of more than 26 feet, and modern general cargo ships will not be
able to use the port when fully loaded. In view of the imDortance of this
question the    Commissioners    in-end  to undertake a comprehensive in-
vestigation promptly, with the assistance of suitable ccnsultants, to deter-
mine the possibility and probable cost of developing a deep-water port in
the Calcutta area. The results of this study will not affect in any way
the need for the present Project.

62.       A realistic depreciation policy is necessary for proper determina-
tion of port charges. The Port Commissioners have agreed to have the port's
accounting procedures in respect of this matter examined promptly by quali-
fied consultants, and to inform the Bank of the recommendations received from
the consultants and the action they propose to take on such recomnendations.
