impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that in Indonesia\n            where the legal system has proven ineffective in enforcing\n            the repayment of debt, the willingness of Government to step\n            in and see to it that corporate restructuring takes place\n            was critical. The success of the Jakarta Initiative Task\n            Force (JITF) process has demonstrated the usefulness of\n            alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in Indonesia. The\n            voluntary nature of the JITF process did not work well until\n            an adequate incentive framework had been created. It is\n            important for the Government to take the lead in formulating\n            policies and designing mechanisms where fundamental changes\n            such as those supported by this Project are planned.\n            Political commitment needs to be demonstrated and cannot be\n            assumed. In a crisis situation, sufficient time and\n            attention need to be given to a rigorous project preparation\n            process: researching, assessing options, discussing and\n            getting full Government buy-in and designing effective\n            project management structures, before going ahead with\n            implementation. A lesson from this Project is that\n            inadequate attention and time saved in Project preparation\n            can be a false economy. Field based supervision was\n            important in this project because of the rapidly evolving\n            crisis situation. When new institutions are being created\n            and are untested, such as the Commercial Court and the JITF,\n            care should be taken to guard against making optimistic\n            assumptions and projections concerning their likely\n            effectiveness and performance. Preparation of a financial\n            management/procurement manual at the outset of a project and\n            training of PIU staff in its use can help ensure smooth\n            operations and minimize problems with procurement, payments\n            and disbursements."}, "docdt": "2004-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
