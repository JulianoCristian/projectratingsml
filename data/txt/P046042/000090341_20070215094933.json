Lessons learned from the\n            project: During implementation, the irrigation\n            rehabilitation project management faced some difficulties in\n            the selection of interventions that could be considered in\n            the project. Considering the desire to deal with as many\n            systems as possible, in some cases not all bottlenecks were\n            removed from the systems. In countries in transition, time\n            is essential. This project turned out to be very timely as\n            it was urgent to reverse the deterioration of irrigation\n            systems. Good supervision work is essential for satisfactory\n            outcome. Besides the quality and commitment of the project\n            implementation unit staff, the high quality and the\n            continuity of the supervision missions was instrumental to\n            the satisfactory implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2007-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
