The\n            project consists of three components.  i) Rehabilitation of\n            irrigation infrastructure will support emergency repairs and\n            selective low-cost rehabilitation of inter-farm irrigation\n            infrastructure.  This includes the rehabilitation,\n            completion, or improvement in monitoring systems of up to 12\n            irrigation dams.  It will also support inter-farm canal\n            networks to improve drainage.  ii) Capacity building will\n            include implementation support of the Project Implementation\n            Unit which handles the daily management, administration, and\n            coordination of the project.  This component will also\n            support institutional development by financing office\n            equipment, machinery, software to assist oblast and rayon\n            offices in the effective planning, operation, maintenance,\n            and management of irrigation and dam systems.  It will also\n            support various training activities and study tours.  iii)\n            Incremental maintenance will assist with the financing of\n            maintenance works for inter-farm irrigation infrastructure\n            associated with the subprojects."}, "docdt": "1998-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
