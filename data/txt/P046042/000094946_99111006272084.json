increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture\n            in the project area through improved water supply and will\n            constitute a six year program for irrigation rehabilitation.\n            With regard to direct effects the mitigation program will\n            particularly focus at the mitigation of poor construction\n            practices. The designs will include the designs of properly\n            landscaped silt deposits and the contractors for\n            construction works will be obliged to remove all equipment\n            and un-used construction materials after the works.\n            Undesirably high levels of groundwater will be partially\n            mitigated by improving drainage in some areas, which will\n            also benefit health problems resulting from increased\n            humidity in houses. Beyond that, this project is the first\n            step in a series of projects, in which the increases in\n            water use, inputs of agro-chemicals, waterlogging and\n            salination, and erosion will be dealt with by the follow-up\n            projects -- On-Farm Irrigation Project, Agricultural Support\n            Services Project, Rural Credit Project, and the Sheep\n            Project. It is recommended that all water quality and\n            quantity issues will be dealt with under a comprehensive\n            Integrated Water Management Action Plan identifying all\n            water needs, their mutual interactions and opportunities."}, "docdt": "1997-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
