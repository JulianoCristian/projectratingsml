The\n            lessons learned indicate that exclusion of key stakeholders\n            in preparation and implementation significantly reduce\n            benefits. Follow-up on key indicators needs to be sustained\n            throughout the entire duration of the project and\n            requirements regarding periodic reporting by the borrower\n            should be enforced. Careful coordination with other donors\n            is important to maximize benefits. Uncoordinated activities\n            can easily result in duplication of efforts or diversion of\n            efforts into lower-priority areas. The Legal Development\n            Project confirmed the general lesson from reform projects:\n            reform, including judicial reform, is a long-term process,\n            highly dependent on political will. To have the maximum\n            impact, technical reform initiatives should ideally be\n            planned to complement political progress on creation of the\n            legal and political foundation for reform initiatives."}, "docdt": "2004-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
