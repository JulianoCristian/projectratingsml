the Legal Development\n            Project will be to assist the Palestinian Authority in (a)\n            starting the process to put in place a legal framework\n            adequate to support a modern market economy and to encourage\n            the growth of the private sector; and (b) increasing the\n            efficiency and predictability of the judicial process. The\n            project's five components are to: (1) unify and develop\n            the existing legal framework by financing studies and the\n            services of outside experts to help draft legal texts and\n            give substantive advice; (2) improve the judiciary's\n            administrative and case management procedures, and reduce\n            the case backlog; (3) introduce selected training programs\n            for judges, develop a judicial education structure,\n            curriculum, and standards, establish a resource center,\n            train judicial educators, develop a long-range training\n            plan, establish internal and external programs, developing\n            teaching materials, and a code of ethics; (4) expand the use\n            of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms within the\n            judiciary; and (5) disseminate legislation and court\n            precedents to the legal, judicial, academic, and business\n            communities, and the public at large by enhancing law\n            libraries to serve as reference centers, support the\n            publication and dissemination of court decisions and laws,\n            and of bench manuals, support a legal information connection\n            to assist the Ministry of Justice in legal research, and\n            establish a legal database to support law dissemination."}, "docdt": "1997-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
