The\n            objective of the program is to support the Government's\n            adoption of an outward-looking strategy focused on improving\n            export competitiveness and increasing the efficiency of\n            Argentine industry. This will redress the strong anti-export\n            bias in the present system of tariff and non-tariff\n            protection.  It will also be linked to the maintenance of an\n            adequate exchange rate.  In conjunction with the Loan, the\n            Government will: (a) expand the temporary admission regime\n            and introduce automaticity and uniformity in its operation,\n            moving towards \"free trade\" status for exporters;\n            (b) simplify the whole system of approvals and controls of\n            trade administration; and (c) eliminate the remaining export\n            taxes on manufactures and reimburse indirect taxes on\n            exports; (d) rationalize the protection system and (e)\n            formulate an Action Program of trade reform for the second\n            phase of the trade policy reform program.  The program will\n            produce an improvement in growth, efficiency and export capacity."}, "docdt": "1987-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
