                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The program development objective is the establishment of an appropriate policy framework for an efficient national safety net system.

                          The proposed DPC support falls under pillar III of the CAS: supporting the poor and vulnerable. The CAS recognizes that the existing social assistance
                         programs cover a very small fraction of the poor, provide negligible benefits, and suffer from ineffective targeting, weak administration, and a lack of monitoring
                         and evaluation. To this end, the CAS notes that the Bank#s support will include support for safety nets that will (i) help the chronic poor cope with poverty, and
                         where possible; (ii) help the poor escape poverty, e.g., via conditional cash transfers; and (iii) help families and households cope with seasonal shocks.

                          The proposed DPC is fully consistent with the PRSP 2, which identifies assisting the poor and the vulnerable as a key objective of Government#s poverty
                         reduction strategy. The proposed DPC is also consistent with the National Social Protection Strategy that supports the development of an effective and
                         financially sustainable safety net system to promote the re-distributive goals of society
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The SSN DPC has two second tranche triggers. The first trigger requires the completion of poverty scorecard data collection in selected pilot districts. This trigger has been satisfied,
                         since poverty scorecard information for 15 districts has been transmitted to the data processing agency. The second trigger requires the BISP to (i) implement the policy decision to
                         remove beneficiaries of the parliamentarian based system who do not complete the scorecard form or qualify under the poverty-scorecard based system; (ii) adopt a transition policy
                         including but not limited to grievance mechanisms, definition of cut-off score for eligibility, plan for national roll-out, and communications strategy. This trigger is also satisfied, since (i)
                         the new poverty scorecard based beneficiary lists are notified, replacing the parliamentarian based enrollees, and they are transmitted to the payment agency for all 15 districts; and

                         (ii) transition policy to the new system is adopted by the BISP Board. However, the second tranche disbursement is currently on hold due to the Bank's inability to provide a positive
                         assessment of Pakistan's macroeconomic outlook.
