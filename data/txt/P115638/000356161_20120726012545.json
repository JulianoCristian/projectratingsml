Net\n            Development Policy Credit Project for Pakistan were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was high; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: a very strong Government\n            commitment and political will has been instrumental in\n            moving the safety net reform agenda forward in Pakistan. A\n            national international development database had already been\n            established by National Database and Registration Authority\n            (NADRA), which the Benazir Income Support program (BISP)\n            utilized for defining families in a manner that is\n            operationally relevant. The BISP was then able to build on\n            this database by linking poverty scorecard data to it.\n            Linking a DPL to technical assistance or investment\n            operations with a strong emphasis on Technical Assistance\n            (TA) ensures that decisions underpinning a Development\n            Policy Lending (DPL) do not remain 'dead letters'.\n            Instead they provide scope for developing and implementing a\n            detailed roadmap for putting a reform program into place.\n            Coordination with other donors can be particularly useful if\n            well done and timely. In this case, Department for\n            International Development (DFID) support was important in\n            getting early traction on developing the poverty scorecard\n            and providing rapid technical assistance, which was central\n            to advancing the overall effort."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
