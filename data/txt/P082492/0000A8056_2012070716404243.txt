                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is now in its very final stages and closes on August 31, 2012. Based on current progress, the Project Development Objectives (PDO) are expected to be partially
                         achieved, with the prospects for of long-term sustainability of various investments still critical. While the Deep Sea Fisheries Act is being implemented, it remains to be ratified by the
                         House of Representatives in Zanzibar (although the impact of this for sustainability is not yet clear , and the process for the establishment and operationalization of the Marine
                         Legacy Fund is significantly delayed. During the last months of project implementation it is crucial that efforts be focused on: (i) the finalization of a sustainability strategy for the Deep
                         Sea Fishing Authority comprising a phased approach, linked with a clear mission, vision and milestones, and associated budget requirements, (ii) the fast-tracking of the
                         establishment of the Marine Legacy Fund; and (iii) documenting and measuring project impacts.
