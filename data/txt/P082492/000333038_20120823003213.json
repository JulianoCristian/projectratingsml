The\n            closing date for the project will be extended from August\n            31, 2012 until February 15, 2013. The extension is necessary\n            to complete key ongoing activities such as the establishment\n            of the Marine Legacy Fund and to ensure the completion of\n            project impact evaluation studies that are critical to\n            achieve project objectives as well as to document those\n            achievements.
