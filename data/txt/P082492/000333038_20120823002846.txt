     MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY

1.     This Restructuring Paper responds to the request of the Government of the United
Republic of Tanzania and introduces the following changes in the Tanzania Marine and
Coastal Environmental Management Project (MACEMP; P082492 and P084213, Credit
TZ4106-TA/TF055580):
    Reallocation of funds to optimize project operations for the remaining project
       implementation period; and
    Extension of the project closing date by five and one-half months.


B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      As of July 23, 2012 The Project has disbursed $50,223,778 and $8,331,219 of its
IDA and GEF funds, respectively, representing 98% and 83% of the available funds. The
Project maintains a satisfactory FM rating and has no outstanding audit reports, nor IFRs.
Of the five PDO-level indicators, two have already been fully achieved, two are likely to
be partially or fully achieved, and one will not be achieved. Among the project’s most
important achievements are: (1) the strengthening of a common fisheries governance
regime, including the establishment of the Deep Sea Fishing Authority (DSFA) to
manage deep sea resources at the Union level; (2) the completion of several large civil
works, including the DSFA building in Unguja, the Fisheries Department building,
Mvuvi House, on the Mainland, two fish landing sites in Tumbe and Kendwa as well as
the near-completion of three fish landing sites in Rufiji, Nyamatsi and Kilindoni; (3) the
establishment of two ecologically representative networks of Marine Protected Areas
(MPAs), one on the mainland Tanzania and one in Zanzibar; (4) the tripling of territorial
seas under effective management, from 4% when the project was launched to over 13%;
and (5) benefits have been provided to all coastal districts, including 25,203 direct
beneficiaries served through a total of 792 livelihood sub-projects.

3.      However, several activities are still not fully accomplished, most importantly
including the establishment of the Marine Legacy Fund (MLF), completion of final
project evaluation studies, and finalization of construction of three fish landing sites.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

4.      There are two proposed changes:

    Reallocation

                                            4
The proposed reallocation is necessary to cover expenses related to the establishment of
the MLF, to successfully complete impact evaluation studies, and to support fisheries
management activities. Please see specific explanation and details on reallocation among
categories in Annex 1.

   Closing date

The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs of the Government of the United
Republic of Tanzania has requested that the project closing date be extended for the
second time. Based on an appraisal of time needed to complete the pending activities, the
Bank has agreed to an extension from August 31, 2012 to February 15, 2013. The first
extension of one year was granted on May 27, 2011, which extended the closing date
from August 31, 2011 to August 31, 2012. The second extension will allow the
Government to complete ongoing activities such as the establishment of the Marine
Legacy Fund, project evaluation studies that are critical to achieve project objectives as
well as to document those achievements, and final construction elements for three
fisheries landing sites.

2.     For project status please see section 2 on page 4.

3.       The project is nearly completed, and remaining tasks and funds have been
assessed to maximize project impact. Based on this assessment, the proposed reallocation
is necessary to cover expenses associated with several priority remaining activities. First,
additional operational costs are needed to support consultation sessions associated with
final studies, including the establishment of the Marine Legacy Fund, and project impact
and evaluation studies. Secondly, using GEF funds the GOT’s Marine Parks units has
purchased buoys to enable marine boundary demarcation in priority sites in all project-
supported Marine Protected Areas. The deployment of these buoys will be covered under
the operational cost under the IDA Credit. And thirdly, under the GEF Grant an
additional allocation to the training category is needed to cover project-related training
activities, which have already taken place.

4.      Overall, these reallocations have been made possible because: i) several planned
consultancies have been conducted by government institutions rather than by external
parties; ii) consultancies and civil works were less costly than anticipated due to changes
in the local currency value; and iii) the Government has granted VAT exemptions for
goods and civil works purchased through the Project.

                               Extension of Closing Date

     MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
                        P082492 AND P084213


1.     The closing date for MACEMP will be extended from August 31, 2012 until
February 15, 2013.

2.     For project status please see section 2 on page 4

3.     Most of the Project’s objectives continue to be achievable. The performance of
the borrower was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory due to largely the delays in
contracting of key studies, for which the extension is needed to allow completion.

4.      The proposed extension is necessary to complete key ongoing activities such as
the establishment of the Marine Legacy Fund and to ensure the completion of project
impact evaluation studies that are critical to achieve project objectives as well as to
document those achievements. Also, the extension will allow for the completion of
several civil works, more notably three fish landing sites in Rufiji, Nyamatsi and
Kilindoni. The Borrower has prepared a specific action plan to complete the project
within the new time period.

5.    This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension was granted
on May 27, 2011 and extended the project one year from August 31, 2011 to August 31,
2012.
