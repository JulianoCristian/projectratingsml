                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All major physical deliverables from MACEMP are now underway or completed, including Mvuvi house. Delivery on project indicators, particularly those related to the Development
                         and Global Environment Objectives, have either already been achieved or are on track for achievement by the end of project. The major pending deliverables are (i) the creation of
                         the Marine Legacy Fund, and studies are underway to propose models for the structure and functioning of the MLF, and (ii) permanently instituting the Interim Deep Sea Fishing
                         Authority.

                         The Government has requested a 12-month extension of the project closing date. The proposed extension would provide the Government with additional opportunities to consolidate
                         important project achievements in the area of institutional and legal reforms, such as the creation of the MLF, that support more sustainable use of marine resources in the Mainland
                         and in Zanzibar. The extension would also allow for additional time to compile and disseminate lessons learned from project implementation.
