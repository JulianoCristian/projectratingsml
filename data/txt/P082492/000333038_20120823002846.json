The\n            closing date for the project will be extended from August\n            31, 2012 until February 15, 2013. The extension is necessary\n            to complete key ongoing activities such as the establishment\n            of the Marine Legacy Fund and to ensure the completion of\n            project impact evaluation studies that are critical to\n            achieve project objectives as well as to document those\n            achievements. Also, the extension will allow for the\n            completion of several civil works, more notably three fish\n            landing sites in Rufiji, Nyamatsi and Kilindoni. The\n            Borrower has prepared a specific action plan to complete the\n            project within the new time period. This will be the second\n            extension of the project. The first extension was granted on\n            May 27, 2011 and extended the project one year from August\n            31, 2011 to August 31, 2012."}, "docdt": "2012-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
