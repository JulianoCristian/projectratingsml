                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During the past 6 months the Project has made important progress on: (i) the establishment of a functioning Monitoring and Control System (MCS); (ii) the strengthening of existing --
                         and establishment of new -- Marine Managed Areas; (iii) the consolidation of community management of fisheries resources, through the establishment of Community Managed
                         Areas (CMAs); and (iv) the promotion and piloting of sustainable community level investments (PPPs and community banks). Additionally, the Deep Sea Fishing Authority (DSFA)
                         was officially established through the endorsement of the DSFA Act by the Parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania. All major physical deliverables from MACEMP are now in
                         their final stages of completion. However, some of the Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators are unlikely to be achieved, unless there is a focused effort to : (i) develop a
                         long-term vision for the DSFA and future income generation options; and (ii) establish the Marine Legacy Fund, a critical element in ensuring sustainability of MPA-related project
                         investments.
