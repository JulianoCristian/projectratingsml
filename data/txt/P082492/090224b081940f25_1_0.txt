                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The ISR has been updated to reflect the approval of a Second Order Restructuring. The restructuring has introduced two changes: i) extension of the project closure date by five and
                         one-half months to February 15, 2013; and ii) reallocation of proceeds to optimizeproject operations for the remaining project implementation period. The extension will allow the
                         Government of Tanzania to complete ongoing activities such as: (i) the establishment of the Marine Legacy Fund (MLF), (ii) project evaluation studies that are critical to achieving
                         project objectives, and (iii) final construction elements for three fisheries landing sites.
