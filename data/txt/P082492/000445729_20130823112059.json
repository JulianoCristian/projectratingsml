performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: complex, difficult operations in the\n            fisheries sector with a high degree of innovation require an\n            extended time horizon, a high degree of flexibility,\n            continuous support for progressive capacity-building and\n            repeat financing to maximize impact, learning and\n            sustainability; given the complexity of the fisheries\n            sector, which addresses both coastal and offshore issues and\n            involves a wide range of institutions, a phased approach is\n            recommended for improved management; the scope of pilot\n            operations need to be carefully defined at the outset; when\n            adopting a multispectral approach, the scope of activities\n            needs to be focused on what the project can realistically\n            achieve; when projects are heavily focused on mainstreaming\n            into government structures, tensions can arise between the\n            need to build the institutions' capacity and the need\n            to effectively deliver the project."}, "docdt": "2013-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
