           Irrigation Project are to increase and stabilize crop\n            production and to raise productivity in a gross area of\n            148,400 ha (143,250 ha net) located about 250 km northeast\n            of Bucharest. This will be accomplished through construction\n            of an irrigation and drainage system and related facilities.\n            The project works will include construction of two main\n            pumping stations, 60 repumping and pressure pumping stations\n            and a storage lake. Distribution networks, soil reclamation\n            and valley training will also be included. About 114 km of\n            110 kv and 20 kv power lines together with related\n            transformer substations will be constructed to supply energy\n            to the pumping stations. Equipment for operation and\n            maintenance of irrigation and drainage works and farm\n            machinery to intensify agriculture on the area to be\n            irrigated will be supplied. The project is expected to\n            increase the gross production value in the project area from\n            a fluctuating annual average of about $35 million equivalent\n            to a relatively stable annual average of about $83 million.\n            Yield increases in various crops will range from 40 percent\n            to over 210 percent and cropping intensity will increase\n            about 19 percent."}, "docdt": "1979-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
