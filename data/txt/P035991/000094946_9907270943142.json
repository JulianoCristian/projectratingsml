       Its sustainability is unlikely and the little institutional\n            development that took place during its implementation has\n            been compromised by the demoralization of civil servants\n            following the re-occurrence of an unsettled political\n            climate. On the positive side, the project has contributed\n            to the structural transformation of Togo's economy\n            initiated under previous adjustment operations. Lessons\n            learned include: Because the political scene was volatile,\n            it would have been preferable to envisage a series of small\n            one-tranche adjustment operations, which would each be\n            triggered only after milestones were reached in a\n            medium-term program. It was agreed to sell 40 percent of the\n            shares and to complement this with corporate governance\n            measures to guarantee autonomous management of the\n            privatized company. The strategy for clearing domestic\n            arrears formulated in 1997 was appropriate, but to complete\n            its implementation would have required sustained fiscal\n            consolidation. In a context where the political situation\n            remains unsettled, macroeconomic improvements are prone to\n            reversal, but structural reforms are more resilient and can\n            help the economy to rebound once political problems get resolved."}, "docdt": "1999-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
