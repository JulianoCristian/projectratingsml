ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
(Credit 28490-TOG)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Economic Recovery
and Adjustment Credit (ERAC) in the Republic of Togo, for which Credit No. 28490-
TOG in the amount of SDR 32.2 million (US$50 million equivalent) was approved on
April 25, 1996, and made effective on June 20, 1996.
2.    The credit was closed on December 31, 1998, one year after the original closing
date of December 31, 1997. This was a two-tranche operation, which was fully
disbursed in May 1998.
3.    This ICR was prepared by Mr. J. Chevallier, consultant, and reviewed by the
country team. The summary of the Borrower's own evaluation of the credit is attached
as Appendix B.
4.    This ICR is based on material in the credit file and other related documents,
discussions with World Bank staff and government officials currently or formerly
charged with project implementation.  The Borrower contributed to this report by
evaluating the project's preparation and execution.  The draft ICR was sent to the
Borrower for comments, which have not yet been received.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.   In the early 1980s, after a decade of high growth and heavy external borrowing to
finance an ambitious public investment program, Togo failed to adjust to a sharp decline
in the international prices of its major exports. In 1983 Togo initiated a reform program
to reduce unsustainable public sector deficits and liberalize the economy, with support
from three structural adjustment credits (SALs) approved in 1983, 1985 and 1988. The
first two SALs were rated as satisfactory, but the third one as unsatisfactory, mainly
because the lack of attention to critically needed changes in the phosphate sector made
the reform process not credible. A fourth SAL was approved in 1990 to support a
deepening of the reform process, particularly regarding public enterprise divestiture and
public sector management. The political turmoil that affected the country from the last
quarter of 1990 to the end of 1993 was a major obstacle to program implementation, and
SAL IV was also rated as unsatisfactory. In January 1994, Togo along with the other
members of the CFA franc zone, devalued their common currency, the CFA franc, from
its fixed parity of 50 CFA francs per French franc to a new parity of 100 CFA francs per
French franc. The devaluation and the return to normalcy triggered a strong recovery,
with an export-led economic growth reaching 16 percent in 1994 and 7 percent in 1995.
Program Objectives and Description
2.    A new IDA country assistance strategy (CAS) was prepared for FY96-98. Its
objectives of promoting sustainable growth and reducing poverty were to be
implemented through a two-pronged approach to address both short-term emergency
needs and longer-term development objectives. ERAC was a central element in this
strategy.   The reform  program  supported  by ERAC  aimed  at: (i) restoring
macroeconomic stability through public finance measures and the acceleration of the
divestiture program; (ii) improving the environment for private sector development
through changes in the regulatory framework; and (iii) re-establishing a capacity to
deliver basic education, health and infrastructure services through targeted increases in
public expenditures.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Macroeconomic performance was uneven in 1996. Slippages in fiscal policy,
coupled with delays in the implementation of structural reforms, resulted in Togo's



11
failure to meet several key performance criteria and benchmarks under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program supported by the IMF. In late 1996-
early 1997 implementation of the reform program picked up steam under the strong
leadership of the new Prime Minister appointed in August 1996. The coordination
committee, with representatives from concerned ministries and agencies, was energized,
and good progress was made in the reform agenda. Macroeconomic performance was
satisfactory in 1997, and the conditions for second tranche release were formally met in
April 1998. Results achieved were jeopardized, however, by renewed political tensions
following charges of electoral fraud in June 1998 presidential elections.   The
management of the economy sharply deteriorated in 1998.
4.    Most tax and tariff reforms were implemented in 1995-96 in line with agreements
reached in the context of the discussions of the ERAC. Budget allocations to priority
sectors were gradually raised, but actual expenditures fell increasingly short of targets.
Substantial efforts were made in 1997 to address the large domestic arrears issue, but
poor public finance management in 1998 resulted in a new accumulation of arrears.
Implementation of the divestiture program  was slower than planned.  The partial
privatization of the Phosphate Company (OTP) was initiated in 1997, but has not been
completed. A new labor code providing for increased flexibility in hiring and firing
decisions was presented to Parliament in July 1997, but has not yet been approved. The
elimination of the monopoly of the marketing board helped improve the share of coffee
and cocoa producers in international prices.
5.    The outcome of the operation is unsatisfactory. Its sustainability is unlikely and
the little institutional development that took place during its implementation has been
compromised by the demoralization of civil servants following the re-occurrence of an
unsettled political climate.
Lessons from Experience
*  In view of the high risks of unsatisfactory performance due to the unsettled political
situation, a series of small one-tranche operations, each one triggered by satisfactory
implementation of a well-defined program, would have been a more appropriate
approach.
*  The extreme difficulty of effective mitigation measures for political risks merits
greater recognition. The partial privatization of OTP has not yet been completed
because of the deterioration of the political situation.
*  The strategy for clearing domestic arrears was well designed, but proved difficult to
implement in the context of insufficient fiscal consolidation
*  rn a context where the political situation remains unsettled, macroeconomic
improvements are prone to reversal, but structural reforms are more resilient and can
help the economy to rebound once political problems get resolved.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
(Credit 28490-TOG)
PART I - PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. BACKGROUND
I.   In the early 1980s, after a decade of high growth and heavy external borrowing to
finance an ambitious public investment program, Tog,o failed to adjust to a sharp decline
in the international prices of its major exports (phosphate, coffee, cocoa and cotton). In
1983, Togo initiated a reform program to reduce unsustainable public sector deficits and
liberalize the economy. Substantial progress was achieved and, after three years of deep
recession, growth resumed in 1984.  The reform program was supported by three
structural adjustment credits (SALs) approved in 1983, 1985 and 1988. The Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) rated the first two SALs as satisfactory, but the third one
as unsatisfactory, mainly because the lack of attention to critically needed changes in the
phosphate sector made the reform process not credible.
2.    A fourth SAL was approved in 1990 to support a deepening of the reform
process, particularly regarding public enterprise divestiture and public sector
management. The political turmoil that affected the country from the last quarter of
1990 to the end of 1993 was a major obstacle to program  implementation.  The
conditions for the release of the second tranche were eventually met in January 1994.
The third tranche was canceled because the conditions for its release had become
outdated. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) was issued in June 1995. OED
agreed with the conclusions of the ICR and rated the outcome of SAL IV as
unsatisfactory and its sustainability as unlikely. Major lessons drawn by the ICR were
that: (i) studies are no substitute for action; (ii) SALs are not well suited to support
implementation of institutional reforms; and (iii) public sector management reforms
require a more comprehensive approach than the one adopted in SAL IV.
3.    On January 12, 1994, Togo, along with the other members of the CFA franc zone,
devalued their common currency, the CFA franc, from its fixed parity of 50 CFA francs
per French franc to a new parity of 100 CFA francs per French franc. The devaluation
took place after a prolonged period of economic recession in the 13 CFA zone member
countries, resulting from a deterioration of the terms of trade and a significant
appreciation of the CFA franc since the mid-eighties. The devaluation and the return to
normalcy triggered a strong recovery, with an export-led economic growth reaching 16
percent in 1994 and 7 percent in 1995. Renewed competitiveness and favorable terms of
trade boosted merchandise exports, which rose by 19 percent in volume terms in 1994
and 1O percent in 1995.



2
4.    A new IDA country assistance strategy (CAS) for FY96-98 was discussed by the
Executive Directors in June 1995. Its main objectives of promoting sustainable growth
and reducing poverty were to be implemented through a two-pronged approach to
address both short-term emergency needs and longer-term development objectives. The
short-term agenda was focused on ensuring macroeconomic stability, restoring basic
social services, and rehabilitating essential physical infrastructure. To sustain economic
growth and alleviate poverty over the medium- to long-term, the strategy proposed to
support broad policy reforms and targeted investments to enhance the participation of the
poor in economic growth, create a favorable environment for private sector development,
and increase the efficiency and sustainability of natural resource management. ERAC
was a central instrument in the strategy. It was expected to address remaining broad-
based reform issues, including the opening of the national Phosphate Company (OTP) to
private investment, and to support an increase in public expenditure for education and
health.
B. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
5.    Program objectives. The reform program supported by ERAC aimed at (i)
restoring macroeconomic stability through public finance measures and the acceleration
of the divestiture program; (ii) improving the environment for private sector
development through changes in the regulatory framework; and (iii) re-establishing a
capacity to deliver basic education, health and infrastructure services through targeted
increases in public expenditures. Expected benefits were cast in general terms and not
quantified.
6.    Program design and cofinancing. The proceeds of the credit (US$50 million
equivalent) were to be disbursed in two tranches of SDR 19.28 million and SDR 12.92
million respectively. The first tranche was to be released upon effectiveness, and the
second after a satisfactory performance review, expected to take place in April/May
1997. The program was co-financed by Japan's OECF and was further supported by
parallel financing from the African Development Bank. The IMF extended its support
through a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) approved in
September 1994. The second year arrangement was approved in December 1995
1. Macroeconomic Objectives
7.    Continued implementation of appropriate macroeconomic policies was a
condition for the second tranche release. In this respect, it was expected that the primary
current deficit, which had declined from the equivalent of 10 percent of GDP in 1993 to
1.6 percent of GDP in 1995, would shift to a surplus. Government revenues, which fell
to an all-time low of 10 percent of GDP in 1993, were expected to increase to 17 percent
of GDP in 1997, the level achieved in 1991. Current expenditure was to be contained at
13 percent of GDP. The share of the wage bill in current outlays was to be maintained at
about 42 percent during the program period, down from 45 percent in previous years.
The objective of the monetary policy was to contain inflation through a reduction of the
money supply growth by maintaining a tight credit policy vis-A-vis the Government,



3
while expanding credit to the private sector. The annual inflation rate was expected to
decline from 35 percent in 1994 to 7 percent in 1996 and 5 percent in 1997.
2. Public Finances
8.    The program  was designed to rebuild the tax base, restructure public
expenditures, and eliminate arrears.
9.    Tax and tariff reform. The Togolese taxation system was simplified in the
1980s and the wide dispersion of tariffs was reduced to four rates ranging from 5 to 35
percent. Before the political crisis of the early 1990s, the ratio of government revenues
to GDP was in the 23 to 29 percent range, which was above avera;,e in the Africa region.
To increase the tax revenue ratio to 17 percent of GDP, the Government program
included a further simplification of the tax system and a broadening of the tax base by
reforming both business and indirect taxation.
10.   The reform program included the elimination of the presumptive minimum tax on
gross receipts levied on small businesses, which was to take place after consolidation of
the recently introduced value added tax (VAT). All small businesses were to be subject
to a single tax on business income, which would replace all current business taxes. The
compulsory contribution to the national investment fund (FNI, a government scheme to
promote investment) was eliminated in the 1996 budget.
11.   In 1995, the generalized sales tax (TGA) was replaced by the VAT, characterized
by a limited number of exemptions and a simple system of deductions. During the
preparation of the ERAC, the dispersion of import duties was further reduced to three
rates ranging from 5 to 20 percent, and the road tax was consolidated with the taxes on
petroleum products. The use of reference values for customs valuation was eliminated.
Remaining non-tariff barriers were abolished. In order to improve tax administration, the
Government created a special unit responsible for tax assessment and collection for major
taxpayers, and a single taxpayer registry.
12.   Public expenditures. Togo's fiscal situation was severely constrained after the
political crisis of 1990-93. There was little room for increasing revenue mobilization.
External assistance was resuming, but at a slow pace. Arrears had accumulated and basic
public programs were seriously underfunded. Under the ERAC, the Government agreed
to maintain the share of personnel expenditures in current outlays at about 42 percent and
to increase allocations to education and health as a share of public expenditure, excluding
debt service and foreign-financed investment, according to a detailed schedule.
Expenditure for routine road maintenance was to increase from CFAF 1.5 billion in 1995
to CFAF 2 billion in 1996, and CFAF 2.5 billion in 1997. The Public Investment
Program (PIP) for 1996-98 was reviewed as part of the ERAC preparation. It put
emphasis on the rehabilitation of physical and social infrastructures.
13.   Before negotiations for the ERAC, the Government had prepared an assessment
of domestic arrears, including cross debts, in the public sector. At the end of 1993, net



4
arrears to public enterprises and the private sector amounted to CFAF 24.8 billion. In
settling arrears, the Government agreed to give priority to public utilities and the private
sector. The settlement of arrears according to these priorities was a condition of second
tranche release.
3. Public Enterprises
14.   Under previous adjustment operations Togo had made good progress in
restructuring its public enterprise sector. From an initial portfolio of 78 enterprises, 37
were privatized or liquidated.  In 1990, a management information system  was
established to monitor performance of enterprises still in the public sector. In 1991,
performance contracts between the Govemment and the public utilities were signed. The
divestiture program was to be accelerated under the ERAC, with the liquidation and
privatization of 25 additional enterprises. In addition, a special focus was put on key
public enterprises requiring urgent attention in view of their importance for the economy
and the welfare of the population, including the OTP, the pharmaceutical company
(TOGOPHARMA) and the public utilities for water (RNET) and electricity (CEET).
15.   When OTP was nationalized in 1974, it was a highly profitable company,
exporting more than 3 million tons of phosphate a year. Gradually, however, it became
the main source of government financing for extra budgetary expenditures.  This,
combined with the overvaluation of the currency, led to a decline in production to about
2 million tons in the early 1990s. The devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 helped the
company improve its financial situation. It remained fragile, however, and a fresh
injection of capital was needed to finance delayed maintenance and investment
expenditures. Under ERAC, the Govemment agreed, albeit with considerable reluctance,
to open OTP to private sector participation. As a condition of second tranche release, the
Government agreed to bring to the point of sale no less than 40 percent of its shares.
16.   Until 1991, TOGOPHARMA had a monopoly on the import and distribution of
drugs. Its bloated administrative structure resulted in high operating costs and prices of
medicines to consumers. The monopoly was abolished in 1991, but only two new
importers were allowed to operate in the sector. The pricing structure for medicines was
characterized by a proportional markup over import prices, thus favoring high cost
specialties at the expense of low cost generic drugs. The adoption of a new price
structure for drugs, favoring the sale of generics, was a condition of second tranche
release.
17.   The water and electricity utilities suffered heavily during the political crisis of the
early 1990s. Public and private customer arrears accumulated, and the companies
stopped paying their suppliers and creditors.  The devaluation of the CFA franc
aggravated the situation.  To restore the financial viability of the utilities, the
Government increased water and electricity tariffs by 15 and 20 percent respectively in
1995. A user charge for standpipes was to be introduced in 1996, and a further tariff
increase in the order of 10-15 percent was to be implemented as a condition of second
tranche release.



5
4. Incentive and Regulatory Framework
18.  In the agriculture sector, a pricing system aimed at linking domestic to world
prices for coffee, cocoa and cotton was introduced in 1988. A guaranteed price was
announced at the beginning of each crop year, and farmers would receive a supplement
based on the after-tax profit of the marketing board (OPAT) and the cotton ginning
company (SOTOCO). The internal marketing of export crops was strictly regulated by
OPAT under a system of licenses and fixed profit margins. In addition, OPAT continued
to enjoy a monopoly on the export of coffee, cocoa and cotton. Its performance was poor
due to high direct and overhead costs.
19.   In 1994, the export of cotton was transferred to SOTOCO, which was given a
monopoly on all stages of cotton marketing and processing. In 1996, OPAT's monopoly
on the export of coffee and cocoa was abolished, and intemal marketing of these crops
was liberalized.  The liberalization of the cotton industry was envisaged, but with
caution, in view of the critical need to ensure the timely availability of pesticides and
fertilizers to producers. As a first step, the export of cotton-lint was to be liberalized
before the second tranche release. To improve producers' incentives, the Government
agreed to distribute 50 percent of SOTOCO's after-tax profits to farmers.
20.   Price controls, which were pervasive throughout the economy, were lifted for
most manufacturing goods in the 1980s. By the end of 1994, the price of six domestic
products remained controlled (cement, plastic pipes, wheat-flour, iron rods, corrugated
iron, beer and soft drinks), and eight imported products remained subject to fixed profit
margins (sugar, rice, vegetable oil, milk, tomato paste, LPG and sewing machines).
Despite the enactment of a new investment code in 1989, fiscal advantages continued to
be granted with a high level of discretion. Finally, the labor legislation was complex and
severely constrained hiring and firing by private employers.
21.   In 1995, all remaining price controls were abolished, except for drugs, petroleum
products, and utilities. The Government put an end to all fiscal incentives that had been
maintained beyond the expiration of their legal duration, and agreed to limit the
investment code to the general dispositions relating to non-discrimination, guarantees and
arbitration. The revision of the labor code was initiated.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROGRAM
22.   Macroeconomic perfornance was uneven in 1996. Slippages in fiscal policy,
coupled with delays in the implementation of structural reforms, resulted in Togo's
failure to meet several key performance criteria and benchmarks under the ESAF
program supported by the IMF. Approval of the third annual arrangement under the
ESAF was delayed by six months to June 1997.  In late 1996 and early 1997,
implementation of the reform program picked up steam under the strong leadership of the
new Prime Minister appointed in August 1996. The coordination committee, with
representatives from concerned ministries and agencies, was energized and good progress



6
was made in the reform agenda. The conditions for the second tranche release were
forrnally met in April 1998.
23.   The economic situation deteriorated in 1998. In the first half of 1998, the
combination of several years of lower-than-average rainfalls and poor management of the
power sector in Togo and neighboring countries led to a four-month energy crisis, with
negative consequences on economic growth. Prospects for economic recovery were
further dampened by rising political tensions following charges of electoral fraud in the
June 1998 presidential elections. The adjustment effort stalled, and progress made in
macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform was jeopardized.
24.   Two major risks were foreseen in the Memorandum of the President for the
proposed operation. The first risk was the possible deterioration of the political and
social situation. At the time of the ERAC approval, the President, the Prime Minister
and the Head of Parliament each represented rival parties, and the democratic institutions
mandated by the constitution were not in place.  It was felt, however, that the
representation of the opposition in the Government, the strong recovery of the economy
in 1994-95 and an immense fatigue with political strife were factors favoring political
stabilitv. A satisfactory implementation of reform programs supported by the ERAC was
seen as a means to mitigate the political risk. As indicated in the paragraph above, the
risk fully materialized, but only after the release of the second tranche of the credit.
25.   The second risk was the opposition of vested interest benefiting from the existing
policy environment, which might attempt to block implementation of policies designed to
increase competition and reduce rents, such as the reform of the incentive framework and
the privatization of public enterprises. The resistance of some parts of government to the
privatization of OTP persisted throughout program implementation.
D. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
1. Macroeconomic framework
26.   The economic recovery that began in 1994 strengthened in 1996 and 1997, with
growth ieaching an average of 6.9 percent per annum. After initial slippages, the fiscal
situation improved in 1997. The share of government revenues in GDP increased
slightly from  14.7 percent in 1995 to 14.7 in 1997.  With current expenditures
maintained under strict control, the fiscal primary balance moved from a deficit of 2.1
peicent of GDP in 1995 to a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP in 1997. The ratio of the
wage bill to revenues declined from 54 percent in 1995 to 44 percent in 1997, still above
the objective of 38 percent set for 1998. Post-devaluation pressures were gradually
brought under control and inflation was reduced from 35 percent in 1994 to an average
of 4.9 percent in 1996-97. The macro-economic objectives of the program were in the
process of being achieved in 1997, but renewed political tensions following charges of
electoral fraud in the June 1998 presidential elections have derailed the program. Budget
management sharply deteriorated in 1998, as recourse to exceptional payment procedures



7
and extra-budgetary transactions increased. The primary fiscal balance moved from a
small surplus to a deficit equivalent to 2.6 percent of GDP. Economic growth turned
negative.
2. Public Finances
27.   Tax and tariff reform. Most reforms were implemented in 1995-96 in line with
agreements reached during the negotiation of the ERAC. They were complemented
during the program period. In 1997, the two-rate VAT was simplified to a single rate of
18 percent, and the number of goods that were exonerated was further reduced. The
taxation of informal enterprises and low-income taxpayers was streamlined.  A
withholding tax on income was introduced. It was levied on imports or wholesale
purchases.  Tax penalties were reduced.  Despite efforts to broaden the tax base,
however, the contribution of large enterprises, i.e. those with a turnover higher than
CFAF 100 million (US$180,000), is more than 90 percent of total government revenues.
28.   Public expenditures. Allocations to priority sectors steadily increased during
1995-98, in line with the recommendations of the public expenditure reviews conducted
with the Bank. Allocations as a share of current expenditures increased to over 25
percent for the education sector, and to over 10 percent for the health sector. Actual
expenditure did increase during the program period, but fell short of the objectives as
shown in Table 1.

29.   In the education sector, Bank support helped stem the decline of the early 1990s,
through the financing of school supplies and the wages of auxiliary teachers. The
number of auxiliary teachers increased much faster than initially envisaged, however, and
their salaries crept up to the point where their cost advantage over teachers in the civil
service became negligible. Despite Bank support, increasing delays were reported in
recent months in the payment of salaries, which led to prolonged strikes of auxiliary
teachers. In the health sector, several donors and NGOs have compensated the
Government deficiencies in the delivery of basic services in some parts of the country.
The managers of district hospitals and health centers in the rest of the country have
learned to rely on their own resources, as they have received almost no support from the
Government in recent years, particularly in 1998.
30.   In the road sector, good progress was made in the resumption of maintenance
after the complete breakdown of the early 1990s. Bank support helped Togo initiate the
privatization of its road maintenance system in 1997. About 800 road workers have been
transformed into single-man enterprises, with each having the responsibility for a stretch
of road. A road fund has been established with revenue from a tax on petroleum
products (CFA franc 5 per liter). The road fund has been insulated from the recent
worsening of budgetary practices and is sufficient to adequately fund routine
maintenance and a small part of periodic maintenance.
31.   Domestic arrears.   A  detailed  assessment of arrears, including  claims
verification, was made in 1997 with the help of consultants. Excluding arrears to the
financial sector, the total amount was estimated at CFA franc 52.8 billion at the end of
1996. This amount was more than double the CFA franc 24.8 billion of net arrears at
end 1993, which served as a basis for the settlement plan agreed to during negotiations
for the ERAC. A strategy for clearing domestic arrears was elaborated and a committee
including representatives of the private sector was established to manage the process.
The strategy included rescheduling and securitization. The proceeds of privatization
were expected to substantially reduce the stock of debt upfront. The sale of a subsidiary
of OTP in South Africa provided the resources needed to implement a first step in the
implementation of the strategy in 1997. In 1998, the Government and the electricity
utility agreed on the settlement of cross debts. The reduction of arrears was a short-lived
process, however.  The worsening of the budget situation in 1998 has led to the
accumulation of new arrears.
3. Public enterprises
32.   After initial delays in carrying out asset valuations of the firms slated for
privatization, implementation of the divestiture program started in earnest in late 1996.
Government shares in four enterprises (a brewery, a match and cork factory, a cement
factory, and a wheat-flour mill) were sold to majority shareholders. The sale of shares in
an industrial gas company is underway. A large hotel in Lome was leased for 15 years in
February 1998, but the privatization of four other hotels has not yet been completed.

33.   The decision to liquidate eight companies, including OPAT, the export marketing
company, and companies in consulting, real estate, agricultural equipment, palm oil,
cereal marketing and shipping, was taken and the process launched. However, the
liquidation process has not been completed for any of these companies, as the
Government has been unable to pay accumulated debt. Thirteen enterprises, which were
supposed to have been liquidated in the 1980s, are in the same situation, raising serious
doubts as to the Government commitment to clean up the sector. While the main
objective of the liquidation program, which was to stop the drain of these enterprises on
the economy, has been achieved, it is not good practice to keep virtual enterprises alive.
34.   In February 1998, the Government offered for sale 40 percent of its shares in
OTP, with the understanding that the minority shareholder would manage the company
and eventually transfer 2 percent of the shares to employees. Out of six firms that were
pre-selected, only three bought the bid documents, and two of them made a joint
proposal. Negotiations with the fist bidder were unsuccessful, and the Government
found the second offer inadequate. Given present circumstances, it is highly unlikely
that the Government will get any better offer, if it decides to re-launch the privatization
process.  In the meantime, OTP continues to suffer from  poor management and
government interference. For lack of investment, its production has declined in 1998 by
about 11 percent to 2.2 million tons of phosphate, it lowest level in the 1990s, except for
1993 (1.6 millions).
35.   In the pharmaceutical sector, the Government established an independent entity
for public import (nd distribution of generic drugs and adopted a new pricing structure
favoring low cost drugs.  As a result, the number of private drug wholesalers has
increased from two to five. The objective of ERAC to improve the availability of
affordable drugs on the local market has been achieved. TOGOPHARMA has become
increasingly irrelevant.
36.   In the utility sector, tariffs were adjusted in October 1995.  Another tariff
adjustment took place in January 1997 in the water sector. In addition, the Government
has decided to privatize the management of the company. In the electricity sector, the
Government contracted out the management of the public company, pending its full
privatization, which was successfully launched in 1998. System losses and receivables
were sharply reduced in 1997. The energy crisis of the first part of 1998 has undernined
the positive results achieved, however.
4. Incentive and Regulatory Framework
37.   The Government liberalized the marketing of coffee and cocoa in June 1996.
Coffee and cocoa exports reached a record high in 1997, more than double the 1996
level.  The feared deterioration in quality did not occur.  As a result of intense
competition among traders, the share of producers in international prices increased from
below 60 percent to an average of 76 percent for coffee and 80 percent for cocoa. In the
context of a favorable intemational price, the real producer prices have increased during
1996-98, and the production jumped compared to the 1990-95 average. The main factor



10
in the success of the reforn was the close involvement of the private sector in its design.
The liquidation of OPAT, which was not envisaged initially, was a major achievement in
terms of improved transparency in the sector.
38.   In the cotton sector, a modest step was made on the liberalization path, with the
opening of cotton ginning and cotton-lint export activities in July 1997. To improve
farmers' incentives, a decree enacted in August 1997 directed SOTOCO to distribute 50
percent of its after-tax profits to producers. In November 1997, an amount of CFA franc
1. 1 billion was distributed to producers, corresponding to about 6 percent of the amount
they received when they sold their output. No distribution has yet been made on account
of the 1997-98 crop year. Overall, however, the share of producers in international
prices has not improved. The value of their production was on average equivalent to 62
percent of cotton exports in 1991-93. It declined to an average of 50 percent in 1996-98
as shown in the table below. A three-year average has been used to smooth out annual
variations.

39.   The major change expected in the regulatory framework was the enactment of a
new labor code to reduce legal constraints to the hiring and firing of staff. A draft code
was submitted to the Bank for comments before ERAC approval. A bill was introduced
to Parliament in July 1997, but no action has been taken so far.
E. BANK'S AND BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
40.   The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, appraisal and
supervision of SAL III was satisfactory. Bank staff did their best to help Togo recover
from the deep crisis of the early 1990s. In view of Togo's unsatisfactory performance
under the previous two adjustment operations, the Bank team made a special effort to
design a program that addressed the major structural issues, with substantial up-front
action by the Government. The satisfactory implementation of the reform program in
1997 demonstrated the success of this approach. The economy was recovering from the
recession of 1992-93, and more attention was being given to the efficient delivery of
essential services to the population.  Bank efforts proved futile, however, as the
deteriorating political situation, following widespread charges of electoral fraud in the
presidential elections, derailed the macro program and halted structural reforms.



11
41.   Supervision of SAL III was satisfactory. Resources were adequate and the focus
was on helping Togo with its reform program. In support of the supervision of the
ERAC, the Bank country team contributed to the preparation of Public Expenditure
Reviews (PER) for the priority sectors. Shortly after approval of SAL 111, the Africa
Region of the Bank changed its structure and appointed Country Directors with full
responsibility for the dialogue with a limited number of countries. The Director for
Togo, who had played an advisory role in the preparation of ERAC, devoted a large
amount of his time to help the Togolese authorities stay the course of adjustment. Both
the country economist and the resident representative, who led the preparation of the
ERAC, stayed on during program implementation. They provided excellent support to
the Togolese team of technicians, as well as to the Prime Minister, who took the
leadership of the reform program after the cabinet reshuffle in August 1996. In February
1998, the Bank approved the public enterprise restructuring and privatization support
project to help the Government implement its reform program.
42.   The Borrower's performance was satisfactory, until the run-up period to the
presidential elections of June 1998, when it became fully unsatisfactory. The elimination
of the monopoly of OPAT on cocoa and coffee marketing was the most significant
reform under the ERAC. An effort was made to improve the budget process and the
allocations to the social sectors, but it was not conclusive. The institutional changes in
the road maintenance system were well managed and are beginning to yield results. On
the other hand, the divestiture program suffered significant delays in 1996 and could not
be fully completed over the reform program period.
F. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME AND SUSTAINABILITY
43.   Implementation of the reform program supported by the ERAC was expected to
result in the restoration of internal and external financial equilibria. By improving
incentives, particularly in the cash crop sector, the program was also expected to have a
positive impact on economic growth and poverty reduction. Finally, the program was
designed to ensure the resumption of the provision of key social and infrastructure
services, with particular benefits for the poorest parts of the population. Except for the
macroeconomic framework, the benefits were not quantified, and it is therefore difficult
to make a detailed assessment of ERAC's outcome.
44.   The financial equilibria, which were in the process of being re-established, have
given way to the re-appearance of serious fiscal imbalances in 1998. The surplus
achieved in the primary current budget in 1997 turned into a deficit in 1998, as the result
of inadequate control over expenditures. The prospects for 1999 are poor. Phosphate
production will continue to decline in the absence of investment and better management.
Unfavorable prices for cotton in international markets will cut its contribution to the
economy. The confidence of the private sector has been undermined by the unsettled
political climate and the accumulation of arrears by the Government. Finally, the
banking sector is increasingly under stress and unable to support private sector activities.



12
45.   The liberalization of the coffee and cocoa sector had a positive impact on
producers' incomes. Bank support in the cotton sector contributed to a fast increase in
production and farmers' incomes, as reported in the ICR issued in April 1998 for the
Cotton Sector Development project approved in 1989.  Production of seed cotton
increased from an average of about 78,000 tons from 1986-89 to 146,000 tons in
1996/97, and 173,000 tons in 1997/98. The number of growers rose rapidly from
132,000 in 1987/88 to about 236,000 in 1997/98, as new producers have been attracted to
a crop, which provides a good cash income.
46.   It is too early to assess the impact of the divestiture program, which was very
delayed. The business environment has considerably deteriorated in 1998, and prospects
for an increase in production and employment in newly privatized or fully privatized
companies are not good. The partial privatization of OTP has not yet been completed
due largely to government inaction following the recent deterioration of the political and
economic situation in the aftermath of the June 1998 presidential elections.
47.   Positive measures have been taken to improve the private sector environment and
private investment has recovered from 5 percent of GDP to 12 percent on average in
1996-98. However, these achievements fell short of the program objectives and the
private investment ratio remained too low to generate the sustained strong growth needed
to alleviate poverty. During the program period, diversification of the economy has been
limited. Cotton and phosphate exports continue to represent about two thirds of domestic
exports.
48.   The delivery of basic services has marginally improved, except for road
maintenance, due mostly to donor support, including the Bank, rather than due to the
increased budget allocation. In 1999, expected government revenues are simply not
sufficient to cover the minimum level of priority expenditures.
49.   In view of the above, the outcome of the ERAC is rated unsatisfactory. Its
sustainability is unlikely and the little institutional development that took place during its
implementation has been compromised by the demoralization of civil servants following
the re-occurrence of an unsettled political climate. On the positive side, the ERAC has
contributed to the structural transformation of Togo's economy initiated under previous
adjustment operations. Major changes, such as the elimination of OPAT's role in the
export of cash crops, are unlikely to be undone.
G. FUTURE OPERATION
50.   In the absence of a political solution to the crisis triggered by charges of electoral
fraud in the 1998 presidential elections, it is unlikely that there will be any improvement
to the management of the economy, which is one of the conditions to resume discussions
over a financial sector adjustment program. The Government has little credibility,
internally or externally. The budget process is becoming increasingly meaningless. The



13
fiscal deficit is widening, domestic and external arrears are accumulating, and the
delivery of basic services is deteriorating.
H. LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE
51.   The risks of unsatisfactory performance were high when the ERAC was
approved. The previous two adjustment operations had been rated unsatisfactory. The
political scene was volatile, as the problems, which were at the root cause of the crisis in
the early 1990s, had not been settled. Under these conditions, it would have been
preferable to envisage a series of small one-tranche adjustment operations, which would
each have been triggered after satisfactory implementation of milestones under a
medium-term program.
52.   Although the Bank had recommended selling a majority of OTP's shares, the
Government was not willing to do so. After long negotiations, it was agreed to sell 40
percent of the shares and to complement this with corporate governance measures to
guarantee autonomous management of the privatized company. This strategy was
successful in attracting serious offers, but the transaction has not yet been completed as
negotiations have halted following the recent deterioration of the politico-economic
situation.
53.   The strategy for clearing domestic arrears formulated in 1997 was appropriate,
but to complete its implementation would have required sustained fiscal consolidation.
The scenario agreed upon during negotiations for the ERAC was based on a preliminary
estimate of the amount of domestic arrears as of end 1993, made at the time of ERAC
appraisal, and was corrected in 1997-98 by a detailed and comprehensive audit of
domestic arrears as of end-1996.
54.   In a context where the political situation remains unsettled, macroeconomic
improvements are prone to reversal, but structural reforms are more resilient and can
help the economy to rebound once political problems get resolved. During the program
period, the macroeconomic situation further improved both in terms of growth and fiscal
adjustment and main objectives were achieved. However, political uncertainty generated
by the contested presidential election and its aftermath, compounded by significant
slippages in fiscal management, led to a rapid deterioration of the macroeconomic and
financial situation in 1998-99. These developments explain why OTP partial
privatization and the clearing of government domestic arrears were not completed within
the program timeframe. On the other hand, structural reforms completed through the
program, in particular privatizations, liquidations, and coffee and cocoa liberalization,
are unlikely to be reversed and have contributed to the structural transformation of the
economy, paving the path for an economic rebound once the political situation improves
and external aid can resume.

REPUBLIQUE DU TOGO
CREDIT D'AJUSTEMENT ET DE RELANCE ECONOMIQUE
(Credit 28490-TOG)
MISSION DU 21 AU 25 FEVRIER 1999
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    Une mission compos6e de MM. Jer6me Chevallier, consultant, et Robert Eguida,
economiste a la mission residente, a sejoume au Togo du 21 au 25 fevrier 1999 pour
preparer le raport d'achevement pour le credit d'ajustement et de relance econormique
(CARE) finance par la Banque mondiale. La mission a ete re,ue par leurs Excellences
Essivi Florence Dzokpe, Ministre deleguee aupres du Premier Ministre, chargee de la
Restructuration Economique et de la Modemisation de l'Administration, et Assiba
Amoussou-Guenou, Ministre delegu6 aupres du Ministre d'Etat charge des Finances et
des Privatisations, charge des Finances et du Budget. La Direction de la Coordination du
Plan a organis6 des rencontres avec les representants de tous les ministeres et organismes
concernes par le programme. La mission exprime ses plus vifs remerciements pour la
disponibilite des participants et pour la qualite des discussions. La mission a egalement
rencontre des representants du secteur prive et des bailleurs de fonds.
2.    Le credit d'ajustement et de relance economique de la Banque mondiale (Cr.
2849-TO) d'un montant de 50 millions de dollars a ete approuve le 25 avril 1996, mis en
vigueur le 20 juin 1996 et clos le 31 decembre 1998, un an apres la date initiale de
cl6ture. Le credit a ete decaisse en deux tranches, la premiere au moment de la mise en
vigueur et la deuxieme en mai 1998. Le CARE avait pour objectif de favoriser la reprise
d'une croissance durable au Togo apres la crise politique qui avait paralyse l'economie
en 1992-93.  De facon plus precise, ses objectifs etaient de restaurer la stabilite
economique et financiere, de renforcer la reprise de l'offre par le secteur prive suite a la
devaluation du franc CFA et d'ameliorer la fourniture des services sociaux de base en
faveur de la population.  L'operation devait accelerer et approfondir le processus
d'ajustement engage par le Togo depuis le debut des annees 1980 et qui avait ete
interrompu par la crise de 1992-93.
3.    Les resultats escomptes du CARE avaient ete definis en termes generaux, sans
etre chiffres. 11 est donc tres difficile de comparer l'impact du programme avec les
previsions. II est clair cependant que, grace a la mise en oeuvre du programme de
reformes, la performance macroeconomique du Togo a ete tout a fait satisfaisante sur la
periode 1995 - 1997, avec une croissance moyenne de l'ordre de 6 pourcent par an,
1'e1imination du deficit primaire et une bonne maitrise de l'inflation. Les allocations
budgetaires pour I'education, la sante et 1'entretien routier ont ete sensiblement
augmentees au cours des trois demieres annees.  Le Togo remontait la pente. 11 est



27
regrettable dans ces conditions de constater que la situation economique et financiere
s'est deterioree en 1998, sous l'effet en particulier de la crise politique ouverte en juin
1998 par des elections presidentielles, dont les resultats ont ete contestes.
4.     Des facteurs externes et internes ont contribue a un recul de l'activite economique
en 1998.  Une faible pluviometrie a affecte les cultures vivrieres.  La production
cotoniere a continue a augmenter, mais les cours mondiaux ont baisse suite a la crise
asiatique. La production de l'Office Togolais des Phosphates (OTP) a connu une baisse,
qui risque de devenir structurelle, en raison principalement du manque de renouvellement
des equipements au cours de ces derni&es annees. La crise des approvisionnements en
electricite entre fevrier et juin 1998 a ralenti un grand nombre d'activites economiques.
Cette crise etait pourtant previsible et n'a pas ete geree avec suffisamment de vigueur et
d'efficacit&
5.     La gestion des finances publiques s'est relachee en 1998. Les depenses extra
budgetaires ont augmente, alors que les recettes plafonnaient au niveau atteint en 1997.
Les entreprises publiques et le systeme bancaire ont ete mis a contribution pour financer
le deficit de l'Etat dans des conditions qui les ont fragilises. Des efforts avaient et
engages en 1997 pour apurer la dette inteme de I'Etat, en utilisant en particulier les
recettes de la privatisation pour reduire les arrieres. Le retour d'un deficit primaire en
1998 a contribue a accroitre les arrieres avec toute les consequences negatives sur la
confiance du secteur prive.
6.     Les reformes prevues dans les quatre volets du programme d'ajustement et de
relance economique ont ete dans l'ensemble realisees. Le regime fiscal et douanier a et
reforme en profondeur. Le programme de liquidation et de privatisation des entreprises
publiques s'est poursuivi. Le cadre incitatif et reglementaire a et modifie. Enfin, les
allocations budgetaires pour les secteurs de l'education, de la sante et de l'entretien
routier ont ete accrues.
7.     Certaines des reformes engagees n'ont cependant pas ete conduites jusqu'au bout
et d'autres n'ont pas ete menees avec suffisamment de conviction. C'est ainsi que le
projet de code du travail visant a liberaliser les conditions d'embauche et de licenciement
est en souffrance au Parlement depuis juillet 1997. Les allocations budgetaires pour les
secteurs prioritaires se sont accrues, mais les depenses effectivement realisees sont bien
inferieures aux previsions. 11 n'est cependant pas possible a ce stade d'avoir une situation
precise des paiements effectues au titre du budget 1998, ni d'ailleurs au titre des budgets
anterieurs. 11 est hautement souhaitable que la situation des paiements pour 1998 soit
etablie le plus rapidement possible.
8.     Le programme de privatisation  ne s'est pas deroule dans les meilleures
conditions. La cession de 40 pourcent des parts de l'Etat dans l'OPT n'a pas pu etre
menee a bien, les deux acquereurs potentiels n'ayant pas offert des conditions jugees
acceptables par le Gouvemement. II faut reconnaitre cependant que les conditions dans
lesquelles devait s'effectuer cette privatisation partielle n'etaient pas des plus favorables.



28
En effet, le schema de privatisation retenu par le gouvernement et qui prevoyait la
cession d'une part minoritaire du capital (seulement 40 pourcent, dont 2 percent aux
salaries), n'etait pas de nature a attirer des investisseurs pouvant offrir des termes
avantageux, stagissant en outre d'une entreprise qui a toujours fait l'objet de larges
interferences de l'Etat dans la gestion. Cette situation se trouve aggravee par le fait que
les comptes de l'entreprise pour l'exercice 1997 ne sont pas arretes et que les comptes des
exercices passes avaient fait l'objet de reserves importantes de la part des auditeurs. Dans
ces conditions, on peut regretter que les negociations aient apparemment ete rompues. La
Banque estime en effet que l'un des candidats a la reprise offrait des references
techniques solides et qu'il n'est pas certain que d'autres investisseurs serieux puissent
etre identifies rapidement, etant donne les conditions particulieres de cession evoques ci-
dessus. En ce qui concerne le reste du programme de privatisation, l'Etat a cede ses parts
dans quatre entreprises (CIMTOGO, BB, SIT, SGMT). La liquidation de sept entreprises
a ete engagee, mais n'est pas encore terminee ( ce qui n'est pas tout a fait surprenant
quand on sait que 13 des liquidations initiees dans les annees 80 ne sont toujours pas
cl6turees). 11 est regrettable aussi de constater qu'aucun effort serieux n'a ete fait pour
interesser les epargnants locaux a l'acquisition d'actions lors de la cession des parts de
l'Etat dans les quatre entreprises ou il etait actionnaire minoritaire.
9.     Des mesures ont ete prises dans le cadre du programme pour augmenter la part
des producteurs agricoles dans les recettes d'exportation du cafe, du cacao et du coton.
La filiere cafe/cacao a ete liberalisee. 11 est souhaitable qu'une etude soit menee pour
mesurer l'impact de cette reforme sur les revenus des paysans. En ce qui concerne les
producteurs de coton, une ristourne correspondant a environ 6 pourcent du prix d'achat
leur a ete versee en novembre 1997. Par contre, la ristourne pour la campagne 1997-98
n'a pas encore ete versee.
10.   Lors de la preparation du credit d'ajustement et de relance economique, deux
risques principaux avaient ete envisages. Le premier risque etait qu'une deterioration de
la situation politique et sociale ne vienne entraver l'execution du programme. Ce risque
s'est en effet materialise, mais seulement une fois le programme execute. Le second
risque etait que des interets bien etablis, beneficiant de rentes de situation, usent de leur
influence pour bloquer la mise en oeuvre de politiques visant a ouvrir leurs activites a la
concurrence. Ce risque s'est aussi materialise. Les reformes ont ete introduites, mais
leur mise en oeuvre effective laisse a desirer.
11.   En raison de la forte deterioration de la gestion economique et financiere en 1998,
la mission estime que les resultats du programme d'ajustement et de relance economique
sont insatisfaisants. Si le Gouvernement ne met pas en place rapidement un ensemble de
mesures visant au redressement de la situation economique et financiere et au
retablissement de la confiance, il est peu probable que les acquis des reformes engagees
soient durables. Bien que le developpement des institutions ne faisait pas partie de fa,on
explicite des objectifs du programme, la capacite de l'administration a et renforc6e
pendant l'execution du programme. Les resultats sont cependant fragiles et ne
survivraient pas a une nouvelle crise economique et financiere.



29
12.   La mission va maintenant etablir son rapport qui sera envoye aux autorites
togolaises pour observations au debut du mois d'avril 1999. La partie togolaise est
invitee a preparer son propre rapport d'achevement. Le rapport final, y compris la
contribution togolaise, sera envoye au Conseil d'Administration de la Banque Mondiale
avant la fin du mois de Mai 1999.

To this end, a Bank mission spent the period February 22-26, 1999 in Lome.
2.    Written by the Government of Togo's ERAC and ESAF (Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility) Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, this part of the ICR has been
prepared on the basis of guidelines provided by Bank staff, for submission to the Bank no
later than one month after the departure of the mission.
Contents of the Report
3.    The introduction first recapitulates the beginnings of the economic adjustment
process in the early 1980s, and describes the context in which this project was appraised
in 1995 in the wake of the social and political turmoil of the early 1990s. It then
indicates the objectives of the project and the measures it incorporated.
4.    The primary objectives of ERAC were to: re-establish macroeconomic stability;
support private sector development following the devaluation of the CFA franc; improve
basic social services; and rehabilitate deteriorated physical infrastructure.
5.    Next, the Report examines the series of economic measures through which project
objectives were to be achieved in the following areas:
* macroeconomic framework
*  public finance
* public enterprises
* incentive and regulatory framework
Finally, program outcomes are presented.
6.    Macroeconomic Framework. From 1995 to 1997, growth in GDP averaged 6.9
percent. Domestic demand, supported by a rate of household consumption which



31
increased by 19.6 percent from 1996 to 1997, was consolidated. Public consumption,
however, decreased by 9.1 percent as a result of reforms in the management of public
finance. Investment increased from CFAF 87.5 billion in 1995 to 116.8 billion in 1997,
largely owing to increases in private investment. Nevertheless, the investment rate in
relation to GDP (13.3 percent in 1997) did not reach the target figure of 16 percent.
7.    Exports increased from CFAF 188.4 billion in 1995 to CFAF 248 billion in 1997.
Imports decreased by 13.3 percent in 1996 but increased by 6 percent in 1997. The
current account balance improved, the deficit decreasing from 13.5 percent of GDP in
1996 to 12.5 percent in 1997, and to 11.5 percent in 1998. However, overall economic
performance was unsatisfactory in 1998.
8.    Public Finances.  Measures were taken to strengthen revenue mobilization and
bring public expenditures under control: tax administration and customs were
strengthened; the tax system  was simplified,  and the tax base was broadened.
Government revenue rose from CFAF 95.7 billion in 1995 to 118.5 billion in 1997, or a
23.3 percent increase, and is estimated at CFAF 119.95 billion for 1998.
9.    In the area of public expenditure, the principal concern was to control the wage
bill, which increased from CFAF 52.4 billion in 1995 to CFAF 56.9 billion in 1997. The
latter figure represented 48.4 percent of current primary expenditure, slightly better than
the target figure of 49 percent for 1997. In the case of allocations to priority sectors,
improvement was stronger in education than in health.  Performance where road
maintenance expenditures were concerned was satisfactory.
10.   A strategy for clearing domestic arrears was adopted in April 1997 with the
establishment of a monitoring committee. The aim for 1997 was an overall debt
reduction of CFAF 36.04 billion. However, Treasury cash flow problems, caused
primarily by the suspension of extemal financing, led to the accumulation of new arrears
in 1998.
II.   Public investment programs, which are an essential development tool, were
approved by the World Bank and Togo's other development partners on a three-year
basis: 1996-1998 and 1997-1999. In 1997, the execution rate reached 71.06 percent,
with disbursement of CFAF 17.68 billion, compared with an execution rate of 37.03
percent in 1996. In 1998, the execution rate was 60.54 percent, with disbursement of
CFAF 34.06 billion out of a projected total of CFAF 56.26 billion.
12.   Public Enterprises. The Government's plans for divestiture of its holdings in
the production and service sectors of the economy, launched several years earlier, were
continued. Under the privatization program, the government's shares in four state
enterprises (CIMTOGO, BB Lome S.A., SIT and SGMT) were sold to four private
companies and the Hotel Sarakawa was leased. Its withdrawal from TOGOGAZ is
proceeding as anticipated. With regard to the offer for sale of 40 percent of its shares in
the national phosphate company (OTP), since negotiations with the first prospective



32
buyer were not successful, the revised proposal from the second pre-qualified candidate
has been analyzed and the relevant reports remitted to PARIBAS and the World Bank.
Seven public enterprises have been liquidated: OPAT, SOTED, SITO, SOTONAM,
SONAPH, TOGOGRAIN and UPROMA.
13.   The supervisory board of TOGOPHARMA decided on August 6, 1997 to begin
implementing the plan for redeployment of its personnel, and the Privatization
Commission proposed the liquidation of the enterprise in its report of July 29, 1998.
14.   The Public Enterprise Restructuring Program  mainly targets public utilities
(CEET, RNET, TOGOTELECOM, and SPT).  For enterprises remaining in the
government's portfolio, reports based on the management information system (MIS) are
regularly produced. Annual audits of their accounts are commissioned and companies
are authorized to charge prices that enable them to be self-sufficient and fund their
investments from their own resources. These elements are generally the subject of
performance agreements between the enterprises and the Government.
15.   Incentive and Regulatory Framework. The project objective here was the total
liberalization of the economy, to enable the private sector to become a driving force
behind the country's economic growth. In the agriculture sector, liberalization of coffee
and cocoa marketing enabled producers to increase their revenue in 1997 and 1998 by
approximately 76 percent of the f.o.b. price for coffee and by 80 percent of the f.o.b.
price for cocoa.  In the cotton sector, export activities were liberalized and producers'
revenues improved in 1997, when they received 50 percent of the net profits of the
cotton ginning company (SOTOCO), a total of CFAF 1. I billion.
16.  In the non-agriculture sector, price controls were abolished except for water,
electricity, and petroleum products. The Investment Code reform is under way at the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) level.
17.   A new Labor Code, designed to liberalize employment and make the labor market
more flexible, has been enacted and is expected to lead to the creation of more jobs. A
bill dealing with the legal framework of the pharmaceutical sector has been remitted to
the National Assembly, its purpose is to enable drig wholesalers to operate in a
competitive and transparent environment. A new drug pricing policy was introduced in
1997 to encourage the sale of generics by the private sector.
Lessons Learned and Performance Evaluation
18.   The Borrower's performance was satisfactory in that significant efforts were
shown to achieve ERAC objectives, although not all program measures were put into
effect. Moreover, beginning in 1998, some of the positive results achieved were
undermined by the combined effects of the energy crisis, unforeseen climate changes,
and the social and political crisis.

19.   Although the reforms in management of the public finances had encouraging
results, especially in improving revenue collection and strengthening tax administration,
privatization activities were less productive. The measures to liberalize the economy did
not lead to the anticipated creation of a competitive business environment because of
cartels among distributors. In addition, the National Assembly was slow to pass certain
bills, such as the Labor Code and the framework law governing the pharmaceutical
sector.
20.   The mobilization of resources for program execution from the IMF, IDA, Japan
and the ADF gave the Government access to CFAF 101.61 billion between April 1995
and May 1998 (whereas the original amount CFAF 106.16 billion).  In addition,
assistance, in the form of budget support, was provided by other donors (France, EU).
During this period, Togo was also able to negotiate rescheduling of its Paris Club debt
and a buyback of its debt to commercial banks.
21.   Togo's official monitoring units (Interministerial Commission, Interministerial
Select Committee, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Prime Minister's Office) also
played a positive oversight role in the project. However, it would be worth equipping
them better so as to improve their program monitoring and evaluation capabilities.
22.   Regarding the performance of the World Bank and the co-financers, the technical
and financial support provided through their assistance strategies clearly contributed to
Togo's economic and financial recovery. Program monitoring and evaluation through
supervision missions were satisfactory. Donors managed to adjust the program to the
country's changing situation, which meant that all program funds were disbursed.
However, certain measures, such as the plan for clearing domestic arrears and the
liberalization of the cotton sector, were not thoroughly discussed with the Togolese
authorities. There were also significant delays in the disbursement schedule, owing to a
somewhat rigid interpretation of what constituted fulfillment of specific disbursement
requirements.
23.   As far as the viability and sustainability of program outcomes are concerned,
implementation of the recommendations and conclusions of the Public Expenditure
Review initiated by the Government in 1995, will help ensure the sustainability of what
has been accomplished. Sustainability will also depend, on the Government's present
and future actions. It is essential as well that a new program be put in place to rectify the
weaknesses of the ERAC. Togo also needs special assistance to clear its domestic
arrears, so that it will be in a position to reactivate the economy.
