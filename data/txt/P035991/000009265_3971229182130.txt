Country Background
1.   Located on the Gulf of Guinea in Western Africa, Togo is a small
country with a population of 3.9 million and a 1993 GDP of about US$ 1.2
billion. After a period of growth in 19984-89, Togo's economic and
financial situation began to deteriorate in 1991 due to social and
political instability. Since then, the country went through a protracted
period of political crisis marked by violent street riots and civil
disturbances. Since mid-1993, the political and economic situation has
been improving. Presidential and legislative elections were held in
August 1993 and February 1994 respectively, and a new Government was
formed in June 1994. On the economic side, the implementation of the
restructuring program which came to a halt during 1992-93, has slowly
resumed.
2.   In 1994, to reverse the downward economic trend of recent years,
the Government has resumed its adjustment effort through a combination
of external and internal measures designed to generate steady economic
growth with low inflation. The January 1994 adjustment of the parity of
the CFA franc was a key element of this strategy. The Government's
development strategy, as outlined in the medium-term PFP for 1994/95-
96/97, aims at redressing the severe fiscal imbalances of recent years
and maintaining external competitiveness to attain a high and
sustainable rate of economic growth, and to accelerate the creation of
employment. During the first half of 1994, the confidence of the
private sector began to be restored and the economy has been showing
clear signs of recovery led by a strong resumption of traditional
exports production. Official estimates indicate real GDP growth has
exceeded 10 percent in 1994 reflecting a solid recovery from the
exceptionally depressed levels of 1992 and 1993.
Project Objectives
3.   Following the economic and fiscal collapse of the early 1990's, the
main objectives of the proposed operation are to restore macro-economic
stability and support a strong private sector-led supply response to the
devaluation of the CFAF. The proposed credit would also provide support
to a resumption of the reform agenda interrupted by the political
turmoil of the early 1990s and would help deepen the scope of reforms



implemented during the 1980s under previous adjustment programs.
Project Description
4.   Restoring macroeconomic stability involves a series of measures in:
(i) public finance -- rebuilding the tax base, containing expenditures
and clearing arrears; and (ii) public enterprises -- stepping up the
liquidation and privatization program to eliminate Government
extrabudgetary and deficit financing through public enterprises. Support
to the private sector involves: (i) improving the regulatory environment
(price liberalization, revision of investment and labor codes); and (ii)
increasing the scope of private activity through privatizations and
abolition of public sector monopolies in commercial sectors.
Project Costs and Financing
5.   A credit equivalent to US$50 million is proposed. The ERAC would be
disbursed in two tranches. Tranche releases would be contingent upon
maintaining the agreed policy reform program and the appropriate
moacroeconomic framework, in line with IMF+s ESAF program.
Environmental Impact
6.   The project has no impact on environment.
Poverty Category
7.   The proposed credit is expected to contribute to poverty
alleviation. It supports the reallocation of public expenditures toward
physical infrastructure and basic social services for the poor. Also
the implementation of the proposed structural measures will help improve
growth prospects and improve farm income in the export crops areas.
