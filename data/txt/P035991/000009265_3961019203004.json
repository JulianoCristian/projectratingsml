      Credit will support the resumption of sustained growth in\n            Togo following the economic and fiscal collapse of 1992-93.\n            Its main objectives are to restore macroeconomic stability,\n            support a strong private sector-led supply response to the\n            devaluation of the CFA franc, and improve the delivery of\n            essential social services. The adjustment package under the\n            operation supports the restoration of macroeconomic\n            stability through: 1) public finance measures to rebuild the\n            tax base, contain expenditures and clear arrears; and 2)\n            acceleration of the public enterprise liquidation and\n            privatization program to eliminate loss-making enterprises\n            and shield viable enterprises from pressure to finance\n            government deficits. Reforms to support broad-based private\n            sector-led growth include: 1) improving the regulatory\n            environment through revision of investment and labor codes\n            and further price and trade liberalization; and 2)\n            increasing the scope for private activity through\n            privatization and abolition of remaining public monopolies\n            in commercial activities."}, "docdt": "1996-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
