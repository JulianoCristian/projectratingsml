Among the lessons drawn from the\n            project, particular attention needs to be given to the\n            policies related to input distribution, credit, and produce\n            marketing, to ensure adequate incentives among farmers,\n            needed for a successful technology transfer. In addition,\n            complementary investments to technology development should\n            be ensured in the project design, as well as a decentralized\n            rural development management, and a robust infrastructure.\n            The government needs to ensure the adequate rapport between\n            the public sector, and donor agencies, to attain\n            complementary arrangements, rather than duplication among\n            agencies. This rapport would also facilitate a focused\n            allocation of limited public funds, to priority\n            interventions for rural development. The flaws in uneconomic\n            procurement, lack of transparency in the process, and\n            exceeding aggregate limits prescribed for the procurement of\n            goods, and services, reveal the need of a strong\n            supervision, which should include skilled staff in financial\n            management, and procurement."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
