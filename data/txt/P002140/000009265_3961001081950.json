basis.  The main project components are:  (a)\n            strengthening thetechnical support services of the Bauchi\n            State Integrated Rural Development Authority, the Kano\n            Agricultural and Rural Development Authority and the Sokoto\n            Agricultural and Rural Development Authority, and other\n            state-level implementing agencies (SIAs) for the\n            Agricultural Development Project, as related to on-farm\n            adaptive research, agricultural extension, including women\n            in agriculture programs, animal traction and small-scale\n            farm implements, on-farm agro-forestry and soil and water\n            management; (b) improving project management in the SIAs\n            through support in administrative and financial management,\n            monitoring and evaluation, and staff development and\n            training in managerial and technical fields; and (c) an\n            agricultural technology support facility to provide funding\n            of a bridging nature for technology adaptation and\n            dissemination activities in other states where Bank\n            assistance has ended or current resources are inadequate,\n            and also to assist discrete federal activities or pilot\n            programs for innovative technologies to increase farmer productivity."}, "docdt": "1992-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
