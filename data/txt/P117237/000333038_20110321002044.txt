                            Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                      March 17, 2011



      The Executive Directors approved the Nigeria - Lagos State Development Policy
Operation in the amount of SDR 121.1 million ($200 million equivalent) on the payment
terms and conditions set out in the President's Memorandum (IDA/R2011-0042).

       Executive Directors expressed support for the objectives of the operation - the first
sub-national Development Policy Operation in sub-Saharan Africa. Directors stressed the
need for sustained reform in public financial management and procurement, including
passage and enactment of related laws in the near future. They also urged the authorities to
establish effective mechanisms of donor coordination with a view to properly supporting
the numerous capacity-building efforts underpinning the structural reforms of the DPO.
Executive Directors also emphasized the importance of paying attention to the gender
dimension of this particular operation and following operations in the future.
