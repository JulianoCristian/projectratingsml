Development Policy Operation Project for Nigeria were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the design of a sub-national government operation should\n            properly account for interplay between federal and state\n            policies. For a sub-national government development project\n            objective (DPO), the team needs to clearly identify who is\n            in charge of policy formulation that is supported by the\n            program. If the federal government is in control of a\n            policy, the program design should allow sufficient space for\n            a state government to counter adverse impacts from factors\n            outside their control. In this circumstance, the targets for\n            results indicators should be moderate and take into account\n            the unanticipated risk due to the federal government's\n            policy actions. Care must be taken when applying Investment\n            Climate Assessment (ICA) recommendations and indicators;\n            reform should be informed by an in-depth sector diagnostic.\n            The World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)\n            recommended that ICA be viewed as a diagnostic tool that\n            provides an evidence basis for the identification of key\n            constraints to private investment and for comparison of an\n            economy to its peers. Without the existence of an in-depth\n            sector and institutional analysis, ICA recommendations\n            should be considered inadequate to inform the design and\n            sequencing of politically-sensitive reform measures."}, "docdt": "2014-07-15T00:00:00Z"}
