1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The First Lagos State Development Policy Operation (FLSDPO) was the first sub-
national Development Policy Credit (DPC) in Nigeria and in the Africa region more broadly that
offered a new vehicle to support Lagos state directly in its efforts to build sustainable systems for
public services. It drew on lessons learned from other federal states, such as those in Brazil and
India, where sub-national DPCs have successfully been used to support policy changes at the
sub-national level. As outlined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2010-13, the DPO
could be used in states with a good track record on public sector reforms, strong fiduciary
systems and low debt levels, and possibly twinned with Technical Assistance (TA) operations to
address governance issues. The FLSDPO was developed in this context to support the Lagos
government’s program articulated in the Ten Point Agenda (TPA) and the Lagos State Economic
Empowerment and Development Strategy (LASEEDS), both of which aimed to create conducive
conditions for investment and private-sector led growth and improve service delivery in a
sustainable manner. As a means to support Lagos in the implementation of its reform program,
the operation was envisaged to be a series of three programmatic operations in equal amounts of
US$200 million. Its development objective was to support sustainable fiscal policies, and help
articulate and monitor cohesive reform strategies to improve the quality of spending and the
investment climate. The prior actions for the release of the credit focused on four pillars: fiscal
sustainability, budget planning, budget execution, and the quality of the investment climate.

2.     World Bank support of the government’s reform program under the programmatic series
was cut short due to delayed approval of the borrowing plan by the National Assembly. However,
the Lagos State Government (LSG) continued with the reform program. This Implementation
Completion and Results (ICR) Report assesses the contribution of the FLSDPO in achieving the
program development objectives and takes stock of government progress in implementing the
reform agenda as defined in the programmatic series.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

3.      Since 2003 the Lagos State Government had embarked upon reforms articulated in
the TPA and LASEEDS that aimed to address key constraints to economic and social
development. As Lagos state is the country’s financial center, a key communication and
transportation hub, and the headquarters of many major national and regional industrial,
manufacturing and financial corporations, the private sector was vibrant and attractive to many in
search of job opportunities from all parts of Nigeria to Lagos. As a result, the state’s population
grew rapidly averaging 4 percent annually over the past decade and population density increased
given a small land of 356,862 hectares. This came at a cost of rampant crime, chronic congestion
of all major transportation routes, serious environmental pollution, and a persistent lack of basic
public services, especially water and power that affected the daily lives of its inhabitants. In
response to these issues, the government embarked on a reform program outlined in the TPA and
LASEEDS that aimed at alleviating key binding constraints including the city’s critical
infrastructure gaps (particularly the urban transit system and power supply) and inadequate
public services. Implementation of the reform was facilitated by expansionary fiscal policy to
make room for a large increase in capital expenditure to address the infrastructure gap. This was
achieved through reallocation of recurrent expenditure towards capital expenditure and reform of
tax administration to increase internally-generated revenue (IGR). 1 The deficit was financed by
commercial bank loans and the issuance of domestic bonds, while the stock of public debt
increased from 1.5 percent of SGDP in 2006 to 3.5 percent in 2009.

4.      The reforms brought about measurable results. The economy grew at double-digit
rates from 2000-2007 driven largely by the services sector including wholesale and retail trade.
The informal sector (estimated at about 45 percent of state output) constituted the main source of
income for the majority of city households. Crime fell as delinquent youths, those involved in
criminal activities, entered state-sponsored vocational training programs. Transportation services
improved with the establishment of designated lanes for public buses, the rehabilitation of
infrastructure and public areas, and initiation of a number of public-private partnership
infrastructure projects. On the fiscal front, the deficits slowly declined as IGR rose significantly
during 1999-2008.

5.      Despite these achievements, development challenges remained and the government
recognized the need to further deepen the reforms to transform Lagos state into a global
and financial and economic hub. The transformation would require implementation of more
effective and deeper economic, social and structural reforms to improve competitiveness, create
a favorable business environment for investment, and accelerate private sector led growth.
Building a more appropriate institutional and regulatory framework would also be critical to
creating the conditions for growth and improved service delivery, all in a sustainable manner.
Without such reforms, the government would be unable to effectively manage the challenges of a
city that has a larger population and bigger economy than many of those in Africa. To achieve
these objectives, the LSG considered two policy areas to be of primary importance: (i) improving
the quality of spending through strengthened budget planning and better budget execution; and
(ii) enhancing the investment climate by streamlining and simplifying the bureaucratic and
regulatory environment. Recognizing the fiscal challenges posed by financing large
infrastructure projects and improving service delivery, the reform program was embedded in a
medium-term fiscal strategy. It was against this background that the state government viewed
support from the World Bank, by means of a Development Policy Credit, as critical to the
desired systemic transformation and preservation of fiscal sustainability.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.     The program development objectives were to support the government to build
systems and institutions to improve the quality of spending and to strengthen the
investment climate, all the while maintaining fiscal sustainability. The main focus of the
support was to (i) maintain fiscal sustainability; (ii) build systems and institutions to improve the
quality of spending; and (iii) strengthen the investment climate. The FLSDPO supports the


1
  Lagos’ focus on improving internally-generated revenue partly reflects the fact that the current revenue allocation
formula does not adequately factor in differences in population and socio-economic indicators. In fact, on a per-
capita basis, Lagos state receives the lowest level of transfers within the federation.


                                                      2
achievement of the program objectives, together with the other two planned programmatic
operations.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

7.     There was neither a revision to the PDO nor to the key outcome indicators of the program.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

8.     The program supported four main areas: (a) fiscal sustainability; (b) budget planning; (c)
budget execution; and (d) investment climate. It built on ten prior actions for the FLSDPO that
aimed to strengthen institutions for budget planning, budget execution, and the quality of the
investment climate.

Policy Area I: Fiscal sustainability

9.      The program supported the LSG in maintaining fiscal sustainability by ensuring that
spending plans were within the ability of the state to raise revenue and keep debt within limits
such that debt service payments would not crowd out poverty and service-related expenditure. A
key policy measure was the adoption by the Executive Council (EXCO) of the 2010 budget, one
based on a medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS) that was consistent with long-term debt
sustainability. In addition, the program was expected to assist in maintaining the state’s fiscal
sustainability by lowering the need for high interest on commercial bank loans and by
contributing indirectly to higher levels of internally-generated revenue through sustainable
growth. The main driver behind this would be non-oil growth and a more comprehensive tax
base, the result of better infrastructure and a better business environment.

Policy Area II: Budget planning

10.     The program supported a medium-term reform program in the areas of budget planning
that aimed to fully align the policy priorities of the government with the executed budget, and
further improve the execution of the capital budget by focusing on three policy actions. These
were: (a) a medium-term macroeconomic framework to help determine budgetary resource
ceilings adopted by the Lagos State Ministry of Economic Planning and Budgeting (MEPB); the
ceilings were used by the Lagos State Ministry of Economic Planning as a basis for the
preparation of the 2010 budget; (b) medium-term sector strategies (MTSSs) prepared and
published by 10 ministries, including the Ministries of Health, Education, Environment, Women
Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Justice, Physical Planning & Urban Development,
Transportation, Housing, Works and Infrastructure and Youth, Sports & Social Development;
and (c) capital projects in the 2010 budget that would meet readiness requirements contained in
the expenditure request checklist of the Lagos State Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget.

Policy Area III: Budget execution

11.   The program supported a medium-term reform agenda aimed at strengthening the legal
framework and building the institutional capacity to enhance both the transparency and



                                            3
accountability of expenditure and the government’s ability to execute the budget in line with its
declared policies. To improve budget execution, policy actions centered on procurement reform,
improvements to the public financial management system, and reform of the external and
internal audit systems. Policy actions under this pillar were: (a) publication of all contracts
awarded between 2007-2009 whose value was above the threshold requiring publication
contained in the procurement law; (b) submission to the State Assembly of procurement and
audit laws acceptable to the World Bank; (c) submission of a Public Financial Management
(PFM) Bill and re-submission of revised audit laws to the State House of Assembly acceptable to
the Bank; and (d) operationalizing cash management and accounts receivable modules by
establishing a platform for real-time access to bank statements.

Policy Area IV: Quality of the Investment Climate

12.     The program supported medium-term actions that would address shortcomings in the
investment climate related to land transactions and to obtaining building permits. These actions
were: (a) approval by EXCO of simplified procedures for assignment and mortgage transactions
through the reduction of steps, the delegation of Governor’s consent to appointed commissioners,
the reduction of mandatory processing deadlines, and an increase in staffing; (b) simplify and
fast-track the Development Permit process by (i) eliminating the pre-inspection; (ii) delegating
approval of a development permit based on project size; (iii) mandating district officers to attach
site pictures to each application; and (iv) publishing all building regulations for wide
dissemination free of charge.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

13.    The policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes

14.     At appraisal, it was envisioned that the program design would be programmatic and
comprise a series of three development policy operations. However, the delayed approval of
the government’s borrowing plan by the National Assembly led to a lapse of more than 24
months between the board dates for the first and second operations. As such, the operation could
no longer be considered programmatic and the preparation of an ICR Report was therefore
required. There were no other significant changes in scope and scale, implementation
arrangements, or funding under the program. The FLSDPO was approved in March 2011 and
closed in June 2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

15.    All prior actions under the FLSDPO were completed prior to Board approval in
March 2011 and were sustained beyond the closing date of the operation. None of the prior
actions have been reversed at the time of the evaluation. Despite the uncertainty caused by
delayed approval of government borrowing in 2012, the government remained committed to



                                             4
deepening the reforms envisaged under the program and the Bank continued its engagement to
support the government throughout. Two examples of triggers and benchmarks for subsequent
operations were implemented in 2012-13 can be found in Table 1 last columns: for example
Triggers and Benchmark for DPO2 under pillar 2 were executed. Also trigger for DPO2 under
pillar 3 (establishing a regulatory agency for procurement) was implemented. The Board
approval of the Second Lagos Development Policy Operation (SLSDPO) in March 2014 is a
testimony to the Bank’s appreciation for reform achievements.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

16.     The government continued implementing the reform program envisaged in the
subsequent operations, notwithstanding the delay in the processing of the World Bank
programmatic support. The approval of the borrowing plan was delayed due to procedural
changes at the level of the federal government. This initiated uncertainty about the timing of the
processing of the World Bank programmatic support under the SLSDPO. 3 However, this did not
stop the state government from implementing the reform program. It forged ahead with the
strengthening of its systems, institutions and reforms and improved the investment climate while
maintaining fiscal sustainability. Still, the delayed approval had a clear impact on the planned
expenditure, and the authorities ultimately decided to issue state bonds to cover a financing gap
for infrastructure development. The uncertainty further aggravated the achievement of some
results (especially the debt service indicator) due to a higher interest rate on the state bonds
compared to the IDA’s interest rate.

17.    Policy changes at the federal government level posed some challenges to fiscal
sustainability in Lagos state. The approval of an increase in the national minimum wage by 140
percent in 2011 by the federal authorities 4 triggered public demonstrations in Lagos state, which
pressured the LSG to increase state public sector wages. The LSG accommodated the wage
increase by cutting overhead costs, thereby increasing the wage bill to recurrent expenditure ratio
(from 34 percent in 2010 to 38 percent in 2011). The amendments of the Personal Income Tax
Act (PITA) aimed to reduce the economic burden on taxpayers by expanding the tax band,
lowering tax rates and requiring tax authorities to obtain a court order before confiscating a
taxpayer’s assets to recover overdue tax payments. These measures not only lowered tax revenue
from personal income taxes (pay as you earn) in Lagos state in 2011 and 2012, 5 but also
hampered tax recovery efforts.

18.     Infrastructure bottlenecks, mainly related to poor network connectivity of
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in Alausa, Ikeja and weak information and
communication technology (ICT) capacity, delayed the implementation of the Oracle
Financial Management System and the Geological Information System (GIS). Limited
internet connectivity of MDAs delayed the implementation of some Oracle modules, which
posed serious challenges to Oracles users in MDAs. In 2010, the LSG made efforts to modernize
network connectivity through the establishment of direct fiber-optic links between the main
MDA buildings and the data center; this took more than one year. The roll-out of the Oracle-
based Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) and the piloting of the GIS in key
MDAs as it faced some challenges due to both technical and reform resistance from MDAs. A
lack of adequately qualified ICT specialists slowed deployment of some Oracle Financial
Modules and operation of the GIS. The extent of the challenges with implementing the modules

was so critical during 2011-2012 that completion of the remaining components almost came to a
halt. The situation was remedied in November 2012 when the government established a new
Directorate (Oracle System) led by an experienced ICT specialist recruited from overseas and a
steering committee chaired by the Lagos State Governor to oversee the implementation. Since
then, the reform effort has been back on track and good progress has been made in
operationalizing the Oracles modules.

19.     Implementation of the program was uneven during the transition of the finance
commissioners following the 2011 elections. Ownership and commitment of the reform
program had been strong during the design stage and up to approval of the FLSDPO in March
2011. It was supported by the Governor and his EXCO team and led by the finance
commissioner who was the key program counterpart. The latter played an active role during the
planning stage and with the design of the results framework. The relationship between IGR and
land reform – designed to improve the investment climate – was obvious to him, and he strongly
supported a major reform of the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS). The 2011
elections in Lagos State reinstated the same Governor of Lagos state; however, the finance
commissioner who had pushed the reform of LIRS left the government. This transition
temporarily weakened the drive to reform LIRS and land use charges (triggers for the subsequent
operation); however, the reform regained its momentum in 2012. The review of LIRS was
eventually conducted by the Oracle Directorate, and the slow implementation of the Oracle
Financial Modules and the GIS was put back on track. Reform efforts to strengthen budget
planning and preparation advanced as the leadership in the MEPB remained unchanged.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

20.     There is solid evidence that the government has consistently utilized the M&E data
pertaining to fiscal sustainability to inform its resource allocation, expenditure policy
decisions and debt management. All four fiscal sustainability indicators have been tracked and
used for budget planning and execution. The government regularly monitors the fiscal deficit,
IGR collections and adjusts expenditures (wage, overhead, and capital) accordingly. The debt
sustainability indicators have been employed to inform the government’s debt service burden, a
profile that is suitable for maintaining long-term debt sustainability. However, the Lands Bureau
does not monitor progress of the reform to simplify the procedures for registering a mortgage.
This is now being corrected as the M&E unit under MEPB is planning to roll out an M&E
system to the Lands Bureau in the near future.

21.     The FLSDPO implementation identified the need to fine-tune the M&E framework.
The adjustments that pertained to the investment climate gave more prominence to the cost of
registering a property. It was also recognized that the targets for some results indicators were
overly ambitious, such as the targets pertaining to the IGR’s real growth rate and the ratio of debt
service to revenue. These have been reflected in the new programmatic series under the SLSDPO.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

22.    The FLSDPO was the first operation in the three-part programmatic series. Due to a
delay of 24 months, the FLSDPO was no longer considered a programmatic operation and
became a single phase of work. Nonetheless, the Government made significant investments in


                                                12
related areas of reform after the first phase was completed (Table 1). The government remained
committed to the reform program envisaged under the programmatic DPO as reform
implementation continued even during a time of uncertainty. Progress during the post-FLSDPO
included the adoption of MTFS to guide the annual budget preparation, the increased the number
of MTSSs, continued procurement and external audit reform, bringing online more modules of
the Oracle Financial System, introduction of the electronic Certificate of Occupancy (eCofO),
and operationalized GIS.

23.    The new programmatic series, beginning with the SLSDPO approved by the Board
in March 2014, supported the continued government reform agenda as initiated by the
FLSDPO. The program development objectives of the new series remain the same as do the
reform policy areas and sub-objectives. Policy actions under the first three pillars are mostly
maintained, while reform policies to strengthen the investment climate focused on reducing the
cost of registering a property and the implementation of GIS and automation of CofOs and
development permits. The results framework has been fine-tuned reflecting increased selectivity
and realism. The results indicators are fewer and their targets are more realistic recognizing the
challenges faced during the implementation of FLSDPO.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

24.     This ICR was not expected as the FLSDPO was intended to be the first of three in a
programmatic operation. The FLSDPO was the first operation of its kind in Nigeria and Africa
and would serve as a reference for future sub-regional DPOs. While the ICR was planned at the
end of the series, the delay of the second operation procedurally called for an ICR of the
FLSDPO. The assessment of outcomes will focus on the contribution of the FLSDPO to the
achievement of the program development objectives. Recognizing that the program was curtailed,
the assessment will also take stock of progress in implementing the reforms during 2012-13 after
the FLSDPO programmatic series ended.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

25.     The objective of the program was highly relevant. The success of Lagos’ government
in improving service delivery to its population involved a large increase in capital expenditures,
financed mainly by increased internal revenue generation (tax collection) and borrowing. While
the increased capital spending contributed to some impressive development outcomes, the
sustainability of the financial position of the government deserves close attention. For this reason,
the first pillar of the DPO program supported analysis and policies to ensure that Lagos state’s
medium- and longer-term fiscal and debt picture remains sustainable and that the associated risks
are acknowledged and minimized. The second and third pillars supported improvements in
transparency, accountability and efficiency of government resources with the aim of enhancing
the quality of public expenditure and thereby public services. An improved investment climate
would contribute to increased private investment and economic growth, and thereby lead to
greater IGR in the future.

26.     Overall, the design of the program was appropriate in its support of the
government’s reform agenda and the achievement of the program’s development objective.
The reform pillars and actions were fully aligned with Lagos’ development strategy as
articulated in the TPA and LASEEDS, an approach that aims to strengthen budget management
to improve the quality of expenditures and thereby public services in priority sectors such as
power, agriculture, transport, and housing as well as the social sectors (education and health)
through increased public investment. Given that public investment accounted for more than one-
half of total expenditure, the design of the reform pillars was appropriate in its aim to tackle
fiscal sustainability, improve transparency, accountability and efficiency in budget management,
and improve the investment climate. This directly supported the achievement of the program
development objectives. The program design was also complemented by technical assistance
support by the Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance Project (LMDGP) supported
by the World Bank and the State Partnership on Accountability Responsiveness and Capability
for Accountability (SPARC) program financed by the UK Department for International
Development (DFID).

27.     The program was consistent with the CPS objective. The program supported the
achievement of the CPS that aimed at improving governance, maintaining non-oil growth, and
promoting human development. The CPS supported state-level development policy operations
that could be a “strong vehicle for deep engagement at the State level,” in particular for
supporting the improvement of public financial management. Lagos was identified as the best
candidate for a “pioneer” DPO in view of its achievements in improving the PFM system, the
reform orientation of the LSG, the importance of Lagos state for Nigeria, and the inadequacy of
fiscal resources. Specifically, the program directly supported the Lagos Partnership Strategy
(LPS) embedded in CPS 2010-13 that focused on three priority areas, namely governance and
capacity building, improving the business environment, and better service delivery. By providing
concessional credit to finance capital investment, the FLSDPO created additional fiscal space for
capital investment by lowering the debt service and contributing to medium-term fiscal
sustainability. The choice of a DPO as an instrument was (and remains) suitable as the
programmatic nature enabled the government to inform stakeholders of the upcoming reforms so
they could adjust their actions accordingly.

28.     Overall, the relevance of the program is satisfactory. The objective of the FLSDPO
was highly relevant and the design of the program (reform pillars and actions, implementation
capacity and instrument) was appropriate in terms of its support to the government’s reform
agenda and contribution to the achievement of the CPS objectives. The reforms to improve
budget planning and preparation, budget execution and the investment climate (by enhancing
fiscal sustainability, transparency, accountability, and efficiency) are critical to Lagos’ vision –
to become Africa’s model megacity and a global, economic and financial hub, a center that is
safe, functional and productive. Implementation capacity was augmented through the support of
the technical assistance activities. For the Bank, the DPO was the right instrument to support the
reform implementation to achieve this vision. The FLSDPO also increased the visibility of DPOs
among state governments in Nigeria as an instrument for advancing the reform agenda.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

29.    This section evaluates the achievements of the program development objectives (PDO)
based on the quantitative contributions of the reform areas. The PDO were to support the
government build systems and institutions to improve the quality of spending and to strengthen
the investment climate all the while maintaining fiscal sustainability. It has three sub-objectives:
(a) maintaining fiscal sustainability; (b) building systems and institutions to improve the quality
of spending; and (c) strengthening the investment climate.

30.     On average the achievement of the PDO is rated moderately satisfactory. On the
whole, about 75 percent of the PDO was achieved (out of 100 percent). About 10 percent of the
sub-objective, maintaining fiscal sustainability, was achieved and thus considered substantial.
The fiscal deficit was under control within 2 percent of SGDP. The wage bill was contained at 35
percent of recurrent expenditure, and increased revenue from land use charges met the 50 percent
target. The achievement towards building systems and institutions was substantial reaching 60
percent due to: (a) the adoption of a new approach to budget planning and preparation; (b) the
above-target capital execution rate (average 75 percent); (c) improved quality of spending
through improvements in the classroom to pupil ratio (primary) and measles immunization rate;
and (d) building and strengthening the budget execution system through the operationalization of
more modules of the Financial Oracle system, and building the institutions for public
procurement and audit to improve transparency and accountability. The achievement of reforms
to strengthen the investment climate was limited to only 5 percent, contributing above the target
for mortgage registrations and the reduced time taken to register a mortgage (but below
expectations). The following discusses achievement of the PDOs under each of the three sub-
objectives of the program.

(a)   Sub-objective 1 - Maintaining Fiscal Sustainability

31.     The fiscal sustainability objective – to anchor the budget in a medium-term
sustainable framework and implement policy and administrative reforms to raise
additional internal revenue, improve efficiency and reduce collection costs – was
considered substantially achieved. Given that the development priorities focusing on the power,
agriculture, transport and housing sectors were financed through public borrowing, maintaining
fiscal sustainability over the medium and long-term would be critical for prudent fiscal
management going forward. The use of target indicators for fiscal sustainability to guide the
MTFS and budget preparation demonstrates strong government reform commitment.
Achievement of this objective is considered substantial. Table 2 shows that the targets for four of
the six indicators (control of fiscal deficit, the wage bill, IGR execution rate, and land use
charges) were substantially achieved. Achievement of the target for the ratio of debt service to
total revenue is inclusive because the original targets are no longer consistent with the revised
base line. The performance of IGR was weaker than expected due to the actions taken by the
federal government and thus affected the debt service targets. The new programmatic series
maintained the policy area but revised the targets for all results indicators to ensure realism.

 32.      The Lagos state budget has been firmly anchored in a MTFS since 2010 and the
 government has maintained a budget deficit within 2 percent of Lagos State’s Gross
 Domestic Product (SGDP) despite rising capital spending. Since 2010, a medium-term fiscal
 framework (MTFS) was prepared each year and approved by the EXCO to inform an overall
 available resource envelope and resource ceilings for MDAs in their annual budget preparation
 to enforce fiscal discipline. The approved budgets during 2011-14 were based on the MTFS.
 Total revenue comprising IGR (60 percent), federal transfers (35 percent), and capital receipts (5
 percent) 6 remained between 4.7 and 5.3 percent of SGDP, while total expenditure ranged from
 5.2 to 6.1 percent of SGDP, of which capital spending accounted for about 52 percent on average
 during the program period. Budget deficits were kept below the target of 2 percent of SGDP. The
 fall in the deficit to 0.6 percent of SGDP in 2011 was due to a sequestration in capital spending
 in response to a delay in financing from a planned domestic bond issuance. It doubled in 2012
 reflecting a decline in IGR coupled with an increase in capital spending.




 6
     Lagos state has the highest share of IGR in total revenue among the 36 Nigerian states.


                                                               16
33.     The MTFS has been consistent with the medium-term debt sustainability analysis
(DSA). The LDMO regularly conducts an analysis to ensure that debt indicators are within the
thresholds agreed between the Bank and the LSG; these indicators are also used to guide the
budget planning process. Since 2011, Lagos state has improved the monitoring and reporting of
its public debt, which has led to greater confidence in the analysis of its debt sustainability. The
coverage of public debt now includes direct and contingent liabilities, both of which can signal
fiscal risks. Direct liabilities, such as power purchase agreements with independent power
producers (IPPs), have now been included in current expenditure. Liabilities to Lekki Concession
Company, a special-purpose vehicle established to build, operate and maintain the Lekki Toll
Road, has been included in domestic debt figures. Lagos has also incorporated most debt
contracted by off-budget entities (for example, off-budget borrowing by Lagos Heli Limited is
now recorded as state debt). This is good progress; however, it is noted that the initial baseline
and target for the ratio of debt service to total revenue did not take into account these debts. The
baseline for total debt service of 7 percent (reported in the program document) was revised to 13
percent of total revenue in 2008. 7 As the initial debt service target is no longer consistent with
the revised debt data used for baseline and actual, the achievement of the debt service indicator is
conclusive.

34.     The average ratio of the wage bill to recurrent expenditure met the target of 35
percent. The government made an effort to control the growth of its wage bill including
pensions; yet an increase in the minimum wage as mandated by the federal government put
pressure on the LSG to increase the civil service wage, and as a result the wage bill increased
from 34 percent in 2010 to 38 percent in 2011. Further, the creation of fiscal space through
lowering the overhead cost (from 1.3% in 2011 to 0.7% of SGDP in 2013) for capital investment
led to a steady decline in recurrent expenditure (from 3.1 percent in 2011 to 2.6 percent of SGDP
in 2013). This put upward pressure on the ratio of the wage bill to recurrent expenditure in 2012-
13.

35.     The performance of IGR was weaker than expected. Major IGR in Lagos state is
comprised of personal income tax revenue (collected by LIRS and accounting for about 70
percent of total IGR), land use charges (collected by Land Use Ltd.), and land transaction fees
including registration and stamp fees, capital gain tax, and consent fees (collected by the Lands
Bureau) and development permit fees (collected by the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban
Development). The lower than expected performance of IGR reflected the impact of unfavorable
developments outside LSG control. The global economic impacts affected the financial sector
concentrated in Lagos state that led to a lowering of income tax collection in 2010. The PITA
amendments by the federal government in 2012 negatively affected personal income tax revenue
collection both in 2011 and 2012. This weakened IGR performance due to the large share of
income tax in total IGR (about 80 percent). The Hotel Occupancy and Restaurant Tax Law
introduced by the LSG in June 2009 was challenged by the federal government in the appeal
court, which led to a temporary suspension of the implementation and the loss in revenue



7
  The program document for FLSDPO shows some inconsistency in the baseline debt service data. Table 5 of the
program document and Table 1.2 in Annex 3 show the baseline debt service (2008) ratio at 10 percent, while Annex
2 – Lagos Policy Matrix shows the baseline data (2008) for debt service in percent of total revenue at 7 percent.


                                                       17
collection during that period. 8 In addition, the reform of LIRS and land use charges was delayed
as the functional review of LIRS (a trigger for the subsequent operation) was not conducted. 9
The collection of land use charges was also uneven in 2011 and 2013 due to low coverage of
enumerated properties billed for the first time (only 18 percent of total cataloged properties), the
low level of awareness in some local government areas, 10 and the ability to deliver land charge
demand notices in the more rapidly developing areas. 11 Nevertheless, the LSG took actions to
counter the weaker than expected IGR performance that adversely affected the targets for IGR.
On the ruling in favor of the federal government regarding Hotel Occupancy and Restaurant Tax
Law, the LSG submitted an appeal to the Nigerian Supreme Court that ruled in its favor in July
2013. The LIRS launched an intensive campaign program to increase tax compliance 12 and
training of tax auditors to reduce reliance on the external audit consultants for audit of lower
brackets of taxpayers. 13 A functional review of the LIRS was carried out in 2013 by the Oracle
Directorate in order to review business procedures with the objective to automate the LIRS
administration system. To address some of the bottlenecks in the collection of land use charges,
additional local offices were established to better administer land use charges. 14




8
   The law levied tax on total goods and services (food, drink, accommodation/rental and other transactions)
rendered by hospitality and tourism enterprises (hotels, motels, guest inns, travel agencies, tour operating outfits,
resorts, cafeterias, restaurants, food outlets and other related tourist establishments). Between 2009- present, LIRS
estimated the unremitted consumption tax that will be recovered from companies that are incompliant at N4.2 billion,
of which N2 billion was expected to be recovered by end-2013.
9
   The review would focus on the integration of the informal sector into the tax net and provide options for more
effective enforcement of land charges and for raising rates. However, the review was delayed as LIRS maintained
that it had already implemented a number of measures including an Electronic Tax Clearance Certificate, direct
payments through banks, and issuance of automated revenue receipts.
10
    To further enhance IGR, the LSG restarted the Property Identification Exercise from 2008, thus requiring
“blanket” enumeration of properties throughout the entire state. The exercise was officially completed in 2011 with
637,569 properties cataloged. An aggregate of 583,458 properties were billed, of which 491,567 notices were
delivered with 152,317 payments.
11
    These challenges included: (a) improper house numbering and lack of street names in the less-developed areas at
the time of enumeration; and (b) removal of property identification numbers from most of the properties in the fast
property development areas (Etiosa, Badagry, Alimosho, and Ibeju Lekki) and changes in the status of property
during the time of enumeration and collection. Most uncompleted properties at the time of enumeration were
completed and pictures taken during the exercise do not depict the current status of the properties. These challenges
pose difficulties with identification. With the recent street naming and house numbering exercise in some of these
areas, there is need to re-enumerate the properties. However, the recent delivery of the Demand Notices in less
developed areas has been more effective as indicated by over 80 percent of the billed records within the 1st quarter
of 2012 and 2013.
12
    The campaign targeted informal sector and high-end professions (doctors, lawyers, bankers, businessmen, etc.),
which increased the number of taxpayers under a tax net from 1.5 million in 2008 to 4.2 million in 2013.
13
    This reduced the number of external consultants from 1,500 in 2011 to 150 in 2012. However, it still needs
external consultants to assist with the audit of large taxpayers.
14
    The Land Use Charge administration has been decentralized with 18 zonal offices established in 15 Local
Government Areas (LGAs) out of the 20 LGAs in Lagos state with more than one zonal office in LGAs (such as Eti-
Osa, where the high net worth properties are situated) and Alimosho, which is the largest LGA in Lagos state for
effective service delivery.

 (b)    Sub-objective 2 - Building the Systems and Institutions to Improve the Quality of
        Spending

 36.    This section assesses the FLSDPO contribution to the sub-objective of building
 systems and institutions to improve the quality of public spending. It concludes that the
 achievements under this sub-objective as contributed by the two pillars (budget preparation and
 budget execution) are substantial. Budget preparation reform (supported by the second pillar) led
 to improved quality of spending as reflected by improvements in the classroom to pupil ratio, the
 measles immunization rate, and an increase in capital budget execution rate. Budget execution
 reforms were achieved through a scaled-up launch of the Oracle Financial Management
 Information System and the building of institutions, such as the Lagos Public Procurement
 Agency and Lagos State Auditor General, to improve value for money, enhance transparency
 and accountability in public financial management.

 Pillar 2: Budget Preparation

 37.     The objective of this pillar – adoption of new approaches to budget planning and
 preparation – was fully achieved. The reforms supported by FLSDPO have built the system for
 budget planning and preparation through the adoption of a new approach for budget planning and
 preparation consisting of MTFS and MTSSs. The MTFS determines the overall resource ceilings
 for budget preparation, while the MTSSs align the budget allocations with the various sector
 priorities, the readiness checklists for capital projects to increase the execution rate, and the
 consultation forum improved transparency in the budget preparation process. The outcomes
 indicators, notably the execution rate of the capital budget, met the targets, while the indicators
 reflecting quality of public expenditures in education and health met the targets for some years.
 The SLSDPO continued to support the reforms to deepen the use of a new approach to budget
 planning and preparation.

 38.   The government adopted and institutionalized the new approaches for budget
 planning and preparation. A medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) is comprised of a


                                                            19
top-down budget plan that includes an overall budget ceiling and a number of sector ceilings
established by a MTFS, and a bottom-up budget based on MTSSs. The government, led by the
MEPB, develops an MTFS that informs the overall resource ceiling for the budget and ceilings
for sectoral budgets over a multi-year period based on macroeconomic forecasting.

39.     To establish the resource envelope, the MEPB also holds budget consultations with
relevant stakeholders. Through its discussions with LIRS and other revenue generating MDAs,
it seeks agreement on targets for the year and with LDMO it discusses financing options and
their budget implications. Subsequently, the MTFS is drafted and submitted to EXCO for
approval. After the approval of MTFS, the MEPB prepares a budget call circular that contains
indicative resource ceilings including revenue and expenditure ceilings for sector MDAs
covering personal, overhead and capital expenditures. The circular is issued to MDAs for the
preparation of their budget proposals.

40.    Beginning 2013, the budget call circular contained resource ceilings for 9 COFOG
sectors. The government appointed ‘sector champions’ for each of the nine sectors to be
responsible for overseeing the intra-sectoral disaggregation of resources amongst the MDAs
within each of the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) sectors. This
disaggregation has been based on policy priorities, including those specified in the State
Development Plan. The approved disaggregation is then communicated to the MDAs as part of
the Budget Call Circular.

41.    From the bottom up, MDAs prepared their budgets based on MTSSs. Currently,
MTSSs are mostly based on administrative agencies rather than sectors (except education, health
and environment) and the costing of MTSSs is not complete (except for the health sector). Since
2011, the number of MTSSs prepared by MDAs has steadily increased from 10 in 2010
(FLSDPO prior actions) to 25 in 2013 (SLSDPO prior actions). The MTSSs have enabled MDAs
to ensure that their budget allocations are consistent with the strategic priorities.

42.      The MTEF approach to budget planning reform was implemented incrementally
throughout the program period and has since become institutionalized and an integral
component of the budget planning and preparation process. The annual budget is now
prepared in a more orderly manner; that is, by commencing with the adoption of the MTFS by
EXCO. Subsequently, a budget call circular including budget ceilings to MDAs is issued to
guide budget preparation. The alignment of MTSSs with sector budget ceilings and allocations
facilitate the budget negotiation process. During the past few years, the MEPB and MDAs have
spent less time on budget negotiations and, as a result, the budgets have been approved before
the end of their respective fiscal years.

43.     All proposed investment projects by MDAs are screened to ensure prioritization of
capital investment projects and improve the execution rate of the capital budget. During
budget preparation, MEPB reviewed all proposed projects to ensure their compliance with the
project readiness checklist. The checklist includes conformity with development policy, a
feasibility study, project plan and design, bill of quantity, site approval, soil test, work plan,
appraisal, baseline studies, milestones and key performance indicators, traffic assessment impact
and conflict impact assessment (where applicable). The execution rate of the capital expenditure



                                               20
 thereby remained at an average of 78 percent during 2010-2011(above the target of 75 percent)
 and 84 percent during 2012-13.

 44.     The government established a consultation forum with stakeholders other than
 MDAs (such as civil society organizations, the private sector and youth) to ensure better
 budget outcomes. The Consultative Forum has sought to establish budget priorities for these
 groups and also to provide feedback on what is achievable given the financial constraints. The
 findings from consultations were communicated to relevant MDAs to ensure that priorities, as
 integrated in their budget submissions, are feasible.

 Pillar 3: Budget Execution

 45.     The objective of the third pillar – enhance transparency and accountability in the
 use of public resources – was substantially achieved as more than half of the results
 indicators met the expected targets. The program aimed to improve budget execution by
 means of several initiatives: procurement and audit reform, the full operation of the Oracle
 system and strengthened cash management, reform of the external and internal audit systems,
 and publication of budget execution reports. The reforms supported by FLSDPO led to the
 strengthening of the Oracle Financial Management Information System and the building of a few
 PFM institutions critical for transparency and accountability (such as procurement, internal and
 external audit, and publication of budget execution reports). Achievement of the objective
 supported by budget execution reforms is judged substantial. The SLSDPO continued the budget
 execution reform agenda.

 46.     Procurement reform is on track and progressing; it has contributed to improved
 transparency and efficiency in the use of resources. The procurement law, approved in 2011,
 provided the legal basis for the establishment of a regulatory agency the Lagos State Public
 Procurement Agency on April 2, 2012. A procurement capacity training needs assessment was
 conducted and implemented with support from SPARC program financed by DFID. A
 procurement professional cadre was established. Procurement officers were recruited through the
 conversion of interested civil service officers into the procurement cadre after screening and
 basic trainings. They have since been working in all MDAs. Contracts awarded above the
 threshold set out by the Public Procurement Law (N100 million) 15 for 2007-2010 were published
 in 2011 on the website of the Lagos State Tender Board (www.stb.lagosstate.gov.ng) and
 publication has continued to cover the 2011-13 period. Beginning in July 2013, the Lagos Public
 Procurement Agency began producing a timely public journal where procurement opportunities
 and contract awards can be viewed (www.lagosppa.gov.ng). Procurement reform actions have
 contributed to a more efficient use of budgetary resources by means of lowering advance
 payments to suppliers/contractors (20 percent of the total contract compared to 50 percent prior
 to the new law). An open approach to competition has reduced the cost of purchases and


 15
    Clause 73 of the Lagos Public Procurement Law states that the setting of thresholds shall be part of the
 regulations.


                                                                  22
acquisition of goods and services. To further deepen procurement reform, the government
mandated MDAs to use standard bidding documents for contracts above of N100 million in the
eight MDAs in the second half of 2013, and then extended the directive to all MDAs during 2014
and inaugurated the Procurement Board on March 8, 2014 (SLSDPO prior actions). A
procurement complaint mechanism was established to resolve all bidders’ complaints in 2013.

47.     Audit reform, as supported by the FLSDPO, has been maintained and scaled up,
and has contributed to improved transparency. A new Audit Law was approved in 2011.
Subsequently, a functional review (including an assessment of capacity to implement the law) of
the Auditor General’s Office was conducted by the Office of Transformation in association with
SPARC. The office was restructured by integrating 9 directorates into 6 core functions in
compliance with the requirements of modern day supreme audit institutions. Together with
restructuring, a Development Action Plan was prepared and approved and is now being
implemented to ensure conformance with modern audit standards. The audited accounts of Lagos
state are to be published no later than three months after the issuance of a signed opinion by the
Auditor General. The scope of the Auditor General’s Office has expanded in line with the
implementation of the Audit Law. Audit reform has contributed to improved accountability as
the coverage of MDAs audited by the Lagos Office of Auditor General increased from 55 MDAs
in 2009 to 96 MDAs in 2012 (about 75 percent of MDAs). As for the percentage of audit queries
that have been resolved, the available basic data indicated that over 75 percent of annual audit
queries raised during the baseline audit year did not re-occur and new audit queries remained on
the decrease. Progress in audit reform during 2012-13 focused on enhancing compliance of
audits with international standards as well as ensuring timely submission of audit accounts and
audit reports to the State Assembly with a three-month of the receipt of the draft accounts from
the State Accountant General’s Office. The enactment of the new Audit Act, coupled with the
restructuring of the Auditor General has positioned the audit office to be responsive to its
oversight role.

48.     While there has been progress in operationalizing the cash management and
account receivable modules, the target was not achieved. The interface between the two
Oracle modules with the Electronic Banking System of Revenue Cycle Management (EBS-
RCM, operated by ABC Ltd) has improved the operations of the cash management module. The
State Treasury Office now has real-time access to bank statements, which allows for more
efficient three-way reconciliation between commercial banks, ABC and the Lagos State Treasury
Office. This helps ensure consistency in reported revenue collection and thus creates a basis for a
more effective cash management. The Lagos Office of Accountant General can now generate
monthly and financial statements on a timely basis to inform budget execution. Quarterly budget
execution reports are now prepared but not regularly published within 30 days except in 2014
due to delays in the finalization of the postings of the payroll costs in the general ledger and their
subsequent inclusion in budget execution reports. 16 Monthly budget execution reports are
prepared for internal use. However, the results based on the PEFA indicator (PI-2) remained


16
   Payroll expenditures were manually loaded onto the General Ledger with some delays due to a lack of an
automatic interface between the payroll system and the General Ledger. Further, a number of technical glitches on
the payroll system itself warranted reiterative validation for accuracy and reliability before postings can be made
against budget entities/cost centers. Finally, the application of Oracle skills and capacity is inherently weak.


                                                         23
above the 5 percent target during 2010-11 because the apparent volatility of revenue earnings
during the period had constrained the implementation of budgeted expenditures as planned, and
resulted in a re-prioritization of expenditure composition. This has been one of the results of the
‘cash budgeting’ arrangements adopted at the State level.

49.     The government has increased effort to operationalize the Oracle financial modules
in 2012. After a period of stop-and-go installation of the Oracle financial modules, the process
eventually regained momentum over the course of 2011-12. Capacity weaknesses across MDAs
and the Treasury Office, coupled with the problems associated with systems connectivity and
frequent downtimes, had significant negative impacts on the orderly implementation of the
delivered systems. Consequently, only about 45 percent of the installed systems functionalities
(General Ledger, Accounts Payable and Receivable, Asset management, Public Sector
Budgeting, HR/Payroll, and Cash/Treasury management) were utilized. 17 The quality assurance
arrangements in place were inadequate or non-existent. The reform was perceived as ICT
improvements rather than support to PFM improvements through the use of ICT tools. To
address this, the Lagos State Financial Systems Management Bureau was established and headed
by an experienced ICT specialist recruited from overseas in late 2012. The Bureau is responsible
for leading and providing the requisite management services over the entire spectrum of the
State’s ICT applications and systems including the Oracle program. An Oracle Directorate
Steering Committee, chaired by the Governor, will regularly monitor implementation. Among
the Bureau’s initial tasks was cleaning up payroll data, re-configuring the Oracle infrastructure,
and rolling out additional functionalities. During 2012-13, challenges with ICT connectivity was
alleviated in 2012, and the Oracle Purchase Order module was piloted in the state’s treasury
office and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), and subsequently rolled out to 8
MDAs 18 in 2014.

(c)   Sub-Objective 3 - Strengthening Investment Climate

Pillar 4: Investment Climate

50.     The aim of the investment climate reform – improving access to investment land
and reducing transaction procedures and costs in Lagos state – was partially achieved. The
cumbersome procedures and the prohibitive transaction cost in Lagos state posed challenges for
potential investors to locate their businesses and collateralize their assets. The potential of the
financial sector in Lagos state was limited by the underdeveloped mortgage market. To address
these issues, the government embarked upon investment climate reform to facilitate land
transactions and the obtaining of development permits, both of which are important for a state
with a high population density and need for new construction. The reforms include development
of a Land Information System (LIS), operationalization of the GIS, and implementation of




17
   Asset /inventory management, HR, and Accounts Payable sub-modules were not being utilized; the rest are
utilized only partially and selectively.
18
   They include Ministries of Science and Technology, Education, Health, Agriculture, Rural Development, Works
and Infrastructure, Environment, and Water.

 electronic Certificates of Occupancy (eCofO) and electronic approval of development permits.19
 In collaboration with IFC’s Investment Climate Program, the FLSDPO focused on simplifying
 procedures for the assignment and mortgage 20 of property transactions, especially the approval
 of a governor’s consent 21 and for obtaining a building permit. 22 However, the achievement was
 limited to reducing the time to register a mortgage and increasing the number of mortgages
 registered above target. The new programmatic series focused directly on the policy actions that
 lowered the cost of registering a property and sped up the registration and approval process
 (introduction of electronic processing of CofOs and electronic approvals of development
 permits). The following discusses in more detail a number of the issues related to investment
 climate reform as supported by the FLSDPO.

    The LIS is a data exchange network linking the digital records of government agencies that produce land-related
 data. It comprises the GIS installed under the auspices of the Ministry of Science and Technology to capture, store,
 analyze and present data linking to location. The GIS also includes mapping software and its application to remote
 sensing, land surveying, aerial photography, mathematics, photogrammetry, geography, and tools and hardware that
 can be implemented with GIS software for full utilization.
 20
    According to the Lagos State Mortgage and Property Law, a mortgage is created by the transfer of any interest in
 a specific movable or immovable property for the purpose of securing the repayment of a loan against an existing or
 future debt, or the performance of an engagement that may give rise to pecuniary liability. A mortgage also includes
 any charge or lien on any property for securing the repayment of money or money's worth.
 21
    The procedures for registering a property were simplified by means of: a reduction in the number of steps,
 delegation of Governor’s consent to 4 appointed commissioners, reducing the mandatory processing deadline to 48
 hours, and increasing staffing. Currently, the delegation of the approval was further extended to 4 more
 commissioners, thus bringing the total to 8 appointed officials: Attorney General and 7 Commissioners (Sport,
 Science & Technology, Establishment and Training, Housing, Environment, Education and Local government
 affairs).
 22
    Prior actions included the elimination of the pre-inspection, delegation of the approval of a development permit
 based on project size, mandating district officers to attach site pictures to each application and publishing all
 building regulations for wide dissemination free of charge.

Similarly, the number of days from application to the release of approved consent fell from 319
in 2009 to 191 in 2013. The longer period for the latter figures was due to the requirement that
the Lands bureau would release the governor’s consent only if an applicant submits an income
tax clearance certificate. The number of mortgages increased by 64 percent in 2010 and 16
percent in 2012, which was above the 10 percent target (with the indicator declining slightly by
1.4 percent in 2011).

  Source: WB staff's calculation based on data provided by the Lagos State Land Bureau                  and thoroughness. The most
common examples of missing records include information related to the land in question as
required by the charting team or the Surveyor General, pictures of the property, and names of
solicitors. The Bureau also cited queries related to tax clearance certificates, 25 verification of the
authenticity of the various documents, and delayed payment of transaction fees. Defects or errors
in the survey plans required more time for remedial action, especially if the records were not
available. The widespread use of forged documents (income tax clearance certificate, a deed of
assignment, a survey plan) necessitated further verification and confirmation. The requirement
for submission of an income tax clearance certificate to complete a property transaction is used
by the LSG as a means to increase tax collection in Lagos. Given the low level of tax compliance,
the requirement has deterred many landholders from formally processing property transactions. 26
Table 9 details the lengthy process for registering a mortgage that was extended by the lack of an
income tax clearance certificate. The weak performance in this area reflects both the inefficiency
of the implementing agency (the Lands bureau), the long process up to the approval of a
governors’ consent, and a low level of tax compliance in Lagos state.

54.     The stock of CofOs in circulation in the secondary market continued to grow albeit
at somewhat moderate pace. It grew less than 5 percent annually during the program period,
only reaching 75 percent of the target in 2011. The moderate increase of the CofO in circulation
in the primary and secondary land market was due to several reasons: (a) errors in the positional
accuracy of the old survey plans and land allocations and unauthorized land boundary

   The applicant is expected to pay the following taxes and fees: carting, endorsement and form IC fees, consent
fees, the neighborhood improvement charge, ground rent, and personal income tax. A failure to pay any of these
taxes in due time delays the process. The consent is only released to the applicant once all taxes and fees have been
paid.
26
   Although tax compliance in Lagos state has improved, the number of taxpayers (3.1 million in 2012) is still low
compared to the estimated number of taxable population of 8 million in Lagos state.

55.     Less progress has been registered in obtaining a development permit in terms of
time, although the cost has steadily declined. Doing Business report has recently revised its
database, as a result, the baseline value for obtaining a construction permit increased from 82 to
96 days in 2009. During 2010-13, time taken to obtain a construction permit remained at 116
days, up from 96 days in 2009 (Table 7). The number of procedures remained unchanged at 18.
However, the cost for obtaining a construction permit fell steadily during the program (11
percent reduction in the cost in 2011) reflecting partially the elimination of the fee (N50,000) for
information on building regulations (now free of charge), a FLSDPO prior action. Thereafter, the
cost of obtaining a construction permit continued to decline during 2012-13. The timeline for
obtaining development permits is typically a drawn out process. Approval requires pre-approval
site inspection prior to any construction to ensure that the property is indeed the same as the one
being proposed for development, that construction not commence before approval of a building
plan, and that the land does not belong or overlap with state-acquired land. Further, intending
developers are required to have a governor’s consent for obtaining development permits and
building plan approvals. 27 Finally, the requirement to submit an income tax clearance certificate
to obtain a development permit also contributed to the long process.

56.     The government took actions to improve the investment climate. First, the number of
commissioners delegated to approve consents was doubled from 4 to 8 commissioners, a
decision that significantly reduced the number of days required to approve governor’s consent
for registering a mortgage by 23 percent in 2012 and helped increase the number of mortgages
registered by 16 percent the same year. These figures reflect a robust demand for mortgage
registration and demonstrate the potential impact of simplifying mortgage registration procedures.
It should be noted that the number of days taken to obtain a governor’s consent remains higher
than the Lands bureau’s service standard for approval of governor’s consent of 30 days. 28
Second, the government has proposed to further reduce the official fees charged for registering a
property. In addition to lowering the land transaction fee (from 30 to 15 percent) 29 in 2007 and
simplification of the process for registering a property (prior actions supported by the FLSDPO),
the LSG has submitted a proposal to EXCO for approval to further reduce land transaction fees
by at least 50 percent together with the introduction of a new methodology for assessing property
value. Third, the operationalization of the GIS with accessible authophotos (SLSDPO’s prior

   Official fees and taxes for consent to assignment of land rights was lowered to 15% of asset value (from the
previous level of 30%) and the official fee for consent to mortgage was lowered from 0.25% to 0.20% of mortgage
amount. The fees include capital gain tax (2 percent), stamp duty (2 percent), registration (3 percent) and consent (8
percent) plus other administrative payments and charges.

formal and secondary markets. Finally, to facilitate the approval of building permits, in 2013 the
government has increased the number of locations where building permit payments can be made
from 1 to 20 locations, reduced the number of building types requiring a full environment impact
assessment by the Ministry of Environment, and operated a pre-clearance service to reduce the
number of incomplete applications from getting lost in the system.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.     Overall outcome rating for the FLSDPO is moderately satisfactory. It is based on
satisfactory relevance of the objectives, design and implementation and the Moderately
Satisfactory rating for the PDO achievement.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.      Various evidence suggest that the pace of economic growth in Lagos state has been
quite strong and has contributed to a significant decline in poverty rates and income
inequality. Nigeria still does not produce state-level GDP or output data. 30 The national
household budget surveys conducted in 2004 and 2010 indicate that per-capita consumption
increased annually by an average of 13 percent over the period, despite rapid population growth.
This suggests that economic growth in Lagos was well in the double digits. Given that the Lagos
state is driven by non-oil activities, output growth appears consistent with the growth rate of non-
oil GDP at the national level. The economy is quite diversified, comprising large manufacturing
(30 percent), road transport (26 percent) and building and construction (20 percent), wholesale
and retail (8 percent) and other activities (telecommunication, financial and real estate).
According to the 2004 and 2010 household budget surveys, Lagos achieved the fastest poverty
reduction recorded in Nigeria: the poverty rate fell from 57 percent to 23 percent during the
period. Income inequality also improved: the Gini coefficient fell from 0.44 in 2004 to 0.34 in
2010. Lagos state has brought millions out of poverty, including numerous migrants from other
parts of Nigeria and West Africa who have come to the city in search of better and/or new
opportunities.

59.     The Lagos government has been successful in addressing social, gender, and public
security issues. The state achieved relatively high rates of literacy and access to quality health
care, including among women reflecting both the impact of government policy as well as a high
degree of private primary education and health services. In education, its key indicators were not
only above those registered at the national level but the gender gaps were also narrower. Lagos
state has the highest literacy among women in the country. Its primary and secondary school net
attendance ratios were above those registered at the national level, and its overall primary and


30
   An enterprise and household survey conducted for the first time in 2010 by the Lagos State Bureau of Statistics
indicated that its GDP amounted to 12.091 trillion naira (US$80.6 billion) in 2010, which is more than double
previous estimates. However, the Bureau assumed that real GDP growth in Lagos state was only 7 percent
throughout the period.


                                                        29
secondary school attendance ratios for girls were also higher than those achieved at the national
level. 31 In health, Lagos attained lower infant mortality and under-five mortality rates and a
higher percentage of women having antenatal care and delivery provided by a skilled health
worker, compared to the national average. 32 Public security has also improved as indicated by a
reduction in the crime rate over the last decade tied to major investment in more effective law
enforcement and technical and vocational training for delinquent youths involved in organized
crime and improved reintegration efforts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

60.      The program contributed to institutional changes and capacity development. The
FLSDPO program complemented by technical assistance supported by LMDGP and SPARC
institutionalized the MTEF approach that has now become an integral part of the budget planning
and preparation process in Lagos state. The program also built the procurement and audit
systems and institutions and furthered operationalized the Oracle Financial Modules towards full
deployment status contributed directly to greater transparency, accountability, and efficiency in
in the use of public resource. In the process of implementation, the capacity of civil servants and
public institutions has been developed and strengthened. The incremental approach to the reform
under the programmatic design helped build the long-term capacity of government officials in
budget preparation and execution, reinforced by the annual budget processes.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

61.     The reform program, which aimed to increase IGR and improve access to
investment land, could have unintended outcomes and impacts. The IGR improvements
focusing on improving compliance of taxpayers is one such area. Lagos’ informal sector (retail
trade and services) is large and has created numerous employment and income for small
businesses and individuals. Although widespread and effective efforts to increase tax collection
in the informal sector would increase both the number of taxpayers and collection that will be
spent to boost growth and job creation, it runs the risk of amplifying the tax burden on the lower-
income group. This potentially adverse impact is expected to be mitigated by public financial
management reforms to ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public
resources that should eventually improve the quality of public services especially education,
health and infrastructure for low-income groups.




31
   According to the National Bureau of Statistics (2013), the literacy rate amongst women registered 96.3 percent,
the highest in Nigeria. The UN Millennium Development Goals’ Survey (2013), indicated that the primary and
secondary school net attendance ratios registered 88.4 and 78.1 percent in Lagos state, compared to 71 and 54.8
percent at the national level. The overall primary and secondary school attendance ratios for girls registered 88.9 and
80.1 percent in Lagos state, compared to 68.1 and 53.1 percent at the national level.
32
   The UN Millennium Development Goals’ Survey (2013) showed that infant mortality and under-five mortality
rates were at 24 and 31, respectively, per 1000 in Lagos state compared to the national rates of 61 and 94 per 1000,
and the percentage of women having antenatal care and delivery provided by a skilled health worker registered 87.2
percent in Lagos state, compared to 66.3 percent at the country level.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

62.    No beneficiary surveys or stakeholder workshops were required for this ICR.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate

63.     The risk to the development outcome – macro-fiscal, political and implementation
risks – is moderate. Changes in the macro and fiscal environments in Nigeria are outside the
control of the Lagos government and pose a significant risk to program outcomes. A decline in
international oil prices, for instance, could lower federal allocations to Lagos state, and changes
in federal tax policies could affect IGR performance in Lagos and thereby medium-term fiscal
sustainability. Political risk associated with the upcoming elections in 2015 is considered
moderate. The 2015 elections is expected to change the executive team of the government in
Lagos State, starting with the governor and EXCO members. However, Lagos state’s
commitment to the reform agenda has been strong and broad-based due to the participatory
policymaking processes involving relevant stakeholders, an approach established over the past
several years through the Ehinbeti Forum and the budget consultation forum. Under this
environment, the risk is assessed as moderate as the new government will likely continue the
reform program. Finally, implementation risk associated with weak IT capacity is considered
moderate. A number of program outcomes, such as the successful and efficient working of all
financial modules and GIS, depend to a large extent on motivated, well-paid and trained civil
servants with requisite IT skills. This challenge was addressed to some extent through the use of
abundant IT consultants available in Lagos to support the implementation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Moderately satisfactory

64.     The team was correct in embedding the FLSDPO in the ongoing government reform
agenda. This ensured the sustainability of the reform program despite delayed preparation of the
second operation. Rather than remain idle, the program progressed due to the government’s
commitment to the reform agenda. Although the operation temporarily slowed down during the
transition after the elections, the program eventually regained its footing and momentum
continued.

65.    The design of the program was informed by comprehensive analytical works, and
implementation was supported by technical assistance where possible. The preparation of the
FLSDPO benefited from extensive studies conducted by the Bank and other donors during 2007-
2010 as well as a PEFA Assessment of the PFM system over the period 2006-2008. These
helped inform the reform program under fiscal sustainability, budget planning and preparation
and budget execution pillars. The Investment Climate pillar, which was guided by the ongoing




                                                31
Investment Climate Program and sub-national Governance Investment Climate, focused more on
administrative procedures.

66.     There were moderate shortcomings related to ensuring quality at entry. The risk to
IGR performance due to changes in income tax policy by the federal government was not
anticipated, and this contributed to an ambitious target. Similarly, the risk associated with limited
internet connectivity and ICT capacity was not expected and as a result the implementation of
the Oracle financial modules slowed in 2011-12.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     The Bank team included the required expertise, namely: PFM specialists, procurement
specialists, the Integrated Financial Management Information System, and a GIS expert to
monitor the implementation of the program. The team maintained the policy dialog with the
government even in the absence of the second operation. The engagement focused mainly on
progress in implementing the triggers of the FLSDPO (prior actions for the SLSDPO). The
Implementation Support and Results (ISR) reports did not present the values for all M&E
indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Moderately satisfactory

68.    Overall Bank performance is moderately satisfactory given some shortcomings in
ensuring quality and supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately satisfactory

69.     The Lagos government demonstrated its firm commitment to the reform program
and its readiness to implement the agreed actions. The government demonstrated strong
commitment to the Lagos state’s reform agenda and the FLSDPO program. The commitment
was broad-based and shared by all stakeholders from the highest level: the Governor of Lagos
state to the second, third, and forth levels of government (Commissioner, Permanent Secretary,
and Director). The overall reform program, implemented by various MDAs, was coordinated by
the Ministry of Finance and all prior actions were implemented by key stakeholders in MDAs
without delays prior to the Board discussion. There were challenges during the program
implementation and the government took decisive actions to address these challenges to ensure
the achievement of the program development objectives. The installation and operationalization
of the financial modules were fast-tracked after intervention by the Governor. The investment
climate reform was strongly supported by the Governor as evidenced by the delegation of the
approval of governor’s consent to 8 commissioners and eCofO to speed up the registration
process.

70.   The government maintained an enabling macroeconomic environment throughout
the program. Through the adoption of MTFS, fiscal management has been prudent and



                                                 32
consistent with the medium-term debt sustainability analysis. MEPB regularly monitors the
budget implementation on a quarterly basis, and this has helped the LSG fine-tune the fiscal
policy in response to external shocks outside its control to maintain fiscal discipline. In 2012,
IGR significantly fell short of expectations due to the retroactive effectiveness of the PITA
Amendments Act approved by the federal government. In response, the LSG reduced personal
costs and overhead spending to accommodate capital expenditures while maintaining the fiscal
deficit below the target of 2 percent of SGDP.

71.     The use of M&E data for the government’s decision-making and resource allocation
was uneven. While the government regularly uses M&E data under the first pillar to inform
fiscal and debt policy and budget allocation, the use of M&E data to strengthen the investment
climate reform is weak. In particular, the Lands bureau does not monitor the impacts of the
reform to simplify business procedures for mortgage registration.

6. Lessons Learned

72.     A key lesson is to design cooperation of a state-level DPO in such a manner that
continuity can be maintained even in the face of unanticipated delays in financial support.
The cutting short of the programmatic series was beyond the state government’s control. A delay
in the approval of the government borrowing plan (as discussed earlier) deferred the preparation
of the SLSDPO. However, the government has continued to drive the reform program forward to
improve monitoring of fiscal risks, strengthen budget preparation, budget execution, and e-
government even during the absence of an operation during 2012-2013. The Bank continued
engagement with the government throughout, which ultimately led to the adjustment of the
program in response to the government’s commitment under a new programmatic series
approved by the Board in 2014.

73.     The design of a sub-national government operation should properly account for
interplay between federal and state policies. For a sub-national government DPO, the team
needs to clearly identify who is in charge of policy formulation that is supported by the program.
If the federal government is in control of a policy, the program design should allow sufficient
space for a state government to counter adverse impacts from factors outside their control. In this
circumstance, the targets for results indicators should be moderate and take into account the
unanticipated risk due to the federal government’s policy actions.

74.    Coupling a DPO with long-term technical assistance supports the implementation of
prior actions and fosters sustainability of the reform. This approach supported the
implementation of prior actions and helped achieve the expected outcomes under the two pillars
(budget preparation and budget execution) because of government commitment to the reform
agenda. Technical assistance support of the IDA investment project LMDGP and SPARC
contributed to successful reform implementation. The reforms moved forward even in the
absence of a programmatic engagement as evidenced by progress in implementing the
subsequent DPO’s triggers during 2012-13.

75.  When the reform focuses on public sector modernization through the deployment of
IFMIS, risks associated with internet connectivity and ICT capacity should be properly



                                                33
accounted for and mitigated. The FLSDPO implementation was supported by the LMDGP
(Component II: Public Governance and Capacity Building) to provide support in a number of
areas: updating the PFM legislation, introduction of an MTEF, improve budget execution and
treasury management, and implementation of the Oracle-based Integrated Financial Management
Information System. However, the risk associated with a less-than-reliable internet connectivity
and inadequate ICT capacity was not addressed.

76.    Care must be taken when applying ICA recommendations and indicators; reform
should be informed by an in-depth sector diagnostic. The World Bank’s Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) recommended that ICA be viewed as a diagnostic tool that provides an
evidence basis for the identification of key constraints to private investment and for comparison
of an economy to its peers. 33 Without the existence of an in-depth sector and institutional
analysis, ICA recommendations should be considered inadequate to inform the design and
sequencing of politically-sensitive reform measures. 34

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

77.     The government counterparts in the MEPB and MOF expressed their appreciation
of the FLSDPO interventions. Besides providing financing for a fiscally sustainable deficit, the
FLSDPO reinforced government’s commitment to advance the reforms in the areas that faced
resistance from vested interests, especially budget execution, procurement and audit. Clearly, the
FLSDPO made it easier to implement the reforms. The authorities also expressed support for the
implementation of the PFM law that institutionalizes the MTEF. The latter facilitated the budget
negotiation process with MDAs. In addition, implementing agencies provided comments to the
draft ICR that are mostly related to the value of fiscal sustainability indicators and factual
information. Summary of implementing agencies’ comments on the draft ICR was included in
Annex 4.

(b) Cofinanciers

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

78.     A key partner of the FLSDPO (DFID-SPARC) underscored the importance of
having close collaboration among development partners. This collaboration could be in the
form of sharing information, mission schedules, and joint meeting. Such collaboration supported
the alignment of their technical assistance to support the reform agenda supported by the
FLSDPO.

       of assembly Public Account Committee (PAC) while results indicators have been
       reviewed to reflect coverage and scope of audit going forward.
   •   Lands Bureau reported that high cost of registering a property is not a factor for land
       registration. Charges seemed fair and reasonable as the values of property are evaluated
       based on the 2005 assessment.
   •   Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development reported that isolated queries
       were responsible for the noted observation, an increase in time taken to obtain a building
       permit. However, it was agreed that fresh applications should be measured in subsequent
       permit processing duration.
   •   Land Regularization Department reported that DPO1 target set seemed to be overstated
       while a moderate target has been agreed under the DPO2.

2. Section 2.2

   •   Delayed implementation of Oracle Financial Modules, the draft ICR needs to be specific
       that some modules were yet to be implemented. The government noted that the way it
       was stated in the draft ICR suggested that no implementation of the entire Oracle
       modules.
   •   ICR asserted that support for a major reform of LIRS and Land Use Charge (triggers for
       the subsequent operation) experienced delays during the transition cannot be correct
       representation of what obtained in reality. The LSG argued that there was no instance
       when any of the reforms program suffered as a result of changes in cabinet members. The
       passage of the law reforming LIRS is into at the instance of the commissioner but a
       function of the Lagos State House of Assembly by the Constitution.

Section 3.2

Pillar 1:
   •   The ICR should clarify which off-budget borrowing by public entities is referred to in the
       report.



                                               41
Pillar 3:
   •   Reconciliation statements are prepared monthly, for all the 21 expenditure banks.
       Unpresented cheques form the bulk of the outstanding items in the reconciliation
       statements and it is at the prerogative of the beneficiaries to present their cheques for
       payments early enough at the bank and the State Government has no control over when
       such cheques are presented. Also, when these cheques become stale, it is the policy of the
       State Government to collate them until year end during the preparation of the annual
       statutory financial statements before they are written back. Nonetheless, this policy
       would be revisited and the write back of outstanding unpresented cheques after they are
       six months old, would be reconsidered. There are also audit trails and these outstanding
       items can be confirmed via the Oracle Application.
   •   Operationalizing Cash Management and Account Receivable Modules.                         As
       mentioned in the report, the State Treasury Office now has real time access to bank
       statements which has improved its cash management operations. However, comments on
       delays in the preparation and publishing of Quarterly Budget Execution Reports are not
       correct as these reports are published within 30 days of quarter end. For instance, the
       First Quarter Budget Performance Review was held on the 29th of April, 2014 while the
       Second Quarterly Review has been scheduled for between the 17th and 19th of July 2014.
       These dates are usually agreed at the beginning of the year and circulated to all
       stakeholders.
   •   Delays in the finalization of postings of the payroll costs in the general ledger are
       also not correct. Although the Payroll Module is not integrated with the GL Module in
       the Oracle Application, payroll costs are inputted manually and journalized via the
       application, on a monthly basis, hence there are no delays in the postings of these payroll
       figures. With the recent set up of an Oracle Technical Committee in STO mandated to
       resolve immediate fixes in the application before the end of the 3rd quarter, the payroll
       module would be fully integrated with GL and postings would seamlessly drop therein.
   •   Full Utilization of Installed Oracle Modules. An Oracle Taskforce championed by the
       Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), with STO as a prominent member, has
       been directed by His Excellency, to see to the full utilization of all the installed modules
       out of which 5 are financial modules domiciled in STO. Challenges observed in the
       network connectivity would be overcome with the recent laying of fibers into the Alausa
       Secretariat and the network upgrade being implemented by MOST. This would assist in
       increasing the 45% Oracle utilization observed in the report.

Section 5.2 – Borrower Performance

   •   The draft ICR concluded that the investment climate in Lagos state has only improved
       marginally despite the ongoing reform. The LSG noted that we should recognize that
       there is usually a lag time from reforms to the full manifestation of their results.
