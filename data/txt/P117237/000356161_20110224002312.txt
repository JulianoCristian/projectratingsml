Financing Data         IDA Credit of SDR 128.1 million (US$200 million equivalent)
Operation Type         Development Policy Operation
Main Policy Area       The main policy areas supported are (a) maintaining fiscal
                       sustainability; (b) improving the quality of spending and (c)
                       strengthening the investment climate.
Key Outcome            The following outcomes are expected as a result of the proposed
Indicators             operation:
                        Lagos state`s budget remains fiscally sustainable through
                           consistency with a medium-term fiscal strategy and with a set of
                           indicators (including ceilings on the deficit, debt service and wage
                           bill and targeted growth of internally generated revenue);
                        Quality of expenditure improves, as measured by a set of key
                           indicators of expenditure effectiveness;
                        Credibility of the budget improves, reflected in the declining
                           deviation of the ratio of budget execution and the budget approved
                           by the state assembly;
                        Quality and transparency of expenditure improves through (i)
                           improved procurement on account of regular publication of contract
                           awards, use of standard bidding documents and effective use of a
                           complaints mechanism; (ii) higher quality of audit reflected in a
                           growing percentage of audit queries that has been resolved; and (iii)
                           expeditious clearance of unreconciled items in bank reconciliation
                           reports;
                        Time to register mortgages and property falls significantly on
                           account of simplified procedures;
                        Time to obtain a development permit falls significantly owing to
                           streamlined procedures.

                       The DPO contributes to a number of key outcomes of the Country
                       Partnership Strategy. Notably, the DPO`s focus on the investment
                       climate should allow improved performance on the Doing Business
                       Indicators, one of the CPS outcome indicators measuring progress
                       towards sustainable growth in the real sector of the economy­a key
                       objective of the government under the Seven-Point agenda. Also, the
                       DPO supports improvements in auditing and accounting, budget
                                                                                               vi
                    planning and better procurement which are outcomes under the CPS
                    pillar for governance for results.
Risks and Risk      There are four main risks potentially associated with the program as
Mitigation          follows: (i) macroeconomic; ii) state risk; iii) country risk; and (iv)
                    governance risk.
                       Macroeconomic Risk. Risks to the program could arise from a fall
                       in world oil prices or lower-than-projected increase in non-oil
                       revenue. To mitigate this risk, the framework underlying the
                       operation makes conservative assumptions on non-oil growth and
                       increases in non-oil revenue that are below the historical record. In
                       addition, the oil-price based fiscal rule and macroeconomic stability
                       could be undermined by continued ad-hoc withdrawals prompted by
                       pressure from states. The government is working to create a
                       Sovereign Wealth Fund, with both investment and stabilization
                       objectives, that would help embed counter-cyclical fiscal policy in
                       law.
                       State Risk. The leadership of Governor Fashola since 2007 has been
                       instrumental in fast-tracking Lagos` reform process. However,
                       progress still needs to be deepened considerably. Addressing
                       shortcomings in the public financial management and procurement
                       system will require strong leadership. The state risk is expected to be
                       mitigated by the various measures to empower civil society and
                       strengthen demand for demand for good governance being
                       undertaken by the state government. Also, the catalytic effect of the
                       LDPO on coordination and cohesiveness of reforms will help
                       improve implementation.
                       Country risk. Lagos` reforms could also be affected by a general
                       slowdown in reform or reversal at the level of the federal
                       government, especially in the context of the electoral process.
                       Factors that may mitigate this risk include the growing importance
                       of an emerging middle class that has benefited from economic
                       growth resulting from reforms; and the relatively good relationship
                       and close policy dialogue established with the Bank.
                 

                       Governance Risk. Although significant improvements have been
                       made in the public financial management system in Lagos,
                       transparency and accountability of resources could be further
                       enhanced. The state has demonstrated strong reform commitment
                       through implementation of reforms in public financial management,
                       such as the operationalization of several components of the
                       Integrated Financial Management System and through the ongoing
                       procurement reform process.

               PROPOSED FIRST LAGOS DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT TO
                        THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA

                                             I.    INTRODUCTION

1.       Lagos is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.1 Its population grew from only
259,000 inhabitants in 1950 to an estimated 15 million at present and continues to grow rapidly.
Following decades of economic mismanagement and lack of long-term planning to allow the
state`s infrastructure to match the needs of the rapidly growing population, the quality of life in
Lagos ranks near the bottom among all mega-cities with rampant crime, chronic congestion of all
major transportation routes, serious environmental pollution and persistent lack of basic public
services, especially water and power. 70 percent of the population lives in slums and the poverty
rate of 65 percent exceeds Nigeria`s national average. However, owing to opportunities for
economic survival in the informal sector, population from all over Nigeria continues to stream
into Lagos, further exacerbating the impact of the infrastructure gap and of the inadequate
institutional framework for public services on the quality of life in the city.

2.      Lagos is also the engine of growth of Nigeria's non-oil economy. As the country`s
financial center, a key communications and transportation hub, and the headquarters of many
major national and regional industrial, manufacturing and financial corporations, much of
Nigeria`s strong growth performance since 2001 can be attributed to the vibrancy of Lagos`
private sector. Moreover, Lagos` wholesale and retail trade, light manufacturing, construction
and information, communication and technology sectors which are already performing well hold
substantial potential for rapid job creation, provided key binding constraints in these sectors are
being alleviated.2 Those constraints include limited and decrepit infrastructure (urban transit
system and power supply), inadequate human capital, a discouraging investment climate, and
limited access to finance.

3.      In recent years, under determined political leadership, Lagos has made considerable
efforts to addressing challenges within the context of a well-articulated and comprehensive
reform agenda aimed at addressing the development needs of the state. While these reforms
were already initiated at the beginning of the decade, they were substantially accelerated by the
new administration that came to office in 2007 and have already begun to yield measurable
results: Crime has fallen drastically, as delinquent youth involved in criminal activity entered
state-sponsored vocational training programs; transportation services have improved with the
establishment of designated lanes for public buses and key transportation infrastructure and
public areas have been rehabilitated. Also, public-private-partnership projects have been initiated
in key infrastructure areas. Importantly, the government has consistently embraced a
participatory style of policy formulation, involving diverse groups of stakeholders in public
meetings attended by senior government officials.

                                                                                                 1
4.      These reforms have already begun to improve the quality of life in Lagos and
created a new and unprecedented sense of optimism about the city's future. However, as
public services expand and begin to better meet the needs of the population, the limitations of the
existing institutional framework have become more apparent. The current administration has
realized that without pursuit of key institutional reforms, the government will not be able to
effectively manage the challenges of a city that has a larger population and bigger economy than
many African countries. Maintaining the recent pace of change will require a systemic
transformation aimed at building a more appropriate institutional and regulatory framework that
is able to create conducive conditions for investment and private-sector led growth and improve
service delivery in a sustainable manner ­ key objectives of the Lagos state government. To
achieve these objectives, Lagos State government considers two policy areas to be of primary
importance: (i) improving the quality of spending through strengthened budget planning and
better budget execution; and (ii) enhancing the investment climate by streamlining and
simplifying the bureaucratic and regulatory environment. Lagos State government is aware that
its reform agenda ­ notably the financing of large infrastructure projects and improving service
delivery ­ will pose challenges for the state`s fiscal sustainability, and therefore needs to be
embedded within a carefully designed medium-term fiscal strategy.

5.     It is against this background that Lagos State government views support from the
World Bank through a Development Policy Credit as critical to catalyze the desired
systemic transformation and preserve fiscal sustainability. This document presents a
proposed single-tranche Development Policy Credit (DPC)--embedded in a planned series of
three operations in equal amounts of US$200 million--to support Lagos State in the
implementation of this reform program. The proposed operation aims at supporting Lagos state`s
reform program by supporting sustainable fiscal policies, and helping to articulate and monitor
cohesive reform strategies to improve the quality of spending and the investment climate.

6.      The proposed sub-national DPC is the first of its kind in Nigeria. It builds on lessons
learned in other federal states, such as Brazil and India, where sub-national DPCs have
successfully been used to support policy changes at the state level. In the Nigerian context, state
governments play a large role in service delivery, and are therefore critical actors to achieve
progress toward many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The proposed DPC
offers a new vehicle to support Lagos directly in its efforts to build sustainable systems for state
services by offering financial assistance for policy changes with systemic impact. Lessons from
this engagement may carry over for other state-level engagements of the Bank.

                 II.     THE COUNTRY AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

7.      The last decade has been the first period of continuous democracy in Nigeria. Since
independence, Nigeria has experienced a series of military regimes, a devastating civil war and
several democratically elected governments unable to complete their terms in office, until 1999,
when President Obasanjo was elected, and then re-elected in 2003. With the election of President
Yar`Adua in 2007, one elected government handed power over to another for the first time in
Nigeria`s history, although the election process was widely viewed as flawed. Following
President Yar`Adua`s death in May 2010, Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan was appointed
President and in early 2011 the presidential candidate of the ruling party. General elections are
expected to be held in April 2011.

                                                                                                  2
8.       From macro-management to sector reforms, the agenda for reform since 2000 has
been ambitious. The most fundamental and far-reaching reforms were in fiscal management,
when the government introduced in 2004 a system of basing the budget on a conservative
reference price for oil, with excesses saved in a special account, thus ending the  boom-and-bust
cycle of previous periods. In 2005, Nigeria secured the largest debt relief in the history of the
Paris Club, substantially increasing fiscal space to expand social expenditures. Ambitious
initiatives were launched to increase transparency and reduce corruption in the management of
public finance, and civil service reform was begun, although progress has been mixed.
Establishment of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was successful in
convicting high-level politicians of corruption and recovering embezzled funds.3 Nigeria was
among the first countries to adopt and implement the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) to improve governance of the oil and gas sector. In this context, an independent
audit of the oil and gas sector from 1999 to 2004 was carried out and published, and efforts to
address the findings of the report are currently being made. Reforms were initiated in the
financial sector, including strengthening banking supervision and consolidation of the banking
system; the telecommunication sector was deregulated; and the power sector was unbundled into
18 companies for generation, transmission, and distribution. Privatization and concessioning
were initiated in the ports, steel, mining, and petrochemicals sectors. The pension system was
replaced with a fully-funded contribution system.

9.      These reforms ushered in a period of high and sustained non-oil growth. Since 2001,
the growth of Nigeria`s non-oil economy accelerated to more than 8 percent, more than twice the
rate of growth over the previous 5 year-period. Increased agricultural production played a key
role in the expansion of the non-oil economy, as remittances and other capital inflows led to an
increase in aggregate demand resulting in increased prices for food products and increased use of
land under cultivation. 70 percent of non-oil growth since 2001 can be explained by the
agriculture and wholesale and retail sectors. Relatively new sectors, such as construction, the
financial sector, telecommunications, and ICT have also recorded high growth and have initiated
a structural transformation of the Nigerian economy towards the services sector. Growth of the
oil economy remains constrained by militancy in the Niger Delta, but oil production has
stabilized since the beginning of 2010 at above 2.3 million barrels a day--about 0.2 million
barrels above the average for 2009.

Recent Economic Developments

10.     The Nigerian economy has weathered the global economic recession well (table 2
and figures 2-5). It expanded more rapidly than expected in 2009 and continued to gain strength
in 2010. Non-oil growth fell only slightly from 9 percent in 2008 to 8.3 percent in 2009 and
remained strong at 7.9 percent in 2010, as remittances and foreign direct investment continued to
drive fast growth in the solid minerals, telecommunication, wholesale and retail and construction
sectors. At the same time, continued disruptions in oil production owing to militancy in the Niger
Delta led to a decline in oil GDP, although improvements in the security situation towards the
end of 2009 allowed oil production to recover in 2010.

11.     The limited impact of the international financial crisis on Nigeria's economy partly
reflected a number of immediate and proactive actions taken by the Federal Government
and the CBN. These measures were supported by the Bank with a federal-level DPO approved
under the Fast-Track initiative in 2009. They included establishing a Presidential Committee to
coordinate the government`s anti-crisis program; steps to stabilize the banking system and
restore confidence; fiscal adjustments including administrative reforms designed to improve the
quality and transparency of Government expenditures. Continuation of these policies (including
the oil-price based fiscal rule, targeting of growth bottlenecks, containing recurrent costs and
wages, tackling subsidies, and prudent borrowing) will also be important to strengthen the
confidence of domestic and international investors in the government`s ability to stay on a
sustainable path and help mitigate the crisis.

12.     Driven by improving oil revenues, the fiscal deficit narrowed from 10.4 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2010. The impact on the deficit of the improvement in
oil revenue in 2010 was partly offset by higher expenditure, including in the area of capital
expenditure to address the large infrastructure gap.

13.     A rise in non-performing loans partly related to the global economic downturn
brought to the fore capital inadequacies in 10 out of the country's 24 banks--some of
which were illiquid--and led the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to inject new capital in the
amount of $4 billion (about 4 percent of non-oil GDP). The CBN has since embarked on a
comprehensive program to strengthen banking supervision and spur lending, such as the
adoption of a timetable for reporting in line with International Financial Reporting Standards,
and of a program for consolidated risk-based banking supervision.

14.    Reflecting lower growth of the money supply, inflation in 2010 fell by 1 percentage
point to about 12.8 percent. The rise in inflation in 2009 to almost 14 percent had reflected a
combination of rising global food and fuel prices, transport bottlenecks caused by local fuel
shortages, and easy monetary conditions.

15.     In 2010, Nigeria's external balance deteriorated despite a favorable external
environment. Although the terms of trade improved and oil production and world oil prices
rose, the current account surplus declined sharply from 13 percent of GDP in 2009 to 6.6 percent
of GDP, as imports surged. In parallel, international reserves fell to about 6.6 months of import
coverage.

                                                                                                4
16.     The stance of Nigeria's macroeconomic policies for 2011 is appropriate. Nigeria
performed well under the IMF`s Policy Support Instrument (PSI) and has, since the expiration of
the program in November 2007, continued to embrace prudent macroeconomic policies and
collaborated closely with the IMF. However, pressure from state governments in 2010 led to a
number of ad-hoc withdrawals from the Excess Crude Account, and had by end-2010 ­­
combined with drawdowns to compensate for shortfalls in oil revenue during the financial crisis
in 2009 and increased capital spending ­ largely depleted the Excess Crude Account. Monetary
policy in 2009-10 has been accommodative of the expansionary fiscal stance, keeping inflation
relatively high and putting pressure on the exchange rate, which the CBN has stabilized through
sale of foreign currency, resulting in a slow but steady loss of international reserves. The
government has recognized the resulting medium-term risks to macroeconomic management and
has adjusted its policy stance for 2011, including through a significant tightening of spending
under the proposed 2011 budget. With a view to enhancing the political consensus around the
oil-price based fiscal rule, the federal government has also recently stepped up efforts to create a
Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). These proposed measures would diminish pressures on monetary
policy and the exchange rate, and support renewed accumulation of fiscal and external reserve
buffers.

Medium-Term outlook

17.     Nigeria`s growth prospects over the medium-term (see Table 2) remain positive,
although the strength of the growth performance will depend on success in implementing
structural reforms to address binding constraints to investment. Oil production is expected
to recover owing to the decline in militancy following the amnesty in the Niger Delta, leading to
positive growth of oil GDP. At the same time, the continued buoyancy of important sectors of
the Nigerian non-oil economy, especially agriculture, wholesale and retail and construction, as
well as the continued strong growth of emerging sectors of the economy (telecommunications,
financial sector and aviation) are projected to allow the non-oil economy to grow at around 7
percent.

18.     In 2011, Nigeria's fiscal deficit is expected to improve from 6.9 percent of GDP in
2010 to 0.4 percent of GDP, largely on account of expenditure cuts and a further
improvement in oil revenue. Through 2013, the fiscal deficit as a share of GDP is expected to
further gradually improve reflecting expenditure restraint.

19.     The balance of payments is projected to improve over the medium-term, as growth
of exports is expected to exceed growth in imports, reflecting primarily the positive outlook
for oil and gas production. As a result, the current account surplus is expected to improve from
6.6 percent of GDP in 2010 to 10.5 percent of GDP in 2013. Reserve coverage is expected to rise
from $34.1 billion at end-2010 to about $52.1 billion in 2013.

20.   Nigeria's external public debt is projected to total $4.8 billion at end-2010.
Approximately $4 billion of the external debt stock is multilateral debt, with the remaining
amount owed to bilateral creditors. Domestic public debt is estimated to have reached 13 percent
of GDP at end-2009. While sub-national borrowing is limited, there are indications that state
governments are expanding their exposure to domestic creditors, underscoring the need for
improved monitoring of sub-national debt.

21.    Reflecting sound macroeconomic policies and prudent borrowing, Nigeria is at low
risk of debt distress based on the joint Bank-IMF low-income country debt sustainability
analysis (DSA). The debt outlook is robust both in the baseline scenario and in the case of

                                                                                                                                     7
standardized stress tests.4 For the two customized stress tests, all indicators deteriorate when
compared to the baseline results, but remain within nearly all country-specific thresholds.5 Debt
would become unsustainable if the primary balance remained unchanged from its anticipated
2009 level. The primary balance is expected to strengthen from this level, however, as oil prices
recover. Debt would also become unsustainable in the event of a permanent shock to GDP
growth. Given Nigeria`s strong financial starting position, there would be time for fiscal policy
to adjust to avoid an unsustainable build up of debt.

                                       III.     THE STATE CONTEXT

22.      Like Nigeria as whole, Lagos has enjoyed continuous democracy since 1999. The
State is governed by a minority party, the Action Congress, which controls the office of
Governor as well as the State House of Assembly. The previous and current governors are from
the Action Congress, and this has resulted in some continuity and consistency in state policy and
development priorities over the last decade.6 The State Government has established its
credentials in the past eight years by promoting consultative and participatory policy-making
initiatives. It has also introduced a participatory planning process (the Ehingbeti Forum) that
actively involves the private sector and civil society. Development priorities such as the state`s
Ten-Point Agenda (TPA) and the Lagos State Economic Empowerment and Development
Strategy (LASEEDS) are vigorously debated among all stakeholders. To ensure an enduring and
productive relationship between the executive and legislative arms of government, the current
administration created a quarterly forum where Lagos lawmakers at the state and federal levels
as well as the entire state executive council come together to work towards a common legislative
agenda for the state at all levels.

 This DSA utilizes the updated Bank-Fund debt template for low-income countries. The previous DSA for Nigeria
was undertaken as part of the 2007 Article IV consultation and published in February 2008.

    The one exception concerns the threshold for the PV of debt-to-exports in certain years between 2019 and 2027.

  Nigeria`s federal system provides for considerable autonomy to states; as a result, political developments at the
state level are often only marginally affected by those at the federal level.

Recent Economic Developments

23.      Based on preliminary GDP estimates for Lagos7, annual growth has been at double
digit rates from 2000 to 2007, faster than the national rate (figure 5). During 2008 and 2009,
growth is projected to have remained around 7 to 8 percent, in line with the growth rate for the
country as a whole. Growth was largely driven by the services sector (including wholesale and
retail trade) which accounts for 75 percent of the state`s overall GDP growth. Wholesale and
retail trade represents more than 50 percent of that services sector. The contribution of the
manufacturing sector to state GDP growth was a healthy 23 percent, while primary activity
(agriculture, fishing, mining, etc) contributed a negligible 2 percent over the same period. The
informal sector, which represents about 45 percent of the state economy in terms of output,
constitutes the main source of income for the majority of city`s households.

24.     Since 2004, Lagos' fiscal deficit has widened rapidly, but the debt burden remains
low. With the government committed to addressing the infrastructure gap, capital spending has
increased since 2004 by a factor of almost 12, from N 14 bn to N 178 bn in 2009. At the same
time, recurrent spending has grown by a factor of only 2.5, as the state government implemented
prudent wage policies. The impact of the significant expansion in capital expenditure was also
mitigated by a very substantial increase in revenue, largely driven by a four-fold increase in
internally generated revenue, reflecting comprehensive and far-reaching reforms in tax
administration.8 Overall, with expenditure growing much faster than revenue, the fiscal balance
deteriorated from a balance of N2 bn in 2004 to a deficit of over N 34 bn in 2009 (about 1
percent of GDP), largely financed through loans from commercial banks and recently through
the issuance of domestic bonds. Notwithstanding these developments, Lagos` debt burden has
remained modest and is currently estimated at only 8 percent of state GDP (GSDP). However,
with the deficit rapidly expanding, Lagos` debt burden has been accumulating fast and has
doubled in recent years.

  Lagos` focus on improving internally generated revenue partly reflects the fact that the current revenue allocation formula does not adequately
factor in differences in population and socio-economic indicators. In fact, on a per-capita basis Lagos state receives the lowest level of transfers
within the federation.

Medium-Term outlook and fiscal sustainability

25.    Baseline projections for the period 2008-2018 depict a favorable evolution of the
main fiscal indicators and conclude that the state fiscal framework is sustainable in the
medium term if policies of strict fiscal discipline and debt responsibility, as outlined in
Lagos' reform program, are enforced (see annex). Under the baseline scenario below--which
includes World Bank budget support--debt levels are forecast to stabilize at 3-4 percent of
GSDP, while budget deficits decline. A reduction in debt service is projected starting in 2010, as
commercial debt due in the next few years is partially substituted for concessional World Bank
financing. However, risks to stability of the fiscal outlook remain high. Alternative scenarios
assuming either a more rapid increase in expenditure, lower revenue growth or significantly
higher domestic cost of borrowing indicate that fiscal indicators could easily deteriorate,
especially if internally generated revenue does not improve as much as expected.

26.      Lagos' fiscal dynamics would also become less favorable if its entire deficit financing
has to be covered at more expensive terms due to unavailability of IDA funding. Failure to
secure concessional financing from IDA would substantially increase Lagos` debt-to-revenue
ratio, which would peak at 80 percent in 2012, up from 62 percent in 2009, in spite of an
assumed cut in capital expenditure by 10 percent. Nonetheless, the debt profile would remain
sustainable recovering to about 63 percent of revenue after 2015 and stabilizing at that level.
This scenario indicates that Lagos should make an effort to secure highly concessional loans to
finance its development needs. At the same time, it confirms that the baseline scenario (and
associated fiscal and debt program) is sufficiently robust with respect to fluctuations in cost of
deficit financing.

Intergovernmental relations

27.     The current inter-government arrangements with respect to external debt service
and overall state debt monitoring provide--in principle--adequate controls for state
government spending within limits compatible with overall fiscal sustainability. The federal
government of Nigeria is actively engaged in oversight of sub-national fiscal and borrowing
decisions through a combination of rules-based controls and direct administrative controls
requiring the center to approve borrowing operations and prohibiting sub-national governments
from directly accessing external borrowing. All external borrowing, including lending by
International Financial Institutions, is controlled by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF),
which de facto provides explicit federal guarantees on external credits to states. The FMF
directly participates in the negotiations on such credits and, through the federal DMO, monitors
the overall debt profile of individual states. Federal legislation limits annual debt service
payments to 40 percent of Federation Account statutory allocations, and ties borrowing to
specific investment projects whose feasibility studies are cleared by the National Planning
Commission. Upon effectiveness of state credit agreements, the federal DMO takes on
responsibility for ongoing service payments (both principal and interest). All state external debts
are serviced centrally by the Federal Government, and debt service payments are recovered later
through automatic deductions from the monthly Federation Account transfers to states.

28.     To access the capital market, states must meet additional legal and regulatory
requirements under the Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 2007, the Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations and the listings requirements of the Nigeria and the
Abuja Stock Exchanges. Most notably, the total state debt outstanding and the proposed new
borrowing must not exceed 50 percent of the state`s revenues in the preceding year. As with
other forms of domestic borrowing, states are required to obtain prior approval from the Federal
Government, and to provide an irrevocable letter of authority giving the Accountant General of
the Federation the authority to make deductions at source from the state`s statutory allocation in

                                                                                                12
the event of default by the state on its obligations under the terms of the loan. The state is
required to establish a sinking fund for each loan raised into which periodic contributions are
made for meeting the loan obligations. In the short term, external debtors would be paid by the
Federal Government9, and thereafter, the issue of particular state debts is worked out between the
federal and state governments in the context of the regular inter-governmental fiscal flows using
the irrevocable letter of authority. Importantly, the need for states to obtain prior approval from
the federal government for access to capital markets provides the federal government with the
incentives and powers to limit accumulation of state debts with a view to limiting the risk of state
debt profiles becoming unsustainable.

29.     In addition, the existing system of sharing of oil revenue and of Value-Added Tax
from the Federation Account across the three government levels serves as a major
stabilizer of State finances. Federal transfers are made monthly in a transparent and
predictable way, based on a stable formula10 (Box 1). As a result, most states are able to
predict future inflows of federal transfers with reasonable accuracy. 11 The 2005 introduction of
the oil price based rule for budgeting oil revenues also helped to reduce the volatility in federal
allocations and further improve their predictability. The recent PEFA exercise for Lagos found
that allocations from the Federation Account correspond to a significant degree to the budgeted
amounts.




9
  The recent DSA by the IMF shows that the Federal Government of Nigeria is capable of meeting its obligations.
The government`s capacity to service its debt derives from the current low level of federal public debt, high level of
reserves and a sound fiscal framework that imposes a considerable degree of fiscal discipline on federal budgeting.
10
   The oil revenue sharing formula was last revised in 2002.
11
   The revenue sharing formulas for Value-Added Tax and for oil revenue differ.

                                                                                                                    13
                           Box 1: Revenue allocation in the Federation
The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria places issues related to major taxes such
as taxation of income, profits and gains, customs duties, excise and stamp duties, and road
taxes under the Exclusive Legislative List at the federal level. This also applies to the value
added tax (VAT). The most important state tax is the personal income tax collected by a state
tax authority on individuals deemed to be resident in that state. Table 1 summarizes the tax-
related responsibilities of the FGN and the states in terms of policy decision and collection.

The VAT revenue-sharing arrangement has been defined by law (as opposed to the
Constitution which includes a provision relating to mineral revenues). The proceeds of the
VAT that replaced the states` sales taxes in 1994 are also pooled and redistributed according to
formulas based on principles similar to the ones applicable to the distribution of mineral
revenues. Vertically, the allocations to the FGN, the States, and the LGAs are currently 15%,
50%, and 35% respectively. The current horizontal VAT revenue-sharing formula among the
states is based on weighted criteria, including equality (40%), derivation (50%), and
population (10%). Although the formula reflects the importance that should be attached to the
principle of derivation, the industrial states (Lagos, Rivers, Ogun, Kano), where the bulk of
VAT is collected, consider not to receive a fair share of their internally generated revenue
because 40% of the proceeds are being distributed equally among the states.

           IV.    LAGOS GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND
                           PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

30.     The key strategic priorities of the current Lagos State Government are to create
conditions for sustained growth, employment creation and poverty reduction by reducing
the infrastructure gap, improving the investment climate and strengthening service
delivery. At the core of this strategy are reforms to improve the quality of spending, streamline
bureaucratic processes affecting the business environment and sustain good governance through
inclusive decision-making, improved accountability and transparency, and an emphasis on the
rule of law.

31.    The Ten-Point Agenda (TPA), initiated in 2003, is the basis upon which the Lagos
State government articulates its strategy. The TPA, which builds on the Lagos State
Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (LASEEDS), includes the following 10
focus areas:

       Roads: the objective is to rehabilitate roads in all local government areas and construct
       new roads and bridges.

       Transportation: the objective, articulated in a transport masterplan, is to put in place an
       integrated mass transit program with emphasis on road, rail and water transportation
       services through LAMATA, and public-private sector partnership by strengthening traffic
       management mechanisms, putting in place the first state-run rail services, and stimulating
       private sector investment in ferry services.

       Power & water supply: the objective is to increase power supply through the Lagos IPP
       program and to improve the financial viability of the water company.

       Environment & Physical planning: the objective is to make Lagos a model city-state by
       introducing a community-based waste management system, enforcing the
       implementation of emission control standards, pursuing systematic physical planning for
       sustainable development, and establishing a disaster management agency.

       Shelter: the objective is to ensure provision of affordable mass housing schemes by
       developing a more effective and responsive mortgage market, and developing new
       satellite towns.

       Health: the objective is to improve health services supply through expansion of
       neighborhood clinics, the pursuit of a secondary health program, the deepening of the
       existing blindness prevention program, malaria control with focus on mothers and
       infants, strengthening marine ambulance/emergency medical services, and enhancement
       of medical personnel welfare.

       Education: the main thrust is on building Millennium schools in all local government
       areas, re-engineering and refurbishing primary schools, providing rehabilitation and
       maintenance of existing schools and libraries and making provisions for school furniture

                                                                                                   15
       and equipment. Reviewing the curriculum and including entrepreneurial training, but also
       enhancing teachers` welfare, improving community-based vocational education, are all
       key elements of the State`s education program. Another area of focus in education is the
       enhancement of the state`s capacity to supervise private sector education providers as a
       large percentage of the population receives education services from the private sector.

       Food security: priorities include facilitation of sustainable food production and
       processing, empowerment of farmers/fishermen cooperatives societies, and support for
       strategic preservation and farm settlements development.

       Employment: the objective is to create more jobs by introducing a graduate
       empowerment program, executing infrastructure projects generating new job
       opportunities.

       Revenue enhancement: the objective is to diversify revenue sources, widen the tax base,
       set up effective revenue collection mechanisms, and develop a database of taxpayers.

32.   The state government has made considerable progress in translating the Ten-Point
Agenda into specific action plans in key sectors:

33.      With chronic congestion of the city leading to prohibitive transport times across the
state and adversely affecting the investment climate, cost of doing business and quality of
life, a central component of the government's policy program is the creation of new means
of transportation. Major progress in this area was made when one of the lanes was dedicated
for the exclusive use of a new bus transportation system (Bus Rapid Transport system-BRT).
The BRT has already considerably reduced the transportation times across the city and is
expected to be expanded shortly. The Lekki toll road which will be essential for the operation of
the Lekki Free Trade Zone (FTZ) is the first infrastructure project in Nigeria built as a Public-
Private Partnership (PPP) and is at an advanced stage of construction. In addition, rehabilitation
and construction of jetties, dredging of waterways and other infrastructure has commenced with
a view to creating maritime transportation.

34.    An additional key element of the strategy to further decongest Lagos State is the
creation of satellite estates in suburban and rural communities. In creating these estates,
government provides the land as equity while construction itself is privately funded. The estates
aim at creating new urban centers that will diversify traffic from the current zones of
agglomeration (Victoria Island, Ikoyi and Lekki on the one hand and Ikeja on the other hand).

35.     The state has also embarked on a comprehensive program to protect the
environment. Efforts focus on the greening and beautification of public areas, mitigating the
effects of climate change, stepping up the state`s capacity for waste management, undertaking
slum upgrades and either rehabilitating or tearing down houses that can no longer be sustained,
and rehabilitating existing or constructing new channels to prevent flooding. These interventions
by the government have already begun to improve the quality of life in the city.



                                                                                               16
36.     Lagos government aims at continuously improving the quality of social services and
infrastructure not only to strengthen service delivery and alleviate poverty, but to further
improve taxpayer morale and enhance collection of internally generated revenue. The
government attributes the success in raising revenue to a significant extent to the fact that
taxpayers see the results of their contributions in improved service delivery. The state
government has already upgraded its health care systems by building a diagnostic center and a
new facility for cardiac care, kidney treatment, and other specialized health care centers, creating
new facilities for emergency care, and maintained free health care for children under five,
persons above the age of 60, and free antenatal care for women. In the area of education, an
Education Sector Plan (ESP) has been developed and aims at providing accessible, equitable,
quantitative and qualitative education for all, fostering self-reliance and socioeconomic
development in Lagos.

37.    Lagos has also reformed the judiciary focusing on alternative dispute resolution
(ADR), an improved legal framework aimed at accelerating judicial processes, and
improving the court infrastructure. Also, a People`s Advisory center has been established to
provide citizens with access to information and advice.

38.     A further priority has been to fight crime which used to be a key weakness in Lagos
affecting the investment climate and the perception of the state. The government has
succeeded in creating opportunities for technical and vocational training for delinquent youth
that were involved in organized crime and reintegration efforts continue to be underway. In this
context, it has put in place several programs that educate, equip and empower the youths in
Lagos State. These programs include: (i) a youth farm settlement scheme, (ii) the creation of a
Youth Institute which provides higher level technical skills to graduates of tertiary institutions,
(iii) vocational centres across Lagos State through Ministry of Women affairs in 14 fields, (iv)
establishment of job registration centres in 10 Local Government Areas, (v) creation of about 1
million person-day direct jobs in the transport sector thanks to the road maintenance scheme.
This and the reform of the police were effective in significantly reducing the incidence of crime.

39.     An additional important goal of the Lagos state government is the creation of a new
service-oriented civil service. The government is in the process of taking concrete steps to
improve the responsiveness and accountability of government services, including the imposition
of mandatory processing deadlines, the publication of email addresses and cell phone numbers of
senior civil servants, the dissemination of booklets and manuals explaining government
procedures (including in areas such as land transactions, building permits, tax payments).
Compliance with service standards is reviewed at public meetings attended by the Governor and
other senior civil servants.

40.    Lagos State is aware of the impact of its reforms on the budget and has embarked
on a range of measures to preserve fiscal sustainability. With a view to limiting the direct
budgetary impact of large-scale projects, it has begun placing large infrastructure projects off-
budget through the creation of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV`s) and Public-Private
Partnerships, while paying close attention to the creation of possible contingent liabilities. It also
has continued to improve tax administration with a view to strengthening internally generated


                                                                                                   17
revenue (IGR), in particular Land Use charges which have nearly doubled in recent years12 and
through the integration of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises into the taxpayer net. In
addition, the government has exercised considerable restraint in current expenditure which have
fallen in percent of GDP since 2004, partly on account of prudent wage policies. Reflecting its
commitment to infrastructure development, the government aims to increase the share devoted to
the capital budget to 60 percent of overall expenditure.

41.     The government realizes that implementing its vision critically hinges on measures
to improve the quality of spending and strengthen budget execution. Expenditure planning
needs to be aligned with the government`s strategic priorities, and expenditure execution needs
to ensure that available resources are used effectively and transparently with the highest value for
money. Higher quality of spending and better budget execution will be essential to improve
infrastructure and enhance service delivery. While better infrastructure is one component for a
better investment climate, improving property-related transactions and development permits has
been a key concern for investors in the Cost of Doing Business surveys. Therefore, efforts to
streamline procedures in these areas are at the core of the government`s strategy to create a more
conducive business environment.

Participatory Processes

42.     The TPA and other action plans of the government have emanated from a
participatory planning process (the Lagos Economic Summit or Ehingbeti Forum) that
actively involves the private sector and civil society and meets every year. In addition, the
government has developed a culture of active consultation in the context of the preparation of the
budget, including through the organization of regular meetings involving a wide range of
stakeholders at the local government level as well as the wide discussion of Medium-Term
Sector strategies. The Governor also holds regular meetings with stakeholders to review the
quality of government services and the effectiveness of measures aimed at strengthening service
delivery. Specific focus areas are tax administration and the functioning of agencies
administering land transactions.

                    V.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

A.         Link to the Country Partnership Strategy and to Other Bank Projects in
           Lagos
43.     The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) which was discussed by the Board in July
2009 anticipates state-level DPCs and provides a clear rationale for their use as an
instrument to strengthen governance and the implementation of reforms more generally.
The CPS recommends that state-level DPO`s be used in states that have a relatively good track
record on public sector reforms, a reasonably strong fiduciary system and low debt levels.
Providing reformist states with DPO support could also create incentives for other states to
engage in a policy reform dialogue even if the DPO amounts are relatively modest compared to
the states` other resources. The CPS already identifies Lagos as a lead candidate for a pioneer


12
     In 2009, Lagos has been collecting IGR in the amount of N 12.5 billion a month, up from N 3.7 bn in 2005.

                                                                                                                 18
DPO, given the quality of its PFM-system, the reform-orientation of the state government, the
importance of the state for Nigeria and its financial needs.13
44.      The DPO contributes to a number of key outcomes of the Country Partnership
Strategy. Notably, the DPO`s focus on the investment climate should allow improved
performance on the Doing Business Indicators, one of the CPS outcome indicators measuring
progress towards sustainable growth in the real sector of the economy­a key objective of the
government under the Seven-Point agenda. Also, the DPO supports improvements in auditing
and accounting, budget planning and better procurement which are outcomes under the CPS
pillar for governance for results.

45.     The Bank currently has an outstanding loan portfolio of about $500 million in Lagos
state. Bank projects include FADAMA and commercial agriculture, the Lagos Metropolitan
Development and Governance project (LMDGP) (which focuses on slum upgrading,
infrastructure investment and economic governance), the Lagos Urban Transportation project,
the Lagos Water projects and the Lagos Eko Secondary Education project. The Bank thus has
considerable operational experience in Lagos State through Bank operations, and has contributed
to improvements in areas such as secondary education (teacher training), slum upgrading, and
transportation. The DPO`s focus on fiscal sustainability, quality of spending and budget
execution is complementary to these projects in that progress towards these three policy
objectives will facilitate the creation of systems capable of making the results of these projects
sustainable. IFC`s direct programs to Lagos State include: (i) in partnership with the Bank and
DFID, assisting the state with investment climate reforms, including interventions focused on
improving the environment for housing; and, (ii) exploring the potential to provide investment
and transaction advisory services for public-private partnerships in the provision of infrastructure
and other government services, including potential transaction advisory services for the proposed
concessioning of the Greenfield Lekki International Airport and the Lagos Island General
Hospital, as well as potential investment in the following PPPs: the light railways system project,
Lekki Deepwater Port, Lagos IPP program and Lekki Toll Road.

B.         Coordination with Other Donors

46.     In Nigeria, coordination with donors is taking place in the context of regular
consultations under the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). In the context of CPSII which
was discussed by the Board on July 28, 2009, the partnership between the World Bank and DFID
has been expanded to include the African Development Bank (AfDB) and USAID in line with
the government and CPSCR recommendations to enhance opportunities for donor coordination.
The CPS II partners account for over 80 percent of Nigeria`s development assistance. By
agreeing to a single joint strategy, partners are contributing to increasing development
effectiveness. Partners are also coordinating closely with Nigeria`s other main development
partners, including the UN funds, programs and agencies, Japanese International Cooperation
Agency, the French Agency for International Development, Canadian International Development
Agency and the European Commission.



13
     The CPS` conclusions are buttressed through the Lagos Partnership Strategy which is an annex to the CPS.

                                                                                                                19
47.      In 2004, Nigeria became the first country to benefit from the IMF's Policy Support
Instrument. Performance under the program which focused both on structural and
macroeconomic reforms was good, including in the aftermath of the historic October 2005 debt
relief from the Paris Club and the subsequent London Club deal which resulted in the virtual
elimination of Nigeria`s bilateral and multilateral external debt. Following the expiry of the PSI
in November 2007, Nigeria maintained a close relationship with the IMF, including in the
context of technical assistance on performance-based budgeting, Public-Private partnerships
(PPP`s), tax policy and administration, financial sector reforms and the establishment of a
Sovereign Wealth Fund. IMF and World Bank collaboration is guided by a JMAP and has been
close and effective.

48.     As regards Lagos State, donor support has been expanding rapidly in recent years
and covers public financial management, health, education, slum upgrading and waste
management. DFID's support on capacity-building in the PFM area is directly
complementary to the DPO. Also, DFID support is coordinated with some of the priority areas
under the DPO, in particular procurement and PFM reforms. DFID`s support is provided through
two projects: the State Accountability and Voice Initiative (SAVI) and the State Partnership on
Accountability Responsiveness and Capability (SPARC). SAVI supports citizens` demand for
good governance, in particular by building the capacity of civil society and government to
institute and replicate improved voice and accountability processes in Lagos. SPARC on the
other hand centers on enhancing Lagos State government`s capacity to deliver good governance
through support for policy and strategy development and for public financial management and
civil service reforms. SPARC has already facilitated self-diagnosis covering public financial
management, public service management, policy and strategy and monitoring and evaluation.
SPARC will also assist in providing capacity-building in critical areas supported by the DPO,
especially procurement reform.

49.     Specific capacity-building measures in support of objectives of the DPO are ongoing
or have already been identified in a number of areas. In the procurement area, capacity-
building measures will include comprehensive training programs based on a Procurement
Capacity and Needs assessment to be carried out with DFID support in 2011. In the tax policy
and tax administration areas, an action plan for further strengthening of LIRS and the Lands
Record company will be developed during 2010/11, possibly with support of the Growth,
Employment and Markets in States (GEMS) project, partly co-financed by DFID. Support for the
implementation of the Medium-Term Expenditure framework and Medium-Term Sector
Strategies (MTSS) is being provided under LMDGP. The operationalization of Oracle and full
adoption of a Treasury Single Account is expected to be supported through LMDGP.

50.    In the context of the proposed DPO, the French development agency (Agence
Francaise de Développement) has shown interest in providing programmatic support to
Lagos state government. These plans are at an early stage, but AFD has indicated to closely
collaborate with the World Bank on the design of the operation.




                                                                                               20
C.      Lessons learned from past engagements in Lagos and subnational DPOs
51.     The instrument of the World Bank's past and current support to Lagos has been
mostly a traditional project approach. During the preparation of these projects the Lagos
government and the Bank defined specific project components and interventions and identified a
set of goods and services to be procured under the project to achieve the objectives of the project.
In most cases, these projects were not fully integrated with the State budget.

52.    The existing projects in Lagos State have already been effective in strengthening the
transport system: both the rehabilitation of important transport arteries and the BRT
system have been supported under the Lagos Urban Transportation project. Strengthening
of economic governance through the Medium-Term Expenditure framework and legislative
reform was supported under LMDGP. In addition, effective dialogue on the education sector has
evolved in the context of the Lagos Eko Secondary Education project which was approved by the
Board in May 2009.

53.   The State Government considers that the DPO will effectively support its
comprehensive institutional and policy reform agenda. The broad objectives articulated in the
DPO help catalyze more effective policy implementation and coordination across different
government ministries as well as mobilize capacity-building measures across different
government agencies.

54.     The DPO also makes a deliberate effort at improving service delivery, building on
experience in South Asia where reforms supported through DPO's did not universally
result in the desired improvements in this area. In this context, the DPO spells out the link
between Medium-Term Sector Strategies that have recently been prepared for a number of key
sectors including education and health. The envisaged improvements in expenditure
accountability and transparency will also support the desired strengthening in service delivery
and will be monitored through a set of results indicators.

55.   In addition to the Lagos-specific feedback and experience in South Asia, lessons
from other state level DPO's were drawn from a recent review by the Independent
Evaluation Group, and can be summarized as follows:

        The report on World Bank engagement at the state level (cases of Brazil, India, Nigeria
        and Russia) concludes that Bank engagement at the state level added considerable value
        and that the often higher cost in resource and effort were usually justified by the results.

        The study also advises to be selective and to concentrate lending services on a few states
        to enhance the impact of the state`s program.

        While engagement with high-performing states adds value, the study also recommends an
        increased focus on poorer states because the hoped-for demonstration effect on poor,
        lagging states was usually not materializing and experience shows that it is possible to
        achieve results in the poorest states through persistent work with committed state
        counterparts and strong partnership with the federal government and other donors.

                                                                                                 21
        On the scope of engagement, the study recommends a continued focus on public finance
        management as the core area for state-level work.

D.      Analytical Underpinnings
56.      The Bank and others donors have carried out various studies on Lagos. These
include (i) a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment (PEFA-July 2009); and
(ii) fiduciary assessments of the state`s procurement and financial management systems (August
2009) and a Public Expenditure Review (June 2010). Jointly, the Bank and DFID have also
undertaken a review of the cost of Doing Business under the Investment Climate Program. Table
7 summarizes how recommendations from relevant ESW work informed the design of the DPO.

PEFA Assessment

57.    The recent PEFA assessment which covers the performance of Lagos State's PFM
system over the period 2006 ­ 2008 concludes that the Lagos State Government showed
strong performance in the areas of payroll controls, revenue collection, accounts
preparation, and external auditing. Through Oracle Financials, the state government has
achieved integration of the payroll and nominal rolls. Internal controls to changes on the
                                                                                                               23
personnel database are strong and payroll audits regular. Taxpayers pay directly into Treasury
Bank accounts. Audit reports are timely and cover all governments operations, including non-
budgetary funds and operations of local governments and state-owned enterprises. However, the
PFM system showed particular weaknesses in fiscal discipline, especially in the area of the
credibility of the budget with significant deviations between the approved and the executed
budget. Budget planning and implementation processes are also weak. In particular, planning and
budgeting do not use multiyear forecasts or sector strategies and often do not follow the budget
calendar foreseen by law. Also, budget implementation does not rely on sound cash forecasts and
cash planning and is undermined by the frequent use of cash advances. Moreover, the current
budget and accounts classification system does not conform to COFOG.

Update of procurement assessment

58.     In August 2009, the Bank prepared an update of the 2003 Lagos State Procurement
Assessment report (LSPAR), including a review of the implementation of the action plan
developed in 2003. The update concluded that little progress had been made in implementing
reforms in the procurement area. In particular, the enactment of a new procurement law was
delayed, on account of ongoing revisions.14Also, there is lack of progress towards the
establishment of an institutional and regulatory framework for the implementation of the new
procurement regulations.15 In addition, awarded contracts are not being published and standard
bidding documents have not been adopted.

Cost of doing business study

59.     The Doing Business Report 2011--which is based exclusively on data from Lagos
state-- ranks Nigeria 137th out of 183 economies on the Ease of Doing business. Overall,
infrastructure is still the most critical constraint for businesses in Lagos State. Frequent power
outages and the resultant cost of private generation, poor roads and traffic congestion, lack of
water, and poor port facilities are often cited by investors as the main difficulties for investors
(ICA, 2008). However, increasingly, the regulatory and administrative constraints to investment
compromise the gains made in addressing these big issues. Nigeria performs poorly on almost all
ten indicators, but land transactions and issuance of development permits are by far the worst of
the ten indicators measured by the DB report - Nigeria scores poorly in the area of Registering
Property (ranked 179), and Dealing with Construction Permits (ranked 167), the two DB
indicators most associated with land transactions.

                                         VI.     THE PROPOSED DPC

60.     The proposed First Lagos State Development Policy Credit (LSDPC I) is a first
single-tranche operation in a proposed series of three programmatic operations. It is
embedded in a medium-term program of actions presented in the attached policy matrix (Annex
1) that seeks to boost the state agenda for transformation of the institutional and legal framework
to create the basis for sustained growth and better service delivery. The proposed series of three
programmatic operations to support the reform program, with the current operation as the first,
would be prepared based on sufficient progress made in sustaining the anticipated reform
trajectory. The operations may proceed annually but could also be stretched over a horizon of 4-5
years depending on the speed of program implementation. DPC-1 will lay the foundation for the
subsequent DPC`s which will further develop and build on the progress achieved in DPC-1. The
credit`s development objectives, which would be assessed as part of the series of operations, are
to support the government to build systems and institutions to improve the quality of spending
and to strengthen the investment climate, while maintaining fiscal sustainability.

61.      The Bank's support to the government is being presented under four policy areas:
(i) fiscal sustainability; (ii) budget planning; (iii) budget execution and (iv) investment climate.
Box 2 summarizes the prior actions of the operation, and Box 3 presents key outcome indicators

that will be used to assess the success of the operation. As outlined in greater detail below for
each of the policy areas, the operation builds on key completed actions to strengthen institutions
for budget planning and budget execution, and improving the investment climate. In addition,
given the state context, the operation builds in mechanisms to ensure medium- and long-term
sustainability of public finances in Lagos. These areas and choices all draw on long-term Bank
knowledge of Lagos, reinforced by recent analytic work. They are embedded in a broader donor
agenda that accompanies institutional reforms with capacity building efforts. The selection of
prior actions has followed the good practice principles for conditionality (see Box 4).

A.     Policy Area I: Fiscal sustainability
62.     The DPO supports measures aimed at ensuring that spending plans are within the
ability of the State to raise revenue and keep debt within limits that will not crowd out
poverty- and service-related expenditure by debt service payments. The substantial
improvement in internally generated revenue notwithstanding, Lagos` budget deficit has widened
considerably in recent years leading to a continuous deterioration in debt sustainability
indicators. While Lagos` current debt burden remains manageable, maintaining fiscal
sustainability for Lagos state will hinge on (i) anchoring the budget in a sustainable medium-
term fiscal strategy and (ii) further improving internally generated revenue. In addition, as shown
in the fiscal sustainability annex, concessional financing provided through the DPO will in itself
be a contribution to maintaining the state`s fiscal sustainability by lowering the need for high-
interest capital market financing. The DPO will also indirectly contribute to higher levels of
internally generated revenue through the impact of better infrastructure and a better business
environment on non-oil growth and the tax base. Key outcome indicators under this pillar will be
the consistency of the budget with thresholds identified in Box 3.

Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy

63.    The state government has made progress towards the preparation of a Medium-
Term Fiscal Strategy, Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Medium-Term Sector
Strategies and has an action plan for the completion and full operationalization of this
exercise. However, in 2009, it still lacked a clearly articulated medium-term fiscal strategy that
adequately factors in (i) cost implications of the large-scale public investment program being
planned or undertaken; and (ii) the effect of reforms of revenue administration on internally
generated revenue. As a result, the design of the budget was not anchored in firm analytical
grounds.

64.     As a prior action, government has developed a Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
consistent with debt sustainability and a 2010 budget that is consistent with this Medium-
Term Fiscal Strategy was adopted by the Executive Council. The consistency of the 2010
budget with a medium-term fiscal strategy will allow to better anchor state finances in an
analytical framework that recognizes spending implications of current expenditure choices. It
thereby is a critical element in maintaining Lagos state`s fiscal sustainability. Embedding the
budget preparation process within a sustainable fiscal strategy will also allow improving the
quality of the budget planning process by basing the main parameters on sound macroeconomic
analysis, rather than on ad-hoc assumptions. Also, the 2010 budget includes more realistic

                                                                                                26
projections for revenue and capital expenditure which should allow greater credibility of the
budget going forward and therefore positively impact the quality of cash management. In
particular, both internally generated revenue and capital expenditure in the approved 2010
budget are below those in the 2009 budget which in view of the trend growth in nominal revenue
and capital expenditure as well as the continuous improvement in revenue collection capacity
and project implementation will allow to reduce the deviation of the budget outturn from the
approved budget.16

     Continue publication of contract awards above the threshold stipulated in the procurement law;
     Publication of comprehensive budget execution reports on a timely basis;
     75 percent of publicly awarded contracts use standard bidding documents.
     Variance in expenditure composition does not exceed overall deviation in primary expenditure by more
        than 5 percentage points.

Policy Area IV: Investment Climate
     Time to register property reduced to 30 days in 2010, and 24 days in 2011 from the current average of 82
        days.
     Time to register a mortgage reduced by 50 percent in 2010 and by 80 percent in 2011from the current
        average of 240 days.
     Time to obtain a building permit reduced by 20 percent per year from current 82 days.
     Total number of mortgages registered increased by 10 percent per year from the current level of 454.
     Increase the stock of CofO`s in circulation from current levels of 56,000 by 21,800 in 2010 and by another

                              Box 4: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The government that assumed office quickly embarked upon the formulation of a comprehensive reform program
through the Ten-Point Agenda. Prior actions, benchmarks and triggers derive from the reform agenda developed by
the government, in particular the components aimed at strengthening transparency and accountability through
reforms of the institutional, regulatory and legal framework for PFM reform, the measures to reduce the time for
land transactions and building permits, and the fiscal sustainability framework. The state government has turned to
the World Bank for support to further articulate the reform program and assist its implementation through technical
assistance.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
DFID and the World Bank have engaged closely with government in the development of a coordinated
accountability framework. As described in the text, the support to Lagos is centered on the government`s program,
with the Bank`s CPS being a coordination tool among several key donors. In Lagos, the policy reform agenda
embedded in the policy matrix is closely coordinated with DFID`s technical assistance. DFID and the World Bank
will coordinate closely in the process of updating the policy matrix for future DPO`s which will continue to be led
by Lagos State government, and will also conduct joint reviews of progress.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The DPL focuses on issues of strategic importance, but also on those where the government sees a particular benefit
to availing the resources of the Development Partners to overcome capacity limitations or vested interests. An
example includes the planned operationalization of the Oracle financial system and the simplification of land
transactions and building permits, as well as the strengthening of the procurement framework.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The DPL`s prior actions focus on a few critical actions to strengthen fiscal sustainability, improve budget planning
and execution and enhance the investment climate. As discussed in section IV, the available analytical work
suggests that progress in these areas is critical to realizing the Ten-Point Agenda. Integrated into a broader donor
portfolio, the DPO focuses on high-level systemic and cross-cutting aspects.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
Progress reviews of the policy actions in specific areas and of the operation as a whole will be held regularly with
government officials from ministries and agencies. These reviews will allow the Bank to update the matrix on the
basis of actual and expected performance and to discuss possible remedial measures as well as Bank support. The
reviews will inform the design and timeline for future DPLs.


65.     In 2010 and 2011, the state government intends to further develop the medium-term
fiscal strategy by (i) developing a comprehensive list of planned investments based on the
finalized Medium-Term Sector Strategies (MTSS) that will allow to systematically factor in
the implications for recurrent spending of the proposed investment projects and (ii) assess
possible contingent liabilities from public-private partnerships, concessions and implicit
and explicit guarantees. In this context, the two different models that have been developed for
the State: (i) a spreadsheet by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) aimed at assessing the
sustainability of bond financing; and (ii) a spreadsheet model by the Ministry of Budget and
Economic Planning to be used in determining the fiscal strategy within the MTEF approach will
be harmonized to develop an integrated approach for medium-term fiscal planning. This

                                                                                                                 29
framework will also comprehensively assess possible contingent liabilities arising from public-
private partnerships and identify options for containing their fiscal impact. Systematic screening
of future government contracts for creating new contingent liabilities and agreement on options
to address these contingent liabilities with a view to maintaining fiscal sustainability will be part
of follow-on DPC`s.
Internally generated revenue

66.     With a view to enhancing revenue collection, since 2001, the state's Internal
Revenue Service has been restructured, including through computerization of the service,
the introduction of an Electronic Banking System of revenue collection and monitoring and
the subsequent creation of a more comprehensive taxpayer database. Key factors explaining
the strong increase in IGR are the full use of Electronic Tax Clearance Certificates, the direct
bank lodgment of tax payments by taxpayers, issuance of automated tax receipts as well as
accelerated tax audits of back years. Furthermore, in order to enhance staff productivity, LIRS
has substantially improved infrastructure and created adequate training facilities for staff. In
addition, significant efforts were undertaken to educate taxpayers about relevant tax laws. The
collection of revenue has also been supported by a consulting company (ABC). As a result,
internally generated revenue (IGR) has increased by a factor of 4 since 2004 and Lagos State has
by far the highest share of IGR in total revenue among all states in Nigeria. However, there
continues to be considerable evidence for under-collection, especially on land use charges and
personal income tax. In addition, there is scope for further streamlining tax administration with a
view to easing the burden on the taxpayer to comply with tax liabilities.

67.     The proposed DPL supports the Lagos government's efforts to continue to increase
collections of internally generated revenue. The Lagos State government has finalized the
identification of 600,000 properties and created billable records for most properties. As a result,
the collection of land use charges which already improved from N 400 million per year in 2008
to N 2 billion in 2009 is expected to have reached N 3 billion in 2010 and is targeted to reach N
4.5 billion in 2011. Achieving this revenue target will be helped by (i) increasing land use
charges ­ expected to take place in 2011­ which have been among the lowest in the world; (ii)
the continuous review and control of the taxable property base; and (iii) the enhanced application
of enforcement measures to ensure compliance.18 Other revenue-increasing measures in 2010
include (i) targeted efforts to increase collections from specific professional groups, in particular
the self- employed and enterprises with less than 10 employees; (ii) the introduction of a new
hotel occupancy tax; and (iii) the streamlining of business processes in revenue administration
with a view to reducing the number of required steps, speeding up transactions and making
government departments more customer-friendly; (iv) further improvements in the
implementation of self assessment; and (v) the establishment of new taxpayer offices to facilitate
tax payments.

68.  At end-2010, internally generated revenue stood at about 80 percent of the budgeted
amounts, up from 74 percent in 2009. Although IGR did not grow in real terms, this

18
  In this context, the government is focusing on specific high-value target groups that have not been in full
compliance with the land use charge and also provides innovative signaling for taxpayers that have already complied
to name and shame those that have not.

                                                                                                                30
performance reflected improved collection efficiency given that 75 percent of IGR is income tax
and the income tax base had shrunk significantly in real terms owing to downsizing of the
financial and telecommunications sectors in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2009 and
wage freezes in these sectors.

69.     In 2011, an independent consultant will review LIRS and the land use charge with a
view to developing an action plan for reform of the agencies aimed at further enhancing
revenue collections. Key aspects of the review will be the integration of the informal sector into
the tax-net and options for more effective enforcement of the land use charge and for raising the
rates. Adoption of the action plan will be a trigger for DPO-2.

70.     In 2011, the Lagos State government is planning to further reduce the cost of
revenue collection. Key to reducing the cost of revenue collection is capacity-building at LIRS
and the establishment of a platform allowing real time access to revenue collections which will
reduce dependency on the consulting company (see also pillar 3). Reducing the cost of revenue
collection will lead to a further increase in internally generated revenue.
Outcome Indicators

71.      At the end of the series of operations, the measures proposed for the first DPC and
follow-on operations are intended to keep Lagos's finances sustainable despite a
considerable increase in spending on service delivery for its citizens. To measure whether
this objective has been achieved, the state government bases its assessment of fiscal
sustainability on a range of indicators, including (i) debt service in percent of revenue; (ii) wage
bill in percent of recurrent expenditure; and (iii) deficit in percent of GDP. These indicators are
broadly consistent with those suggested by the Bank`s fiscal sustainability framework for sub-
nationals.19 The Lagos State government aims at limiting the ratio of debt service to revenue to
10 percent in 2010; as well as containing the wage bill to 35 percent of recurrent expenditure and
the deficit to 2 percent of GDP, while targeting an increase in internally generated revenue by 6
percent in 2011 in real terms. Achieving these indicators will be a trigger under the DPO also for
2010 and 2011.20

B.      Policy Area II: Budget planning
72.     The DPC supports a medium-term reform program in the areas of budget planning
that aims to fully align the policy priorities of the government with the executed budget,
and further improve the execution of the capital budget. Currently, sectoral policy priorities
are not sufficiently spelled out and, as a result, the government`s ability to translate policies into
monitorable action is compromised.




19
   That framework includes in addition the operating balance (i.e. revenue minus current expenditure). The
operating balance has been positive in Lagos in the past, and thus meets the Bank`s recommendations.
20
   Preliminary data for 2010 show that these target indicators have been observed.

                                                                                                             31
73.        Key recent achievements of the state government in the area of budget planning include:

                  Timeliness of budget approval: While prior to 2009, MDAs were not notified of
                  their final approved budget for the year until well after the beginning of the new
                  year due to delays in passing the budget, the FY 2009 budget was signed into law
                  by the Governor on 5 January 2009. This allowed timely information to be made
                  available to MDAs for effective planning. While approval by the House of
                  Assembly of the 2010 budget was significantly delayed due to a stand-off between
                  the State Assembly and the government, the 2011 budget was approved at the
                  beginning of 2011.
                  Restructuring of Ministry of Economic Planning and Budgeting: To strengthen
                  its capacity to implement new PFM initiatives, the Government is restructuring and
                  repositioning the Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget (MEPB). In
                  particular, the organizational structure of the MEPB has been revised to establish a
                  new Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) to lead the development of the MTSS and
                  improve both collection and analysis of data on sectoral policies and performance.
                  A Monitoring and Evaluation Unit was also set up which is responsible for
                  improving the reporting on budget execution across the MDA`s. The Budget
                  Division was reorganized in line with the new functional grouping of expenditures
                  and MDAs. Capacity-building programs were introduced for various cadres of
                  financial management staff (accountants, internal auditors, budget specialists).
                  Also, a revised format for budget summary has been adopted which makes the
                  budget presentation more transparent by separating income, expenditure and
                  financing flows.
                  Capital budget readiness requirements: For capital projects to be included in the
                  budget, they need to meet certain readiness requirements, including an
                  environmental impact assessment. The compliance with the check-list has improved
                  in recent years so that execution rates of investment projects have risen from 33
                  percent in 2004 to 70 percent in 2008 and 2009.21 Table 7 illustrates the increased
                  credibility of the budget.




21
     Preliminary data show an execution rate for the capital budget of 75 percent through December 2010.

                                                                                                           32

       Sources: LASG authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

74.     However, there remain considerable shortcomings in the area of budget planning
that affect the quality of spending.

          The absence of Medium-Term Sector strategies that would allow to identify
          expenditure priorities and projects, appraise the costs, associated risks and recurrent
          maintenance needs and assess their impact on economic targets hinders placing
          expenditure decisions in a multi-year context. In addition, in parallel with the
          preparation of MTSS, MDA`s will have to strengthen capacity to analyze and screen
          capital projects.
          MDA`s are not given budget ceilings at the beginning of the budget cycle, so that
          MDA`s have little incentive to prioritize their budget submission in line with their
          medium-term strategies. Instead, MDA`s base their budget submission mostly on
          projections from activities of the previous year which are not fully aligned with budget
          priorities. Hence, the linkage between sector policies and strategies and resource
          allocations is weak.
          Although use of the check-list for the execution of the capital budget has improved the
          execution of the capital budget, weak capacity in line ministries­including the Ministry
          of Public Works which is supposed to support MDA`s in the execution of the budget­
          and lack of availability of qualified contractors continues to affect the capital budget.

75.    To address these shortcomings, the strategy to improve budget planning under the
DPO is based on (i) development of a Medium-Term Sector Strategies and Expenditure
Framework and, (ii) further steps to strengthen the preparation and execution of the capital
budget and (iii) the establishment of sector-specific ceilings based on a macroeconomic
framework as a basis for budget negotiations.

                                                                                                             33
Medium-Term Sector Strategies and Expenditure Framework

76.     With a view to improving the consistency of budget allocations with the strategic
priorities of the government, the government is following a two-step approach: First, the
development of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which will help align
expenditure allocations with the policy priorities of the government. The government plans to
finalize preparation of the MTEF and fully operationalize it.22 Second, the preparation of
Medium-Term Sector strategies which will determine within each sector the relative priorities
that should guide allocations for the sector. These two measures together--both of which are
based on significant stakeholder involvement--will be critical to enhancing the efficiency of
resource use towards the objectives of the government.

77.     As a prior action for the DPO and building on the MTSS for health, education and
environment that have already been finalized, the Lagos government has prepared and
published an additional 7 MTSS for the Ministries of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation,
Justice, Physical Planning & Urban Development, Transportation, Housing, Works and
Infrastructure and Youth Sports & Social Development. The benefits of the adoption of the
MTSS for service delivery are discussed in box 5.

78.     In 2010 and 2011, as part of planned follow-on DPCs, MTSS for the remaining
ministries will be prepared and published. Several lessons have been learnt from the pilot
phase that will be taken into account during the roll out phase. For example, the prioritization
and costing activities during the pilot phase mainly focused on capital projects because of the
Government`s emphasis on infrastructure development. During the roll-out phase, efforts will be
made to ensure that prioritization and costing are not limited to capital projects only, but consider
the operational effectiveness of recurrent budgets as well. At the same time, further
improvements have been adopted in 2010: Specifically, the submission of budget proposals to
the Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget has now been done in line with the agreed MTSS
for the sector. The effectiveness of MTSS will be comprehensively reviewed in 2011.

79.     The MTSS will also be used as a basis for the establishment of key performance
indicators to monitor the quality and the efficiency of service delivery and of capital
expenditure. Key indicators that have been prepared by Lagos State government in
collaboration with the World Bank include the ratio of classroom to pupils, the measle
immunization rate, and the incidence of armed robbery and other crimes. The government is
carrying out a comprehensive impact assessment based on these indicators and will include them
in the budget execution report for 2010.

80.     The MTEF will be fully operationalized. To this end, draft outlines of the MTEF have
been prepared and are discussed within the Ministry of Economic Planning. Also, workshops for
planning and budget officers to explain the need and requirements for the MTEF and training
events are being organized. In this context, a central pool of MTEF experts will be dispatched
across the Budget and Economic planning departments to provide capacity-building for MDA`s.

22
  The Ministry of Economic Planning and Budgeting reported that in 2010 sectoral resource ceilings based on the
MTEF were conveyed to line ministries for the first time before the budget negotiations, and that budget
submissions were organized by priority programs identified in the MTEF.

                                                                                                                  34
81.     A number of institution-building measures aimed at strengthening budget planning
will accompany the further development and implementation of the MTSS, the MTEF and
the medium-term fiscal strategy. In particular, the Economic Intelligence Unit in the Ministry
of Finance which has recently been established is managing the macroeconomic and the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and is overseeing an action plan aimed at fully
operationalizing the MTEF. Also, in 2010 a budget manual was prepared that will ensure that
presentation of budgets is homogeneous across MDA`s and that the content of the budget is
sufficiently aligned with the strategic policy priorities of the government.

Preparation and execution of capital budget

82.     With a view to further improving execution of the capital budget, Lagos State has
established a number of important principles for the design of the capital budget. First, only
capital projects that meet readiness requirements defined by the State Executive Council will be
included in the budget (prior action). These readiness requirements include bills of quantities,
environmental assessments and any other document necessary to prove the preparedness of the
agency to execute the proposed project. Second, projects need to be consistent with priorities
established for each MDA and submissions need to be appropriately prioritized.23 Third,
preference is given to completing existing rather than beginning new projects. Applying these
principles will allow the execution rate of the capital budget to further increase from its current
rate of 70 percent. 24

83.     These efforts aimed at improving the capital budget execution will be complemented
by capacity-building for staff for the analysis and screening of capital expenditure
proposals under the DFID-funded SPARC program. In this context, the Ministry of
Economic Planning and Budgeting intends to deploy specialized budget planning officers to all
MDAs that will have specialized skills in the screening of capital projects. Capacity will be
further enhanced in the Budget Division of the Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget in the
vetting of budget submissions.

Use of resource ceilings

84.    Progress has also been made towards the use of sector-specific resource ceilings to
guide the preparation of the budget. In the context of the preparation of the 2010 budget,
budget ceilings for MDA`s were established based on the macroeconomic framework developed
in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Budgeting and were used as a basis for bilateral
discussions with MDA`s (prior action). However, the ceilings themselves were not
communicated in advance to the MDA`s and the agreement on budgetary envelopes for each
Ministry was largely still the result of a bargaining process. The Ministry of Economic Planning
and Budgeting has further improved the budget planning process in 2010 by communicating
23
   Minutes of bilateral budget discussions with MDA`s show that a number of projects were rejected because they
did not meet these obligations. Also,with a view to ensuring the consistency of projects with the strategic policy
thrust of the state, the State`s Debt Management Office has recently established a unit that conducts appraisal of
investment projects that are above a certain threshold and are of critical importance.

   Preliminary indicate that the execution rate of the capital budget improved to 74 percent in 2010.

                                                                                                                     35
resource ceilings that have been formally adopted by the Executive Council to the MDA`s prior
to the negotiations. These resource ceilings are based both on the macroeconomic framework and
the MTSS.

85.      The use of these ceilings in the budget negotiations enables the Ministry of
Economic Planning and Budgeting to base its negotiating position on a sound
macroeconomic framework, and is therefore an important component of the government`s
strategy to embed the budget in a sustainable fiscal framework. Communicating these ceilings to
MDA`s before the negotiation provides incentives to focus budget planning on the consistency
of the budget with strategic priorities and on detailed planning for budget implementation. As a
result, the quality of spending should improve.

Outcome indicators

86.     At the end of the series of three operations, the government would have established
a sound framework of medium-term frameworks and sector strategies guiding expenditure
allocations; the capital budget would be prepared based on sound principles and its execution
increases; and resource ceiling would be more effectively employed in budget planning and
communicated to MDA`s with a view to focusing MDA`s attention to strategic prioritization of
expenditure allocations and on the completion of projects that have already begun.25 The impact
of these activities would be measured through the following indicators: i) for the effectiveness of
government expenditure to improve based on a set of indicators that has been developed by
Lagos State government in collaboration with the World Bank26; (ii) for capital expenditure to
deviate by an average of 25 percent from the budgeted amount, compared to 30 percent in 2009
and (iii) for internally generated revenue to deviate a maximum of 20 percent from the budgeted
amount.

C.      Policy Area III: Budget execution
87.     Although Lagos state's public financial management capacity ranks among the best
among Nigerian states, a number of inefficiencies in the institutional, regulatory and legal
framework lead to disconnect between the executed and the approved budget and affect the
quality of resource use. The DPO supports a medium-term reform agenda aimed at
strengthening the legal framework and building the institutional capacity to enhance both the
transparency and accountability of expenditure and the government`s ability to execute the
budget in line with its declared policies.

88.    The reform program under the DPO builds on a number of achievements in the
area of budget execution.

25
   Given that actual expenditure usually remains below budgeted expenditure, the purpose of the budget ceilings is
less to promote expenditure discipline in budget execution but to help improve the quality of budget planning.
26
   A range of sectoral indicators has already been identified for the education, transport and roads, health,
environment, and water resources and power sectors that will be monitored through the responsible ministries under
the overall oversight of the recently created M&E unit in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Budgeting. For
example, in the education sector the pupil-classroom ratio and the number of classrooms built or rehabilitated will
be reviewed, while for the health sector immunization rates will be monitored.

                                                                                                                 36
           Introduction of e-governance: The government has partially computerized the public
           financial management system and pays suppliers though direct bank lodgment for a range
           of government services and for tax payments.

           Financial accounting, reporting and auditing: Accounting, reporting, and auditing
           processes have improved recently, and annual financial statements are prepared within
           three months of the year-end and audit reports on the financial statements are submitted
           to the State Assembly in a timely manner27. Also, the coverage of audit reports has
           improved. Financial statements conform to national reporting formats, though these fall
           short of International Public Sector Accounting Standards. The new Internal Audit
           Charter was adopted in 2009 which sets up the nature, role, responsibility, status and
           powers of the Central Internal Audit Department and also outlines the scope of its work.
           Also, the number of state internal auditors has increased and an Internal Control Office
           was established in the Office of the Auditor General, whose core responsibility is to
           report on systemic weaknesses in the state systems of financial control and audit. The
           2008 accounts included a much more detailed presentation of outstanding loans to state
           parastatals. New formats for monitoring revenue and expenditure performance were
           introduced and several monitoring reports were issued in 2009 in the new format to
           reflect on in-year budget implementation. The state government set up an inter-
           ministerial committee on budget tracking whose work has brought about some additional
           improvements in expenditure reporting.

           Debt Management Office: The state Debt Management Office (DMO) has
           introduced quarterly reports to the State Assembly on public debts.

           Payroll control: Payroll control has been strengthened through full integration of the
           payroll and nominal rolls, better internal controls of changes in the personnel database,
           and regular payroll audits.

89.        However, there remain a range of issues that affect budget execution.

           The lack of full operationalization of the Oracle financial management system allows for
           warrants to be issued without cash backing. In addition, the use of unretired cash
           advances draws funds away from approved budget priorities, as budget limits are not
           adhered to. Also, because of weaknesses in cash management and sometimes
           unattainable revenue projections, actual cash funding does not reflect priorities.

           The Chart of Accounts is not fully utilized. The program segment is used to identify only
           capital projects, whereas it could be used to capture the State`s development priorities
           and programs (Ten-point Agenda) so as to allow for a level of disaggregation
           corresponding to the strategic and operational priorities of the government.



27
     Audit reports are issued within three months after a receipt of financial statements

                                                                                                 37
        Progress in the implementation of procurement reforms (as defined by the LSPAR
        Recommendations) has been slow. Although the Bank extended an IDF grant to the
        Lagos State Government for implementing the reforms, the Grant was hardly utilized
        before it expired in November 2008. The main reason for slow progress was the lack of a
        champion in the Lagos State Government to spearhead the reforms.

        Like most States in Nigeria, Lagos State still uses outdated PFM Laws. In 2006, only
        financial regulations were revised with a view to addressing a range of operational
        changes emanating from financial technological advancement that the State is
        undertaking. Also, the Accounting and Procedures Manual ­already updated in 2007­will
        need to be further revised as business processes are re-engineered.

        Although audit reports are being prepared on a regular and timely basis, there is
        inadequate follow-up on audit recommendations both within Ministries and by the State
        Assembly. Also, internal auditing in Lagos is still based on the traditional view as an
        activity of self-imposed internal checks mainly focusing on pre-payment audit and
        financial audit.28 Another shortcoming affecting the integrity and accountability is the
        lack of availability of timely budget execution reports and the lack of compliance of
        financial statements with international accounting standards.

90.     Against this background, the DPO's strategy for improving budget execution
centers on (i) procurement reform; (ii) improvements to the public financial management
system, including through the full operationalization of the Oracle financial management
system and strengthened cash management; (iii) reform of the external and internal audit
systems; and (iv) publication of budget execution reports. The reform program for budget
execution under the DPO is informed by the recent PEFA assessment and the recent integrated
fiduciary assessment.

Procurement reform

91.   The reform of the procurement system under the DPO consists of (i) the adoption of
a modern legal and regulatory framework; and (ii) the creation of institutional capacity to
implement the procurement bill.

92.     As prior action, the Lagos government has re-submitted to the State Assembly the
Procurement Bill that incorporates comments from staff and is in line with best
international practices. Staff comments focused largely on the need to separate implementation
and regulation of procurement, and a sharper delineation of responsibilities between the
regulatory agency on the one hand and the power of the Governor on the other hand. In addition,
staff comments focused on improving the definition of the major procurement principles.



28
  FR 2111: Internal Audit Units in all Ministries/Agencies shall ensure that 100% pre-payment audit of all checked
and passed vouchers is carried out and the vouchers forwarded under security schedule directly to the appropriate
Central Pay Office for payment.

                                                                                                                38
93.      As a further prior action in the procurement area, all contracts (above the threshold
stipulated in the procurement law) that have been awarded since 2007 have been published
on the State Tender Board's web-page, including the contract amount and the name and
address of the firm to which the contract was awarded. This measure has considerably
strengthened the transparency of the procurement process. Following passage of the procurement
bill, the state government will also establish a regulatory agency for procurement and also recruit
an adequate number of procurement officers in each MDA. The required number of procurement
officers will be determined by a Procurement Capacity and Needs assessment to be carried out in
collaboration with DFID which is spearheaded by the Head of Service. In parallel, standard
bidding documents will be prepared and financial regulations adjusted in line with the
procurement act. During 2011, the procurement function will be fully decentralized to MDA`s,
provided the related capacity building efforts have been effective, and a complaints review
mechanism for procurement will be created that should become effective in early 2012. Building
these institutions will create the basis for the effective implementation of the procurement law.
           Box 5: MTSS: Strengthening the link between government spending and service delivery
In late 2009, the Lagos state government prepared a set of Medium Term Sector Strategies (MTSS) for the period
2011 ­ 13 for key sectors as a pilot initiative aimed at strengthening the link between budget spending and public
sector service delivery. It is expected that the MTSS roll-out will be completed in the next two years and that the
strategies will be made more informative as MDAs` capacity is strengthened and more practical experience with
expenditure monitoring and evaluation is being gained. The 2009 MTSS documents are publicly available through
the government website, and the LSG also intends to fully disclose future progress reports related to MTSS
implementation.
The key objective of the MTSS is to spell out prioritized and costed sector strategies aimed at meeting the
government`s medium term goals in the core areas of service delivery. The MTSS therefore supports the attainment
of service delivery outcomes through the identification of specific programs and projects necessary to meet these
outcomes, fully backed-up by adequate budget allocations. In this way, the MTSS intends to push for a gradual shift
in the mentality of the civil service by focusing the operations of government agencies on achieving measurable
output and outcome targets as well as strengthening the accountability of senior managers for delivering the results.
The MTSS emphasizes project supervision, monitoring and reporting on program implementation, areas that had not
received sufficient attention by the Lagos State government.
For instance, the Transport MTSS aims at reducing travel times within Lagos, expanding the mass transit system,
and improving transportation safety. This would be achieved by putting additional resources in several priority
programs, including inter alia (i) upgrading road infrastructure and maintenance, (ii) better integrating water and
land transportation networks through rehabilitation of jetties and dredging of navigable routes, (iii) expanding the
fleet of high capacity buses operating dedicated routes, and (iv) upgrading the traffic management system. Progress
in implementing the MTSS will be monitored through improved data collection on indicators related to the
availability of buses, incidence of traffic accidents, average travel time and household spending on city
transportation.
Other sector strategies also have a focus on particular priority services. The MTSS prepared by the Ministry of
Urban Development emphasizes programs to protect coastal areas against damages associated with ocean surge,
reduce incidence of building collapses and illegal real estate developments, improve infrastructure for small traders
through redevelopment and upgrading of existing retail markets. The MTSS in the housing sector sets priorities in
the areas of public housing construction, infrastructure developments (roads and drainage) that are necessary to
attract additional private investments to the sector, and modernization of the system for title registration which is
critical to develop real estate markets in Lagos. The Ministry of Justice aims at improving access to justice by Lagos
residents, strengthening accountability and transparency within law enforcement, and increasing the efficiency in the
resolution of legal disputes. To achieve these objectives the Ministry intends to proceed with further restructuring of
the court system, install an electronic case management system and other upgrades to IT infrastructure, expand
utilization of ADR mechanisms, prepare a number of new draft laws and invest in retraining of judicial and other
professional staff.


                                                                                                                    39
Public financial management system

   a. Legal framework for public financial management

94.    As a prior action under the DPO, the state government has also submitted to the
state assembly a revised PFM Law which aims at ensuring that all revenue, expenditure,
assets and liabilities of the State are managed efficiently and effectively and provides for
clear assignment of responsibilities to persons entrusted with financial management.
Additionally, the law also specifies in greater detail transparency requirements, such as
information to be provided in budget documents to the public; and also accountabilities for
measures such as publication of the annual financial statements. The PFM law also foresees a
more systematic assessment of contingent liabilities.

   b. Full operationalization of the Oracle Financial system

95.    In 2003, Lagos State acquired the Oracle Financial system to implement an
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). The system is only partially
operational with only the General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Public Sector Budgeting, Fixed
Assets and Human Resources modules fully used. As a result, the benefits from the system are
yet to fully materialize. This situation leads to weaknesses in cash management, lack of full
reconciliation between budget execution reports and financial statements and is a key reason for
the disconnect between the approved and the executed budget. Full operationalization of the
Oracle financial system is at the core of a strategy to enhance transparency and accountability of
resource use and bring about greater credibility of the budget in Lagos State.

96.     Against this background, Lagos State government is developing in a participatory
manner a roll-out plan for Oracle that will be endorsed by the Accountant General and the
Commissioner of Finance. Furthermore as prior action, a platform for real time access to bank
statements has been established to operationalize the Accounts Receivable and Cash
Management modules. Operationalizing the Accounts Receivable module involved capacity-
building measures at commercial banks, facilitated by a new Service Level Agreement between
commercial banks and Lagos state, and the establishment of new transaction codes and reporting
formats. The use of the cash management module required that the State Treasury Office has the
same level of information on available revenue as the consulting company in charge of revenue
collection (ABC). This became possible as a result of the establishment of a platform for real
time access to bank statements allowing more efficient three-way reconciliation between the
commercial banks, ABC and STO to ensure consistency in reported revenue collection, to also
create the basis for more effective cash management.

97.    In the near future, phase II of the implementation of the Oracle system will begin
with the recording of payment vouchers before cheques are issued with a view to ensuring
that all cheques are backed by adequate funds. Furthermore, the Treasury management
module will be operationalized to manage domestic and foreign debt. In addition, the Purchase
Order module will be piloted in the State treasury office and the Ministry of Science and
Technology. Afterwards, the Purchase Order module will be rolled out to all MDA`s and, also
the Inventory and Fixed asset modules will be operationalized. That means that by the end of the

                                                                                               40
third programmatic DPO, the Oracle system will be fully used allowing the timely processing of
transactions with audit trails to hold users accountable for action taken on each transaction.

98.    The roll-out of the Oracle financial system will be accompanied by the training of
super-users in the State Treasury Office and the Ministry of Science and Technology to
support and maintain the system with a view to reducing over-reliance on the Oracle consultants
(Soft Alliance).

     c. Improved cash management to enhance the credibility of the budget

99.     The full operationalization of the Accounts Receivable and the Cash Management
modules will also facilitate an improvement of the cash management process. Notably, the
availability of real-time information on the actual income position of the state makes it possible
for the STO to provide accurate information that is required for MDA`s to develop accurate cash
planning. Based on this, the state government will in 2011 adopt a cash management policy and
train officials in the treasury in the forecasting of cash flows. In 2011, MDA`s are expected to be
able to prepare annual, quarterly and monthly cash plans that are based on revenue and
expenditure seasonality. Furthermore, the State Treasury Office which has already started
rationalizing bank accounts29 to consolidate cash balances for effective cash management is
planning to adopt a Treasury Single Account in 2011.

100. These improvements in cash management that are based on both strengthened
human capacity and technological upgrades will be essential to execute the budget in line
with the budget approved by State Assembly. As a result, the variance in expenditure
composition is expected to not exceed the overall deviation in expenditure composition by more
than 5 percentage points (a PEFA indicator) in any year.

     d. Chart of Accounts (CoA)

101. A robust classification system is needed to allow the tracking of revenue,
expenditure, assets and liabilities for all collecting and spending entities. At present, the
budget classification system is being improved and the coding is being aligned with UN-
supported COFOG system. The next step will be for all entities to use a common multi-
dimensional CoA for budgeting, accounting and reporting.

     e. Publication of budget execution reports

102. Lagos State government is already publishing on a regular basis budget execution
reports. However, the existing reports provide information at a highly aggregated level which is
not sufficiently detailed to effectively monitor budget execution. As part of its commitments
under the DPO, the government has agreed to publish comprehensive and timely in-year budget
execution reports within 30 days of each quarter. These reports include at organizational and

29
  LASG maintains about 200-300 revenue bank accounts in various commercial banks and 11 expenditure bank
accounts. The State Treasury has online access to the bank accounts and is used to ascertain consolidated cash
position before cheques are issued. 6% interest is earned on overnight balances

                                                                                                                 41
functional level the approved annual budget, supplementary budget (if any), allocation to date,
expenditure to date, outstanding commitments, balance on allocation and available budget to
year-end.

External and Internal Audit

103. Although Lagos state ranks relatively high in the area of audit on the PEFA scores,
there are considerable shortcomings in the effectiveness of both external and internal
audits. Under the DPO, the state government has committed to both reforms of the Auditor
General and of the internal audit system. As a prior action, it has resubmitted to the State
Assembly an Audit bill that reflects Bank staff recommendations regarding best practices. Staff
suggestions focused on language to guarantee the independence of the Auditor General; specify a
mandatory mechanism for follow-up on audit recommendations that is reviewed by the Auditor
General; detail responsibilities of staff in the Office of the Auditor General to report to relevant
authorities on fraudulent practices, and ensure that the Auditor General has appropriate
professional and technical qualifications and that audit reports are available to the general public.

104. For DPO-2, the government has committed to undertaking a functional review of
State General Auditor's department aimed at assessing the capacity of the office to
implement the audit bill and to adopt a Development Action Plan (DAP) to build relevant
capacity. The State Government will also update annual manuals, checklists and reporting
formats. Both activities will benefit from support by DFID. In 2011, the state department will
review compliance of the audit reports with International Standards of Auditing which will
ensure that the annual audits are of good quality. These reforms are expected to improve the
state`s ranking on the PEFA score for audit which calls for the clear definition of roles and
responsibilities for submission of audit reports on comprehensive financial statements with focus
on significant and systemic PFM issues for which follow up is taken by the Executive.

105. In the area of internal audit, the Lagos government intends to prepare a
comprehensive internal audit program to cover all operations and activities of the MDA's
with a view to monitoring their efficiency and effectiveness. This will gradually shift the
approach to Risk Based Auditing (RBA) by adopting the COSO30 Enterprise Risk Management
framework. In 2010, the state government intends to establish Audit Committees in the
ministries of Finance, Education, Health, Environment and Works. The Audit Committees are
expected to strengthen the independence, integrity, and effectiveness of government audit
functions by providing independent oversight of the internal and external audit work plans and
results, assessing audit resource needs and mediating the auditor`s relationship with the
respective MDAs. The audit committees will also ensure that any recommended improvements
or corrective actions are addressed and resolved. In 2011, risk-based auditing will be rolled out
across all MDA`s with a view to ensuring (i) conformity to the LASEEDS/ten-point agenda; (ii)
effectiveness and efficiency of operations; (iii) reliability of financial reporting; and (iv)
compliance will all applicable laws and regulations.



30
   Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) has established a common definition of
internal controls, standards, and criteria against which companies and organizations can assess their control systems.

                                                                                                                         42
Outcome indicators

106. At the end of the series of three operations, the government would have established
an institutional, regulatory and legal framework for public financial management, audit
and procurement conducive to greater budget credibility and a transparent and
accountable execution of the budget. The impact of these reforms would be measured through
(i) more effective execution of the budget as measured by a lower variance of expenditure
composition than deviation in primary expenditure; (ii) reconciliation of audited financial
statements with budget execution reports within 30 days starting with the 2010 audited financial
statements; (iii) the number of audits conducted that comply with International Standards of
Auditing; (iv) an increase in audit queries that have been answered; (v) the submission of
comprehensive quarterly budget execution and debt reports to legislation and general public and
(vi) the use of standard bidding documents in 75 percent of government contracts.

D.         Policy Area IV: The quality of the investment climate
107. While some improvements have been made, Lagos' investment climate is still not
conducive to private investment. In addition to shortcomings in physical infrastructure, the
regulatory and administrative framework limits the ability of the private sector to harness
business opportunities and create employment. In this context, shortcomings related to land
transactions and development permits have been identified as particularly critical. The
importance of these two areas reflects the high level of population density and need for new
construction. The DPO supports a medium-term action plan that will address shortcomings in the
investment climate related to land transactions and to obtaining building permits.

108. Since 2007, Lagos has made progress in a number of areas to improve the
investment climate. Some of the key accomplishments include:

                 Enactment of a public-private partnership law and the creation of a management
                 agency31 (within the Governor`s office) to develop public-private partnership policy
                 and regulations that have been instrumental in enabling the private sector to engage
                 in a seamless manner with the government.

                 Enhancing the performance of the judiciary through skills development and
                 developing a rapid response mechanism to deal with violent crime in partnership
                 with the private sector. These actions are designed to make the administration of
                 justice faster, simpler, more efficient and yet more accessible. In addition, Lagos has
                 adopted new High Court rules for civil procedures aimed at expediting dispute
                 resolution (front-loading of evidence, pre-trial hearings, and stricter deadlines for
                 actions). These measures complement the already-existing program to integrate
                 youth prone to crime (including technical and vocational training programs in new
                 Centers for Excellence)

                 Introduction of a fixed schedule for property assessment in an effort to alleviate the
                 burdensome land transfer process.

31
     The chairman of the unit is being hired through a competitive process.

                                                                                                     43
109. However, investors wishing to locate in Lagos remain constrained by lack of
investment land, and where it is available, the cost of transaction is prohibitive, and the
procedures cumbersome. The result is a clogged property market which presents particular
difficulties for potential investors both in locating their businesses, and in collateralizing their
assets. Likewise, the potential of the mortgage market has not been fully exploited, limiting the
potential of the financial sector in Lagos State. The reform program for the investment climate
pillar centers on facilitating land transactions and obtaining development permits.

Land transactions

110. Lagos State government has adopted a comprehensive program to reduce the cost
and time needed to obtain land information. A key action towards this goal is the adoption of
a Land Information System that will offer online electronic title search and hence substantially
reduce the cost and time for investors to obtain land information. As a first step towards such a
Land Information System, the state government has finalized the digitization of all existing
survey records. Also, a Geographic Information System (GIS) has been installed under the
auspices of the Ministry of Science and Technology, and is fully functional, except for
orthophotos. Orthophotos have been fully integrated into the GIS system in early-2011. The GIS
is an essential element towards the adoption of a Land Information system (LIS). A LIS is a data
exchange network which links the digital record systems of agencies of Government which
produce land-related data as part of their mandate.32

111. In 2010, the LIS was implemented on a pilot basis in the Ministries of Science and
Technology, Commerce and Industries, Physical Planning, the Lands Bureau and the
Surveyor General in one or two pilot areas in Lagos with special commercial significance.
In 2011, the LIS is planned to be expanded further. The adoption of a GIS and an LIS are
expected to make it possible to submit applications and process building permits on line, hence
substantially facilitating access to land-related information. Also, e-service centers (starting with
a pilot targeting large developers) in proximity to the client will be established.

112. In addition, Lagos State has embarked on a program to fast-track the approval
procedure for mortgage and for property assignments. In this context, the DPO will support
the strategy designed under the ICP program to simplify property transaction procedures. In
particular, the Lagos government will complete the ongoing process mapping exercise for all
property transactions with a view to reducing the time to complete the registration process.
32
  The LIS is based on the individual parcels of land which, when aggregated, form the land tenure pattern of a state,
city, region, or locality. Schematically, the LIS can be seen as a hub surrounded by a ring of specific attributes that
are attached to a parcel of land (e.g. soil type, land value, electricity supply, land use etc.). These attributes are
linked to the hub which is the core of the LIS. There are three fundamental components of the hub; the land owner
name(s), the land descriptors (e.g. legal land description, street address, map coordinates), and the cadastral map
base or GIS on which the land parcel is plotted. Consequently the existence of the Lagos Enterprise GIS is
particularly useful in the development of a LIS (and vice versa) as both systems rely on the same spatial referencing
framework. For this specific operation, we refer to the Lagos Pilot Land Information System (Pilot LIS) since it will
have an initial smaller number of participating MDAs with the focus on facilitating investment opportunities and
inter-ministerial coordination. In the case of the Lagos pilot LIS, the target MDAs are the Lands Bureau, the office
of the Surveyor General, the Ministries of Physical Planning, of Commerce and of Science of Technology. Once
tested successfully, the model could be expanded into a full LIS covering other stakeholders serving much broader
economic and social objectives such as the Ministries of Environment and the Ministry of Finance.

                                                                                                                    44
Furthermore, the government is planning to move away from the paper-based system and is
currently developing an entirely electronic approval process, the electronic CofO system, which,
in addition to reducing approval time, will promote transparency and predictability in the land
administration systems. Finally, the DPO will also support the ongoing effort to increase access
to mortgage financing by reducing the burden of compliance through a) speeding up approvals of
the Governor`s consent for mortgages; and b) establishing a dedicated mortgage registry.

113. As a prior action, the government has recently implemented the following measures
to streamline approval of land-related transactions:

        a. The delegation of governor's consent to 4 commissioners with a 48 hours
           mandatory consent deadline. Lagos State is one of the few states in Nigeria where
           the issuance of the Governor`s Consent has been delegated. Initially delegated only to
           the Attorney General, recently 3 additional Commissioners have been authorized to
           grant the consent and were also mandated, through an Executive Order of the
           Governor, to grant consent within 48 hours.

        b. The establishment of an Office of the Commissioner for Stamp Duties at the Land
           Bureau. The assessment of Stamp duties, Capital Gains Tax and Personal Income
           Tax are now all completed in the Land Bureau`s newly established Office of the
           Commissioner for Stamp Duties. This measure has decreased the processing time
           from 10 days to 24 hours.

        c. The acceptance of consent applications without evidence of payment of ground
           rents and Personal Income Tax. These payment receipts can now be submitted later
           for verification.

        d. The Executive Order from the Governor for officers to treat all files within 48
           hours. This measure is closely monitored by the Governor who regularly meets with
           staff to discuss service delivery performance.

        e. The doubling of the Accounts Department Account officers for payment
           confirmations for all land transaction registrations through the Lagos State Electronic
           Banking System Manager, reducing the time for payment confirmation from 15 days
           to 5-7 days.33

        f. The Ministerial circular by the Permanent Secretary instructing officers to record
           telephone numbers and email addresses of applicants. This simple measure has
           enabled Land Bureau officers to quickly communicate to applicants any issue related
           to their application files.

        g. The Ministerial circular requesting customers to submit all photocopies of payment
           receipts along with the originals for confirmation. With irregular power supply, this
           measure has reduced the load of photocopying the already ill-equipped Accounts

33
  The team assessed these reduction of processing time by reviewing the Accounts Department file registry and
looking at various batch processing time before and after the staff increase.

                                                                                                                45
           Department was performing on a daily basis ahead of the confirmation step.
           Combined with the increase of staff, the Accounts Department estimates its entire
           processing time (preparation of files and electronic confirmation) has been halved.

       h. The attachment of a checklist to all applications to increase the number of complete
          applications at initial intake. Delays caused by the intake of defective or incomplete
          applications (or  Keep in View approach) were a significant problem. A 2009 study
          by the IFC found that the average suspension time of defective or incomplete
          application was 62 days.
114. Lagos State has also developed a program to improve the security of tenure and
increase the stock of titles in the secondary market by extending registration of titles to
those not yet registered. The government has therefore submitted to the state assembly a law to
consolidate all laws for the registration of titles in Lagos State and for connected matters. The
consolidated law, among other things, provides for the recognition of electronic documents and
processing, makes registration compulsory, and specifies penalties for non-registration. This will
significantly improve registration of titles and CofOs. In addition, in 2010 the conversion of
letters of allotment/allocation to subleases (deeds) for allottees in government housing estates
and the regularization of illegal settlements on government-acquired land further enhanced the
issuance of certificates of occupancy. In 2011, the Executive Council is planning to adopt a
decree to allow the processing of private CofOs without the need to file purchase receipts during
the transfer of land parcels bought in the past. This will facilitate the transfer of title to
landowners who have acquired land in the past but have found it difficult to transfer this title due
to the requirement to provide transaction receipts issued pre-1978 for the original purchase of the
land. These three initiatives combined (coupled with the electronic CofO system) are expected to
increase the stock of CofOs in circulation from 56,000 in 2009 to 106,000 at the end of the DPO.
The expected impact is an increase in economic activity, in the number of land related
transactions and finally in internally generated revenue from land-related transactions.

115. By 2011, Lagos State will also implement a permit tracking system to allow accurate
reporting, management and monitoring of property registration information. The benefits
will be to reduce the time for processing building and land use permits, greater transparency in
the issuance process and better Monitoring and Evaluation of the permit tracking process.

Building and development permits

116. Dealing with building permits is the second most difficult area of the business
environment in Lagos State (ranked 162 in the DB Report 2010). It takes nearly one year
(350 days) to build an average size warehouse in Lagos State, making it one of the most difficult
places to locate and build a warehouse in the world. Most of this delay is spent on connections to
services, including telephone (180 days) and power (270 days) where they exist, and water (7
days) where investors have to dig their own boreholes because there is no reliable water supply.
While connection to services is largely outside the direct control of the LSG, the State
Government has some operational leverage in addressing some aspects of this indicator, in
                                     a
particular the requirement to obtain  development permit from the district offices which takes
82 days largely due to pre-inspection approvals, in addition to other inspections from the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Local Planning Authority. In practice, these
                                                                                                 46
inspections do not take place, and instead provide an opportunity for rent-seeking, and
application of extra-legal procedures. It is important, therefore, to streamline this procedure to
reduce uncertainty for the developer.

117. As a prior action, the Lagos State government has simplified and published new
Building Permit procedures. Specific elements of the new building permit procedure are:

       Elimination of the pre-inspection and the publication and dissemination of all building
       regulations free of charge. The Governor issued in October 2009 an Executive Order
       eliminating the costly pre-inspection step. Developers can now obtain the necessary
       information from the Ministry, without paying the required 50,000 Naira fee, and directly
       proceed with building plans and with development permit approval. In addition, all
       planning regulations can be obtained, free of charge, in the 2009 Lagos State Building
       permit approval handbook.
       The devolution of the approval of development permits down to the district office for
       simple structures. The Governor issued an Executive order to this effect in October 2009.
       The approval level depends on the complexity of the project; for example permits for
       simple 2 stories projects with no Environmenal Impact Assessment can be approved at
       the local district office, while permits for projects of 8 stories or higher are approved by
       the Governor.
       The ministerial order for all district officers to attach pictures of the proposed
       development sites; this simple step has reduced the need for repetitive site inspections
       and fast tracked the permit approval procedure by one week.

118. As a result of these measures, the time to obtain a building permit is expected to fall by
20 percent per year.

119. Lagos state will also automate approval procedures and implement an e-approval
system for the Development permit. In 2011, procedures to obtain building permits are
expected to be further simplified by automating the development permit approval process.
Similar to the proposed registration e-approval system at the Lands Bureau, the Ministry of
Physical Planning will implement in 2011 a development permit e-approval system to allow
accurate reporting and management of approval information and link the system to the pilot LIS
for complete integration of the Land and the Building Permit administrations. Ultimately both
systems will be extended to all district offices and enable developers to obtain all necessary land
use information and building regulation, and subsequently submit electronic applications. These
systems also provide a basis for monitoring reform progress in these activities. This program of
measures which is supported by the Bank under the Investment Climate program for states is
expected to reduce the time for obtaining development permits by a further 20 percent.

Outcome Indicators

120. At the end of the series of three operations, the government would have
substantially simplified the legal and administrative framework for land transactions and
development permits and reduced the cost and time to obtain land information. Key

                                                                                                47
outcome indicators for the investment climate include (i) reduction of time to register property to
24 days in 2011 from the current 82 days; (ii) reduction of time to register a mortgage reduced by
50 percent in 2010 and at least by 80 percent by the end of 2011 from the current average of 240
days; (iii) reduction of the time to obtain building permits by at least 20 percent per year from
the current 82 days34; (iv) an increase in the total number of registered mortgages by 10 percent
per year from 454; and (v) an increase of the stock of CofO`s in circulation from current levels of
56,000 by 21,800 in 2010 and by 28,200 in 2011.

                                     VII.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.         Poverty and Social Impact
121. The proposed operation is not likely to have any significant negative poverty or
social impact on poor or vulnerable people, but is expected to have moderate but significant
positive impacts on poor and vulnerable groups by improving state services and landholding
rights.

122. Lagos currently has a higher poverty rate than the national average, largely as a
result of rural-urban migration that results in slum formation across the city and poses
excessive burden on the available social and physical infrastructure. The DPO`s emphasis on
improving budget planning and execution will reduce leakages and further strengthen the
government`s ability to deliver on key social and infrastructure services, in line with the
intention expressed in the budget document. Notably, the preparation of MTSS in key social
areas such as education and health and the adoption of measures to strengthen budget execution
should substantially strengthen the quality of spending, including in areas of the budget that are
particularly pro-poor. The MTSS spell out strategies in the areas of education, health and
environment that will be driven by key overall objectives such as improving primary education
and health care.

123. The DPO will also indirectly help to improve infrastructure by (i) strengthening
fiscal sustainability; (ii) admitting only capital projects that meet the readiness
requirements or lay over from the previous year and (iii) supporting the preparation of a
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework that will ensure that maintenance expenditure are
fully aligned with the capital budget. The DPO`s program to facilitate land and building
permits will address one of the most important obstacles to doing business in Lagos state and
therefore help to create employment and raise incomes. In addition, the reform of land titling is
not only supporting faster growth, but likely to benefit poorer people who, as experience from
Nigeria and elsewhere shows, are more likely to be disenfranchised of their landholding rights
and associated access to finance as a result of illiteracy and poor governance.

124. The broader poverty impact of the proposed program will be assessed through
General Household Surveys that are carried out on an annual basis and the Nigeria Living

34
   To better assess all reform impacts on the building permit process, the baseline indicator has been created by subtracting the following 2 steps
from the World Bank Doing Business,      Dealing with the building permit indicator: the fixed telephone line connection and the electricity
connection



                                                                                                                                                 48
Standard Measurement Survey 2010. The current NLSMS will allow comparison with the
earlier NLSMS of 2003 and the preceding GHS. More specifically, the impact of the
comprehensive reform of the land market on poverty and income distribution will be assessed
through a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis to be carried out in 2011. Key questions will be to
review the extent to which (i) the change in the price of land possibly triggered by the reforms,
(ii) modifications to the land tenure; and (iii) the expected increase in the number of
development permits will affect the levels and distribution of income in the affected population.

B.     Environmental Aspects
125. As a development policy operation, it is not be possible to ring-fence the
environmental impacts of the Bank's financial support. The policies and measures supported
by the proposed operation could, however, be potentially associated with positive environmental
effects. In particular, support for the Ministry of Environment through a Medium-Term Sector
strategy and the expanded fiscal space resulting from measures to strengthen fiscal sustainability
as well as improved government services in the area of solid waste management and water
supply will help both the quality of environmental spending and its sustainability. The
government is planning to strengthen the enforcement of existing regulations over time in the
context of ongoing capacity-building in the Ministry of Environment. Future policy dialogue in
the context of follow-on DPC`s will aim at fully integrating environmental concerns, especially
through the full operationalization of the MTSS and the compliance with environmental
regulations in business regulatory processes.

C.     Fiduciary Aspects
126. The analytical underpinnings assessing the strength of the PFM systems of Lagos
State ­ LSFAA 2004, LSPAR 2003, PEFA 2009, and Fiduciary Assessment 2009 - conclude
that while the state has better systems of expenditure management and control than most
other states, there are key weaknesses that would require focused attention and
management to uplift the PFM performance of the State. The fiduciary assessment, in
particular, concluded that several inherent control risks could affect the expected outcomes and
benefits of the PFM Reform in Lagos State. These include: weak capacity to implement reforms;
poor budget implementation; weak internal controls; insufficient PFM skills; low level of
independence of the Office of the Auditor General; weak monitoring of parastatals and local
governments; uneven strength of legislative scrutiny of external audit reports; high levels of
extra-budgetary expenditures (impacting weaknesses in fiscal discipline); poor budget
classification system; and lack of transparency in intergovernmental relations. However, as part
of the Government of Lagos State`s commitment to improve accountability in the public
financial management in the State, the following key areas, most of which are supported under
the program, constitute the thrust of the State Government`s reform initiatives: (i) strengthening
the legal and institutional framework for public finance management through the drafting of a
new Financial Management Law, a Procurement Law, an Audit Law, and the reviews of the
Financial Regulations Handbook and the enforcement of compliance; (ii) reinforcing budget
preparation processes through improvements in compliance with its budget calendars as well as
the form, content and substance of the budget documentation; (iii) strengthening and rolling out
the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and of Medium-Term Sector Strategies; (iv)
introducing improved cash planning and monitoring so as to support the budget execution and

                                                                                               49
enhance predictability of expenditure commitments; (v) improving revenue forecasting; (vi)
strengthening public debt management and undertaking regular debt sustainability analysis,
including the inherent fiscal risks associated with state-owned enterprises and local authorities;
(vii) optimizing the utilization of IT-based accounting and financial reporting modules to
enhance accountability and financial monitoring as well as strengthen the integrity of PFM
systems; (viii) improving timelines for rendering draft accounts for audit from the current lag of
6 months to 3 months; (ix) designing measures to strengthen internal and external controls and
the impact of legislative scrutiny.
127. Foreign exchange Control Environment: The IMF conducted a full Safeguards
Assessment of the CBN in 2001 with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement which expired on
October 31, 2001. The assessment, which was completed on November 28, 2001, concluded that
vulnerabilities existed in the areas of financial reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank.
Staff findings and proposed recommendations are reported in the related staff report. No further
safeguards assessment has been conducted. Since then, the CBN`s financial statements have
been audited on an annual basis and the reports rendered timely. The auditors have given
unqualified opinions on the 2007 and 2008 audited financial statements. Nonetheless, given the
absence of a more recent IMF Safeguards Assessment or equivalent information from other
sources relating to the control environment in the CBN, additional fiduciary safeguard measures
will be taken to ensure that the foreign exchange proceeds of the Credit are deposited into a
dedicated foreign exchange account held with the CBN, including an independent audit of the
movement of flows on this account.

128. Overall Fiduciary Environment: The commitment of the Government of Lagos State to
improving its PFM systems is exemplified through its gradual improvements as highlighted in
the analytical work carried out by the Bank, DFID and other partners. While progress has been
achieved in addressing weaknesses, including in the area of public procurement, there remain
significant gaps that would need to be managed to allow for further strengthening of PFM
systems and practices. Some of these efforts are supported under the program but, a sustained
and reinforced commitment of the government is required to achieve the milestones necessary
for establishment of a robust overall fiduciary environment. Notwithstanding the progress made
in the area of PFM reforms, the overall fiduciary risk of this operation is rated high`.

D.     Disbursement and Auditing
129. Credit amount. This Credit is a single-tranche operation embedded in a planned series of
three operations. The first operation is an IDA Credit in the total amount of US$200 million. The
credit would be made available upon effectiveness.

130. Recipient, Program and Financing Agreement: The proposed Credit would be made to
the Federal Republic of Nigeria, represented by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The credit
proceeds would be transferred by the Federal Government to the Government of Lagos State
under the same terms and conditions used for IDA investment loans on-lent by the Federal
Government to a state government. The establishment of such an on-lending agreement shall
constitute a condition of Credit effectiveness. A program agreement between IDA and the
Government of Lagos State, outlining the commitments and obligations of the Government of
Lagos State under the program, shall be negotiated and signed at the same time that the

                                                                                                 50
Financing Agreement for the Credit is negotiated and signed between IDA and the Federal
Republic of Nigeria.

131. Funds flow arrangements: The Government of Nigeria shall identify a dedicated
Foreign Currency Account with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) into which the proceeds of
the credit will be disbursed on a single tranche basis upon credit effectiveness. The account is to
be used exclusively for the proceeds of the Credit and will form part of Federal Republic of
Nigeria`s foreign exchange reserves. The funds in the Account will, within two working days, be
transferred into a dedicated account of the Government of Lagos State, to be established with the
CBN. The funds transferred into the dedicated Foreign Currency Account of the Government of
Lagos State with the CBN will form part of the Consolidated Fund Account of the Government
of Lagos State and will be used to finance the budgeted expenditures of the Government of
Lagos State. The account is to be used exclusively for the proceeds of the Credit. The
Government of Lagos State will make withdrawals from these accounts either directly for US$
denominated budgetary expenditure, or transfer the resources in Foreign Currency and/or local
currency to dedicated accounts it maintains with any commercial bank that has met the stress test
conducted by the CBN35 to finance budgeted expenditures in local currency. The dedicated
accounts and the transactions therein will be recorded in the Government of Lagos State's budget
management and accounting system.

132. Disbursements: Disbursements and/or withdrawals from the designated Foreign
Currency Account of the Government of Lagos State held with the CBN, as well as the
designated Local or Foreign Currency Accounts of the Government of Lagos State held with
commercial banks shall not be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement
requirement shall be needed. The proceeds of the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance
expenditures in the negative list as defined in Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement. If any
portion of the Credit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule of
the Financing Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA,
refund an amount equal to the amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA
upon such request shall be cancelled from the credit.

133. Assurance Requirements: Due to the fiduciary risks associated with the program,
additional fiduciary arrangements shall apply to this operation. An audit of the flows in and out
of the dedicated Foreign Currency Account of the Government of Lagos State held with the CBN
as well as the dedicated Accounts (Foreign Currency and Local Currency) to be established with
any of the Government of Lagos State`s commercial banks will be carried out by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA within 4 months after the end of each fiscal year (and until such time
that the balances in the accounts reach zero), and the audit report shall be submitted to IDA
within 6 months of the end of each relevant fiscal year. The Terms of Reference of the audit have
been agreed at negotiation and include: (a) with respect to the Foreign Currency Account held
with the CBN, a full assurance that the withdrawals from the account were indeed (i) used to
finance regular and legitimate budgetary expenditures of the Government of Lagos State (if they
represented direct payments) and these are reflected in the budget management and accounting
records of the Government of Lagos State, and/or (ii) transferred in foreign or local currency to

35
  The stress tests conducted by CBN in 2009 included a review of the state of capital adequacy, liquidity and
corporate governance.

                                                                                                                51
the dedicated accounts established by the Government of Lagos State in any of the commercial
banks; and (b) with respect to the dedicated Account(s) held with any of the three Commercial
Banks, a full assurance that the withdrawals from the account(s) were indeed used to finance
regular and legitimate budgetary expenditures of the Government of Lagos State and these are
reflected in the budget management and accounting records of the Government of Lagos State.
Within 30 days of disbursement of the Credit by IDA the Lagos State Commissioner of Finance,
jointly with the Auditor General, shall also provide a written confirmation to IDA certifying the
receipt of the transfer of the Credit by the CBN into the Government of Lagos State`s Foreign
Currency Account held with CBN.

E.      Risks and Mitigation
134. There are four main risks potentially associated with the program as follows: (i)
macroeconomic; ii) state risk; iii) country risk; and (iv) governance risk. Although mitigation
measures are being undertaken for each area, not all risks can be fully addressed. The design of
the operation as a single tranche operation embedded in a planned set of three operations will
allow to assess the riskiness of the envisaged operations and the adequacy of the planned
measures to address these risks.
     Macroeconomic Risk: Risks to the program could arise from a fall in world oil prices or
     lower-than-projected increase in non-oil revenue. To mitigate this risk, the framework
     underlying the operation makes conservative assumptions on non-oil growth and increases in
     non-oil revenue that are below the historical record. In addition, the oil-price based fiscal rule
     and macroeconomic stability could be undermined by continued ad-hoc withdrawals
     prompted by pressure from states. The government is working to create a Sovereign Wealth
     Fund, with both investment and stabilization objectives, that would help embed counter-
     cyclical fiscal policy in law.
     State Risk: The leadership of Governor Fashola since 2007 has been instrumental in fast-
     tracking Lagos` reform process. However, progress still needs to be deepened considerably.
     Addressing shortcomings in the public financial management and procurement system will
     require strong leadership. The state risk is expected to be mitigated by the various measures
     to empower civil society and strengthen demand for demand for good governance being
     undertaken by the state government. Also, the catalytic effect of the LDPO on coordination
     and cohesiveness of reforms will help improve implementation.
     Country risk: Lagos` reforms could also be affected by a general slowdown in reform or
     reversal at the level of the federal government, especially in the context of the electoral
     process. Factors that may mitigate this risk include the growing importance of an emerging
     middle class that has benefited from economic growth resulting from reforms; and the
     relatively good relationship and close policy dialogue established with the Bank.
     Governance Risk: Although significant improvements have been made in the public
     financial management system in Lagos, transparency and accountability of resources could
     still be further enhanced. The state has demonstrated strong reform commitment through
     implementation of reforms in public financial management, such as the operationalization of
     several components of the Integrated Financial Management System and through the ongoing
     procurement reform process.

                         Annex 3: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis (FSA)

                                        A.      Introduction

1.      Maintaining fiscal stability and debt sustainability is a growing challenge in the
development process of Lagos State. With development needs far exceeding fiscal revenues, the
State fiscal balance position has deteriorated sharply over the past four years, from a surplus of
0.1 percent of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2004, to a deficit of -1.2 percent in 2008
and -0.7 percent in 2009. Continuous budget deficits have resulted in rapid accumulation of
public debt. Debt stock as a percentage of total Government revenue rose from 37 percent in
2006 to 62 percent in 2009, above the statutory ceiling of 50 percent. Debt stock as a percentage
of GSDP rose from 1.5 percent in 2006 to 3.5 percent in 2009.

2.      Moving towards a sustainable fiscal path by making necessary policy adjustments is at
the core of the government`s fiscal adjustment program. LSG's fiscal adjustment program for the
next three years aims at broadening and deepening the reforms already introduced under its PFM
and revenue reform programs. The expected outcomes of the program are: (i) stabilization of the




                                                                                                           73
key debt ratios, such as debt-to-GSDP and debt service-to-revenue, which would require a
significant reduction in the fiscal deficit; (ii) change in the composition of expenditure markedly
towards growth-enhancing expenditure and improve its management; and (iii) strengthening
revenue mobilization by broadening the tax base, administrative improvements and stronger
efforts at reducing collection costs. The specific policy measures to attain these objectives
include (i) the adoption of and adherence to the Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), (ii)
improvements in expenditure management; and (iii) preparation and implementation of a
property tax reform plan.

3.       Baseline projections for the period 2009-2018 depict a favorable evolution of the main
fiscal indicators. Debt levels are forecast to stabilize at 3 percent of GSDP while annual budget
deficits decline. A reduction in debt service pressure beginning in 2012 is projected, as
commercial debt due in the next few years is partially substituted for concessional World Bank
financing. However, risks to stability of the fiscal outlook remain high. Alternative scenarios
indicate that fiscal indicators are highly sensitive to a more rapid increase in expenditures and
lower revenue growth than under the baseline scenario. The FSA concludes that the state fiscal
framework is sustainable in the medium-term if policies of strict fiscal discipline and debt
responsibility, as outlined in the LSG reform program, are enforced.

4.      This annex consists of five sections, following this introduction. Section B describes
Nigeria`s sub-national borrowing framework. Section C summarizes the historical context of the
fiscal performance of Lagos State for the period 2003-2009. Section D describes the assumptions
underlying the baseline scenario and presents the evolution of key fiscal and debt indicators
under this scenario till 2018. Section E reports the results of a sensitivity analysis to illustrate the
effects of changes in the determinants of fiscal outcomes. Finally, Section F presents the main
conclusions of the analysis.




                                                                                                     73
                        B.      Nigeria's sub national borrowing framework

5.     The federal government of Nigeria is actively engaged in oversight of sub-national fiscal
and borrowing decisions through a combination of rules-based controls and direct administrative
controls requiring the center to approve borrowing operations and prohibiting sub-national
governments from directly accessing external borrowing.

6.      All external borrowing, including IFIs` lending, is controlled by the Federal Ministry of
Finance (FMF), which de facto provides explicit federal guarantees on external credits to states.
The FMF directly participates in the negotiations on such credits and, through the federal DMO,
monitors the overall debt profile of individual states. Federal legislation limits annual external
debt service payments to 40 percent of federation account statutory allocations, and ties
borrowing to specific investment projects whose feasibility studies are cleared by the National
Planning Commission. Upon effectiveness of state credit agreements, the federal DMO takes on
responsibility for ongoing service payments (both principal and interest). All state external debts
are serviced centrally by the Federal Government, and debt service payments are recovered later
through automatic deductions from the monthly Federation Account transfers to states.

7.      To access the capital market, states must meet additional legal and regulatory
requirements under the Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 2007, the Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations and the listings requirements of the Nigeria and the Abuja Stock
Exchanges. To issue bonds, states are required to obtain prior approval from the Federal
Government, and to provide an irrevocable letter of authority giving the Accountant General of
the Federation the authority to make deductions at source from the state`s statutory allocation in
the event of default by the state on its obligations. The regulations for state borrowing from
commercial banks are less restrictive. Still states are required to establish a sinking fund for each
loan raised into which periodic contributions are made for meeting the loan obligations. There
are also federal disclosure requirements in place with respect to state borrowing from
commercial banks. Most notably, the total state debt outstanding and the proposed new
borrowing should not exceed 50 percent of the state`s revenues in the preceding year.

8.      Overall, the current inter-government arrangements with respect to external debt service
and overall state debt monitoring provide--in principal--adequate controls for state
governments` spending within limits compatible with overall fiscal sustainability. This is
effectively achieved through the federal guarantee mechanism, which ensures oversight of all
external borrowing. The mechanism also reduces the general risk of debt default by states. In the
short term, external debtors would be paid by the Federal Government39, and thereafter, the issue
of particular state debts would be worked out between the federal and state governments through
regular inter-governmental fiscal flows. In the long term, and much more importantly, the
regulatory framework provides the Federal Government with incentives and powers to limit
accumulations of state debts and use various safeguards to limit the risk of state debt profiles
becoming unsustainable.



39
   The 2009 joint World Bank-IMF DSA indicates that the Federal Government of Nigeria is considered at a low
risk of debt distress.

                                                                                                               74
9.       In addition, the existing system of oil revenue sharing (Federation Account) across the
three government levels serves as a major stabilizer of state finances. Federal transfers are made
monthly in a transparent and predictable way, based on a stable formula40. As a result, most
states are able to predict future inflows of federal transfers with reasonable accuracy. The 2005
introduction of the oil price based rule for budgeting oil revenues also helped to reduce the
volatility in federal allocations and further improve their predictability.

                           C.       Evolution of Lagos State Finances, 2003-2009

10.     Over the last few years, the fiscal performance of Lagos State has been marked by both
revenue and expenditure expansion. Total revenues grew at an average real rate of 18% over the
period of 2003-2009, reflecting in part, high world oil prices and increased federal transfers, but
more importantly, a substantial increase in IGR. Total IGR collections in real terms more than
tripled between 2003 and 2009, rising from 2.4 percent to 4.1 percent of GSDP. At the same
time, there has been a considerable increase in investment expenditure, from Naira 9 billion in
2003, to about Naira 178 billion in 2009. Overall, total Government expenditures have risen
from 4 percent of GSDP to 6.4 percent (See Table 1.4).

11.      The fiscal position of Lagos state government shifted from a surplus of 0.5 percent in
2003 to a deficit of 1.2 and 0.7 percent of GSDP in 2008 and 2009. The sizeable increase in the
fiscal deficit was financed by borrowing, both domestic and external. Debt levels rose sharply in
2007-09, following their decline in 2006, which was the result of the debt reduction deal secured
by Nigeria in October 2005 with the Paris Club. Current data (as of the end of 2009) on Lagos
state debt show that, outstanding debt totaled N 168 billion representing 3.5% of GSDP. In
terms of its composition, domestic debt as a share of total debt increased from 38 percent in 2005
to 68 percent in 2009, while the share of external debt fell from 62 percent to 32 percent over the
same period. The shift in debt structure was largely on account of the fast accumulation of
domestic debt, as well as external debt relief.

12.    Lagos State Government has met only partially the debt level requirements of Nigeria`s
Investment and Securities Act. The debt stock to state revenue ratio, which under the Investment
and Securities Act should be lower than 50 percent, rose from 37 percent in 2006 to 62 percent in
2009. However, the state has been in full compliance with the external debt service indicator
limit.

13.     The budget summary in Table 1.4 and above estimates of debt burden (debt-to-revenue
ratio) have been developed in line with the established standards of budget presentation in
Nigeria and are consistent with the thrust of federal sub-national Debt Guidelines, both of which
                         net
utilize the concept of  federal transfers. This reflects the fact that traditionally federal
transfers are accounted in Nigeria`s state budgets net of withholdings related to the cost of
external debt service which remains off-budget. Such accounting convention results in biases:
total debt service costs are underestimated in official budgets and, therefore, the actual debt
burden-to-revenue ratio is overestimated relative to the situation if gross state revenues would
had been used. But in the case of Lagos these biases are insignificant, given the modest amount
of external debt payments in Lagos, and respectively the low levels of withholdings. E.g. the

40
     The revenue sharing formula was last revised in 2002.

                                                                                                75
annual size of external debt interest payments amounted to less than 4% of interest payments on
domestic debt in 2008-09.

14.     The current breach of the debt-revenue threshold is not considered a likely threat to long-
run fiscal sustainability of LSG, given the broader reforms aimed at realigning major
expenditures in support of economic growth, maximizing revenue potential, and increasing the
state`s ability to service debt. Currently, due to availability of low cost financing (IDA), total
debt service obligations remain below 10 percent of annual revenue, the State has maintained a
significant operating surplus41 which has risen 8-fold since 2003. New borrowing has therefore
been limited to financing capital as opposed to current expenditure, hence enhancing the
productive capacity of the state economy. Moreover, the rapid growth in revenues is expected to
be sustained, reflecting the significant scope to improve performance of tax revenue in the
medium to long term, as tax reforms are deepened. The combination of these factors, in view of
this FSA, provides Lagos with relatively more room to increase its debt-revenue ratio, up to 50
percentage points beyond the existing statutory limit, without compromising its fiscal
sustainability.

15.      The Lagos state government has accumulated some contingent liabilities that remain to
be fully assessed. The full scale of respective risks remains unclear as the LSG is currently in the
process of assessing the scope of these liabilities and how to address them. Once the assessment
has been completed, the government is expected to take appropriate measures within its broader
medium-term fiscal strategy. There are three main types of contingent liabilities in Lagos. First,
several large state investment projects have been undertaken on a PPP-basis and have been
funded through issuance of state payment orders (ISPO). By 2011, the Government is expected
to develop an appropriate institutional and organizational framework for analyzing contingent
liabilities associated with PPPs and for monitoring these risks over their lifecycle. Second, there
are contingent liabilities in Lagos related to unfunded pension benefits (estimated at N160 bn).
The costs of financing these liabilities are by now fully assessed and they are reflected in the
government`s fiscal framework and should average N5 bn -7 bn over the medium term, peaking
at about N12 bn in 2015 and declining afterwards. Third, there are debts of state parastatals,
which are currently estimated at a magnitude of N1 bn and do not represent a significant fiscal
risk. Parastatals are monitored by their respective line ministries and by the Ministry of Finance.
All borrowing by both the parastatals and local governments is required to be approved and
guaranteed by the state (this responsibility lies with the State DMO). Currently, most of these
entities are reported to be debt free: according to the State DMO, there are currently no state-
guaranteed loans to any state corporation or Local Government. Still further tightening of
parastatals` supervision and reporting arrangements would be needed.

                 D.       Projected Fiscal Trends under the Base Case, 2010-2018
16.     Assumptions underlying fiscal projections in this FSA are broadly in line with those
recently used by the IMF team in its macroeconomic monitoring of Nigeria as well as with the
assumptions utilized by the federal Debt Management Office (DMO) in its recent debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) of the entire national debt.

41
  Operating surplus is defined as the amount of current revenues net of current expenditure (such as wages, pension
outlays, subsidies, transfers, and operation and maintenance).

                                                                                                                 76
17.      The main assumptions of the baseline scenario are as follows (Table 1.1):
         A considerable recovery in Nigeria`s oil production after 2011, to reach an average of 2.5
         mn bpd, while the oil price remains in the range of $75-80 per barrel.
         Average annual real growth of 6 percent over the medium term. Improved
         macroeconomic management of the Nigerian economy and higher oil revenues would
         mean overall better economic growth prospects for Nigeria and Lagos state in particular.
         The gradual decline in inflation from its 2008 level to single-digit levels to a medium
         term average of 8.5 percent.
         Real interest rates on domestic borrowing will decline gradually but remain above 4%. In
         combination with relatively high inflation, nominal lending rates will therefore remain
         within the range of 10-14%. The drivers for this decline relate to the ongoing banking
         sector reforms, high level of competition in banking, declining political risks, and an
         expected significant entry of foreign banks to the sector.
         Recovery in oil revenues, supported by responsible macroeconomic policies of the
         federal government, will result in real appreciation of the Naira, at the rate of about 4%
         per annum after 2012.
         The Lagos state government will continue with the recent revenue reform initiatives to
         strengthen IGR collection capacity. Average growth in IGR is therefore assumed to
         exceed 6% per annum in real terms, reflecting both stable economic growth as well as
         further improvements in tax administration. The current level of state and local tax
         burden is quite modest and provides considerable room for further improvements in tax
         collection.
         The LSG will continue with steady implementation of all existing IDA credits (about
         $USD 445 mn in outstanding commitments as of September 2009). It is assumed that
         these loans will be fully disbursed over the next 4-5 years, thus raising the external debt
         stock of LSG considerably. However, this is not expected to create serious risks for debt
         sustainability given the large grant element of IDA credits. Real appreciation of the Naira
         would further reduce relative costs of IDA borrowing denominated in foreign currency.
         Over the next two years (by May 2012) the LSG will complete its repayments of several
         old IBRD loans (signed in 1990-91), resulting in marginal improvements to the current
         debt profile. Outstanding total IBRD loan balance as of September 2009 was less than
         US$ 3 mn (at the average interest rate of 6.5%)42.
         New borrowing from IDA will be limited to budget support operations disbursed in 2010-
         12 with annual disbursements in the range of $200 mn. These new loans will be directly
         linked to LSG deficit financing and explicitly reflected in the state budget.
         The outstanding deficit (after IDA budget support) will be financed locally through a
         combination of commercial bank borrowing and local bond issuing. All such borrowing
         is assumed to take place at prevailing market terms.


42
  Due to its size, the current debt service costs of the IBRD portfolio are insignificant relative to the service of IDA
credits despite that the IDA credits are much less costly.

                                                                                                                      77

18. Under these assumptions, the Lagos state budget is expected to expand considerably over
the medium term. Total budget expenditures in 2015 would be 24% above 2008 levels in real
terms. The baseline scenario assumes that budget investment spending would increase from
about N161 bn in 2008 to N267 bn in 2012 and to N385 bn in 2015. Personnel costs would
amount to 13.7% of total budget costs and 35% of total recurrent costs in 2012.

19. With strong growth in IGR, combined with concessional IDA financing, LSG would be
able to afford a substantial expansion in its public investment program. Overall government
revenue would grow by 51% between 2008 and 2015, in real terms, driven by growth in
internally generated revenues. By 2015, it is projected that LSG own revenues will amount to
72% of total budget revenue, while the share of federal transfers in total revenues would decline
from 36% in 2008 to 28% in 2015.

20. Financing provided by IDA in 2010-12 would amount to over two thirds of the total
deficit financing during that period. This would greatly reduce the overall costs of state
borrowing and result in broad improvements in the overall state debt profile. The share of
external debt in the total debt of LSG would steadily rise from 32 percent in 2009 to 78 percent
on 2015.

21. The government program suggests that Lagos state would cover its additional financing
needs through a balanced borrowing strategy supported by the DPO, in which additional deficit
financing would be split between external (IDA) and domestic market sources. It is worth
noting that in the case of Lagos such a considerable expansion in external debt does not result in
a significant increase in the exchange risk. The exchange risk is in fact rather modest because a
significant portion of state revenues (federal transfers) are based on the country`s oil export
proceeds and as such are USD denominated. Thus, a shift towards a balanced portfolio of
external and domestic debt in the case of Lagos well reflects the currency composition of its
regular revenue inflows and therefore would help the state to manage its currency risks in a

                                                                                               78
 more effective way. At the same time, it is important to highlight that if additional IDA funding
 is unavailable, then the LSG will be forced to cut its rate of expansion in capital spending to
 remain within the fiscal sustainability limits, and thus the state`s development objectives in
                                                                                  no
 terms of non-oil growth are unlikely to be achieved. This is reflected in the  IDA scenario
 in the FSA analysis.

 22. Given these assumptions, the overall state fiscal framework (Table 1.3) is considered to
 be sustainable in the medium term.43 Projected fiscal soundness under the baseline scenario is
 reflected in trends of fiscal and debt indicators, which remain at manageable levels over the
 projected period. Lagos` debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at about 4.4 percent in 2011 and
 decline thereafter to 3 percent in 2018. The debt-to-revenue ratio (interest payment only)44 is
 also forecast to decline, stabilizing at an average of 50 percent of total state revenue from 2015
 onward. The debt service-to-revenue ratio would remain below 10 percent throughout the
 forecast period and would remain below 5 percent after 2012. Operating balances would stay
 positive for the entire period (Table 1.2). Personnel-related costs (wages and pensions) are
 expected to stay below 15% of the total budget spending.

 23. Budget deficits are expected to decline. The baseline scenario shows that the LSG would
 incur a considerable budget deficit during the period of 2010-12, at an average level of about
 N30 bn a year. The deficit would be reduced considerably in 2012, and it is expected that the
 government would run a balanced budget in 2013. In relative terms, the baseline scenario
 outlined here assumes a significant fiscal adjustment effort, with the deficit as percent of total
 government spending being reduced from 11% in 2009 to 3.4% in 2012.

   Total debt service, including both interest and principal on medium- and ling-term debt, would decline from the

                                                                                                                     79
                                       E.     Risk Analysis

24.      Using the above scenario, which assumes availability of World Bank budget support, as a
baseline, several alternative scenarios were examined. These alternative scenarios are designed
to illustrate the impact of the following set of core risks on the future financial performance of
Lagos State Government:

       failure to sustain the pace of IGR improvements;
       decline in oil revenues and respective federal transfers;
       failure to maintain strict control over growth in state expenditures;
       much higher costs of domestic borrowing; and
       inability to secure IDA budget support, thus switching to alternative, more expensive
       deficit financing in 2010-12

25.     Main differences in assumptions used to develop the alternative scenarios are reflected in
Table 1.5. Table 1.6 presents the main results of our risk analysis in terms of different trends in
core fiscal and debt indicators. Figure 1.1 presents the same set of results as a diagram.

26.     Lower internal revenue growth would result in unsustainable fiscal dynamics, reflected in
the steady deterioration of fiscal indicators. The revenue-adjusted alternative scenario, which
assumes a 50 percentage points decline in rates of revenue growth outlined in the baseline,
implies substantial worsening in all debt indicators (despite assumed lower investment levels).
Under this scenario, the debt to revenue ratio would be growing steadily to reach 115 percent in
2018, while the debt service ratio would gain 3 percentage points. This scenario highlights the
importance of maintaining momentum in the implementation of tax revenue reforms to keep
Lagos on a sustainable debt path.

27.     Debt indicators would deteriorate relative to the baseline under the expansionary fiscal
policy scenario, where annual growth in real non-interest recurrent expenditures is 150 percent
higher from 2010 onward and investment levels are lower by 10%. The debt-to-GDP ratio would
climb to 6 percent by 2018. The debt to revenue ratio would follow an upward path reaching 118
percent in 2018. This underscores the importance of phasing the implementation of the ambitious
PIP, selecting and investing only in projects with a high rate of return, while keeping recurrent
spending under control and undertaking PEM reforms to set the stage for efficiency gains
alongside expenditure growth.

28.     A prolonged decline in oil prices would result in unsustainable fiscal indicators relative to
the base case. A drop in oil prices to $40 per barrel relative to the baseline would double Lagos`
debt-to-revenue ratio from 62 percent in 2009 to 130 percent in 2015. Stability of the debt profile
could not be maintained in this scenario beyond 2015 even at the cost of considerable
compression (by 20%) in the budget investment program. This scenario highlights further the
importance of improving the non-oil tax collections in order to reduce long-term dependence on
volatile oil revenues. It also points to the constraints of oil dependence: in the short to medium
term LSG`s investment plans would have to be scaled down in a case of prolonged period of low
oil prices.

                                                                                                  80
29.     The three alternative scenarios discussed above are clearly unsustainable with both debt-
to-revenue ratios showing a stable growing trend. It is worth noting that this steady debt profile
deterioration in these scenarios would take place although all of them provide for much less
aggressive growth in budget investments.

30.     In the scenario with the higher interest rates the state`s debt dynamics marginally
deteriorate but remain sustainable. Our alternative interest rate assumption provides for a real
interest rate that is 4 pp higher than in the base case for each year, i.e. there is no decline in real
interest rates during the period relative to its actual 2009 level. In this case, the debt-to-revenue
ratio increases by 7 pp to 64% in 2015, which generally indicates that the state fiscal profile is
sufficiently robust with respect to interest rate volatility. However, a combination of interest rate
increases with no access to additional IDA financing (discussed below) would generate
significant fiscal pressure.

31.     Lagos` fiscal dynamics would become less favorable if its entire deficit financing has to
be covered at more expensive terms due to unavailability of IDA funding. Failure to secure
concessional financing from IDA would substantially increase Lagos` debt-to-revenue ratio,
which would peak at 80 percent in 2012, up from 62 percent in 2009. This would happen in spite
of the fact that this scenario assumes a cut in capital expenditure by 10 percent resulting in lower
economic growth. But in contrast to the first three alternative scenarios, the debt profile in this
case would remain sustainable recovering to about 63 percent of revenues after 2015 and
stabilizing at that level. This scenario indicates that Lagos should make an effort to secure highly
concessional loans to finance its development needs. At the same time, it confirms that the
baseline scenario (and associated fiscal and debt program) is sufficiently robust with respect to
fluctuations in cost of deficit financing.

                                         F.      Conclusion
32.     The Government of Lagos State has strengthened its revenue performance in the last few
years, but this has been accompanied by a much faster expansion in public spending. Baseline
projections depict a sustainable long-term fiscal framework that accommodates a significant
expansion in the public investment program. Sensitivity analysis nonetheless shows that this
predicted positive trend depends largely on continued improvements in the efficiency of tax
administration and perseverance in the tight control over overall expenditure growth. The extent
of fiscal risks also depends upon the ability to secure highly concessional external financing.
With IDA financing, a favorable evolution of the fiscal position is expected to continue over the
medium term as reform measures, developed by the state in conjunction with the World Bank
support program, are implemented.
