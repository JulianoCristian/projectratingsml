                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to promote better and more equitable local service delivery. The project will achieve its objective by establishing and
                         operationalizing a decentralized participatory and transparent financing mechanism that empowers local governments and communities. This writing of the
                         PDO shows small differences with the one in the PAD; it is just a consolidation, based on AFTRL's advice. Similarly small consolidations have been made in the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project will initiate a new capacity building action plan that focuses on training of newly elected officials at the communal level. Only when this training program has been
                         underway for several months will the final round of micro-projects be selected and signed (after March 2011).

                         Many partners within this sector have shifted their operations recently. The project will therefore prepare a new strategy for both provinces of low and high level intervention to better
                         collaborate with other projects on the ground. This strategy should carry-through until the close of the project in December 2012, also when many other projects within the sector will
                         wrap-up operations.
