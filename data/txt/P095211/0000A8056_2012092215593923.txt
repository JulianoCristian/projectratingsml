                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to promote better and more equitable local service delivery. The project will achieve its objective by establishing and
                         operationalizing a decentralized participatory and transparent financing mechanism that empowers local governments and communities. This writing of the PDO shows
                         small differences with the one in the PAD; it is just a consolidation, basedon AFTRL's advice. Similarly small consolidations have been made in the writing of the key
                         indicators, based on AFTRL's advice.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The project development objective is to promote better and more equitable local service delivery. The project will achieve itsobjective by establishing and operationalizing a
                         decentralized participatory and transparent financing mechanism that empowerslocal governments and communities. Key performance indicators at the PDO level include: (i) at least
                         15% of targeted communes haveobtained funding for Communal Development Plan activities from outside the project, (ii) 70% of infrastructure financed undersub-projects is

                         maintained and operational two years after completion of the respective sub-project, and (iii) 70% of targetedcommunes show an increase in access to, and use of, primary health,
                         primary education, and water services, since the time ofconclusion as compared with that at the time commencement of the project.

                         As the project heads into its last few months ofoperations, the focus is placed on consolidating the capacity building component and finalizing all community sub-projects. Theproject
                         has revised capacity building training modules that will be professionally printed and given to the Ministryof CommunalDevelopment to feed into the new National Capacity Building
                         Plan. The project will also assist the GoB in designing newfive-year Communal Development Plans. After the completion of an infrastructure audit last year, the project will close out
                         thesub-project component by ensuring that all social infrastructure is well build and functional. The final micro-projects are beingbuilt. The project is preparing a close-out strategy,
                         including a communications strategy to ensure that all stakeholders are awarethat the project is closing.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is winding down the capacity building of local officials and the formulation of new communal development plans by end of October 2012.

                         The project will hand-over professionally formatted and printed training modules to the Ministry of Communal Development to feed into the National Capacity Building Plan.

                         The project will complete all infrastructure projects, as well as the repairs required on already completed buildings before the close of the project in December 2012.

                         The recruitment of a firm to undertake the Final Evaluation of the project is on-going and this will be completed before December 2012.
