                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to promote better and more equitable local service delivery. The project will achieve its objective by establishing and
                         operationalizing a decentralized participatory and transparent financing mechanism that empowers local governments and communities. This writing of the PDO shows
                         small differences with the one in the PAD; it is just a consolidation, basedon AFTRL's advice. Similarly small consolidations have been made in the writing of the key
                         indicators, based on AFTRL's advice.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project closed in December 31, 2012. The capacity building component completed all training and finalized new communal development plans (PCDC's in the French acronym)
                         by mid-December. These new plans cover 37 communes in six provinces. Capacity building for social cohesion has completed training activities on the legal rights of vulnerable
                         groups with the training of 1370 people across six provinces. Legal services were provided under this component to 106 orphaned children. A further 1250 vulnerable people, mostly
                         children, received assistance to have their registrations into the civil status completed, and 800 orphaned children received assistance to remain in school.

                         The project has produced training modules for 10 thematic areas. The modules are in both French and Kirundo. Furthermore, the project supported the Ministry of Communal
                         Development by providing the consultant who produced the national guide on the methodology for the new communal development plans. Finally, the project provided a consultant to
                         draft a new law on the maintenance of infrastructure. This draft law has been provided to the Ministry of Communal Development and will now be entered for consideration as new
                         legislation.

                         The project team initiated a communications strategy in October2012 focused on the close-out of the project, ensuring that all partners and local communities are aware of the close
                         of the project.
