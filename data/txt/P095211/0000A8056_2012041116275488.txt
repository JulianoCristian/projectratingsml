                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to promote better and more equitable local service delivery. The project will achieve its objective by establishing and
                         operationalizing a decentralized participatory and transparent financing mechanism that empowers local governments and communities. This writing of the PDO shows
                         small differences with the one in the PAD; it is just a consolidation, basedon AFTRL's advice. Similarly small consolidations have been made in the writing of the key
                         indicators, based on AFTRL's advice.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project development objective is to promote better and more equitable local service delivery. The project will achieve its objective by establishing and operationalizing a
                         decentralized participatory and transparent financing mechanism that empowers local governments and communities. Key performance indicators at the PDO level include: (i) at
                         least 15% of targeted communes have obtained funding for Communal Development Plan activities from outside the project, (ii) 70% of infrastructure financed under sub-projects is

                         maintained and operational two years after completion of the respective sub-project, and (iii) 70% of targeted communes show an increase in access to, and use of, primary health,
                         primary education, and water services, since the time of conclusion as compared with that at the time commencement of the project.

                         As the project heads into its last year of operations, the focus is placed on consolidating the capacity building component and finalizing all community sub-projects. The project has
                         developed a new capacity building plan that focuses on training modules that are specific to each province in order to tailor the required skills. The project will also assist the GoB in
                         designing new five-year communal development plans. After the completion of an infrastructure audit last year, the project will close out the sub-project component by ensuring that
                         all social infrastructure is well build and functional. The final micro-projects are being build and definitive hand-over will be done during the year.
