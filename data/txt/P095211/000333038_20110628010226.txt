                                    RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
1.      This restructuring paper proposes to correct an omission of the previous
restructuring from December 2010. The Ministry of Planning and Communal
Development, the line Ministry of the project, reports to the Second Vice President.
According to the Financing Agreement, the chair of the National Orientation and Steering
Committee (NOSC) of the project is the Vice Presidency representing the line Ministry of
the project. As such, the Second Vice President is the chair of the NOSC. The previous
amendment to the Financing Agreement omitted this change.


PROJECT STATUS
2.      The Burundi Community and Social Development Project (PRADECS, P095211)
was approved by the World Bank Board of Directors on March 21, 20071 and current
closing date is December 31, 2012. The project was originally designed to support the
Burundi national decentralization strategy through two major programmatic actions: (i)
Capacity building activities for supporting decentralization efforts (at the central and
local levels; and (ii) Supporting the financing of sub-projects to enhance access to small
scale social infrastructure and small sub-projects for the benefit of traditionally
vulnerable groups.

3.      Under Component 1. Capacity Building, the project has trained and supported
local actors in 6 provinces selected for this component. In view of changes in support
from other development partners, as of July 2011 local actors from an additional 2
provinces will receive this support. By May 2011, 391 subprojects had been signed under
Component 2. Public Subprojects, which represents 91 percent of the Financing
Agreement minimum target of 430 subprojects for social infrastructure.


PROPOSED CHANGES
4.      Following the creation of a separate Ministry of Decentralization and Communal
Development in 2008, and the renaming of this Ministry after elections in 2010 to the
Ministry of Planning and Communal Development, the Financing Agreement of the
project was amended to reflect these changes in December 2010. This Line Ministry
reports to the Second Vice President, while the original Line Ministry of the project, the
Ministry of Interior, reports to the First Vice President. According to the Financing

1
    The project became effective on August 28, 2007.
                                                       4
Agreement, the chair of the National Orientation and Steering Committee (NOSC) of the
project is the Vice Presidency representing the line Ministry of the project. As such, the
Second Vice President is the chair of the NOSC. The previous amendment to the
Financing Agreement omitted this change. The proposed change to Financing Agreement
is as follows:

Schedule 2, Section 1. A1:
“ (a) The Recipient shall maintain, throughout Project Implementation, the National
Orientation and Steering Committee, in form and substance and with resources
satisfactory to the Association, and comprising the Second Vice President as Chair and
Line Ministers.”
