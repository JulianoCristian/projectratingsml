                           The project development objective is to promote better and more equitable local service delivery. The project will achieve its objective by establishing and operationalizing a
                         decentralized participatory and transparent financing mechanism that empowers local governments and communities. Key performance indicators at the PDO level include: (i) at
                         least 15% of targeted communes have obtained funding for Communal Development Plan activities from outside the project, (ii) 70% of infrastructure financed under sub-projects is
                         maintained and operational two years after completion of the respective sub-project, and (iii) 70% of targeted communes show an increase in access to, and use of, primary health,

                         selected, as agreed upon with IDA. On the other hand, many ongoing sub-project have been finalized during this period.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          The project needs to continue to focus on capacity building of local officials.

                         The project will launch its last round of sub-projects over the coming months.

                         Many partners within this sector have shifted their operations recently. The project will therefore prepare a new strategy for both provinces of low and high level intervention to better
                         collaborate with other projects on the ground. This strategy should carry-through until the close of the project in December 2012, also when many other projects within the sector will
                         wrap-up operations.
