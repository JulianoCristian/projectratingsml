Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project development objective is to promote better and more equitable local service delivery. The
project will achieve its objective by establishing and operationalizing a decentralized participatory and
transparent financing mechanism that empowers local governments and communities. This writing of the
PDO shows small differences with the one in the PAD; it is just a consolidation, based on AFTRL’s advice.
Similarly small consolidations have been made in the writing of the key indicators, based on AFTRL’s
advice.
