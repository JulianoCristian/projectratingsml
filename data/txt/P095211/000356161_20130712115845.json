 Development Project for Burundi were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) operation on its\n            own is not a sufficient vehicle to promote broad policy and\n            institutional reforms needed for effective decentralization.\n            The limited transfer of funds from the national to the local\n            level, although required by law, severely constrains local\n            government to carry out their new responsibilities. In a low\n            capacity environment, community Driven Development (CDD)\n            projects should use a gradual, transitional approach. CDD\n            approaches have proven to be effective in low capacity,\n            post-conflict environments. A comprehensive assessment of\n            actual capacity among local officials in a fragile context\n            is essential to avoid over-optimism and an unrealistic\n            design at entry. CDD projects need to be flexible during\n            periods of elections in post-conflict settings. Bank\n            presence in-country, particularly in a post-conflict\n            environment, is important. This lesson has been repeated in\n            several recent Burundi ICRs, and no doubt from other countries."}, "docdt": "2013-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
