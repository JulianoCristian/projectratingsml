The overall performance of the Ministry of Public\n            Works (MPW) in the execution of the Third Highway Project\n            can be regarded as satisfactory. There is some evidence,\n            though that more could have been achieved had MPW invoked\n            its experiences acquired from execution of the first two\n            highway projects. Even though all components of the project\n            have been completed, the Government of Liberia is still\n            exploring means of liquidating its financial indebtedness to\n            the various contractors and consultants that provided\n            construction and construction management services\n            respectively. The conclusion is that all components of the\n            Third Highway Project are economically justified and\n            socially desirable."}, "docdt": "1984-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
