The program components supported\n            by the loan are: (i) construction, rehabilitation, and\n            expansion of federal and state highways and urban bypasses;\n            (ii) construction of SAHOP regional centers; (iii) purchase\n            of maintenance equipment and vehicles; and (iv)\n            consultants' services. Subprojects to be assisted under\n            the loan will be submitted to the Bank for approval. The\n            project will: (a) help modernize, maintain, and expand the\n            road network; (b) help assess the regional development\n            impact of highway investments and the long term perspectives\n            of road transport; (c) promote improved sector policies; and\n            (d) strenghthen local capabilities to plan and manage\n            highway sector programs. The highway sector now carries some\n            90 percent of intercity passenger traffic and about 75\n            percent of intercity freight transport."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
