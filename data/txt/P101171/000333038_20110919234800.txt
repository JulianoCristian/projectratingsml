7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project's development objective is to identify social and/or fiscal attributes of physical and legal
persons in Argentina, through a sustainable information exchange system, aimed at improving the
efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services and fiscal programs at all levels of government in
Argentina. The specific objectives to be pursued under this operation are: 1.         to expand and
consolidate the network underlying the exchange of social and fiscal information among public agencies at
the national, provincial, and municipal levels of government, with provisions to ensure data protection,
accessibility, and the quality and accuracy of information; and 2. to consolidate the institutionalization of
SINTyS as an independent national entity responsible for coordinating and setting standards governing the
exchange of information within Argentina's public sector.
