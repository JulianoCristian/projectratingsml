                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is to identify social and/or fiscal attributes of physical and legal persons in Argentina, through a sustainable information
                         exchange system, aimed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services and fiscal programs at all levels of government in Argentina.

                         The specific objectives to be pursued under this operation are:

                          1.    to expand and consolidate the network underlying the exchange of social and fiscal information among public agencies at the national, provincial, and
                         municipal levels of government, with provisions to ensure data protection, accessibility, and the quality and accuracy of information; and
                          2.    to consolidate the institutionalization of SINTyS as an independent national entity responsible for coordinating and setting standards governing the
                         exchange of information within Argentina's public sector.

                         Outcomes have been generally positive during the first two years of project implementation and the project is being implemented satisfactorily. In support of achievement of the
                         objective, significant advancements have been made in strengthening the existing IT infrastructure, including the implementation of a safe room and the inauguration of a new
                         location with improved IT and information security, as well as in the unequivocal identification of physical and juridical persons
