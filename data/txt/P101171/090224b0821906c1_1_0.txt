                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is to identify social and/or fiscal attributes of physical and legal persons in Argentina, through a sustainable information exchange
                         system, aimed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services and fiscal programs at all levels of government in Argentina. The specific
                         objectives to be pursued under this operation are: 1.        to expand and consolidate the network underlying the exchange of social and fiscal information among public
                         agencies at the national, provincial, and municipal levels of government, with provisions to ensure data protection, accessibility, and the quality and accuracy of
                         information; and 2.       to consolidate the institutionalization of SINTyS as an independent national entity responsible for coordinating and setting standards governing
                         the exchange of information within Argentina's public sector.

                         The consolidation phase supported by the Project continues and is based on a greater focus on services and data quality management. Twenty one databases have been added
                         since May 2013, bringing the total to 1,622. At the subnational level, there are currently Provincial Coordination Units in operation in 21 of the 24 provinces. Between May and
                         September 2013, thirteen new agreements were accorded with different entities (2 agreements at the national level, 6 at the provincial level, and 5 at the municipal level), bringing the
                         total number of agreements to 380 since the creation of SINTyS. Since January 2008, 13,072 data exchanges have taken place.
