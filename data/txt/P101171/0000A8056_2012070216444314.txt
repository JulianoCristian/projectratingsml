                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is to identify social and/or fiscal attributes of physical and legal persons in Argentina, through a sustainable information exchange
                         system, aimed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services and fiscal programs at all levels of government in Argentina. The specific
                         objectives to be pursued under this operation are: 1.        to expand and consolidate the network underlying the exchange of social and fiscal information among public
                         agencies at the national, provincial, and municipal levels of government, with provisions to ensure data protection, accessibility, and the quality and accuracy of
                         information; and 2.       to consolidate the institutionalization of SINTyS as an independent national entity responsible for coordinating and setting standards governing
                         the exchange of information within Argentina's public sector.
