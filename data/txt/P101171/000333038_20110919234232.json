fiscal attributes of physical and\n            legal persons in Argentina, through a sustainable\n            information exchange system, aimed at improving the\n            efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services and\n            fiscal programs at all levels of government in Argentina.\n            The changes aim at supporting the project as it moves from\n            the expansion stage to the consolidation stage and ensuring\n            its sustainability after closing. The modifications include:\n            (i) changes to intermediate indicators, aimed at revising\n            the results framework to provide for indicators that have\n            continued relevance and that can be realistically measured\n            at exit given project progress and the actual parameters of\n            the system established under the project; and (ii)\n            reallocation of remaining loan proceeds to address the\n            financial requirements of the consolidation stage and to\n            adjust for changes in prices.  The restructuring does not\n            modify the project development objective (PDO) and prospects\n            for achieving the PDO under the restructured project remain positive."}, "docdt": "2011-09-07T00:00:00Z"}
