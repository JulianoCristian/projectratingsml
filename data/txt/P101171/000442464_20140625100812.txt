F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's development objective is to identify social and/or fiscal attributes of
physical and legal persons in Argentina, through a sustainable information exchange
system, aimed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services
and fiscal programs at all levels of government in Argentina.
  The specific objectives to be pursued under this operation are:

  1. to expand and consolidate the network underlying the exchange of social and
fiscal information among public agencies at the national, provincial, and municipal levels
of government, with provisions to ensure data protection, accessibility, and the quality
and accuracy of information; and
  2. to consolidate the institutionalization of SINTyS as an independent national entity
responsible for coordinating and setting standards governing the exchange of information
within Argentina's public sector.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of design, Argentina was experiencing a sustained period of strong
growth, expanding 8.7 percent in 2007 - the sixth straight year of 8-9 percent growth
since the crisis. In order to achieve increased social equity, the Kirchner administration
had prioritized social safety-net programs, and since 2006, had initiated a massive
expansion in the coverage of social security, incorporating an estimated 1.4 million
people who had previously not been covered. While together these factors had
contributed to a considerable improvement in social indicators such as unemployment
and poverty, these issues continued to pose significant challenges.

2.     The expansion of social programs had been made possible by the substantial
increase in public revenues, especially from taxes.1 However, in spite of improvements in
tax administration systems, there remained room for improvement at the national and
provincial levels, with some estimates suggesting that tax collections represented only
about half of their potential revenue.

3.      The government of Argentina was committed to continuing to improve the
efficiency, efficacy, targeting, and transparency of social expenditures, and to reducing
tax evasion and noncompliance. During the 1990s, such efforts had been hampered by a
variety of factors, including the lack of national e-government and information and
communication technologies (ICT) strategies, and a common framework for effective
interconnection of ICT systems and exchange of data among government agencies. To
ameliorate this shortcoming, the Social and Fiscal National Identification System
(Sistema de Identificación Nacional Tributario y Social (SINTyS)) was established in
1998 to support the development of an online, real time shared information exchange
network which facilitated the systematic exchange of information across national,
provincial and municipal public agencies’ databases.

4.      The SINTyS Adaptable Lending Program (APL), approved in 1999, was designed
to support this development, through the objective “…to improve the efficiency,
effectiveness and impact of social services and fiscal programs through institutionalized
information exchange.”2 As conceived, the APL was planned to be implemented in three
phases covering a total of eight years, supported by US$54 million in Bank lending– a
demonstration phase (Phase I), an expansion phase in which additional government
agencies were to be incorporated into the system (Phase II), and a consolidation phase
focused on the institutionalization of the system (Phase III).

Republic in Support of the First Phase of a Social and Fiscal National Identification System, March 31,

                                                   1
5.      By the time of design of SINTyS II, program implementation had progressed
somewhat differently than initially planned (See Table 1). Phase I, for which
implementation took longer than expected, received Bank support under the Social and
Fiscal National Identification System Project (P055461, US$10 million) over the course
of six and a half years, and was found to have provided monetary benefits of more than
US$130.5 million as a result of reduced tax noncompliance and improved targeting of
social programs and social security benefits, as well as a wide range of non-monetary
benefits. Due to limited resources under the 2004-2005 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) envelope (which was fully committed and did not contain separate resources for
Phase II), the first part of Phase II received Bank support through the reallocation of
US$8 million from the State Modernization Project (P057449, US$30.303 million) in
November 20053 (and was estimated to have provided approximately US$62.4 million in
benefits during one and a half years of implementation in 2006 and 2007).

6.      At the time of SINTyS II’s design, there were approximately 200 government
agencies participating in SINTyS. The progressive decentralization and extension of the
system to provincial and municipal governments had begun,4 and the establishment of
SINTyS as a National Directorate under the National Council on the Coordination of
Social Policies (Consejo Nacional de Coordinación de Políticas Sociales, CNCPS) in
December 20075 was a major first step towards Phase III-Consolidation, reflecting the
administration's commitment to the permanent institutionalization of SINTyS within
Argentina's public sector. As a result of the significant progress already made on Phase II
as well as developments in line with the objective of Phase III at the time of SINTyS II’s
design, the decision was made to combine the remainder Phase II and Phase III within the
SINTyS II operation.
                         Table 1. Original APL Design vs. Implementation
                             Original Design                                  As Implemented
Phase I: Demonstration     US$10 million, 2 years   US$10 million, 6.5 years (SINTyS I, P055461)
                                                    US$8 million, 1.5 years (Reallocation under State Modernization I
Phase II: Expansion        US$37 million, 4 years   (P057449))

                                                    US$20 million, 5 years (SINTyS II, P101171)
Phase III: Consolidation   US$7 million, 2 years


7.      As such, the SINTyS II operation was designed to provide further Bank support
for completion of the SINTyS APL program, building upon previous advances under the
projects mentioned above and focusing on the key pending challenges which needed to
be addressed in order to ensure the achievement and sustainability of SINTyS’s full
potential. With its extensive experience supporting public sector modernization efforts in

Argentina’s subnational sector, the Bank was well-positioned to help the Government
expand SINTyS at the provincial and municipal levels. Sectoral knowledge and
longstanding relationships forged by the Bank with subnational actors that resulted from
two Provincial Development Projects and two Municipal Development Projects 6 were
particularly relevant. The Bank’s support towards the development of a national e-
government plan, as well as its broad perspective, ability to apply lessons from similar
projects worldwide, and its role as a facilitator of inter-institutional coordination were
also seen as important.

8.      The project was fully consistent with the overall strategic goals outlined in the
2006-2008 CAS (34015-AR, discussed by the Board on May 4, 2006), which focused on
three pillars (sustained economic growth with equity, social inclusion and governance),
and included public sector strengthening as one of four highlighted areas of work. By
helping to provide more accurate information on the social and fiscal status of individuals
(through contributing to reducing tax noncompliance and thereby generating additional
public revenues that could be redirected to social programs and social security benefits),
the operation supported the CAS objectives of enhancing fiscal equity and furthering
social inclusion, and was explicitly noted in the CAS under the Improved Governance
pillar.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

9.      The project's development objective was to identify social and/or fiscal attributes
of physical and legal persons in Argentina, through a sustainable information exchange
system, aimed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services
and fiscal programs at all levels of government in Argentina.

10.      The specific objectives to be pursued under this operation were7:

         1.     to expand and consolidate the network underlying the exchange of social
                and fiscal information among public agencies at the national, provincial,
                and municipal levels of government, with provisions to ensure data
                protection, accessibility, and the quality and accuracy of information; and
         2.     to consolidate the institutionalization of SINTyS as an independent
                national entity responsible for coordinating and setting standards
                governing the exchange of information within Argentina's public sector.

11.        Neither the PDO nor the PDO indicators were revised during implementation.

Main Beneficiaries

12.      As described in the PAD, the direct beneficiaries of the Project were to be the
program managers and government officials in charge of social programs and social
security benefits and tax, health, judicial, and pension administration at federal and
provincial levels who would be able to improve the management and effectiveness of
their respective programs through better targeting and/or the reduction of fraud and
leakages. The general public was to be an indirect beneficiary, as a result of facing a
fairer tax burden (because of reduced tax evasion) as well as potential increases in social
and other public programs, which could have a positive -albeit indirect- impact in terms
of poverty alleviation.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)8

13.     Component 1-Institutional and Legal Framework (US$1.56 million, of which
58.97 percent was to be financed by the Bank loan): This component was to support
the further development and implementation of the institutional and legal framework
required to ensure SINTyS' permanent institutionalization within Argentina's public
sector, as well as the continuing expansion of SINTyS to additional agencies. Specifically,
the focus was to be on the definition of SINTyS' institutional imprint (organizational
structure, financial mechanisms, and coordination among participating agencies,
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and control mechanisms), the development
mechanisms to ensure transparency and full compliance with Argentina’s legal
framework and constitutional guarantees regarding the privacy and confidentiality of
personal information, and subnational expansion.

14.     Component 2-Information Management and Data Quality Framework
(US$6.75 million, of which 31.41 percent was to be financed by the Bank loan): This
component was to focus on further strengthening SINTyS’ information management,
with a particular emphasis on enhancing the quality of the data being exchanged under
the system through the development of data standards, support to the digitalization of
information from key sources of social and fiscal data, enhancement of the quality of data
at entry, and development of SINTyS’ information management and quality enhancement
framework .

15.    Component 3-Technological Framework for the Information Exchange
(US$12.69 million, of which 87.71 percent was to be financed by the Bank loan):
This component was to support the project’s overall information technology,
telecommunication, and software development needs, with specific support to the
management, development, implementation, maintenance, and continuous reengineering
of technology and infrastructure; the definition of protocols and standards for data

exchange; and evaluation and adaptation of modern telecommunication models to
guarantee the highest reliability of the information exchange.

16.     Component 4-Information Security (US$6.31 million, of which 85.1 percent
was to be financed by the Bank loan): This component was to support the further
development and implementation of a robust information security architecture and
framework to ensure that SINTyS could run operations safely and reliably, and ensure
that constitutional guarantees for the privacy and confidentiality of individual information
exchanged under SINTyS were preserved and protected. The component was to finance
the development and implementation of tools and methodologies, as well as the purchase
of equipment for data security to protect the ICT system from unauthorized intrusion, and
also foster awareness on the importance of security within the user communities within
participating agencies.

17.     Component 5-Project Management (US$ 0.67 million, of which 59.7 percent
was to be financed by the Bank loan): This component aimed to provide the
administrative, financial and budget management, accounting, audit, procurement and
other services support needed for project implementation according to the rules specified
in the Project Operation Manual and the Bank’s procedures.

1.6 Revised Components

18.    Components were not revised during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.     On September 16, 2011, a Level 2 restructuring was approved. This restructuring
(i) made changes to a number of intermediate results indicators (See Annex 10 for the
table of changes from the restructuring paper) and (ii) reallocated loan proceeds to meet
the financial requirements of the consolidation stage (continuing investment in
information technology (IT) infrastructure), adjust for changes in prices due to inflation,
and move funds from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) that were not used prior to
project effectiveness.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
20.     The quality at entry is viewed to be Moderately Satisfactory.

21.    Project design was a logical continuation of the work undertaken in SINTyS I and
the corresponding component of State Modernization I, and drew upon international
experience in similar efforts9.

22.      As previously mentioned, with progress already made on Phases II and III,
SINTyS II combined the remaining Phase II and III activities under one operation.
SINTyS II’s full implementation within the expected five year timeline and the successful
institutionalization of SINTyS within the government structure support the positive
evaluation of the feasibility of combining remaining activities within one operation.
However, this feature also may have reduced the imperative to fully meet all of the
intermediate results indicators designed for “passage” from the expansion to the
consolidation phase under the original APL design (as implied by Annex 10 of the
PAD10) (targeted for a midterm completion date, but not all fully achieved by then), given
that such was not required for the origination of a separate loan or continuing
disbursement.

23.     The operation’s components (Institutional and Legal Framework; Information
Management and Data Quality Framework; Technological Framework for Information
Exchange; Information Security; and Project Management) reflected the program’s
increasing emphasis on institutionalization following the successful demonstration of
SINTyS’ impact in past operations11, and represented the key areas in which additional
work was needed to ensure the agency’s mainstreaming into Argentina’s public sector
(strengthening the institutional framework to define users’ responsibilities and
prerogatives; ensuring the privacy, confidentiality and legitimate use of data; and
generating confidence in the appropriate management of the information exchanges).
This focus reflected an understanding of the challenges encountered in the past (e.g.



9
  During Project preparation, visits to Estonia and Belgium were undertaken, with the goal of learning from
their experience in information exchanges.
10
   The preconditions for moving from Phase II to Phase III, as appearing in the SINTyS I PAD appear as
the main headings in Annex 10 of the SINTyS II PAD. The specific achievements associated with these
preconditions are defined through the comments on the state of these preconditions in Annex 10 of the
PAD and the Results Framework.
11
   The SINTyS I operation contained components in Improving Social Services; Improving Fiscal
Efficiency; Institutional Framework, Infrastructure and Common Services; Management of the System; and
Project Administration, and the corresponding component of State Modernization I included
subcomponents on Improvement of Social Services; Improving Fiscal Efficiency; Technological
Framework and Infrastructure; Organizational, Institutional, and Legal Framework; and Security
Framework.

                                                    6
agencies’ reticence to share their information, the institutional complexities implied by
Argentina’s federal structure, and inconsistent data quality).

24.     Project design contemplated a thorough assessment of possible project risks and a
corresponding set of risk mitigation measures, some of which were linked to monitoring
indicators thereby facilitating oversight during implementation. In retrospect, in
monitoring of indicators, it seems that some of the designed mitigation measures could
have benefited from a deeper assessment of their feasibility (e.g. annual security audits
by external control bodies when SINTyS cannot influence the General Syndicate of the
Nation’s (Sindicatura General de la Nación, SIGEN) auditing agenda). However, given
that the associated possible risks identified did not impact project implementation, the
mitigation measures applied appear to have been sufficient.

25.     In January 2008, a PPF for US$1,489,300 was approved to finance activities
including the definition of the components, diagnostic studies, and evaluations of the
needs of the participating government agencies.           The corresponding loan was
subsequently approved by the Board on July 10, 2008 and became effective on February
27, 2009 following receipt of the legal opinion of the Treasury Attorney ( Procurador del
Tesoro) confirming the validity and enforceability of the Loan Agreement (the only
effectiveness condition).

26.     Implementation arrangements built upon those associated with previous support
to the agency, with additional responsibilities being transferred to SINTyS (the agency)
under SINTyS II. The CNCPS continued to be responsible for project implementation
and in charge of the Central Executing Unit (CEU), which benefited from the continuity
of staff associated with the previous projects. Following the past use of the United
Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) as the procurement agent and funds
administrator, it was decided to limit the use of UNOPS in SINTyS II to only the first two
International Competitive Bidding processes. These changes were a positive reflection
of the institutionalization that had occurred since the inception of the original APL
program. Although the CEU’s lack of direct past experience in Bank procurement
processes (identified at design as one of the risks) did contribute to some initial
challenges in implementation, these issues were overcome through intensive, proactive,
and regular coordination between the CEU and the Bank (discussed below).

27.     While design drew upon the lessons learned from past operations, it seems that it
may have been overly ambitious in its assessment of some aspects of the environment for
new inter-institutional coordination arrangements amongst stakeholders. For example, the
meetings anticipated at design related to the SINTyS and provincial advisory bodies and
the users’ forum were not held in the first two years of project implementation, resulting
in the modification of the related intermediate results indicators (change of measurement
in the case of the first two to already existing mechanisms and elimination in the case of
the third) in the September 2011 restructuring. Similarly, the target set for regular
municipal participation in data exchanges also was overly ambitious, and was not able to




                                            7
be met over the implementation period, in part as a result of an overestimation of
municipal capacity and motivation12 to participate. However, as commented upon further
in Section 3, these factors do not appear to have hampered the successful expansion and
institutionalization of the system, and demand for SINTyS’ services remains high.
2.2 Implementation
28.     Overall, project implementation proceeded quite smoothly. The Project was
implemented as planned over the course of five years, aided by the strong motivation,
flexibility, and skill set of the SINTyS team, substantial political support from the
Government, and strong support from the Bank team, which included experts in the areas
of information security and data quality.

29.     Learning from the experiences of the first provincial nodes and complications
related to the renovation and access to SINTyS spaces, and taking advantage of recent
technological advances, SINTyS adjusted its provincial strategy in 2009 to allow for a
solution that was more cost-effective while guaranteeing the physical security of
equipment, thereby facilitating expansion into less affluent provinces. The successful
expansion to additional provinces was also aided by central SINTyS’ understanding of
the need to tailor their presentation of SINTyS’ services to each province’s specific needs
and commitment to re-presenting the SINTyS model to local authorities following
changes in political leadership.

30.     While SINTyS II involved fewer acquisitions processes than SINTyS I, the
processes carried out were more sophisticated, and the newness of some of the
technology deployed implied additional time be devoted for the Government’s
corresponding technical reviews. Following some initial delays and complications in
procurement processes, including delays in UNOPS procedures, however, these
challenges were overcome through intensive coordination between the CEU and the Bank
task team. This good relationship, combined with permanent dialogue between technical
and procurement experts both within SINTyS and the Bank, facilitated the successful
execution of large and complex processes (such as those related to a data safe room)
without delay.

31.     By the time of the midterm review (MTR) in May 2011, significant progress had
been made in all of the components – with, for example, national decrees having been
emitted to designate the individuals holding key positions within SINTyS13, a detailed
data quality operations manual having been developed, the new data center being
operational, and information security controls having been applied in central SINTyS’
new offices. Following the review of project indicators during the MTR, the Project was
restructured in September 201l to reallocate funds between expenditure categories and
modify some of the intermediate results indicators in order “to properly reflect project

13
  Decrees 486/10, 487/10 y 488/10 designated the individuals holding the positions of National Director of
SINTyS, Director of Integration of Information Technology, and Director of Technology for Information
Exchange.

                                                    8
progress as well as SINTyS challenges in face of the consolidation phase.”14 Some of
these changes (such as the dropping of indicators related to student registries once the
information could be obtained through the Universal Child Allowance (Asignación
Universal por Hijo, AUH), as well as the one related to the service-oriented architecture
model which was outdated following the creation of web services) are indicative of
changes to implementation that could not have been anticipated at design and were
beyond SINTyS’ control. Some others, however (e.g. those previously mentioned related
to the convening of external groups (CNCPS advisory body, provincial advisory body,
users’ forum)) seem to reflect a shift in perspective since design.

32.     As discussed further below, the Project is believed to have resulted in significant
savings. However, during implementation, the verified impact of SINTyS II was not
measured in the form anticipated at design, due to the growing technical challenges
associated with doing so given the increasing number of information exchanges and
SINTyS’ desire not to be viewed as auditing independent agencies’ use of information.
Supervision missions as early as November 2009 underscored the importance of impact
information, and discussions with the Bank team on the development of a new tool to
measure SINTyS’ financial impact continued throughout the remainder of
implementation. By closing, SINTyS had developed a tool via which average potential
efficiency gains from removing identified irregular claimants in a particular period could
be estimated. While allowing for the collection of information illustrative of project
efficiency and within the spirit of the project development objective, such information is
not directly comparable with the two impact-related PDO indicators, thereby preventing
measurement of these indicators.

33.     In spite of SINTyS’ proactive approach during project implementation, it is
important to note that some aspects - which could perhaps have been better anticipated in
design - lay beyond its control, and also demonstrate how signing and revisiting
agreements is a continual activity within an agency such as SINTyS. The activity related
to the digitalization of the civil registries (included within Component 2) is temporarily
on hold for reasons beyond the scope of SINTyS (registries are autonomous and it is
required to enter into separate agreements with each entity in order to use their
information). Similarly, while SINTyS has developed information exchange standards
for thirty data types, formalization of these standards with the National Office of
Information Technology (Oficina Nacional de Tecnologías de Información, ONTI) is
pending.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.    The Project’s M&E Framework included an extensive set of indicators, which are
to be commended for their ambitious scope, designed to both continue monitoring of
some of the key indicators used in the SINTyS I project15 and incorporate mechanisms

  The indicators from the first operation that continued to be monitored in SINTyS II included: (1)

                                                    9
through which progress on the SINTyS II operation’s particular focus on expansion and
consolidation could be captured. However, given that in order to properly reflect
progress as well as some of the challenges in the face of the consolidation phase, some
were later modified during the restructuring without having previously recorded any
progress prior to this point, the extent to which some indicators’ original formulations
were practical is unclear. Those associated with the verified impact were not measured
during implementation for the reasons discussed above. While at design the continuation
of the verified fiscal impact indicators may have seemed logical from the perspective of
the overarching APL program and such indicators were maintained during project
supervision because of their recognized importance, it took longer than expected to reach
agreement on the measurement methodology, and ultimately they were not measured as
planned at design for the reasons discussed above.

35.     While the Project’s extensive set of intermediate indicators was surely intended to
provide detailed monitoring information on project implementation, in practice, the large
number of indicators seems to have caused some challenges. The baselines of some
intermediate indicators were not clearly specified in the PAD, and some of the original
indicators (some of those with a midterm target date) were not included in the tables
prepared at the Project’s restructuring.

36.      The central SINTyS office was responsible for monitoring overall project
implementation, including continuing development at the national level, implementation
of remaining provincial field offices, and special activities related to specific registries
(civil, juridical, deeds and students). Provincial SPFOs were responsible for monitoring
subnational expansion.

37.     Indicator measurements and progress was monitored and discussed with the CEU
and the Bank team during missions, with reports regularly provided to the Bank. The
practice of monitoring activities appears to have been well institutionalized within
SINTyS. At closing, SINTyS had its own M&E system in place, and was preparing
monthly reports for management to monitor advances in key management indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

38.    Throughout project implementation, Financial Management (FM) performance
was satisfactory, with audits received on time, and considered acceptable by the Bank.

39.     As mentioned above, some initial procurement challenges were encountered
(including delays in UNOPS procedures, which subsequently resulted in a change in the
procurement agent from UNOPS to the CEU). However, following the initiation of close
and frequent interactions between the CEU, the Bank procurement specialist, and the task
team including preparation of annual procurement plans, early detection of complex
procurement processes, and prompt reviews of No Objection requests, implementation

proceeded smoothly and project procurement ratings were at least moderately
satisfactory16 throughout implementation.

40.     With respect to safeguard, no safeguard policies were triggered by the Project at
design, an appropriate decision, as no such issues arose during implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     As of project closure, SINTyS appears to have become a well-institutionalized
agency. The activities undertaken have resulted in significant utilization of its services
(between January 2008 and September 2013, more than 13,000 data exchanges took
place17, and as of September 2013, 98 provincial agencies and 42 municipalities were
regularly exchanging information through the system (increasing from baselines of 63
and 11, respectively), with information meeting the desired quality standards. From the
point of view of demand, it seems that SINTyS is well-positioned to continue to facilitate
such exchanges in the future, delivering a service valued by many agencies within the
Argentine public sector.

42.     From the perspective of internal sustainability, SINTyS also seems to be well-
positioned to sustain the advances to date. All of SINTyS’ personnel costs, as well as
those associated with the updating and operation of its technological platform have been
incorporated into the budget of the CNCPS, and twelve provinces were financing the
salaries of their provincial coordinators in September 2013. Recognizing the significant
work carried out to date in internal processes, central SINTyS has also expressed its
intent to thoroughly document such progress, facilitating the creation of institutional
memory of the agency’s evolution.

43.     While the Bank does not currently have immediate plans for a follow-up project,
the topics addressed in SINTyS II remain of high relevance. There are positive signals
that future Bank engagement in Argentina would include a focus on strengthening
capacities of subnationals for public service delivery, and the availability of accurate and
timely fiscal and social information made possible through the data exchanges facilitated
by SINTyS would likely form an important input to such efforts.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

44.      The objectives pursued under the SINTyS II Project remain highly relevant and of
critical importance. Improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services
and fiscal programs at all levels of government continue to be shared priorities of the


16
   Through ISR#3 (December 2, 2009), Project procurement was assessed to be satisfactory; subsequent
assessments through the remainder of implementation were moderately satisfactory.
17
   In the first months of 2008 approximately 60 exchanges took place per month. By 2013, the number of
monthly exchanges had more than doubled.

                                                  11
Government of Argentina and the Bank, and as mentioned above, there are positive
signals that future Bank engagement in Argentina will reflect this commitment. By
facilitating the exchange of information on fiscal and social benefits between agencies at
multiple levels of government, SINTyS has contributed to the strengthening of such
agencies’ institutional capacity to effectively use their information and in doing so, likely
to have helped improve the efficiency and effectiveness of agencies’ associated social
and fiscal programs.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

45.       Overall, the Project could be said to have satisfactorily met its development
objective. Project activities have contributed to the improved identification of social
and/or fiscal attributes of physical and legal persons in Argentina, as evidenced by the
full achievement of PDO # 2 (92 percent of physical persons unequivocally identified by
SINTyS), #4 (32 percent of the population identified with family relationship data), and
#5 (38.2 million people identified with more than 75 percent confidence), and the partial
achievement of PDO #3 (60 percent of juridical persons unequivocally identified) (See
Table 3 below). The significant over-achievement of the target set for PDO #1 (number
of agencies using consistent common processes), as well as the achievement of the PDO
indicators measuring high network availability (PDO#7) and the reduction of highly
critical vulnerabilities exploited by pentests (PDO#8) are critical to the creation of the
enabling environment required for the sustainability of the information exchanges being
facilitated by SINTyS.
Table 3. PDO Indicators, Achievement Summary
                               Indicator

                                                12
46.     However as reflected in Table 3, three PDO targets set forth in the results
framework were not achieved as planned, leading to an evaluation of moderately
satisfactory performance against the metrics set forth in the Results Framework. SINTyS
has developed information exchange standards for 30 data types, but as formalization of
these by ONTI is still pending, the indicator is not considered to have been achieved. As
previously mentioned, the indicators related to verified fiscal gains (PDO#9 and #10)
were not measured as designed during implementation, and are thus considered to be
unmet. However, the Counterpart has developed a tool to estimate SINTyS’ potential
economic impact (see Annex 3 for details on the calculations carried out, and Section 3.3
for a summary of results), the results of which are suggestive of the potential for
significant savings from the identification of incorrect benefits, contributing to the
increased efficiency, effectiveness and impact of social services and fiscal programs.

47.      It is important to reiterate the Project’s substantial results, in line with both the
spirit of the overall development objective and the two specific objectives discussed in
the PAD (expansion and consolidation of the network, ensuring data protection,
accessibility, and quality; and consolidation of the institutionalization of SINTyS).
Intermediate indicators demonstrate such progress, with at least 22 of 49 intermediate
results indicators have been fully achieved and 21 others having demonstrated progress
towards achieving their corresponding targets, and the SINTyS network has continued to
expand and consolidate over program implementation. The development of tools
including SEWS (Servicio Web SINTyS, SINTyS Web Services) and VIAS (Ventanilla
de Integración Automática y Seguimiento, Window for Automatic Integration and
Monitoring) (among others) has allowed entities to improve the quality of their data and
facilitated the attainment of high-quality information in real time, with more and more
government agencies now utilizing web services (use increased from 7 to 91), and 8
national and 11 provincial agencies now use national information exchange standards.
Provincial support for such exchanges is evident, with twelve provinces financing the
salaries of their provincial coordinators in September 2013 (from a baseline of 4) and
conversations during supervision missions with provincial agencies in Formosa and San
Juan expressing their satisfaction with SINTyS’ services.

48.     Overall, substantial Program results were also achieved vis-à-vis the original
APL’s objective of improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services
and fiscal programs through institutionalized information exchanges – evident in both the
results of the SINTyS II loan described above, as well as the advances achieved under
SINTyS I and the corresponding component of the State Modernization loan.18

  The SINTyS I project was found (Report No. 36160-AR) to have successfully demonstrated the benefits
of comprehensive information exchange and won the participation of a sufficiently substantial number of
entities to establish consensus for widespread buy-in to the concepts and benefits, leading to national and
provincial agencies actively seeking SINTyS’ support to monitor their social spending and rationalize their
beneficiaries. Benefits of U.S. $130.5 million were estimated. Under the corresponding component of the
State Modernization Project (ICR No. 0000778), activities were found to have contributed to improving the
completeness, accuracy and reliability of agency data through cross-validation, which in served to enhance

                                                    13
3.3 Efficiency

49.    The activities undertaken have contributed to the increasing efficiency of
SINTyS’ services, with developments such as the VIAS tool having significantly reduced
the time required for data exchanges. 19 Similarly, the establishment of user profiles
within the system has allowed for important savings in time, eliminating the delays
previously encountered if the person responsible for physical verification was not present.

50.     Based upon the Counterpart’s calculations of potential economic benefit s, and
looking only at the number of deceased individuals identified among the social benefits
registries in 2013 (using the average value of benefits within each registry and assuming
that such individuals were dropped from the registries one month after identification),
potential savings of more than US$160 million were estimated – implying that savings
could be seven times the size of the US$20 million loan associated with SINTyS II in just
2013. These savings, combined with the on-time implementation of SINTyS II, suggests
that Project efficiency was high. Overall program efficiency is also quite high – while
total implementation was approximately five years longer than anticipated, the program
had a US$192.9 million fiscal impact between 1999 and 2007 (in addition to the potential
impact from SINTyS II), and was implemented using US$38 million in Bank funds
instead of the planned US$54 million.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

51.     Given the Project’s and the APL’s high relevance, substantial progress on project
and program objectives and the efficiency implied by the counterpart’s calculations on
the Project’s potential economic impact in 2013 alone, the overall Project outcome could
be considered to be satisfactory, as could the outcome of the APL program as a whole,
taking into account the savings reported under the SINTyS I and the corresponding
component of State Modernization I projects. While the outcome of the APL program is
therefore considered to be satisfactory, given the necessity of measuring the SINTyS II’s
project achievement against the formal Results Framework, and progress against the
corresponding PDO indicators – the overall Project outcome rating is viewed to be
moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




the targeting of social programs and reduce tax non- compliance (resulting in estimated benefits of over
US$60 million from reduced tax non-compliance and enhanced targeting of social programs).

19
  Before SINTyS, exchanging such information could take between five and six months. Over the years,
with SINTyS, the average number of days continued to decline, dropping from 38 days in the period
between creation and 2003 to 7 days in 2012, and now with VIAS one can have the information within 1 to
2 days

                                                    14
52.     While the project did not directly impact poverty, gender or social development,
the estimated potential impact of removing irregular claimants as beneficiaries of social
programs implies that the government will be able to direct social benefits to those in
greatest need, thereby indirectly contributing to poverty reduction and social
development policies.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.      As the Project focused upon the expansion and consolidation of sustainable
information exchanges, the SINTyS II project has contributed significantly to the
institutional strengthening of the national and provincial SINTyS offices. The technical
assistance provided by central SINTyS to the provincial offices has helped to strengthen
these offices’ capacities, and institutionalize their roles. At the central level, important
practices – including the setting of annual goals, the creation of monitoring dashboards to
monitor exchanges, and the development of a strong security environment – have been
institutionalized, and are expected to be sustained well beyond the scope of this particular
loan. Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, the continuing adherence of additional
agencies to the networks speaks to a growing culture of information sharing within the
public sector – an impact that while supported by the SINTyS II project, points to an
institutional change extending much further within the Argentinian public sector.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

54.    No unintended outcomes or impacts were identified.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

55.    Neither a beneficiary survey nor a stakeholder workshop was carried out.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

56.     It is clear that over the course of implementation, the institutionalization of
SINTyS as an agency has been achieved, and that it is no longer a “ project.” As
previously mentioned, SINTyS has succeeded in generating significant demand from
other agencies for its services, a place for itself within the institutional framework of
multiple levels of government (recognition as a National Directorate, receipt of funding
through the federal budget, provincial funding of provincial coordinators, etc.), and has
also started to share its experience with other developing countries. Important
management practices (regular monitoring of management indicators and creation of
monitoring dashboards, establishment of annual goals, capacity building efforts focused
on explaining the reasons behind policies - instead of simply focusing on the enforcement
of the policies themselves) have been internalized, and all indications to date suggest that
they will be maintained in the future.

57.   However, several issues remain to be addressed and could pose a challenge in the
medium to longer term. Covering the entirety of the state (with so many systems, and
                                            15
being so physically large) will continue to be a challenge moving ahead, and it may be
that expansion processes reaches a point where its advancement is limited by the
diversity of the actors involved. Given the rise in cloud technology, it also remains to be
seen how SINTyS will evolve. While such technology has the potential of permitting the
expansion to areas previously unreachable due to the challenges associated with their
maintenance of their individual servers, given the political importance associated with
local control of the data safe rooms, the extent to which this technology is able to be
taken advantage of in such contexts remains to be seen.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.    In designing the SINTyS II operation, the Bank team drew upon past experiences
with SINTyS and related projects, incorporating lessons learned from these experiences.
Given the progress at the time of design, the decision to combine Phases II and III under
the same APL seems to have been justified, and based upon the progress made during
implementation, have reflected an accurate assessment of what could be accomplished
over the Project’s five year implementation period.

59.     Nevertheless, it seems that some of the issues encountered during implementation
could have been diminished by further consideration of contextual realities and possible
implementation challenges during the design phase. The fact that discussions regarding
the need to adopt a new methodology to measure Project impact arose less than a year
after Project effectiveness suggests that design could have benefitted from a greater
analysis of the considerations surrounding its measurement. Additionally, design could
have merited from a greater consideration of the necessity and practicality of including so
many intermediate results indicators; in implementation, the large number of intermediate
indicators (53) proved to be somewhat cumbersome.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

60.      The Bank team played a very proactive role in Project implementation.
Supervision missions were carried out one to two times every year, and in between
missions, video conferences were arranged in order to facilitate a fluid dialogue with the
SINTyS team. During the period in which many procurement processes were being
undertaken, missions included detailed meetings with procurement staff and a permanent
dialogue between technical and procurement experts within the Bank and SINTyS was
maintained, helping to facilitate the timely completion of the Project’s highly technical
activities. From an early stage of implementation, Project supervision included active
discussions on the impact measurement methodology (which took longer than anticipated
to agree upon), and progress was followed up on both during missions and in between
video conferences, helping to support the development of the methodology developed to
                                            16
measure the Project’s potential impact. While surely complicated by the large number of
intermediate indicators established at design, a more detailed review of the modified
results framework would have helped to further facilitate the assessment process. The
intensive supervision should also be credited for supporting the Project’s full
implementation without requiring an extension, as well as the almost full disbursement of
loan resources.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     Considering the overall strength of project design and supervision, but in light of
the challenges encountered due to Project design, overall Bank performance is considered
to be moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

62.     During project preparation and implementation, the Government played a critical
role in supporting the expansion and institutionalization of SINTyS, and many of those
involved with the Project cited the strong level of Government support as one of the key
factors contributing to the Project’s success. Indeed, the Project’s success in overcoming
the challenges and concerns associated with inter-institutional sharing of data across
levels of government would not have been possible without the Government’s
demonstrated commitment to the agency and its work. In spite of its overarching
satisfactory performance, some of the activities that would have required the involvement
of multiple agencies (emitting of shared data standards, verification of fiscal benefits of
data exchange, creation of new advisory bodies) encountered some challenges which
could have been diminished through additional Government oversight.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

63.      SINTyS was very committed to the Project objectives of expanding and
consolidating the data exchange network, as well as the institutionalization of the agency
as an independent national entity. Its flexibility and proactivity in adjusting to
technological advances and the realities encountered during provincial expansion played
an important role in supporting the continuing development of the data exchange system.
The agency’s sustained effort to develop an impact assessment tool in spite of the
challenges faced with defining the methodology under this phase of the Project (and the
realities that made calculating the impact as planned at design technically complicated
and outside of the agency’s mandate), demonstrate its commitment to the Project and all
Project objectives.     Highly technical projects such as these can often encounter
significant delays in implementation, and SINTyS’ dedication to moving forward on
implementation, including the realization of complex procurement processes, was critical
to both overcoming the initial difficulties and the achievement of an on-time completion
of the SINTyS II Project in alignment with the Project’s development objectives.

                                            17
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     Considering the important role that Government support played in the project’s
successful completion and its continuing support to SINTyS as an agency – critical to the
agency’s institutionalization process –, and SINTyS’ successful achievement of the
Project’s development objective, overall borrower performance is considered to be
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

65.    Early institutionalization of SINTyS helped to ensure the sustainability of
project activities. The establishment of SINTyS as a National Directorate at the time of
loan design served as the foundation for later advances, signaling the Government’s
commitment to the agency’s institutionalization.

66.     Given the constant evolution in technology, it is critical that technology-
intensive projects be attentive to changes and how advances can impact their
business model. Because of SINTyS’ awareness of such changes as well as its flexibility
to adjust its strategy, the agency was able to leverage technological advances to expand
its subnational coverage.

67.     While the complexity of projects that are intensive in the procurement of
ICT products and services can often result in delays, strong coordination between
the SINTyS and the Bank team can help ensure the timely completion of planned
activities. In the case of SINTyS II, a hands-on approach, combining regular meetings
between the counterpart, the task team leader and procurement staff, was critical to
overcoming procurement challenges and facilitating the successful completion of the
project within the expected timeline.

68.    While project design should include sufficient indicators to monitor progress
on key aspects of implementation, too many results indicators can complicate
monitoring efforts. The large number of intermediate indicators in the SINTyS II results
framework complicated Project restructuring, contributing to challenges in the evaluation
of some Project outcomes.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
69.     Given the Project’s achievement of the general development objective and almost
all indicators, as well as its timely development, implementation and execution, the
Government views the Overall Outcome to be satisfactory.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1-Institutional and Legal Framework:

This component provided support to SINTyS authorities to further develop and
implement the institutional and legal framework required to ensure SINTyS' permanent
institutionalization within Argentina's public sector at the national, provincial, and
municipal levels. Specifically, the focus was to be on the definition of SINTyS'
institutional imprint, including its organizational structure, financial mechanisms, and
coordination among participating agencies, as well as its monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) and control mechanisms. In addition, this component was to focus on developing
mechanisms to ensure transparency and full compliance with Argentina's legal
framework and constitutional guarantees regarding privacy and confidentiality of
personal information.

This component also aimed to support the further expansion of SINTyS, not only by
incorporating additional government agencies at the national level but also by continuing
its decentralization at the subnational level (provincial and municipal).

Subcomponent 1.1-Institutional Framework: This subcomponent was to provide support
to SINTyS authorities to further develop its institutional framework, paying particular
attention to the development of an institutional imprint and governance structure
reflecting SINTyS' collaborative nature, with multiple users at the three levels of
government. The activities in this subcomponent were to be grouped into two main
categories: SINTyS’s institutional imprint (covering SINTyS’ organization structure,
financing mechanisms, coordination with other government agencies, advisory bodies,
and institutional arrangements) and monitoring and control (monitoring and evaluation
and management tools, and internal and external control mechanisms).

Subcomponent 1.2-Legal Framework: This subcomponent was to provide support for the
further strengthening and implementation of an effective legal framework and
complementary operational mechanisms to protect the privacy of data exchanged under
SINTyS, ensuring that only those with an authentic right have access to the information
and do not misuse it. The activities to be financed included design of SINTyS' privacy
protection framework, definition of access to information rights of individual agencies,
definition of compliance and enforcement frameworks, and drafting additional legislation
to guide the information exchange and promoting its adoption at the national and
provincial levels as well as to control the use, dissemination and disclosure of
information.

Subcomponent 1.3-Expansion at the Subnational Level: This subcomponent was to
continue to support SINTyS' ongoing expansion at the provincial and municipal levels,
furnishing them with the necessary knowledge and technical assistance. Activities within
this subcomponent were to include coordination across jurisdictions -national vis-a-vis
provincial governments; provincial vis-à-vis provincial and municipal governments- as



                                           20
well as legal agreements to support them, and ICT equipment. In addition, this
subcomponent was to support training and dissemination activities.

Outputs:

      Interconnected the provinces of Córdoba, Río Negro, Tucumán, San Juan,
       Formosa, La Rioja, Catamarca, Santa Cruz, Corrientes, Misiones, Entre Ríos and
       Chubut. Generated institutional conditions for the interconnection of Chaco,
       Santiago del Esterno, Tierra del Fuego and Neuquén.
      Over the period of the loan, 10,771 information exchanges took place (13,653
       over the entire life of the system).
      Since the creation of SINTyS, a total of 380 agreements have been reached with
       various jurisdictions, organizations, and national, provincial and municipal
       entities. 151 of these agreements correspond to the period of SINTyS II.
      211 regulations referring to SINTyS were approved. These regulations can be
       classified according to the jurisdiction in which they were emitted (national,
       provincial, municipal) and their thematic area (organizational structure,
       procedures, and those approving agreements).
      44,254 judicial requests were responded to.
      SINTyS’ website was designed on three occasions, with the goal of converting the
       site into a tool for diffusion, consultation, and communication with the
       organizations using SINTyS. As such, content was generated each time missions
       and meetings took place, or agreements were signed to communicate and share
       with the SINTyS community.
      Annual workshops were held with the coordinators and consultants in the
       Provincial Coordination Units. Within these workshops, advances in technology
       and services were presented and consultants were trained in the regulations
       associated with SINTyS’ functioning and the Law of Protection of Personal
       Information. Training was also carried out in the standards of the ISO 9001
       regulation of Quality Management, among others. These gatherings were also
       used to exchange experiences and strategies between provincial consultants,
       helping to spread knowledge of good practices amongst provinces.
      At least two video conferences were carried out each year with each of the 13
       provincial coordination units which have video conference equipment provided
       by SINTyS, allowing for the number of provincial missions to be reduced without
       a loss to fluid contact. (The video conference system was implemented in mid-
       2011, implying 65 video conferences (13 provinces*2 video conferences*2.5
       years).
      Diffusion and training events on information exchanges were organized with
       entities in the provinces of Tucumán, Mendoza, San Juan, Misiones, La Rioja,
       Corrientes, Jujuy, Catamarca, Entre Ríos, Río Negro, Forma, Tierra del Fuego,
       Salta and Córdoba.
      User and Administrator Manuals for SINTyS services were created for VUO
       (Ventanilla Única de Organismo, Entity Single Window), Web Services, SEWS,
       VIAS and CPM (Consulta Puntual Minima, Basic Consultations) in their different
       versions, according to technological modifications.

              Executive Summaries for the World Bank, Annual Reports for the Ministry of
              Social Development, and summaries of activities for the Ministry of Economy
              were prepared.

Component 2-Information Management and Data Quality Framework:

This component was to focus on further strengthening SINTyS' information management,
with a particular emphasis on enhancing the quality of the data being exchanged under
the system.

The specific objective of this component was to enhance SINTyS' information
management practices. Particular attention was to be given to enhancing the quality of the
data being exchanged under SINTyS so that it correctly represented the real-world
constructs to which it referred. Specifically, this component was to focus on ensuring that
data being exchanged under SINTyS is representative of the functions, responsibilities
and privileges of the government agency that provides it (i.e. that the information is
provided from an authentic source).

Subcomponent 2.1-Development of Data Standards: Activities under this subcomponent
were to support efforts to develop and implement common data standards and formats, so
that they could be adopted by the different government agencies that exchange
information through SINTyS. SINTyS, in association with ONTI, was spearheading an
effort to develop a set of data norms and standards to be applied throughout Argentina's
public sector. Both agencies were developing standards for the 30 most commonly used
data types (such as name and address) to homogenize criteria among government
agencies at the national level thereby facilitating the exchange of information.

Subcomponent2.2-Increasing Data from Authentic Sources: Early on in the
implementation process, SINTyS identified the need to support the digitalization of
information in those entities responsible for generating key social and fiscal data. This
subcomponent was to continue to support these efforts, with activities focusing on civil
registries, registries of juridical persons, the registry of students, and registries of deeds.




                                                                    24
Subcomponent 2.3-Information Management and Data Quality at the Agency Level: This
subcomponent was to support the efforts of government agencies participating in SINTyS
to enhance the quality at entry of data. The focus of these activities was to be on adopting
Web services and other applications aimed at reducing the number of errors in data entry;
adopting data quality management tools by participating government agencies; and
increasing awareness as to the importance of data quality and disseminating best practices
in data quality management among participating government agencies.

Subcomponent 2.4-Developing SINTyS' Information Management and Quality
Enhancement Framework: Since its inception, SINTyS' national office had placed great
emphasis on the enhancement of data quality and has gradually developed robust
mechanisms to ensure the same. This subcomponent was to continue to support these
efforts by developing a business intelligence unit within SINTyS' national office and a
data-quality advisory body with representation from participating government agencies.

Outputs:

       Creation of an index of people with 40.05 million people uniquely identified.
       Creation of a new data model for the integration of data sent to SINTyS,
        associating files by thematic area.
       Creation of a new model of exchange with crosses against entire thematic areas.
       This new data model allowed for the development of the tool VUO and the first
        versions of web services. Over time, these became the systems now known as
        SEWS and Judicial Processes (Oficios Judiciales)
       Receipt of information online, using Web Services, allowing for daily updates of
        information with entities such as RENAPER and the National Administration of
        Civil Aviation.
       Various methodologies for the receipt and sending of files were developed (First,
        CD, then mail, then Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), SWED (Servicios Web
        de Envío y Descarga), and finally VUO.
       VIAS also allows for the standardization of information to be later integrated into
        the system, the downloading of the results of exchanges, and access to the
        Results Dashboard.
       The Results Dashboard passed through two stages. In the first local version, the
        user carried out the process on their machine as a result of the information that it
        had received through the exchange. In the second online version, all entities can
        have access on the basis of having a VIAS password and having requested an
        exchange.
       A Data Quality Manual, detailing the steps that should be followed for the
        integration of a file sent to SINTyS, was designed.
       A methodology to evaluate, create and implement access to information profiles
        was developed.

An information management framework that
includes, among others, decentralized data                             Implicit in
quality management (Stage III) has been                                indicator                                        Not reported during
approved by the midterm review.                    Unspecified         description                                      implementation.


Component 3-Technological Framework for the Information Exchange:

 SINTyS is heavily dependent on a technologically advanced ICT architecture and robust
infrastructure for its information exchange system, which aims at providing
methodologies and tools for the development of a government-to-government (G2G)
platform for real-time, online exchanges of qualitative information, a prime production
factor for government bodies, among its participating institutions at the federal,
provincial, and municipal levels. This component supported the project's overall
information technology, telecommunication, and software development needs, with
specific support to the management, development, implementation, maintenance, and
continuous re-engineering of the technology and infrastructure; the definition of protocols
and standards for data exchange; and evaluation and adaptation of modern
telecommunication models to guarantee the highest reliability of the information
exchange.
                                                                         28
The objective of this component was to support the expansion and institutionalization of
information exchange that would: (1) eliminate barriers to information exchange among
participating institutions by continuing the implementation and financing of nodes at the
national and provincial levels; and (2) assist municipalities participating in the system
with technical assistance and targeted financing for software and hardware. This
objective not only aimed at physically expanding the network with hardware and
software but also supported the harmonization of the information flow for the social and
fiscal sectors with ICT tools and methodologies aimed at improving real time online data
exchange. In particular, this operation was to support the transition to a Service-oriented
Architecture (SOA) that would improve the system's flexibility while providing a model
for an interoperability platform to underlay current e-government efforts in the country.

Subcomponent 3.1-Consolidation of the Enabling Environment for the Information
Exchange System: The system's infrastructure requires that a comprehensive ICT
enabling environment, including policy and regulatory frameworks specific to ICT, be
defined to support the technology implemented as well as its continuous reengineering.
This subcomponent was to support the strengthening of the consultative bodies with
stakeholders for the improvement of ICT policies, necessary to regulate the information
exchange system. Specifically, this subcomponent was to strengthen the current
infrastructure to transition to an SOA architecture that included improvements in the
telecommunication network and adoption of an interoperability framework', and
established the needs and methodologies for international certification for IT,
telecommunication, and processes used in and for the system; in collaboration with the
security component, define and implement all required security, risk, and business
continuity plans; and, with the quality component, implement all necessary technological
processes needed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and quality of data exchanged
in the network; develop an M&E framework for the system to monitor activities
associated with the exchange of social and fiscal information and to measure the impact
of service resulting from the exchange of information in participant agencies; and provide
technical assistance to actual and potential participants to adopt and comply with the ICT
policies and standards of the system.

Subcomponent 3.2-Expansion and Consolidation of the System: At design, SINTyS'
exchange network includes five national nodes and six provincial nodes. Under the
proposed operation, the network was to be expanded to 10 national nodes, the remaining
provincial nodes, and a selected number of municipalities. This subcomponent was to
finance consultant services, hardware and software necessary to expand and consolidate
the infrastructure to all participants, and was to include the development and implement a
secure data center for SINTyS and explore the possibility for full redundancy in a
stakeholders' secure data center, national and/or provincial, to eliminate the costs for a
secure redundant data center as well as the development and implementation of a control
center to effectively monitor and evaluate the network and its nodes at every point at all
times, and an intranet.




                                            29
Subcomponent 3.3-Service Delivery: The main focus of the information exchange was to
provide services to authorized users using the current Ventanilla Única de Organismo
(VUO) web services and any other technology that became feasible during the operation,
with the following activities: development of web services tailored to users' needs,
resulting from the mapping of processes and information flow related to the social and
fiscal sectors that would include digital certificates and digital signatures over a public
key infrastructure; and exploration of the possibility to design a pilot project for a Web
service that would allow citizens to view their own data through the national e-
government portal.

Outputs:

      Through Multiprotocol Label Switching, SINTyS implemented a private
       communications network with multiple security and service protocols. This
       allowed for the interconnection of the nodes in 19 provinces, guaranteeing the
       quality of the data transfer and reduced communication costs.
      Within this framework, SINTyS implemented a secure internet protocol (IP)
       telephone network through an open source system. This channeled thousands of
       long distance calls through a secure connection and generated significant cost
       savings over the last five years for the provincial and national governments.
      Using the same technology, an advanced video conference system was
       implemented in all of the Provincial Coordination Units, allowing for an increase
       in communications and savings via reduced transport costs.
      All of the communications equipment implemented in the local area network has
       stringent administration, monitoring and security standards.
      Using databases generated and administered by SINTyS with information on each
       of the components necessary for data exchanges, a monitoring system was created.
      24 Blade servers were installed, and a super cluster of virtual machines created.
       About 250 servers in connected provinces, the national SINTyS, and
       interconnected entities have been virtualized.
      Data storage with stringent data security and availability measures has been
       implemented, and policies for safeguarding information strengthened.
      Complementary open source system for email services, printing, storage,
       monitoring of preventative and corrective maintenance, document management,
       administration models, and tracking of goods and technicians were implemented.
      Nineteen nodes within the provincial sphere and two in specific entities were
       computerized, with architecture in accordance with their physical availability and
       the needs of the SINTyS network. In each, servers for local services,
       communications equipment, work stations, printers, scanners, and video
       conference systems were provided.
      Implemented a backup and recovery manager for its Oracle-based database and
       implemented a redundancy in the databases, allowing for synchronizing a
       physical standby database with the production database, protecting data and
       allowing for high availability.
      A maximum security area was constructed for computing equipment. This space
       guarantees the safeguarding of the technological environment against

                                            30
    environmental threats, vandalism, and unauthorized access. The design follows
    international guidelines for protection and security.
   On-line services were developed. In 2013,VIAS was implemented, allowing for
    entities to exchange information in a secure manner, with the exchange
    automatically carrying out the controls necessary to guarantee the consistency and
    standardization of data.
   SEWS was also developed, allowing for entities to automatically interact with the
    SINTyS network through their own systems, validating online the data of physical
    or juridical people, and allowing for access to information based on entities’
    competencies. Punctual consultations are also facilitated through other services.
   A variety of applications were developed, including ones for punctual
    consultations of processes, administration of users by entities, SINTyS’ internal
    administration of users, a system for management of consultants, impact,
    indicators, administration of the information of all SINTyS users, updating
    RENAPER data daily, as well as one for SINTyS general administration.
   In coordination with the National Technological University to meet ONTI
    standards on Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and ISO 9000,
    95 percent of technicians were trained.
   A variety of processes were surveyed and corrected (listed below) within the
    framework of talks to become a certifying authority.

Component 4-Information Security:

For a system with SINTyS’ unique characteristics to function adequately, it is imperative
that an optimal level of information security be embedded in day-to-day operations of
this system, thereby ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
for all stakeholders involved. While the development of SINTyS' security framework
was included as part of
the infrastructure component under the first SINTyS operation, it was later designed as a
self-standing component under Phase II in order provide greater objectivity in the
detection of potential vulnerabilities by separating security and operational roles, and to
avoid any potential instances of conflict of interest between the two; and to increase
responsibilities in the area of security, including the development of security plans, to be
implemented not only at the SINTyS' national office but in SPFOs as well, that were
overloading the capacities of staff responsible to carry out IT operations.

The specific objective of this component was to support the further development and
implementation of a robust information security architecture and framework to ensure
that SINTyS can run operations safely and reliably. This component was to ensure that
constitutional guarantees for the privacy and confidentiality of individual information
exchanged under SINTyS was preserved and protected. This component was to finance
the development and implementation of tools and methodologies, as well as the purchase
of equipment for data security to protect the ICT system from unauthorized intrusion,
ensuring the physical security of the installations and monitoring user access to
information. It was also to be aimed at building relationships and spreading knowledge
among participating agencies, to foster awareness as to the importance of security within
the user community.

Subcomponent 4.1-Strengthening of the Security Enabling Environment: This
subcomponent was to focus on the establishment of an organizational structure for long-
term sustainability of the legal, logical, and physical security aspects that are related to
SINTyS, its exchange, and its participants. This subcomponent was to focus on defining
measures that would include the establishment of formal coordination mechanisms with
stakeholders, pertaining to the regulatory environment and compliance benchmarks in
Argentina with regards to the privacy of personal information that SINTyS could

                                                                      35
potentially face while dealing with public records and exchange proprietary information.
The main activities that were to be financed under this subcomponent were: enhancement
of the existing information security practice, within the SINTyS organization model, by
defining a separate unit for information security and formally establishing its relationship
with the other functional units; augmenting staff for the existing information security unit
to meet the future demands; development of a support model for the security network that
would allow central SINTyS to efficiently and effectively provide assistance; and
formulation of a process to integrate embedded security controls while providing
assistance in secured software development within SINTyS.

Subcomponent 4.2-Operational Strengthening and Support to Security Aspects:
The development of a risk-based information security management plan, infrastructure,
and support, to secure SINTyS and its nodes in participating institutions, was the focus of
this subcomponent. It was to include the following activities: security architecture and
framework and a risk-based approach, looking at operational risks, technology risks, and
regulatory risks.

Outputs:
    Creation of the area for computer audits. Multiple controls for the early detection
       of anomalies in use were designed, as were controls to safeguard SINTyS’
       computer assets.
    Since 2008, SINTyS has been aligning itself with international standards such as
       ISO 27001, and hopes to be certified in such in the short term.
    Internal and external training of security and auditing analysts
    Implementation of multifactor authentication mechanisms
    Periodic external perimeter audits and social engineering tests
    Elaboration and implementation of policies, standards, and procedures that
       support security
    Collaboration with the area developing applications, including training in secure
       development
    Deployment of a network of sensors of a system for detection and prevention of
       intrusion
    Fine-tuning of the Network Operations Center
    Security testing of new or updated applications
    Campaigns and training to raise the awareness of internal and external users of
       protection of SINTyS’ computer assets.
    Carried out an analysis of the business impact of computing assets and a risk
       analysis
    Elaboration of a contingency plan.
    Perimeter firewalls
    System for detection of intrusions
    Physical access controls and cameras
    9 policies (e.g. acceptable use, security, access control, etc.), 15 procedures (e.g.
       backup of security equipment, documentation control, retirement of equipment,

Component 5-Project Management:

This component aimed to provide the administrative, financial and budget management,
accounting, audit, procurement (goods, services and consultant services) and other
services support needed for project implementation according to the rules specified in the
Project Operation Manual and the Bank's procedures. This component was to provide
assistance to oversee project implementation and to manage the on-going SINTyS
program, ensuring that the benefits from the exchange of fiscal and social information
continued to be derived. Activities included under this component were to include:
strengthening the borrower's capacity to monitor and supervise the overall
implementation of the Project; provision of technical assistance to participating
government agencies in respect of SINTyS operations; strengthening the capacity of
participating provinces to implement SINTyS within their municipalities; strengthening
the capacity of participating municipalities to implement SINTyS at the municipal level;
and dissemination activities aimed at raising awareness among government agencies at
all levels of government of the main benefits that can be derived from the routine
exchange of information and the role of SINTyS in facilitating such exchange.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Since Phase I of the SINTyS program, demonstrating the agency’s fiscal impact has been
considered important for both generating interest in participating within the system as
well as serving as an indication of the corresponding investments’ efficiency. The
demonstration effect was considered to be particularly important in the first phase, where
the achievement of demonstrable results that would help to support the subsequent
expansion and institutionalization of the system was considered to be critical. Within this
context (and with a limited number of institutions participating), following a data
exchange, SINTyS followed up with organizations to request information on the benefits
obtained from the exchange and after the next exchange, verified whether the
incompatibilities identified in the previous exchange had been corrected, thereby
allowing for the calculation of a verified impact. In this way, SINTyS I and reallocation
under State Modernization I were found to have provided monetary benefits of more than
US$190 million.22

However, as noted in the main text, during implementation of SINTyS II, the agency did
not calculate the verified fiscal impact of SINTyS on incorrect benefits not awarded and
increased tax collections due to both the agency’s desire to not be seen as auditing the use
of information obtained through the exchanges as well as the technical complications
associated with calculating the verified impact given the significant increase in the
number of data exchanges.

Instead, the potential economic impact was calculated as follows. Using information on
beneficiaries included in massive data exchanges between February 2013 and January
2014 from databases containing information on the values of benefits, incompatibilities
were identified (with each person only counting once in the event of multiple
incompatibilities). Following the calculation of the average value of benefits in each
month, the potential impact of removing incompatibilities was calculated. This
information for 2013 was then used to further estimate the potential impacts in 2009-
2012. To do so, the value of potential savings was discounted by the Government
inflation rate. The potential economic impact per exchange in each year was then
calculated, and the amount multiplied by the number of exchanges carried out. Values
were converted to dollars using the average exchange rate for each year.

SINTyS carried out calculations under different scenarios, including one with only those
identified as deceased, and another including incompatibilities in social programs. Based
on the most conservative estimates (only deceased individuals who were identified and
assumed to have been dropped from beneficiary databases one month after their




22
  Under SINTyS I, from 2004 onwards, agencies verified monetary impacts. For the period 1999-2003,
SINTyS estimated the actual impact by multiplying the potential impact per period by the average
verification rate of the respective provinces.

                                                 40
identification23, and only considering 2013 so as to minimize the number of assumptions
made), an impact of approximately US$160.5 million is calculated.




23
  After one month, SINTyS assumes that the individuals identified as deceased have been removed from
benefits programs. While information is not available on how long it took for such individuals to be
identified prior to SINTyS, it was assumed that agencies would not engage in such crosses with the
National Registry of People (Registro Nacional de las Personas, RENAPER) as frequently, and that
identification would take more than a month.

information exchange system, aimed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services and fiscal programs at all levels of government in Argentina. The
specific objectives to be pursued under this operation are: (i) to expand and consolidate the network underlying the exchange of social and fiscal information among public agencies
at the national, provincial, and municipal levels of government, with provisions to ensure data protection, accessibility, and the quality and accuracy of information; and (ii) to
consolidate the institutionalization of SINTyS as an independent national entity responsible for coordinating and setting standards governing the exchange of information within
Argentina's public sector.

   The pretended mechanism would certainly be useful for citizens, particularly for those who need to rectify errors, even when it exceeds SINTyS's institutional mandate. However,
 there exist some constraints that would turn its practical implementation unfeasible. Some of these constraints are: (i) In order to allow citizens to access their personal data in
 compliance with national laws ('habeas data'), a mechanism for robust authentication has to be devised, implemented and maintained, capacity that largely exceeds SINTyS's
 current possibilities. In order to develop that capacity, SINTyS should grow considerably to allow for the required granularity country wide; (ii) By giving direct access to citizens,
 SINTyS's operational model would change from G-to-G (government to government) into G-to-C (government to citizen), what would in turn increase the associated
 information security risks by a manifold.

   The pretended mechanism would certainly be useful for citizens, particularly for those who need to rectify errors, even when it exceeds SINTyS's institutional mandate. However,
 there exist some constraints that would turn its practical implementation unfeasible. Some of these constraints are: (i) In order to allow citizens to access their personal data in
 compliance with national laws ('habeas data'), a mechanism for robust authentication has to be devised, implemented and maintained, capacity that largely exceeds SINTyS's
 current possibilities. In order to develop that capacity, SINTyS should grow considerably to allow for the required granularity country wide; (ii) By giving direct access to citizens,
 SINTyS's operational model would change from G-to-G (government to government) into G-to-C (government to citizen), what would in turn increase the associated
 information security risks by a manifold..

Subcomponent 2: Operational Strengthening and Support of Security Aspects
Intermediate Result (Subcomponent 4.2):
The information security practice within SINTyS is performed by specialists with the appropriate level of skill sets and the greatest degree of commitment to the project.
The personnel forming the core group of the information security practice within SINTyS are well-trained in their respective areas and are required to upgrade their skill sets to meet the changing needs of
the environment.
Training programs are conducted periodically to maintain basic information security awareness among the internal user community at SINTyS Central and the provinces.
Every SINTyS personnel has to undergo the training program and endorse a Security Awareness Statement (ESAS).
A formal Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has to be established to ensure that SINTyS’ day-to-day operations are not affected in the event of natural or a constructed crisis situation.
The BCP has to be tested and rehearsed by simulating crisis scenarios and role-playing multiple times during a calendar year.
Results of the simulated tests have to be shared with Management and included into the BCP for future reference.
Security events at all five layers of system composition (application, desktop, network, server, database) have to be monitored and correlated to proactively detect any potential anomalies and raise an alert
for further attention.
Formation of a computer security incident response team (CSIRT) within SINTyS that clearly defined roles and responsibilities and a set of standard operating procedures (SOP) that have to be taken in
the wake of a computer related emergency situation.
