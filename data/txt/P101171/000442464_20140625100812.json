        outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: early

Given the constant evolution in technology, it\n            is critical that technology intensive projects be attentive\n            to changes and how advances can impact business model.
