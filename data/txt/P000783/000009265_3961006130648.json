devaluation\n            of the franc of Central Africa. The Government's\n            program aims at restoring the competitiveness of the\n            Gabonese economy and laying the basis for growth and poverty\n            alleviation. The Government has already taken a series of\n            key measures to restore competitiveness and stabilize the\n            public finances. The main measures already taken are: a) the\n            adjustment of the parity of the currency; b) limiting wage\n            increases in the public sector; c) a reduction and\n            simplification of the imports tariff, and the implementation\n            of a preferential tariff in favor of imports from the\n            countries of the Central African Custom Union; d) a\n            reduction of the taxes on fuel; e) the preparation of a\n            revised Draft Budget Law for 1994 that provides for a\n            reallocation of funds to the social sectors, the elimination\n            of export taxes on exports other than wood and mineral\n            products, the elimination of some customs exemptions, and\n            the introduction of a value added tax. The Economic Recovery\n            Loan Project is designed to support the implementation of\n            these measures as well as a reform towards more efficient\n            pricing of energy and a further liberalization of trade."}, "docdt": "1994-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
