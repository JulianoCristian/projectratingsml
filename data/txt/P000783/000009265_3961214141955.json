project sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the ERL\n            provided the opportunity to strengthen the policy dialogue\n            with Gabon, following a period of several years during which\n            Bank involvement in the country had been constrained by the\n            absence of a sustainable macroeconomic framework and weak\n            commitment to reforms. It remains uncertain, however,\n            whether the Gabonese economy, served by oil reserves that\n            turned the country into the richest nation in continental\n            sub-Saharan Africa, was in need for immediate Bank support\n            following the devaluation. Building appropriate institutions\n            and mechanisms to monitor progress and implement reforms, so\n            as to strengthen the authorities' ability to overcome\n            conflicting political interests and forestall weaknesses in\n            administration (lack of appropriate administrative structure\n            and lack of institutional coordination and organization).\n            Program ownership and administrative coordination may be\n            better served by creating high-level committees to focus on\n            program implementation and monitoring."}, "docdt": "1996-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
