Some lessons\n            learned included: project design and implementation\n            arrangements need to be tailored to the client's\n            capacity, and work plans for at least the first year of all\n            project components need to be in place and agreed to before\n            the start of implementation. Major policy and legislative\n            reform across multiple sectors or sub-sectors, which require\n            prudent management of the political processes and of\n            multiple stakeholders, should not be expected to be\n            accomplished in only a few years. Establishing baseline and\n            target values for key indicators are and having an effective\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system are essential for\n            measuring progress and impact. Proactive supervision and\n            implementation support can overcome project design\n            weaknesses. A multi-component project covering an entire\n            sector of the economy can be an effective tool to address\n            issues across a range of related sub-sectors and thereby\n            generate important synergies. It also provides more\n            flexibility than a more narrowly focused project to respond\n            more quickly and readily to unforeseen new needs and\n            requirements, by allowing resource reallocations, shortening\n            decision-making processes and facilitating inter-agency\n            coordination and collaboration. Support services for\n            primarily poor clients, such as a rural advisory service,\n            are unlikely to attain financial viability and complete\n            self-financing in a transition economy and do require public\n            funding for their public-good aspects for a considerable time."}, "docdt": "2008-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
