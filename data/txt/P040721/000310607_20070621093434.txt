IntroductoryStatement

1.      This project paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to amend the
development objectives and scope o f the Kyrgyz Republic Agricultural Support Services
Project resulting from the need to provide urgent support to address the threat posed by
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The restructuring o f the project is
undertaken inparallel with other Bank efforts to fight against the global threat posed by
HPAI, in particular (i) Global Program for Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic
                          the
Preparedness and Response (GPAI) approved by the Board on January 12, 2006 and
(ii) KyrgyzRepublic:AvianInfluenzaControl&HumanPandemicPreparedness&
    the
Response Project (Grant No.H203 KG) approved by the Board on February 9,2006.

Backgroundand Reasonsfor Restructuring

2.      OnApril 9, 2007 the Government o f the Kyrgyz Republic formally requested the
restructuring o f Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP) in order to utilize project
savings o f around US$l.O million to support its efforts to prevent and contain'the risks o f
Avian Influenza.      The ASSP i s financed under Credit 3062-KG (SDR 11,100,000,
equivalent at the time to US$14.8 million), which was approved by the Board on May 7,
1998 andbecame effective on September 21, 1998.

3.      The proposed changes include (i) modification o f the development objective
                                              the
to include minimizing the threat posed to humans and to the poultry industry by Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection, (ii) addition of a new component on
                                                       the
HPAI related activities, and (iii) extension o f the closing date to June 30, 2008 to
                                    the
allow for completion o f activities under the new component.

4.      The restructuring would contribute to finance the Kyrgyz Republic - Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project which was
approved by the Board on February 9,2006 and became effective on July 10, 2006. The
project i s financed by an IDA grant o f $4.0 million and a Japanese PHRD grant o f $1.0
million, but it has a financing gap o f at least $1.1million.

5.      The original objective o f ASSP was to improve the incentive framework for, and
productivity, profitability, and sustainability of, the Kyrgyz agriculture, by means o f
assisting the Borrower in: (a) implementing land and agrarian reforms and providing
support for farm restructuring; (b) providing emerging private farms with advisory and
development services, and training in technology adaptation and use o f improved
production practices; (c) developing the seed industry; (d) establishing the legal
framework, organizations and procedures for plant protection and plant quarantine

services; (e) establishing an agricultural market information system; and (f) enhancing
the institutional capacity o f the Ministry o f Agriculture Water Resources and Processing
Industry.

6.      Despite some setbacks in the earlier years o f its implementation, the Project has
beenperforming satisfactorily. The Development Credit Agreement was signed on June
22, 1998. The closing date was extended on December 10,2003 and September 22,2005,
from its original December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2005 and then to the current June
30,2007.

7.      As the project approaches its closing date, savings o f aroundUS$l.O million
would be left unutilized. These savings originated from the following factors: (a) the task
team was able to mobilize grant funds from other donors to finance a number o f activities
that hadinitiallybeen expected to require IDA credit funding. Therefore the Government
opted for grant fundingrather than credit; and (b) the variation o f SDR/US$ exchange
rate duringproject implementation made available more U S dollars than initially planned.

8.      Meanwhile, currently there i s an urgent need for additional funding to increase
HPAI preparedness in Kyrgyzstan. If fact the Avian Influenza Control & Human
Pandemic Preparedness & Response Project (Grant No.H203 KG) which was approved
by the Board on February 9, 2006, had a financing gap which was estimated at the time
o f appraisal at around $1.1 million.

9.      The level o f risk o f HPAI inthe Kyrgyz Republic i s high because the country is
located on the flight path o f many migrating birds, and several neighboring countries,
such as Kazakhstan, China, Afghanistan, and Russia, have already suffered HPAI
outbreaks. At the moment the country does not have the capacity to detect or respond to
eventual outbreaks o f HPAI. The combination o f risk and low capacity results in
emergency needs.

ProposedChanges

10.     To accommodate for the above described emergency needs it i s proposed to
include an additional component on HPAI into the ASSP. This will not preclude the
achievement o f original project objectives, outcomes and outputs but will complement
them with added benefits o f stronger disease surveillance and control capacities in the
country.

11.     The proposed changes include (i) modification o f the development objective
                                            the
to include minimizing the threat posed to humans and to the poultry industry by Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection, (ii) addition o f a new component on
                                                       the
HPAI related activities, and (iii) extension o f the closing date to June 30, 2008 to
                                   the
allow for completiono f activities under the new component.

12.     The project savings would be utilized to achieve the development objective of the
Avian Influenza Control & Human Pandemic Preparedness & Response Project (Grant

  No. H203 KG). Therefore the following objective would be added to the original ones: to
  minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry by HPAI infection and to
  prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics. To achieve this, three areas
  will be supported by the project: (i)
                                      prevention, (ii)preparedness and planning and (iii)
  response and containment.

  13.     The components and activities implemented under the current Agricultural
  Support Services Project will be completed as planned on June 30, 2007. Only activities
  under the new component on HPAI related activities will be implemented during the
  period from July 1,2007 to June 30,2008. The results framework already approved inthe
  Project Appraisal Document o f the Influenza Control & Human Pandemic Preparedness
  & Response Project (Grant No.H203 KG) would be used to evaluate also the new
  additional component. In fact the US$1 million co-financing from the Agricultural
  Support Services Projects had already been considered and proposed inthe design o f the
  Influenza Control & Human Pandemic Preparedness & Response Project (Grant No.
  H203 KG), as indicatedinthe financing planfor that project shown inTable 1below.

  14.     The savings made available through the restructuring would be utilized to help
  finance the following sub-components o f the Avian Influenza Control & Human
 Pandemic Preparedness & ResponseProject (Grant No. H203 KG):

      I.AnimalHealthComponent

          (B) Strengtheningofthe PublicHealth SurveillanceSystem

  15.    Implementation arrangements. BothASSP and HPAI projects are implemented
 by the same implementingunit, the Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit (APIU)
 under the Ministry o f Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industries

(MAWRPI).The implementationcapacity ofthe APIU includinginterms o fprocurement
and financial management, has been assessed and found satisfactory. All exiting
implementation arrangements will remain effective, except for the changes suggested
below.

16.     Procurement.Thenew component will cover procurement o f goods andworks
related to the HPAIactivities. Procurement would be undertaken inaccordance with the
procedures set forth inthe Bank's "Guidelines-Procurement under IBRDLoans and
IDA Credits", dated May 2004 (the "Procurement Guidelines"). The thresholds for
procurement methods will be changed according to Table 2 below, so as to be consistent
with the thresholds established for the Avian InfluenzaControl & HumanPandemic
Preparedness& Response Project itself.

Analysis

19.     The utilization o f project savings will have no negative effects on the original
economic, financial, technical, institutional, or social aspects o f the project. Economic,
financial, technical, and social aspects of the HPAI activities were assessed during the
preparation o f the Avian Influenza Control & Human Pandemic Preparedness &
Response Project (Grant No. H203 KG). The Operational Manual and Procurement Plan
o f the Avian Influenza Control & Human Pandemic Preparedness & Response Project
(Grant No. H203 KG) will be amended to refer to the new component fimded under
ASSP.

20.     The proposed restructuringwill change the environmental category from the
current "C" to "B", signifying mediumrisks. To address andmitigate these risks an
EnvironmentalManagement Planfor the Avian InfluenzaControl & HumanPandemic
Preparedness & Response Project ( Grant No. H203 KG), satisfactory to the Association,
hasbeenadopted on November 1,2006. The EnvironmentalManagement Planwill be
amendedto includeHPAIactivities fundedunder ASSP.

Expected Outcomes

21.     Therestructuredproject would contribute to achieve the outcomes o fthe Avian
Influenza Control & Human Pandemic Preparedness& Response Project (P099453),
including
   National AI Strategy developed and adopted by government;
    Outbreak Containment Plan conforms with the guidelines o f FAO/OIEand GPAI;

   Capacity o f the veterinary Services and Ministry of Health is increasedthrough:
       o Increasedsurveillance capacityby strengthening laboratorydiagnostic
            capacity
       o Stafftrained insurveillance anddiagnostic methods;
       o Reporting andreactiontime for suspected cases ofAI is reduced to the
            minimallyacceptable levels;
    Emergency supplies procuredand available at strategic locations inthe field;
    Ifappropriate, ringvaccinationaroundinfectedareascompleted
    Culling,disposal anddisinfection activities completedas needed
   Compensation providedto poultry owners

Benefits and Risks

22.    The main benefit of the restructuringwould b e to address the financing gap of the
Avian Influenza Control & HumanPandemic Preparedness & ResponseProject. This
would allow the project to achieve its objective to minimize the threat posed byHPAI.
This would ultimately lead to saving lives and reducing hospitalization periods, which
would also contribute to the global objective ofreducingthe risk of apandemic.

23.    The restructured project would face the same risks identified inthe Project
Appraisal Document o f the Avian Influenza Control & Human Pandemic Preparedness &
Response Project. The main risks andmitigation measures are summarized inthe table          ,
below. Notwithstandingthese risks, project implementationof the project is proceeding        I
satisfactorily.
