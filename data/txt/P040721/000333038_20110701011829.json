Some lessons learned included: broad-spectrum\n            change in a complex sector where there is limited experience\n            can be made effective through a learning-oriented and\n            continuously adaptive program approach aimed at establishing\n            a platform for future development. While financial\n            independence for providers of agricultural services is\n            generally desirable, self-financing options need to take\n            account of the public goods nature of some services, the\n            special needs of poorer rural communities, and the rate at\n            which communities and entrepreneurs can adapt to a\n            pay-for-service environment. Inclusion of women and poorer\n            families in rural development can be particularly effective\n            if based on proactive investigation of the needs of\n            vulnerable groups, practical social and economic measures to\n            respond to these needs, and monitoring and adapting these\n            measures during implementation. A strong monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) system is particularly important for\n            projects that pioneer new approaches, and may need\n            adjustment as implementation progresses. Monitorable\n            indicators to measure achievements against the project\n            objectives, and M&E arrangements, need to be detailed\n            prior to project commencement including processes that\n            enable learning from evaluation results."}, "docdt": "2011-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
