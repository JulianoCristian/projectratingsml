Re:  Kyrgyz Republic: Cr. 3062-KG (Agricultural Support Services Project) -- 
Amendments to the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency: 
 
I
refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Credit Number 3062-KG) (Agricultural 
Support Services Project), dated June 22, 1998 (the Development Credit Agreement), between the 
Kyrgyz Republic (the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the 
Association).  I also refer to the letter from Mr. Toromyrzaev, First Deputy of the Minister of 
Finance, of July 11, 2003, requesting the Association to increase retroactively the percentage of 
expenditures to be financed for operating costs,
 
and to the agreements reached during the 
Associations’ mission to the Kyrgyz Republic from November 2 to 21, 2003, on the reallocation 
of the proceeds of the Credit and proposed changes of the aggregate amounts for procurement 
under the national shopping and small works.  I am pleased to inform you that the Association 
hereby agrees to amend the Development Credit Agreement as follows: 
 
1. 
The proceeds of the Credit as set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the 
Development Credit Agreement are reallocated as follows: SDR 452,944.32 from Category (2) 
(“Goods”); SDR 905,000 from Category (4) (“Operating Costs”); SDR 492,055.68 from  
Category (6) (“Unallocated”) to Category (1) (“Works”); and SDR 410,000 from Category (6) 
(“Unallocated”) to Category (3) (“Consultants’ Services and Training”). 
 
2. 
The percentage of expenditures to be financed for Operating Costs in Category (4) set 
forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement is revised to 
read as follows: 
 
“100% until June 30, 1999; 85% until June 30, 2000; and 80% thereafter.”  
 
The revised Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement reflecting above 
mentioned reallocation and amendment is attached as Annex to this amendment letter.   
 
3. 
The aggregate amount of “$124,000” in Paragraph 3, Part C, Section I, of Schedule 3 to 
the Development Credit Agreement is replaced with “$300,000”.  
 
4. 
The aggregate amount of “$300,000” in Paragraph 4, Part C, Section I of Schedule 3 to 
the Development Credit Agreement is replaced with “$1,200,000”.
