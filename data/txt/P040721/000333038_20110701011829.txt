                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEGWB incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments
are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report
has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report of the Agricultural Support Services
Project in the Kyrgyz Republic. The $30.2 million project was approved in May 1998 and
received an IDA Credit (Credit 3062) of $15.0 million equivalent. The original closing
date of December 31, 2003 was extended by 4 ½ years to June 30, 2008 through several
extensions: in December 2003 by two years to December 2005, in December 2005 by six
months to June 2007, in June 2007 by one month to July 2007, and, finally, in June 2007
by one year to June 30, 2008.

The report presents the Independent Evaluation Group‟s (IEG) findings based on review
of the project implementation completion report, appraisal report, credit agreement,
sector reports, and other relevant material; and an IEG mission to the Kyrgyz Republic in
December 2009. The mission visited project sites, and held discussions with government
officials and agencies, project directors and staff, beneficiaries, the private sector, key
donors and NGOs.

The Agricultural Support Services Project was chosen for assessment because it was an
unusually complex project that set out to create agricultural support services across a
broad spectrum of actions juxtaposed with land reforms to create a privately owned
farming sector. Experience with such a multi-dimensional approach has relevance to
future agricultural development in the Kyrgyz Republic and to other Commonwealth of
Independent States countries facing the same need to revamp agriculture after collapse of
the former collective farming systems.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft Project Performance Assessment
Report were sent to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for review. No comments
were received.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the experience and lessons of the
Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP) in the Kyrgyz Republic.

The objectives of ASSP were “to improve the incentive framework for, and productivity,
profitability, and sustainability of Kyrgyz agriculture.” This fitted well with the Kyrgyz
Republic‟s social and economic situation. In 1998, when ASSP was approved, the
country was still recovering from the collapse of the economy subsequent to withdrawal
from the Soviet bloc. Per capita income was only about one-tenth of average per capita
income in Europe and Central Asia, and about half of the population was classified as
poor. Faced with this situation, the highest priority of both the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic and the Bank was accelerated and pro-poor economic growth. Market-based
growth led by the private sector was the core of the strategy.

The rural sector featured prominently in this strategy, with good reason. In the mid-1990s
when ASSP was being prepared, agriculture contributed over 40 percent of GDP, and
two-thirds of the population, including the bulk of the poor, lived in rural areas.
Economically and socially there was a need to boost agricultural productivity and the
profitability of farming, which in turn would enhance rural incomes, and contribute to an
improving and more sustainable rural economy.

Yet agricultural value added, already low under the Soviet system, had fallen to three
quarters of its value before Independence. The collective farming system had
disintegrated and most of the land had since been distributed to rural families. This
created an entirely new agricultural sector based on private small-holder farmers. They
had minimal understanding of agricultural technology and environmentally sustainable
farming. But there was no agricultural training and extension system as this had not been
needed under the collectives. Other basic agricultural support services were also minimal
or absent. ASSP‟s four objectives - to boost agricultural productivity, profitability and
sustainability, and the incentives framework to achieve these goals were, thus, highly
relevant.

The project‟s design was substantially relevant to these objectives. The support activities
under ASSP – completing land distribution and privatization, establishing agricultural
advisory services, developing the seed industry, providing agricultural market
information, regulating pesticide use, and providing a plant quarantine service –
responded to most of the agricultural service gaps noted above. The design also included
several general orientations that proved effective, notably: substantial community
participation, development of a comprehensive legislative framework for all project
activities, and measures to integrate women and the poor. Between the components
chosen and the in-built orientations used to apply them, the project‟s design was well
suited to stimulate and enable a progression towards the more productive and sustainable
agriculture sector that the project objectives called for.

Nevertheless, the project was ambitious in what it set out to do. There were (including
four components added during project implementation) 12 components, six donor
                                            x


agencies and over 20 institutions involved. There were several options to simplify the
project, including divesting less essential components or having some components
financed and managed by other donor agencies in parallel projects. In the event, however,
good interagency coordination in the Kyrgyz Republic, and effective delegation within
the Bank of supervision responsibilities to the specialist teams already working in the
country (for instance, ASSP‟s microfinance pilot to the rural finance project supervision
team), largely overcame the implementation complications inherent in such a complex
project.

ASSP had significant achievements delivering its planned outputs. Under the Land and
Agrarian Reform component, 20 of the remaining 22 former collective farms were
disbanded and 240,000 hectares of land allocated to villagers. This increased privately
held land in the Kyrgyz Republic by one-third. The land allocation system was through a
transparent and equitable system and attracted few complaints. Additionally, free legal
services were provided, primarily to resolve disputes from past land distribution. An
agricultural extension service was also created covering all of the Kyrgyz Republic‟s
districts and providing a broad spectrum of technical and management advice. An
agricultural market information system was scaled-up to provide information through
various media on agricultural prices. A micro-credit component provided small loans to
poor farmer groups based on their group commitments to repay. The project‟s crop
protection and plant quarantine component established legislation, regulations and
laboratories to monitor pesticide use and plant diseases. The seed development
component transformed a dysfunctional and monopolized state seed production system to
a decentralized and competitive seed industry. A community seed production component
was added during project implementation, focused on poor communities in remote areas.
A pilot program for community managed pastures and preparation of related legislation
was also added to ASSP. The model and learning from the pilot pastures has been the
basis for a nation-wide pasture management program included as the largest component
of ASSP‟s follow-on project, the Agricultural Investments and Services Project. ASSP
was also used as an immediately accessible financing source for repairing flood damaged
protection works on a river and for urgent provision of facilities and mechanisms to
reduce the risks of avian influenza.

Of particular note is ASSP‟s exemplary approach to social issues. The extension service
had as many women advisors as men; as many women were trained as men; free legal
advice on land issues was particularly helpful to women; micro-credit and community
seed production were specifically channeled to poorer communities including women;
and all social groups were involved in pasture management.

Assessing the efficacy of ASSP must contend with the very limited outcome data
provided by the project‟s M&E system. Nevertheless, based on proxy data, other sources
of information and IEG field observations and interviews, achievements against three of
the objectives (improving productivity, profitability and the incentives framework for
agriculture) had substantial efficacy, while the efficacy of the remaining objective
(improving agricultural sustainability) was modest.

As concerns the productivity objective, the 2003 agricultural census found that family
farms were about six times more productive than the collectives, and the land reform
                                             xi


component could be expected to have contributed to this transformation. A national
survey found that some 80 percent of farmers considered ASSP‟s agricultural extension
system to be of good quality and to have met their needs – these positive views would be
consistent with improving productivity. There are also a few direct measures of
productivity gains – under integrated production management, yield increases of between
10 to 30 percent have been recorded, and communities in the pasture management pilot
increased pasture yields by 25 and 40 percent respectively, for winter and summer
pasture.

Profitability appears to have increased as well. First, a close causal relationship between
increased productivity and profitability can reasonably be assumed. There are also a
number of proxy indicators that imply higher agricultural returns from ASSP services: for
instance, micro-credit had a 98 percent repayment rate; some 80 percent of the
community seed production groups are financially viable, and the number of private
producers selling seed at commercial rates has increased rapidly, indicating that farmers
consider use of improved seed a remunerative activity.

The efficacy of ASSP at improving the sustainability of Kyrgyz agriculture was uneven.
Environmentally, the project had a number of activities that would promote more
sustainable agricultural practices; for instance, land ownership provided farmers a direct
interest in preserving the fertility of their fields, and communal pasture management
reduced overgrazing. However, funds for several support services were reduced at the
end of the project, reducing their effectiveness. The crop protection and plant quarantine
laboratories became dysfunctional due to inadequate funding for their operations. For the
same reason the market information program has contracted, and agricultural extension,
also with reduced funds, faces an uncertain future.

ASSP‟s efficacy at improving the incentives framework was substantial. The project‟s
most fundamental contribution to the enhancement of agricultural incentives was its land
reform activities. ASSP substantially completed the land reform program, thereby
consolidating the transfer of land to private ownership. Gains in productivity and
efficiency, and hence of profits, went entirely to the farmer, and the farmer also had a
direct interest in sustaining the quality of his land. These changes provided the incentives
framework for increasing productivity and profitability and for sustaining the farm
environment.

Concerning efficiency, an economic rate of return was not calculated for ASSP, and
indeed, there is insufficient data with which to calculate one. But proxy information such
as the interest of farmers in adopting new agricultural technologies, participating in
training and using improved seed, suggests that project activities were viable. ASSP also
appears relatively cost-effective compared with irrigation improvement, the country‟s
other main agricultural intervention supported by the Bank. These observations suggest
that ASSP had a positive economic impact but data is insufficient to make an informed
judgment on the project‟s cost-benefit ratio. There are also uncertainties regarding the
sustainability of some of the project‟s components. Accordingly, while there is enough
information to conclude that efficiency was at any rate modest, there is not enough to
presume that it was substantial.
                                              xii


An additional consideration in the assessment of ASSP‟s outcome is the weakness of
M&E - ASSP was a pioneer project, and a learning and adjustment process based on
good information was particularly needed. A responsive M&E system could have made
decisions more sharply focused on what actions make a difference, and how activities can
be better tuned to needs. It would also have provided a stronger empirical base to design
ASSP‟s successor project.

In summary, taking account of ASSP‟s relevance, efficacy and efficiency, the project has
been predominantly satisfactory, but the project‟s achievements are qualified by several
factors: the sustainability issue; insufficient information on the project‟s efficiency; and
weak M&E. ASSP‟s outcome is thus assessed moderately satisfactory. Nevertheless, a
broader achievement of ASSP going beyond a project-specific evaluation should be
recognized.

ASSP was more an adaptive program of change than a typical investment project. All
components were new activities, and were also being established by personnel without
experience, mostly in newly formed institutions. In essence, each component was an
experiment, and implementation provided a learning process. There were mistakes along
the way, such as the initial monopolistic approach to seed production which required
complete redesign to foster a competitive private sector. Most components were
significantly adapted over the project period. However, through this adaptive change
process, by project completion, ASSP had created a platform of experience, an
institutional capacity, a legislative framework, and a core of trained personnel for future
agricultural development. This base – a potential springboard for future development of
the country‟s agricultural support services – was ASSP‟s most fundamental achievement.

As the Kyrgyz Republic moves forward a significant risk to development outcome needs
attention – provision of funds for each support service and, related to this, the degree to
which each service can be self-financing. The downsizing of several agricultural services
places particular urgency on finding a solution to the financing shortfalls. Government‟s
current intention is to make agricultural institutions financially self sufficient, and indeed,
some services such as seed production and extension advice to large farm enterprises can
be self-financing through fees. But other services such as research or extension advice for
poor isolated communities have public good elements and collecting fees is difficult.

As concerns the performance of the Bank, quality at entry was moderately satisfactory,
because, although the strategy and technical features for ASSP were sound, M&E was
poorly designed. Supervision, however, was satisfactory. Although more could have been
done to revamp the M&E program, in other respects supervision was strong. Particular
strengths were in encouraging adaptations of components as experience was gained;
providing informal coordination of the activities of other donors; giving practical advice
to the implementing agencies as needed; and promoting the project‟s social inclusion
activities. Taking account of both quality at entry and supervision, the Bank‟s overall
performance was moderately satisfactory. For the borrower, Government provided
generally supportive back-up during project implementation and passed extensive
legislation to underpin ASSP‟s activities. But the inadequacy of counterpart funding was
a chronic problem. Government performance is thus rated moderately satisfactory. The
performance of the implementing agencies was generally satisfactory – a remarkable
                                          xiii


achievement given that they had no or minimal experience with ASSP activities and a
number of the institutions were new. Overall borrower performance was moderately
satisfactory.

The experience gained under the ASSP yields the following main lessons:

      Broad-spectrum change in a complex sector where there is limited experience can
       be made effective through a learning-oriented and continuously adaptive program
       approach aimed at establishing a platform for future development.

      While financial independence for providers of agricultural services is generally
       desirable, self-financing options need to take account of the public goods nature
       of some services, the special needs of poorer rural communities, and the rate at
       which communities and entrepreneurs can adapt to a pay-for-service environment.

      Inclusion of women and poorer families in rural development can be particularly
       effective if based on proactive investigation of the needs of vulnerable groups,
       practical social and economic measures to respond to these needs, and monitoring
       and adapting these measures during implementation.

      A strong M&E system is particularly important for projects that pioneer new
       approaches, and may need adjustment as implementation progresses. Monitorable
       indicators to measure achievements against the project objectives, and M&E
       arrangements, need to be detailed prior to project commencement including
       processes that enable learning from evaluation results.

1.      Agricultural Development Issues
1.1. For both the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Bank, accelerated and pro-
poor economic growth is considered to be the country‟s highest development priority. The
Kyrgyz Republic is a low-income country with a population of about 5.3 million and a per
capita gross national income estimated in 2008 to be about $790 – one tenth of average per
capita income in Europe and Central Asia. Since the mid-1990s, after the first shock from
withdrawal from the Soviet bloc in 1990, economic growth has averaged about 4.4 percent
per year (1998-2008), increasing to about 8 percent per annum in 2007 and 2008.

1.2. The Kyrgyz Republic is landlocked, making communications and trade more
difficult, and has a quite limited resource base. Gold and hydropower are the two main
natural resources and reserves of the former are reported to be diminishing. In the absence of
significant industrial activity, agriculture has been a mainstay of the economy. However, the
rural environment is not favorable to agriculture: The country‟s mountainous terrain leaves
only about seven percent of land area well suited for arable farming, and the country‟s
geographic isolation limits export prospects. Nevertheless, in the mid-1990s, when ASSP
was being prepared, agriculture contributed over 40 percent of GDP, and two-thirds of the
population, including the bulk of the poor, lived in rural areas. Economically and socially,
there was a need to boost agricultural productivity. But the agricultural sector‟s growth rate –
which averaged 2.5 percent per annum in 1998-2008 – is not enough to provide the
development engine that the Kyrgyz Republic sorely requires. An upturn in agricultural
performance is needed.1

1.3. The 1998 Country Assistance Strategy, in the same year that the Agricultural Support
Services Project (ASSP) was approved, emphasized development of the rural sector, poverty
alleviation and better governance. Over time, while maintaining rural and pro-poor growth as
a key objective, the governance aspects of development have assumed greater importance.
Government‟s Country Development Strategy for 2007-2010 had four pillars: growth-
oriented economic policies; improving the business environment; better governance; and
more transparent public administration. The Joint Country Support Strategy for the Kyrgyz
Republic (2007-2010) (issued by the World Bank, and other development partners) was in
similar vein.

1.4. Accelerated economic growth required transition from an economy constrained by an
unwieldy public sector and regulatory system to a market economy spurred by supportive
development services and an enabling legal and institutional environment. This private-sector
oriented growth strategy has been a consistent objective for the Kyrgyz Republic throughout
the last decade, and applies as much to the rural sector as to industry and commerce.
However, the organization of agriculture under state-directed collectives during the Soviet
period provided anything but a liberalized and market-based agricultural sector, and was
marked by an absence of services necessary for innovative and productivity-enhancing
agricultural growth. There had, for instance, been no need for an agricultural extension

1. Data are primarily from the Joint Country Support Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (2007-2010) (World
Bank, and other development partners), and the Country Development Strategy for 2007-2010 (Government of
the Kyrgyz Republic).

service under the collectives system. Market information was also not needed in a directed
economy. And even where some form of service had existed, such as production of seed, by
the time ASSP was being prepared, nearly a decade after independence, facilities had
degenerated and most staff had left the concerned institutions. In short, there was an urgent
need to establish the agricultural support services typically required for a modern and
productive agricultural sector. And these services needed to be geared towards facilitating
development of a private rather than public sector led agricultural economy, and to boosting
growth.

1.5. There was also a need to ensure that economic growth was broad-based and pro-poor.
The proportion of the population classified as poor has fallen, but as recently as 2007 the
poverty rate was 35 percent. The bulk of the poor live in rural areas, and remote villages have
particularly high poverty indices. The approach to poverty alleviation articulated in the 2009
Joint Country Support Strategy Progress Report relies primarily on the Government‟s and
Bank‟s growth-oriented economic policies and assumes that higher GDP growth will have
spill-over impact on poverty. Thus, the 2007 Joint Country Support Strategy (page 8)
estimates that: “For every 1 percent increase in GDP per capita during 2003-2005, extreme
poverty fell by 5 percent and overall poverty fell by 2 percent.”2



2.       Project Structure and Management Arrangements
Project Objectives
2.1. The objectives of the Kyrgyz Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP) were to
improve the incentive framework for, and productivity, profitability, and sustainability of
Kyrgyz agriculture.3

Project Outputs
2.2. The intended means (“project outputs”) to achieve these objectives, each supported
by a project component (Box 1), were:

                 Land and agrarian reform (LAR) to consolidate the handover of former
                  collective and state farms to private ownership of family or cooperative
                  farming units;
                 Establishing rural advisory and development services (RADS) aimed to
                  provide agricultural extension services to advise the new farmers in technical
                  and managerial skills, and to pilot micro-credit;



2. Of note, however, is the relatively low disparity of incomes in the Kyrgyz Republic – the country had a Gini
coefficient of about 0.3 in the 2000-2005 period. This is lower than most Europe and Central Asia countries,
suggesting that low incomes and poverty are generalized across much of Kyrgyz‟s population.
3. From Project Appraisal Document. The Credit Agreement has similar wording.
                                              3


              Developing the seed industry by creating institutional capacity to produce
               seed varieties of major crops for multiplication by commercial producers;
              Establishing crop protection and plant quarantine services for regulating
               pesticide use and quarantining of new crop varieties;
              Developing an agricultural market information service to inform farmers and
               marketing businesses of agricultural prices; and
              Creating within the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) an
               Agricultural projects implementation unit for project co-ordination.

2.3. During ASSP‟s implementation, four additional outputs and associated components
were added to the project: (i) Community Seed Production (added in 2001 as an addition to
ASSP‟s seed industry component) to pilot multiplication and distribution of seeds by poor
communities in mountainous regions; (ii) Pasture Management (added to the land reform
component in 2006) to pilot community management of pastures; (iii) Flood Damage Repair
(added in 2004) of infrastructure along a river for better protection against floods; and (iv)
Avian Influenza Protection (added in 2007) to create facilities and institutional capacity to
reduce the risks of an avian influenza outbreak, and to provide increased capacity to mitigate
any such outbreak.

Box 1: Objectives and Components of the Kyrgyz Agricultural Support Services
Project
Development Objectives :
To improve the incentive framework for, and productivity, profitability, and sustainability of Kyrgyz
agriculture.
(From the Project Appraisal Document)

Original Components:
1. Land and Agrarian Reform (Appraisal Cost US$ 4.7 million, Actual Cost US$ 3.4 million). (i) Completion
of the distribution of land and non-land assets, including rectifying previous errors and inequities; (ii)
Establishing a legal and regulatory framework for land market development; (iii) Capacity building of the
Centers for Land and Agrarian Reform (CLARs) and of the State Agency for Land Management and Land
Resources (SALMLR); and (iv) Establishment of policies and procedures for auctions/leasing of land.
2. Rural Advisory and Development Services (Appraisal Cost US$ 12.4 million, Actual Cost US$ 7.5
million). Assisting small scale private farms to develop profitable farming units by providing technical and farm
management knowledge, supporting agricultural research, and increasing access to credit.
3. Seed Industry Development (Appraisal Cost US$ 8,9 million, Actual Cost US$ 5.8 million). (i) Acquiring a
wide range of cereal and forage germplasm to provide the foundation for developing new varieties; (ii)
rehabilitating seed production, processing and distribution facilities; (iii) demonstrating seed production on pilot
farms to promote commercial production; (iv) Strengthening the capacity of MAWR for developing and
implementing a seed policy and regulatory services for variety testing, registration and seed certification; (v)
supporting the development of a legal framework for the protection of breeders‟ rights; and vi) funding
publications and dissemination of variety testing results and seed industry information.
4. Crop Protection and Plant Quarantine (Appraisal Cost US$ 1.5 million, Actual Cost US$ 1.1 million). (i)
Establishing the legal framework for regulation of pesticide use; (ii) Implementation and application of the
pesticide registration system; (iii) Rehabilitating plant quarantine facilities; and iv) Providing support for
Kyrgyz membership in the European Plant Protection Organization.
5. Agricultural Market Information (Appraisal Cost US$ 1.8 million, Actual Cost US$ 1.3 million).
Expanding the existing market information system to cover the whole country to provide up to date information
on produce prices.
6. Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit (Appraisal Cost US$ 0.9 million, Actual Cost US$ 0.9 million)
Establishing an Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit within the Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources for overall project coordination, including financing of staff, equipment and operating costs.

Additional components/sub-components added during project implementation:
7. Community Seed Production. Multiplication and distribution of seeds by poor communities in mountainous
regions on a self-financing basis after provision of initial grants and training. (This was added in 2001 as a sub-
component of the Seed Industry Development component. Specific costs have not been separately calculated,
but were probably less than US$ 200,000 overall).
8. Pasture Management. Piloting of community management of pastures and development of an associated
legal framework (added in 2006). Specific costs have not been separately calculated, but probably totaled less
than US$ 150,000).
9. Flood Damage Repair. (reallocation of $2.2 million from other components) Added in March 2004.
Repairing the Kugart river with bank protection embankments, river-bed cleaning, check dam rebuilding,
developing a siltation model, and capacity building.
10. Avian Influenza Protection. Added in January 2007 to help address the threat of Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (HPAI). Costs at project completion were US$ 1.1 million. The objective was to minimize the threat
posed to humans and to the poultry industry by HPAI and to prepare for, control and respond to this threat.
Savings from other components were used to supplement the financing provided by IDA for the HPAI project.
ASSP financed activities included rehabilitating and equipping four veterinary laboratories and constructing
safe animal carcass disposal facilities in various locations throughout the country.

Implementation Period and Costs
2.4. The originally intended implementation period of ASSP of 5 ½ years (from Board
approval in May 1998 to closure in December 2003) was increased by 4 ½ years through four
extensions, resulting in a 10 year project overall.4 The actual project costs of US$ 23.3
million were 77 percent of appraisal estimates, the savings being primarily due to a
devaluation of the Som. The costs at completion included the costs of flood damage repair
and avian influenza protection, costing a total of US$ 3.3 million. By project closure, US$
13.4 million of the US$ 15.0 million Credit had been disbursed.

Project Coordination and Institutions Involved
2.5. An Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit (APIU) was established within the
MAWR for coordination of ASSP5 and staffed with well qualified Kyrgyz consultants.
ASSP‟s broad objectives required involvement of over 20 institutions (Box 2). A notable
feature was the rudimentary or non-existent institutional and technical capacity in each sub-
sector when the project first began.




4. The four extensions were: In December 2003 by two years to December 2005; in December 2005 by 1 ½
years to June 2007; in June 2007 by one month to July 2007; and finally, in June 2007 by one year to June 30,
2008.
5. When ASSP was initiated, the Coordination Unit was termed the Projects Implementation Unit, and the
Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources was renamed, later in the project, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Water Resources and Processing Industry.

2.6. Development agencies. The project became a fulcrum for the rural development
programs of a number of aid agencies. The International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) provided the largest financial assistance with a Credit of US$ 7.9 million and was a
formally integrated lending partner with the Bank. IFAD‟s funding was all to the Rural
Advisory and Development Services component. The other agencies mainly funded technical
assistance for implementing the different project components. The agencies included: the
                                                       7


Swiss Development Cooperation (supporting ASSP‟s rural advisory services); the
Department for International Development (UK) – for the land and agrarian reform and rural
advisory services), TACIS (Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent
States, Economic Union) supporting ASSP‟s seeds and market information components;
Swedish Aid and GTZ for the seeds component; the United Nations Development Program
for microcredit; and the Food and Agriculture Organization supporting integrated production
management in the rural advisory services and crop protection and plant quarantine
components. The Bank was the lead agency for supervision of ASSP and covered the project
as a whole. This included supervision on IFAD‟s behalf of the rural advisory services which
the Bank did not finance. Despite the number of development agencies involved, interactions
and mutual support between them were generally good, and the APIU and the Bank were
effective coordinators.

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.7. The quality of ASSP‟s monitoring and evaluation system is assessed based on the
design, implementation and utilization of M&E:

       Design. The PAD comments that the APIU would be responsible for monitoring
        (page 44) and refers to monitorable indicators in the project log frame (the PAD‟s
        Annex A). Indicators in the log frame are useful as measures of project progress - as
        “output” indicators such as land and property shares distributed and quantities of seed
        distributed. But clear outcome indicators linked to the project‟s objectives in a
        measurable results framework were lacking. There were also virtually no baseline
        data or targets, the PAD referring only to preparation by the APIU during project
        implementation of more detailed indicators. Further, implementation arrangements
        for the M&E program were not developed,6 and processes for learning from the
        evaluation were not considered.
       Implementation. The gaps above were partly rectified in the case of the RADS. A
        set of monitorable indicators was developed early in the project period (2000),
        enabling monitoring of RADS achievements from ASSP‟s second year. Some 16 staff
        (two per oblast) were recruited for the work and received training in M&E practices.
        Additionally, there was a survey of farmer attitudes towards the RADS7 and surveys
        over time of several villages, but not enough villages to be statistically reliable. 8
        Monitoring of other components was generally confined to information on
        implementation progress. Even for the RADS, monitoring was largely confined to
        output achievements and not to achievements of the project‟s outcome objectives.


6. Implementation details would include defined sources of monitoring information; the frequency and detail of
surveys and M&E reports; the organizational structure, responsibilities and implementation schedule to
implement the M&E program and to provide relevant information to project managers and policy makers; and
an estimated budget to fund the M&E activities.
7. “Survey on Level of Ownership of Kyrgyz Farmers towards the Rural Advisory Service Network”, Rural
Development Fund, September 2006.
8. The village surveys were reported in the “Repeated Baseline Survey”, Center for Sociological Studies,
National Academy of Sciences, Kyrgyz Republic, 2007.
                                              8


        Utilization. All components had some data to measure project progress, which was
         generally reported on a semi-annual basis. This was a useful monitoring tool for the
         APIU and the respective managers of the project components. However,
         measurement of outcomes, and more qualitative measures of project performance
         remained limited, which was inappropriate given that ASSP‟s activities were
         unproven and would have benefitted from more factually based learning. The data
         situation has got better over time, partly due to the surveys and also to more emphasis
         on monitoring outcomes by some component managers (for instance, the informative
         productivity data recently released by the Agricultural Investments and Services
         Project‟s (AISP) pasture management group.

2.8. Overall quality of M&E: ASSP put in place a Management Information System on
project progress, which became useful for project decision makers. But the project‟s M&E
system did not track achievements relative to its objectives. The quality of ASSP‟s M&E
program was Modest.

Safeguards and Fiduciary Issues
2.9. The project was classified as category C, with no safeguards issues triggered and no
requirement for an environmental assessment. Environmental impact is likely to have been
positive, especially from activities such as ASSP‟s promotion of soil-conserving agronomic
practices and pasture management. And the project‟s actions to include women and poorer
households were exemplary (paras. 9.7 to 9.10).

2.10. In distinct contrast, fiduciary management was poor in the first two years of
implementation, with no dedicated financial specialist for ASSP management, weak
accounting generally, and US$ 6,000 of funds for procurement of seeds unaccounted for (this
was investigated and eventually recovered). From 2001, under the APIU‟s leadership,
financial management, accounting and procurement were brought to satisfactory status.



3.       Relevance
Relevance of Objectives
3.1. ASSP‟s objective to “improve the incentive framework for, and productivity,
profitability and sustainability of Kyrgyz agriculture” had High relevance to the Kyrgyz
Republic‟s socio-economic circumstances and to the development strategies of the
Government and the Bank, at present and at the time when ASSP was appraised. Both the
Joint Country Support Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (2007-2010) (World Bank and other
development partners) and Government‟s Country Development Strategy for 2007-2010
place GDP growth as the nation‟s highest development priority. This was also a priority in
the 1998 Country Assistance Strategy. The growth strategy necessitates a robust contribution
from the agriculture sector which generated 44 percent of GDP when ASSP was appraised.
Increased agricultural productivity would in turn boost profitability and farm incomes and a
                                               9


more sustainable agrarian economy. Moreover, there is a social dimension as the bulk of the
poor live in rural areas.

3.2. The need for agricultural growth was particularly acute at the time ASSP was
prepared. Independence in 1991 had left Kyrgyz‟s agriculture sector with a heritage of
centrally directed collective and state farms. Agricultural productivity, already low under the
Soviet system, had then deteriorated markedly – to three-quarters of the agricultural value
added in the Soviet era. This situation required development of key agricultural services to
raise agricultural productivity. Agrarian reform (distribution of collective lands to rural
families) had created a new and totally different farming sector based primarily on privately
owned small family farms. However, these families had minimal or no technical and
managerial knowledge of farming (collective workers had typically only undertaken a
specific task under close supervision). Agricultural advisory, market information, and credit
services did not exist as they had not been needed under the collective system, and, even
when some capability and infrastructure had been present, such as in seed production or
irrigation, neglect in the immediate years after Independence had left such facilities
dysfunctional.

Relevance of Design
3.3. The means (project outputs) to achieve ASSP‟s objectives were well chosen. By
continuing agrarian reform, providing agricultural advice, producing higher yielding seed,
developing crop protection and plant quarantine services, disseminating agricultural market
information and strengthening the institutional capacity of the MAWR; the project was
responsive to the gaps in support services noted above. Taken together these actions could be
expected to provide a significant boost to all of ASSP‟s objectives- land reform created a
private farm sector where farmers had direct incentives to increase their profits by increasing
productivity, and to sustain the quality of their soils, as economic and environmental gains or
losses accrued directly to them. And ASSP‟s support services could assist Kyrgyz farmers in
these endeavors by promoting the more sustainable and productive farm practices that were
needed.

3.4. Two aspects of ASSP‟s design are particularly noteworthy: first, a number of well
oriented approaches to key issues; and second, the project‟s complexity given the multiple
components and actors involved.

3.5.   Four orientations stand out:

      an emphasis on grass-roots, community and participatory approaches, which
       consistently proved effective and which for some components – for instance,
       community seed production and pasture management – was the centerpiece of
       activity;
      the development of a supporting legislative framework was found necessary for all
       components, responding to non-existent or inappropriate legislation inherited from
       the Soviet period. This was effectively done;
                                                    10


        the strong social inclusion features of the project. Actions to include women and the
         poor as project beneficiaries - were included in all project components (although most
         of these were added during project implementation); and
        with some exceptions such as the piloting of pasture management and community
         seed production, all components were designed to have national geographic coverage.

PROJECT COMPLEXITY

3.6. The ASSP comprised (including additions during project implementation) 12
components,9 and involved six donor agencies and over 20 Kyrgyz institutions. This
presented a formidable implementation challenge, the more so given the nation‟s limited
experience, and the country-wide scale of most project activities. From Bank international
experience simpler projects are generally desirable, and a specific remark to that effect was
made by IEG when the Bank assistance program to the Kyrgyz Republic was evaluated in
2001.10 Relevant questions then are: Could ASSP have been made less complex? Were there
special circumstances justifying such a multi-component project? And, how was ASSP
designed to manage complexity?

3.7. Possibilities for divestment. One option could have been to forgo activities that were
not essential to ASSP‟s central mission to urgently ramp up agricultural productivity.
Decisions here are difficult. A common viewpoint expressed to the IEG mission by
Government and Bank staff was that agriculture “needed everything”, and the broad validity
of this comment given the collapse of agriculture in the aftermath of the Soviet period can
hardly be disputed. But some activities might have been less integral to the immediate core
actions needed to jump-start agricultural growth.11 The crop protection and plant quarantine
component might have been one activity that could have been deferred without directly
affecting the productivity enhancement mission.12



9. The 12 project activities (components/sub-components) were: land and agrarian reform, agricultural
extension, micro-credit, pasture management, crop protection, plant quarantine, agricultural market information,
seed industry development, community seed production, project implementation unit, flood damage repair and
avian influenza protection. Some, such as the RADS were bundles of activities.
10. A tendency for Bank financed projects in the Kyrgyz Republic to be complex was noted in the Operations
Evaluation Department‟s (the former name for IEG) Country Assistance Evaluation for Kyrgyz in 2001. This
was summarized as follows: “Keep projects simple, with few components and realistic objectives, in
recognition of the limited implementation capacities in the country.” (in the Fast Track Brief for the Kyrgyz
Republic: Country Assistance Evaluation, May 31, 2001).
11. Increased incentives and the means to increase productivity were in particular provided by land ownership,
improved agricultural technology, and improved seed and market information.
12. Decisions on what to prioritize are not easy and have a large element of judgment. Thus, there is a “worst
case” scenario where prioritizing crop protection and plant quarantine would make very good sense. Risks
posed by a particularly fast-spreading and virulent pest such as the Goldfish Potato Nematode (found in the
Kyrgyz Republic in recent years and which can reduce potato yields by 50 percent) would certainly need
monitoring – a standard activity of a plant quarantine service. Mention of the crop protection and plant
quarantine component is, thus, an example of the prioritization issue rather than a specific assessment of the
relative worth of this component.
                                                      11


3.8. Prospects for allocating components to projects with similar specializations. At face
value there were several options. The flood protection addition in March 2004 might have
been added to the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project which still had two more years of
implementation, or to the On-Farm Irrigation Project approved in May 2004, only two
months after the component‟s addition to ASSP. The avian influenza component was added
to ASSP in 2007, one year after Board approval in February 2006 of the Avian Influenza
Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project, pursuing the same
objectives as the ASSP add-on. However, funds for the irrigation and influenza projects were
fully committed, whereas ASSP had undisbursed credit funds in excess of expected project
expenditures. Approval of additional financing for the irrigation and avian influenza projects
would have taken longer than reallocating ASSP funds, whereas response to the floods and
avian influenza risks were emergencies.13

3.9. The inclusion of micro-credit in ASSP is more questionable than the addition of the
two emergency components. There were two readily available alternatives. The Kyrgyz
Rural Finance Project was approved in FY97, the year before ASSP‟s approval. And the
Kyrgyz Second Rural Finance Project was approved in FY99, the year after ASSP approval.
Both rural finance projects used the same financing intermediary, the Kyrgyz Agricultural
Finance Corporation (KAFC) as ASSP used, and both had components to provide credit to
poorer farmers, as intended under ASSP.14 The primary reason for including credit under
ASSP was to accommodate the wishes of a lending partner.15

3.10. Distribution of responsibilities between donor agencies. Responsibilities and
financing might have been made the distinct and separate responsibilities of different donor
agencies. The project‟s record of good coordination between different agencies suggests that
splitting the project into separately financed but closely aligned sub-projects each made the
full and independent responsibility of a particular donor for the activity would have been
workable. For the Bank, the ASSP could thereby have comprised only one or several
technical components plus the APIU, still enabling an overall coordination role for the Bank,
yet a more manageable set of specialist activities for its own direct support.




13. The global context for avian influenza is also relevant. The Kyrgyz avian influenza component was a
pioneer sub-project in the global program, and the Board had requested rapid preparation of Kyrgyz‟s program
as one of the pilots for the larger program.
14. Both projects targeted part of their activities on poor farmers. The Rural Finance Project had a Small
Farmers Credit Outreach Program which included a sub-component to test mechanisms for credit delivery to
poor households, and to development of farmer organizations to facilitate access of poor households to financial
services. The Second Rural Finance Project had a Special Credit Line to provide credit for group lending based
on group commitment.
15. As advised by the ASSP task team, micro-credit was included in ASSP because IFAD wanted credit to be
part of the RADS, for which it was the primary financer. Inclusion of micro-credit in ASSP could thus be
considered as a practical expediency, although from a purely development perspective there is no reason to
assume that a separate component under ASSP would have been more effective than financing all micro-credit
under the rural finance projects.
                                             12


MANAGING COMPLEXITY

3.11. From the above, while inclusion of the avian influenza and flood response actions
responded to the need for urgent financing, in other respects there were several options that
might have been considered to simplify ASSP. The project design eschewed such options
which was a risky choice given the Bank‟s past experience with multiple component projects
in the Kyrgyz Republic (IEG, 2001). Implementation of ASSP was indeed difficult, but in the
event most components were broadly successful and contributed to achieving the project‟s
objectives. This was in part due to the quality of Bank supervision and most of the
implementing agencies, but two additional features facilitated the coordination of ASSP‟s
multiple components and actors:

        Inter-agency coordination. Inclusion in project design of a coordination unit (the
         Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit) with a clear mandate and substantial
         authority over the project-related actions of all concerned institutions. This unit
         became an effective institution that enabled ASSP‟s implementation despite its
         complexity.
        Delegating specialist responsibilities between Bank task teams. Delegation of
         supervision of several ASSP components to other Bank teams specialized and already
         occupied with similar activities. This was done progressively during project
         supervision. Technical supervision of ASSP‟s micro-finance component was
         delegated to the rural finance projects‟ supervision team, agrarian reform to the land
         and real estate registration project team, flood emergency to the irrigation projects‟
         team, and avian influenza to the avian influenza team.

OVERALL RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

3.12. ASSP‟s design was generally well tailored towards the outputs that could contribute
towards the project‟s objectives. The project was complex, and there were some
opportunities, though considering the context of the country‟s development needs and the
financing limitations of other projects, less than might be apparent, to simplify it. The design
of ASSP‟s institutional and supervision arrangements helped to surmount the difficulties of
implementing such a multi-component and multi-institutional program. In social aspects
(community participation, gender and poverty) the project‟s design was exemplary. Overall,
ASSP‟s design was Substantially relevant.



4.       Efficacy
4.1. This section presents evidence on the extent to which the ASSP‟s four objectives –
improved incentives, agricultural productivity, profitability and sustainability – were
achieved. The section begins by examining the delivery of outputs that were germane to all
four objectives: each output contributes to more than one objective. The next step is to
examine evidence on outcomes associated with each objective. This is more problematic
owing to the failings of project M&E. Extensive recourse is thus made to proxy data and
other indications of the project‟s development impact.

Outputs
LAND AND AGRARIAN REFORM

4.2. Unlike ASSP‟s other components, each of which pioneered a new activity, the Land
and Agrarian Reform (LAR) component helped to complete an existing program. But ASSP
brought in a higher quality of cadastre and more community participation, and built capacity
to help resolve land ownership disputes.

4.3. Land reforms began in 1991 and by 1997, the year before ASSP start-up, 766,000
hectares of land had been distributed to private farming units. ASSP financed an additional
240,000 hectares, including the reorganization and distribution of land of 20 of the 22
remaining former collective farms, and resulting in a total land distribution of 1,006,000
hectares by 2006 (roughly about 390,000 family farms16). This resulted in an increase in
privately owned land of 31 percent and raised the proportion of available land distributed to
farmers to 91 percent.

4.4. Improved quality and consolidation of land distribution were probably ASSP‟s most
significant contribution to the LAR program. The cadastre was strengthened using contracted
firms, and the project‟s community outreach was intensive. Also, before ASSP “land shares”
were provided to families without specifying locations of parcels. Under ASSP, land rights
were now specified for each new owner with clear delineation of parcels. Another
contribution was in settlement of disputes due to cases of inaccurate and inequitable land
allocation in earlier years. ASSP provided legal assistance to over 10,000 rural families 17 and
also helped resolve disputes amongst or between communities as a whole.

4.5. Another achievement of ASSP was, together with the Land and Real Estate
Registration Project (LRERP), to facilitate preparation of a legal framework for land reform.
A cross-ministerial working group involving parliamentarians prepared a Land Code, a Law
on Agricultural Land, and other legislation, providing a base for the land reform and land
administration program. Finally, a large outreach program to build public awareness of land
reform rights was mounted, with more in-depth training through some 2,000 seminars
involving 83,000 participants (about 21 percent of total families that had received land,
including land recipients prior to ASSP).18


16. Data on number of farms as opposed to number of hectares is incomplete. The rough estimate of 390,000
farms having received land is a cumulative estimate as of 2006 (source APIU) derived by taking the total area
of 1,006,000 hectares as in the ICR, and dividing this by an estimated average of 2.6 hectares per farm.
17. Most of these families were from the pre-ASSP period when cadastral standards were weak. In 1997 about
766,000 hectares of land had been distributed, which, assuming 2.6 hectares per farm, would be equivalent to
295,000 farming families. Thus, about 3 to 4 percent of the families that had received land in the pre-ASSP
period were provided with legal assistance (the majority of families had no legal issues).
18. Data on farm sizes and total family farms in Kyrgyz is limited, with some inconsistencies. Most aggregate
data in this report is from or derived from World Bank Development Indicators, 2010 Edition reporting on 2008
data; viz: national population - 5.3 million (2008); percentage of population rural – 64 percent; thus rural
population - 3.4 million; national land area - 191,800 km2; proportion of land that is arable - 6.7 percent;
therefore arable land - 1,285,000 ha. The estimates for the percentage of the rural population that are farming
                                                   14


4.6. The good collaboration between ASSP and LRERP is to the credit of both projects.
LRERP was approved two years after ASSP and had to build up the new implementing
agency – Gosregister. ASSP handled some of the activities that LRERP subsequently took
over. ASSP and LRERP officials shared responsibilities in land reform and administration,
Gosregister taking responsibility from ASSP for land registration services. The two projects‟
complementary roles and responsibilities were also made clear in a Memorandum of
Understanding between the two parties.

PROVIDING RURAL ADVISORY AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES

4.7. ASSP‟s RADS program responded to the vacuum of technical and managerial skills
that Kyrgyz‟s new family farms had to face, and the virtual absence of agricultural extension.
The RADS created an agricultural extension service represented in all of Kyrgyz‟s districts
covering a broad spectrum of technical and management skills.

4.8. The program had some impressive output achievements (Table 1). By 2006 187,000
farmers were being directly advised by RADS extension workers (about 37 percent of the
total number of family farms in the country), and in the same year there were 75,000
participants in training courses (15 percent of Kyrgyz‟s family farms). Also, over the project
period some 500,000 technical pamphlets were distributed,19 127 different training modules
were developed, and 200 radio broadcasts were made. As indicated in Table 2, RADS has
become the primary source of agricultural information for about 40 percent of its member
farmers, although it is of interest that newspapers are also an important information source
(the primary source for nearly a quarter of RADS farmers).

4.9. It is noteworthy, however, that in 2007, the last full year of the project, extension
contacts, training and demonstrations dropped appreciably due to reduced donor funding
(Table 1). This begs the question whether RADS will achieve the intended goal of financial
self-sufficiency and points to the sustainability risks that the ASSP/AISP program will need
to surmount (paras. 6.8 and 9.1 to 9.6).




(75 percent) and the average persons per family (about 5 persons) are taken from the Household Budget Survey
1998-2001of the Kyrgyz Republic (Government of Kyrgyz), as reported in S. Savastano and P. Scandizzo –
“Optimal farm size in an uncertain land market: the case of the Kyrgyz Republic” (Agricultural Economics,
2009). The number of farming households in Kyrgyz is estimated to be about 500,000 (3.4 million rural people,
75 % of which are farming, and 5 persons per family). The average area of a family farm is estimated at 2.6
hectares based on 1.28 million hectares for 500,000 families.
19. An average of one pamphlet for each of Kyrgyz‟s family farms, although distribution was primarily to
RADS contact farmers, who might receive a number of pamphlets on different subjects.

4.10. Studies of several RADS and non-RADS villages illuminate some of the features that
influence the quality of RADS services.20 Villagers frequently praised the high quality of the
extension staff.21 The strong interest of women in the RADS also emerges clearly from the
studies, including their desire for specialist training in areas of particular interest.22 Also,
farmers were vocal about ways to improve the RADS, including a high interest in
participatory and community oriented approaches by RADS staff. And finally, the difficulties

21. For example, in Baigonchok village the RADS advisor was highly appreciated and the RADS service
(including provision of written material, training, advisory consultations and good accessibility) received a
strong evaluation by farmers with a score of 4.8 out of 5. On the other hand, in another village (Kosh-Terek),
extension advice was considered less relevant and service delivery less energized, and the RADS was evaluated
at only 3.0 out of 5.
22. Women in Baigonchok village, for instance, had formed groups supported by the RADS advisor on
handicrafts, poultry, micro-credit and vegetable production.
                                                   16


and location-specific agronomic requirements that the Kyrgyz farmer and the RADS must
contend with are clearly demonstrated - exhausted soils due to constant cropping with
minimal or no fertilizer appears a common issue.

RURAL MICRO-CREDIT

4.11. The RADS‟ micro-finance sub-component was intended to provide micro-credit to
groups of poor farmers without collateral requirements using the Kyrgyz Agricultural
Finance Corporation (KAFC) as an intermediary. This was achieved through a “Farm
Development Fund” managed by the KAFC, providing loans for which recovery depended
on peer pressure and group solidarity mechanisms. Management of the fund was problematic
throughout ASSP implementation. KAFC was slow developing a group lending policy and
manual. The government imposed a ceiling on interest rates which threatened to rapidly
erode the fund‟s capital, resulting in a moratorium by the Bank and IFAD on lending by the
fund. Fund reflows were not reinvested but were diverted to other project components.
Finally, KAFC unilaterally introduced a requirement for collateral.

4.12. Despite these problems, in its peak year (2006) the program reached about 6,200
farmers in 733 farmer groups, which represents about four percent of the average of 156,000
farmers under the RADS in ASSP‟s last three years. These numbers (there were no physical
targets) are ample enough to have piloted the micro-credit sub-component, thus meeting the
appraisal intention to make “Progress in implementing pilot activities in micro-finance in
selected areas.”23

4.13. Nevertheless, there are doubts about the sustainability of the micro-finance sub-
component. Micro-finance is not included under AISP, ASSP‟s follow-on project, and the
two rural finance projects closed three years before ASSP‟s completion. Moreover, KAFC
has demonstrated a consistent lack of interest in the sub-component.

PASTURE MANAGEMENT

4.14. This sub-component piloted community management of pastures and was highly
successful. On four pastures, each shared between several villages, the communities were
encouraged through participatory processes and training to form Pasture Committees. These
committees held workshops and community meetings to prepare a Pasture Management Plan
for managed grazing and control of stocking levels. Grazing and stocking under the plan was
then monitored by the community. A draft law for pasture management was also prepared
(approved in January 2009, shortly after project closure). Each committee was provided with
a one-time grant for investment in related infrastructure (for instance, an access track or
small infrastructure for a watering point). Thereafter, each community was expected to be
financially independent. It is not yet clear whether the communities will collect sufficient
funds from villagers to cover operating costs. But communities throughout the Kyrgyz
Republic have expressed their support for this initiative.

4.15. ASSP‟s follow-on project, the AISP, includes pasture management as its main
activity – some 38 percent of project costs.24 According to the managers of the Pasture
Management Department, communities in all of the Kyrgyz Republic‟s 40 districts are taking
up the program. Some 445 clusters of villages are mobilizing and forming pasture
committees, of which 270 are already registered as formal institutions. The intention of AISP
is to develop pasture committees for all of the country‟s pastures. In the unanimous view of
Government and Bank staff interviewed by the IEG mission, the pilot program, through the
experience and lessons gained, provided the foundation for the national program that is now
underway.

SEED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

4.16. When ASSP was approved, the seed sector - still mainly the responsibility of
designated former collective or state farms – was in serious decline. Most farmers relied
upon locally grown seed, with little use of improved germplasm. Laboratories and other
facilities were in disarray, staff having left because salaries went unpaid. Legislation,
regulation, standards and procedures were inadequate.

4.17. As designed at appraisal, the seed component contained strong vestiges of the top-
down and horizontally concentrated approach of the Soviet system. A central seed farm was
to supply seed to three seed farms, which were intended to demonstrate commercial
production of seed. But creation of a private seed sector was compromised as breeder‟s seed
was only provided by the central farm to the three seed farms.

4.18. The seed component was redesigned in the second year of ASSP. The new design
provided assistance to a broader range of seed producers and to development of a competitive
and private-sector based seed industry. Greater emphasis was also put on providing a
facilitating framework for development and regulation of the sector. A seed law was passed,
seed standards developed, seed inspection procedures established, and a national Seed
Association comprising all seed producers was created.

4.19. Several difficulties had to be overcome before the new approach could make
progress. MAWR was not interested initially in the redesign of the component, preferring to
directly manage the program than to become a regulator and overseer. Parliament was also
uninterested in the adjustments, and there was strong opposition from seed sector vested
interests.

4.20. The Kyrgyz Republic‟s seed production industry is now achieving some recognition.
The country‟s seed inspection procedures have been approved by the International Seed
Testing Association, enabling it to provide international certificates on seed quality. The
Kyrgyz Republic also helped establish the Central Asian Seed Association, a forum for cross-
country dialogue and coordination of seed activities.




24. AISP‟s slightly larger “Agricultural Support Services” component is a bundle of several support activities
(agricultural extension, market information, community seed production and animal health).
                                                    18


4.21. A completely new sub-component – “Community Seed Production” – was added to
ASSP‟s seed component at mid-term-review in 2001. This was carried out in poor
mountainous areas, thus serving a poverty-alleviation function as well as seed production.
Farmers established cooperative “Community Seed Funds” and received seed grants as start-
up capital and for initial operating expenses. Local farmers bought such seed with a 25
percent fee paid in kind. In turn, in the following year these farmers sold their seed to other
farmers. Local NGOs played a facilitating role. Some 75 cooperatives covering about 300
villages and 24,000 farmers were established and registered. This successful program is
being continued under AISP.

ESTABLISHING CROP PROTECTION AND PLANT QUARANTINE SYSTEMS

4.22. For crop protection a legal framework and administrative structure were established
for regulating pesticide use, and laboratories were rehabilitated and equipped. An additional
initiative in the last three years of the project was the introduction, through field trials,
training and pilot farmers, of Integrated Production Management.25 On the plant quarantine
side, an existing law on plant quarantine was amended, quarantine standards and procedures
developed, some scientists trained internationally, and laboratories refurbished. It is notable
that the progress made by the Kyrgyz Republic enabled it to participate in the European Plant
Protection Organization and the International Plant Protection Convention. But these good
achievements were set back in the last three years of the project by Government‟s chronically
inadequate funding for operation of the laboratories. Both plant protection and quarantine
services effectively stopped and most staff left.26

SCALING UP THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEM

4.23. Provision of agricultural market information had been piloted before ASSP in two
oblasts.27 ASSP expanded the system to nation-wide coverage through a new institution- the
Kyrgyz Agricultural Market Information Service (KAMIS). Under KAMIS, a one-person
office was established in each oblast, a broader set of crops, livestock, and agricultural inputs
were included, wholesale and retail prices were collected and disseminated for all oblasts,
and prices in adjacent countries or countries with significant agricultural trade with Kyrgyz
were included. Market information was provided twice-monthly in a KAMIS newspaper
(“Market Pulse”) which was distributed to all village councils. The newspaper is thorough,
extensive in the agricultural commodities covered, and presented in user-friendly form.
KAMIS staff informed the mission that the newspaper was widely read in the villages, and
that villages often asked for more copies. The KAMIS program also had a web-site and
provided information requested by television and radio networks. All in all, this was a
dynamic and successful program. Nevertheless, plans under AISP to phase out Government
and donor funding with expectations that KAMIS can be self-sufficient may need revisiting,

at least for the short term, given the public good nature of much of KAMIS‟ services,
especially for poorer and remotely located farmers (paras. 9.5 and 9.6).

RIVER FLOOD PROTECTION AND AVIAN FLU MANAGEMENT

4.24. These two components were added to ASSP at the request of Government through
amendments of the credit agreement in 2004 and 2007 respectively.28

4.25. The river flood protection component supported reconstruction of embankments and
check dams and de-silting of the Kugart river, and the development of a flood and siltation
management model. These actions were to help protect adjacent communities from floods.
Start-up was late due to delays in Government ratification of the amendments to the credit
agreement despite the original request being framed as an emergency. Nevertheless, the
infrastructure is reported to have been completed as designed, and the flood model
developed.

4.26. The avian flu management component was the Kyrgyz Republic‟s first response to the
risks posed by a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza epidemic. Risks of an outbreak were
high given the country‟s position on migratory flight paths. Project funds were used to
rehabilitate veterinary laboratories, purchase lab equipment and construct additional animal
carcass disposal facilities. This component was part of the Global Program for Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response, and is continuing under
the Kyrgyz avian influenza project.

4.27. The achievements flowing from these components are reviewed below by each of the
project‟s objectives: Improving Kyrgyz agriculture‟s (i) incentives framework, (ii)
productivity, (iii) profitability and (iv) sustainability.

Outcomes
OBJECTIVE 1: IMPROVING THE INCENTIVES FRAMEWORK FOR AGRICULTURE

4.28. ASSP‟s most fundamental contribution to the enhancement of agricultural incentives
was its land reform activities. The project substantially completed the land reform program,
thereby consolidating the transfer of land to private ownership. Hence, any gains in
productivity and efficiency, and therefore of profits, would go entirely to the farmer, and the
farmer also had a direct interest in sustaining the quality of his land. These changes provided
the incentives framework for all of the other objectives, whether for increasing productivity,
profitability or sustainability. And the project‟s support services provided the means to put
these objectives into practice. The incentives framework was Substantially improved.




28. The credit agreement was amended as follows: In March 2004 the addition of “Improving and securing the
sustainability of river flood protection along the Kugart river;” followed in January 2007 with an addition to
“Minimize the threat posed to humans and to the poultry industry by HPAI, and in preparing for the control and
response to HPAI and other infectious diseases.”

OBJECTIVE 2: INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURE

4.29. The most direct data available is cross-sectional comparisons between the private
family farms and the agricultural enterprises still largely based on the collective and state
farm systems. Table 3 shows that family farms are about six times more productive per
hectare and per worker than the productivity of agricultural enterprises. While these data are
for 2002, it is likely that ASSP‟s land privatization program created similar differences
between the two farming systems. The RADS was ASSP‟s other large-scale program. A
national survey of farmer opinions29 found that about 80 percent of RADS member farmers
considered that RADS provided good quality agricultural extension services, and a similar
percentage considered that RADS services met their needs. It would be reasonable to expect
that these views were primarily because of improvement in their incomes based on improved
productivity.

4.30. Some productivity data are also available for other project activities. Crop yields
under Integrated Production Management are reported to have increased by about 10 to 20
percent for cotton and by nearly two-thirds for tomatoes and potatoes.30 The pasture
management pilot increased summer pasture yield by 41 percent and winter pasture yield by
25 percent (Box 3). And, for these and other ASSP activities,31 farmer appreciation is evident
from the interest expressed in participating in ASSP activities.

4.31. Another consideration is the important role of ASSP in setting up a technical,
knowledge and institutional base for future agricultural development. The Efficacy of
ASSP‟s objective to increase the productivity of Kyrgyz agriculture is rated Substantial.

Development Fund, September 2006. (coverage: sample of 196 farmers in seven oblasts).

31. For the flood and avian influenza activities, while assessments of impact were not found by the IEG
mission, these actions are likely to have contributed to ASSP‟s objectives – better protection against floods
would reduce lost agricultural production and incomes in flood affected years, and enhance the sustainability of
irrigation systems and other rural infrastructure. The risk of catastrophic losses in poultry production and in the
sustainability of the poultry industry can be expected to have been reduced by the infrastructure and capacity
building program initiated by ASSP.

Box 3: Initial gains from community management of Orgochor Pasture
  Orgochor pasture in Jety-Ogoz rayon, Issyk-Kul oblast was one of the four pilot pastures under ASSP‟s Pasture
  Management sub-component. Baseline assessments were made of Ogorchor‟s pasture resources, the legal status
  of current pasture management, the current usage of the pasture, and the reasons behind overgrazing A
  community pasture committee was formed which developed a pasture use and management plan, determined
  fees to be paid by users and developed a plan for infrastructure – this included a bridge for easier access to
  summer pastures. The pasture management plan was then applied by the community. All processes were highly
  participatory.

  Only two years of results are currently available (from 2007 when the pasture committee was established to
  2009), but the initial impacts are already encouraging as indicated below:

OBJECTIVE 3: INCREASING THE PROFITABILITY OF AGRICULTURE

4.32. Direct data on gross margins, farm incomes and other measures of profitability are
even more limited than the data for productivity, and indeed, much of the assessment of
profitability is based on productivity observations assuming a reasonably close causal link
from productivity to profits and incomes. Thus, most of the productivity indicators provided
above also imply improvement in farm incomes. Then there are some strong proxy
observations for individual project components that imply profitability. Micro-credit had a 98
percent repayment rate and attracted more enthusiasm to participate than could be
accommodated by the project. Some 80 percent of the community seed farms are financially
                                                    22


viable and are either stable or growing in size. For the commercial seed sector some 90
private producers were established by ASSP completion, much more than expected and
indicating the profitability of commercial seed production and the viability for farmers of
buying seed at market rates to use on their farms. The eagerness of village communities to
participate in the pasture improvement program also construes clearly perceived benefits.
And reduced risks of flood damage and avian influenza would reduce the chances of major
economic and social losses.

4.33. Survey data is consistent with these observations. The national survey of agricultural
extension showed that farmers were mostly pleased with the service, again suggesting that
they materially benefitted. Also, repeater surveys of a small group of villages by Kyrgyz‟s
Center for Sociological Studies32 found substantial changes over time in the number of
farmers who felt that their incomes had increased due to using the RADS agricultural advice.
Baigonchok village (Table 4) illustrates the direction in most of the villages. Triangulating
from these various sources, the profitability objective is rated as Substantially achieved.

OBJECTIVE 4: INCREASING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURE

4.34. Several ASSP components were by their nature designed to be environmentally
beneficial and may have contributed to strengthening the environmental sustainability of
agricultural production: community pasture management may have reduced overgrazing and
the ongoing roll-out could have national significance; the flood and avian influenza
components provided better hazard preparedness; and the RADS promoted land conserving
agronomic practices. However, there is no evidence of the extent to which improved
practices were adopted and what the results achieved were. Furthermore, the sustainability of
agricultural services is a considerable issue, because project and post-project experience with
financing raise questions as to whether such services can be enhanced, or even maintained.
First, at the end of the project, the RADs program was substantially curtailed following a
drop in funding, and the future prospects of a developing private extension service are not yet
clear (paras. 9.1 to 9.4). Second, failure to provide funding for operations and maintenance of
the crop protection and plant quarantine laboratories resulted in them becoming non-
functional (para 4.22). And third, KAMIS‟s market information services had to be reduced,
also due to a reduction in financing (paras 9.5 and 9.6). If such financing problems persist,
the services themselves are clearly at risk, and this may put at risk the extent to which

32. “Repeated Baseline Survey”, Center for Sociological Study, National Academy of Sciences, Kyrgyz
Republic, 2007.
                                                     23


sustainable farming practices are further developed, disseminated, adopted and those
introduced under the project maintained. If agricultural services decline, maintaining
improved technologies would be made more difficult for farmers. Thus, the project, which
experienced inadequate funding and resultant decline in service quality for three of its ten
components, has not yet ensured that its influence on sustainable agricultural development
can be sustained. Taking account of this, efficacy of ASSP‟s objective to improve the
sustainability of agriculture is rated Modest.



5.      Efficiency
5.1. Implementation Efficiency. ASSP took 10 years to implement – nearly double the 5 ½
years intended at appraisal, although given that practically all of the project‟s activities were
new, the realism of the original five-year implementation target is questionable. Another
consideration is cost savings - at completion, ASSP‟s costs were 77 percent of appraisal
estimates. However, these savings have little meaning for assessing efficiency as output and
outcome targets were not specified at appraisal, and the cost reduction is in line with a
significant depreciation of the Som during project implementation.33

5.2. Economic Efficiency Assessment of ASSP‟s economic efficiency is particularly
difficult. Estimation has all the data limitations found when evaluating efficacy, and an
economic rate of return was not calculated in the ICR. Thus, the considerations below are
limited primarily to observations on farm level profitability and a comparison of ASSP costs
with irrigation investments.

5.3. Financial Returns and Profitability. From the review of ASSP‟s impact on
productivity and profitability, there are persuasive indications that ASSP brought in
technologies that were financially viable. There are only a few indicators from direct
measurements of increases in productivity. But proxy information from farmer views and
participation rates convey a generally consistent direction. All of ASSP‟s services were
popular with farmers, uptake levels being more influenced by supply constraints than by lack
of demand, and where payments were required these were generally made.

5.4. Relative cost effectiveness. Irrigation improvement would be an obvious alternative or
parallel intervention to ASSP. Under the Second On-Farm Irrigation Project, rehabilitation
and modernization costs of the tertiary system are estimated at $250/hectare and the farmer‟s
incremental gross margin as a result of the project is estimated at $68/hectare, a modest 16
percent increment on the without-rehabilitation scenario.34 For ASSP, taking only the
240,000 hectares of land privatized under the LARS program, the project‟s total costs
amount to $50 per hectare ($25 per hectare if the 480,000 hectares under the RADS program



33. At appraisal the assumed exchange rate was 17.5 Som per US$, whereas by project completion it was in the
35 to 40 Som per dollar range.

is taken) for an incremental yield significant enough to explain the wide-spread interest of
farmers in the ASSP program.

5.5. The indications above suggest that ASSP had a positive economic impact, but data is
insufficient to ascertain the extent of increases in productivity and profitability. Hence, it is
not possible to make an informed judgment on the project‟s cost-benefit ratio. There are also
uncertainties regarding the sustainability of some of the project‟s components (paras. 6.7 and
6,8 and 9.1 to 9.6). Accordingly, while there is enough information to conclude that
efficiency was at any rate Modest, there is not enough to presume that it was substantial.




6.     Project Outcome
6.1.   Ratings for ASSP‟s relevance, efficacy and efficiency are summarized in Table 5.

6.2. ASSP‟s objectives to improve the productivity, profitability, sustainability and
incentives framework of Kyrgyz agriculture were Highly Relevant to the Kyrgyz Republic‟s
new agricultural sector. The new privately owned family farms faced low yields yet had
minimal knowledge or technologies with which to raise productivity and earnings and
maintain the fertility of their fields. This was important for improving rural welfare, reducing
poverty, sustaining farming systems, and contributing to a more viable rural economy.
Project design was Substantially relevant - a generally well chosen set of agricultural support
services could between them be expected to boost rural productivity, and arrangements for
project coordination mitigated the risks posed by the choice of a complex, multi-component
project.

6.3. Project implementation was largely successful - all components were established and
made significant physical progress. ASSP also pioneered several general thrusts for the rural
sector: promoting a private-sector based agricultural economy; involving communities in
nearly all development activities; creating a legislative framework for all services; and
integrating a strong social inclusion program.

6.4. The project‟s efficacy was Substantial as concerns the objectives to improve the
incentives framework, productivity and profitability of agriculture. Sustainability
achievements however were Modest given the deterioration of some services as a result of
underfunding. Efficiency was also Modest as reduced service quality would reduce the
potential benefits from the ASSP program.

6.5. An additional concern is the weakness of M&E. ASSP was a pioneer project, and a
learning and adjustment process based on good information was particularly needed. A
responsive M&E system could have made decisions more sharply focused on what actions
make a difference, and how activities can be better tuned to needs. It would also have
provided a stronger empirical base to design ASSP‟s successor, the AISP.

6.6. ASSP‟s overall outcome was Moderately Satisfactory. In most respects the project
did well. But an otherwise predominantly satisfactory performance is qualified by the modest
                                                      25


sustainability achievements and uncertain efficiency, with weak M&E a further
consideration.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.7. Considerable uncertainty for the short-term was introduced by recent socio-political
events in the Kyrgyz Republic. For the medium and longer term, demand for quality services
by farmers is likely to be a sustaining influence on government commitment to the
agricultural support activities introduced by ASSP. An intangible but likely significant factor
is the build-up of ownership of ASSP by the implementing agencies and Government,
including various forms of recognition by outside parties.35 The continued presence of the
Bank and other development agencies in financing the follow-on AISP will also help sustain
and enhance ASSP‟s achievements in the medium term, both by relieving the financial
burden for Government and by the dialogue during project supervision on policy and
implementation progress of ASSP activities included in the AISP program.

6.8. Nevertheless, past Government actions suggest wavering political commitment. In the
last three years there have been seven Ministers of MAWR, each requiring time to become
familiar with the project. Some became reform champions, but a number had insufficient
time to make significant impact. Also, policy reflections (such as the tendency after the rapid
price increases in 2008, to restore greater Government control over production of agricultural

35. For example, inclusion of the Community Seed Production model in the World Bank‟s Innovation Fair, the
licensing of the Kyrgyz Republic by the International Seed Testing Association for seed exports (the first CIS
country to be so authorized); the establishment, led by Kyrgyz, of the Central Asian Seed Association; and
Kyrgyz‟s Pasture Management program visited by other countries.
                                                   26


commodities) have been questionable. Rent seeking may also undercut the sustainability of
project outcomes.36 There is in particular the significant risk that Government funding will
be inadequate - as indicated above, counterpart funding was problematic throughout
implementation. Risk to Development Outcome is assessed Significant.

ASSP’s Broader Impacts
6.9. Although, as indicated above, ASSP had some flaws qualifying a mostly satisfactory
outcome, a fundamental achievement of ASSP going beyond a project-specific evaluation
should be recognized. ASSP was not really a project – it was more an adaptive program of
change. All components were new, and were also being established by personnel without
experience, in newly formed institutions. In essence each component was an experiment and
implementation provided a learning process. Most components were significantly adapted
over the project period. But through this adaptive change process, by project completion
ASSP had created a platform of experience, a core of trained personnel, an institutional
capacity, and legislation for future development of the Kyrgyz Republic‟s agricultural
support services and for Kyrgyz agriculture in general. Providing that its sustainability issues
are resolved, ASSP‟s heritage will be considerable.




7.      Performance of the Bank
Quality at Entry
7.1. The Bank was attuned to the Kyrgyz Republic‟s goal to enhance the productivity and
incomes of the agricultural sector, and the resultant priority for agricultural lending to jump-
start sector growth. Choice of a project to support the diverse agricultural service needs to
stimulate and sustain agricultural growth was strategically appropriate. With the exception of
the seed sector component, the quality of preparation was good. This included detailed
discussion and up-front formulation of implementation arrangements. With its many
components, the project was complex but arrangements to enable coordination were built
into the project‟s design and were largely successful. When ASSP was approved, there was a
sufficient base, both in design and readiness for implementation, for starting the adaptive
development program that ASSP became. Quality at entry was good except in one respect -
the M&E program. A good and outcome oriented M&E system was particularly necessary
given that ASSP was effectively a pilot for a broader program. Accordingly, overall quality
at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.




36. Transparency International publishes an annual list assessing transparency (corruption) by country. The
ranking of the Kyrgyz Republic in recent years has been: 2005-130th; 2006-142nd; 2007-150th; 2008-166th;
and 2009-62nd. (Ranking is expressed as the number of countries assessed to have more transparency than
Kyrgyz. The smaller the number, the more transparent the country.
                                                        27


Supervision
7.2. Supervision was generally strong. The team was well grounded in the ultimate
objectives of ASSP, and this influenced a dynamic and flexible approach to supervision,
which was desirable for a project forging new ground in almost every activity.37 The decision
to continue supporting the program started by ASSP with a follow-on project (AISP)
recognized that the agricultural change process in Kyrgyz required more than a one-time
intervention.

7.3. Additional to the flexible and strategic approach noted above, three aspects of
supervision stand out. First was the Bank‟s role as an informal coordinator of a large number
of development agencies. The Bank team was effective in harmonizing the various activities
of these agencies, hence harnessing additional dynamism and technical and financial
resources to the ASSP program. Second was the Bank‟s collegiate rapport with Government
and hands-on problem-solving approach. Comments such as the Bank team could be “easily
reached,” even when on another mission, they would provide “any assistance needed,” and
they were “very good at resolving problems” were typical Government and agency remarks
to the IEG mission. Third was the exemplary attention to social issues resulting in social
inclusion measures across most of ASSP‟s activities. On the other hand, the M&E program,
while it was somewhat improved during project implementation, could have received more
attention. An otherwise highly satisfactory supervision performance is thus rated
Satisfactory. Considering quality at entry and supervision performance together, the overall
performance of the Bank is rated Moderately Satisfactory.




8.       Performance of the Borrower
Government
8.1. Other than in provision of counterpart funds, Government was a generally strong
supporter of the ASSP program. Land reforms were personally championed by the President.
Turnover of Ministers of Agriculture and Water Resources was excessive requiring repeated
re-briefings but most became active leaders of reform. Government support included passing
the considerable number of laws and amendments involving all project components. In this,
parliamentarians worked closely with the APIU and implementing agencies.

8.2. Inadequate counterpart funding was a significant problem,38 although a major
contributor to the financing difficulties was exogenous to the project. The Kyrgyz Republic

37. Also, the supervision team had an adequate skills mix, and Bank management recognized that ASSP
required a larger supervision budget than normal (between FY99 and FY07, the average annual supervision
budget was US$ 136,000 - over 50 percent more than typical supervision allocations).
38. As concerns the project period, the problem was substantially solved when, in 2004 the Bank adjusted
disbursements to 100 percent of costs, and several bilateral agencies agreed to finance all of the technical
assistance on a grant basis.
                                            28


was severely affected by the Russian financial crisis of August 1998 (shortly after ASSP had
been approved). The Kyrgyz Som depreciated sharply from 17.5/US$ in mid-1998 to Som
42/US$ in mid-1999. And the country continued to have severe fiscal constraints throughout
the project period and beyond. The budgetary difficulties resulting from the Kyrgyz
Republic‟s economic situation place the shortfall in counterpart funding in somewhat more
sympathetic light. But even scarce resources are fungible and the choice to limit Government
financing for ASSP caused some services to deteriorate. Nevertheless, given its strong
support to the project in other respects, Government performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

Implementing Agencies
8.3. Overall, the performance of the implementing agencies was Satisfactory. All of the
many agencies involved with the project began with no or minimal experience in the ASSP
activities assigned to them. A number of the institutions were new, having been created
specifically for the project. They all had to learn by doing, and in process, all institutions
could be expected to, and did, make mistakes. Nevertheless, the majority of the institutions
were effective learners and showed flexibility in adapting their programs based on
implementation experience. The bottom line is that nearly all project components ultimately
prevailed in introducing, even with imperfections, the support activities that agriculture so
sorely needed, thereby contributing to the overall objectives of the project. Coordinating
these initiatives was the APIU which played a highly proactive and effective role as a bridge
and motivator between the implementing agencies, Government, and the development
community.

8.4. Considering the performance of Government and the implementing agencies together,
the overall performance of the borrower was Moderately Satisfactory.




9.     Special Issues
Financial Self-Sufficiency
9.1. The degree to which ASSP‟s activities can be financially self-sufficient and, if self-
financing is feasible, the appropriate timetable to get there, would benefit from further
examination. Some activities, such as community seed production groups and pasture
management communities are already fully or nearly self-financing. But in other cases –
particularly some of the RADS‟ activities and KAMIS‟ market information program - there
is cause for concern. The collapse for lack of funding of the laboratories for crop protection
and plant quarantine provide cautionary examples of what could happen without adequate
funding.

9.2. Rural Advisory Services. From the beginning of ASSP and continuing to this day, the
official position of the Bank, its partner donors and the Government is that the RADS should
progressively become financially independent, and that other agricultural service providers
                                                        29


should develop and thereby complement and compete with the RADS in a new demand-led
environment.39 Most public funding would be channeled to service users (farmers, farm
enterprises, farming communities) who would select and pay for services directly. Transition
to this model is taking place under AISP. The approach has evident merits. The RADS and
other extension services would need to be responsive to farmer needs if they are to be
selected, and be appreciated enough to be able to charge fees which will be paid; and self-
sufficiency would release the RADS from reliance on continued financial support from the
donor community and from the perpetually constrained financing available from
Government.40 Further, multiple providers of agricultural extension services would create
competition between providers, a greater diversity of skills and, possibly, more innovations.
However, some adjustments appear needed in the way the new model is applied, in particular
as concerns the role of the RADS versus the private sector, how to cater for “public good”
agricultural extension activities, and financing agricultural extension for poorer farmers.

9.3. For the RADS, the tightly rationed funding from donors and Government in the last
several years is reducing the quality of its services. A manager of one of Kyrgyz‟s seven
oblasts commented to the IEG mission that there had been very little training of farmers in
the past two years. There had also been a substantial loss (approaching 50 percent) of RADS
staff. And salaries of his staff had not been increased since 2002. The progression of the
RADS budget for the oblast is consistent with these developments. Whereas the oblast‟s
budget in 2007 was 5.5 million Som, by 2009 it was 3.2 million Som. This budget includes
financing from donors. The oblast RADS was trying to increase revenues from client fees.
But by 2007 these only amounted to 12 percent of the oblast‟s budget. In his view, if donors
such as the Bank, IFAD and the bilateral agencies withdrew, considering the past history of
limited Government budgets for the RADS, the program would be unsustainable. A similar
view – “the program would collapse” – was expressed by a Bank staff. A comment made by
another oblast manager to the IEG mission was “I don‟t understand why a good and effective
system (the RADS) is being destroyed.”

9.4. Annual increases in the share of RADS expenditures financed by farmers are targeted
by the Bank, other donors, and Government to progress to 100 percent over the next several
years. This approach, which includes a set schedule of percentage targets by year, would
benefit from more tuning to the diversity of services that agricultural extension provides, and
to the needs of poorer and more isolated farming communities. Several actions (with
accompanying assured financing) could be considered. First, applying more comprehensive


39. As stated in the appraisal reports for the ASSP and the follow-on AISP: (i) “The RADS will function as a
semi-autonomous institution, until it becomes over a period, a self-financing organization.” (ASSP PAD, page
31); (ii) “The RADS will be in position to function without further donor support by the end of the project”
(AISP PAD, page 32); and (iii) “The project will provide, on an annually declining scale, funding for the direct
and decentralized contracting for extension services by the farming communities themselves (also in the AISP
PAD; page 13).
40. Availability of funds was a critical constraint. In the first three years of ASSP, due in large part to the
Kyrgyz Republic‟s financial crisis, virtually no counterpart funds were provided, and the Bank and other
agencies raised financing percentages to 100 percent, including funding by bilaterals of technical assistance
costs through grants.
                                            30


differentiation of clients by categories such as small farmers, for which a subsidized service
may be required, and large farmers and agribusinesses where a fully paid private service is
feasible. Second, clearer specification and adequate funding of all services which are “public
goods” in nature (such as extension by radio and television, research and demonstrations).
Third, assessing and applying a time path for reducing RADS funding that is more
responsive to the rate at which the RADS can adjust to the new approach, and the rate at
which private suppliers can enter the extension services market and assume RADS activities.
And fourth, tailoring and timing the program and adjustment of RADS to regional conditions
and implementation experience.

9.5. Market information services. There was a chronic shortage of counterpart funding to
KAMIS throughout project implementation. A pragmatic partial solution to this, introduced
in 2003, was to change the legal status of KAMIS to a private company. This enabled
KAMIS to charge for its services and to retain earnings. By project completion about 30
percent of KAMIS‟ funds came from users, in particular the larger users such as cooperatives
and agribusinesses. The remaining funds came from MAWR through annual contracts with
KAMIS. This was a better situation, but Government funding has still been less than
KAMIS‟ operational needs and the program‟s future is not secure.

9.6. Government‟s objective, supported by the Bank, is to progressively reduce funding
with the eventual objective to make KAMIS a financially independent entity. Already, the
Government provision of funds to KAMIS (funded under the follow-on AISP) has been cut
from $90,000 per annum in the last years of ASSP to $ 65,000 currently. To make ends meet
KAMIS has cut staff salaries and curtailed some of its services. As with agricultural
extension, at issue is the degree to which KAMIS can reasonably be expected to finance itself
when a significant proportion of its services are in the nature of a public good (media,
information for village communities) rather than services to specific private customers. As
matters stand now, KAMIS‟s good services developed under ASSP are declining.

Exemplary Social Inclusion Practices for Women and the Poor
9.7. By completion of ASSP, the project had developed a strong orientation and actions
towards improving access to project benefits of the poor, women and other vulnerable
groups. This fitted Government‟s and the Bank‟s strategy for “pro-poor” economic growth. It
was also consistent with experience in the Kyrgyz Republic and a number of other ECA
countries, that without special measures, vulnerable groups could be marginalized in
development programs. ASSP has become a model of “good practice” social inclusion, with
potential interest for other countries.

9.8. Social inclusion was not an emphasis during project preparation. The PAD has
minimal references to features in project design for alleviating income and gender
inequalities, but the development context at that time should be borne in mind. As aptly
expressed by a senior Government official, in the first years following Independence,
“Everyone was poor.” Poverty targeting was “the last thing on people‟s minds.” However,
the initial implementation experience of ASSP raised awareness for both Government and the
Bank that adaptations to better cater for the needs of women and the poor were needed.
ASSP became more oriented to participatory and community-based processes, and some
                                                            31


components such as community seed production and micro-credit were focused entirely on
poor communities. All project components developed features for social inclusion (Box 4).


Box 4: Actions to Include Women and the Poor
Most of ASSP‟s project components had features that would help the poor and women to be more effectively reached:

Land and Agrarian Reform: The main ASSP activity on land reform became settlement of disputes which was particularly
beneficial to the less influential (ethnic minorities, poorer households and women). Free legal advice was also provided.

Rural Advisory Services: Women had access to extension services almost as equally as men. Female advisors were nearly as
prevalent as male advisors. Women accounted for 51 percent of all training participants, and for 42 percent of the RADS‟
regular client contacts.

Micro-Credit: Credit was targeted to the most poor, vulnerable and remote villages identified through the UNDP Poverty
Alleviation Program. Only groups comprising families with monthly incomes of less than US$ 20 per month were eligible to
participate.

Pasture Management: A participatory and community based approach helped to include poorer and women livestock
owners.

Community Seed Production: This component specifically targeted poor communities, often in mountainous areas, and
included women‟s groups. Most of the cooperatives became financially independent through sale of seed to local farmers.

Market Information: Most of KAMIS‟ services were freely available through public media and the KAMIS bimonthly
newspaper, which was distributed to all of Kyrgyz‟s Village Councils (access to information through KAMIs‟ web site,
would, nevertheless, have been easier for higher income households with computers and information technology links).

Studies: Several studies financed by ASSP reviewed gender issues and women‟s needs. 41

Sources: ICR page 21 and IEG mission observations and interviews.



9.9. ASSP‟s pro-activism was a better approach to rural development than the “neutral”
approach (wherein project activities have no bias inhibiting social inclusion, but no features
to actively promote it) to poverty and gender issues often found in other projects. The
development needs of men and women can be quite different. A survey in the Kyrgyz
Republic in 2002 found that women valued training within or close to the village, and there
were some training topics of particular interest to women.42 There are also complications
from the juxtaposition of customary law with modern law, customary law being particularly
influential in Kyrgyz‟s more remote rural communities. Rights to land are quite different
between the two legal systems.43 There is also the sometimes unobtrusive or even hidden

41 . Women‟s Rights to Land in the Kyrgyz Republic; R. Giovarelli et al, World Bank, June 2001; Women‟s
Involvement in Extension Programs in Kyrgystan, R. Giovarelli, World Bank, June 2002; and Local Institutions
that Enforce Customary Law in the Kyrgyz Republic and their Impact on Women‟s Rights. R. Giovarelli and
C. Akmatova, World Bank, March, 2002.)
42. Women were particularly interested in off-farm income generating activities, training in small business
management, legal rights of women, and food processing. The latter two interests were unique to women.
(From R. Giovarelli, Women‟s Involvement in Extension Programs in Kyrgyzstan, June 2002.)
43. “Customary law appears to super-cede the written law in many rural villages, although women have the
legal right to land as individuals, this right is rarely exercised.” (in Women‟s Rights to Land in the Kyrgyz
Republic. (Giovarelli 2001).
                                                   32


nature of gender and poverty issues.44 The need for the RADS to take proactive measures to
cater to the needs of women might not have been thought of without the review of social
issues during ASSP‟s implementation and if the Bank team and Government had been less
vigilant in their attention to the issues arising.

9.10. ASSP‟s experience provides the following considerations for the ASSP/AISP
program and possibly for other countries:

       A study to assess gender and poverty issues and to identify practical actions should be
        done during project preparation, and findings incorporated in project design (or as a
        second-best retrofitted as was done for ASSP).
       Gender and poverty impacts should be monitored during project implementation
        (done informally by ASSP, though without surveys).
       The intention to make ASSP/AISP activities financially self-supporting needs to
        integrate social considerations in the assessment of feasibility, in design, and in
        subsequent monitoring.


10. Lessons
10.1. The main lessons from this review are:

    1. Broad-spectrum change in a complex sector where there is limited experience can be
       made effective through a learning-oriented and continuously adaptive program
       approach aimed at establishing a platform for future development. ASSP‟s
       fundamental achievement was that it explored and created a starting set of technical
       modalities, experience, institutions and legislation for the future development of
       Kyrgyz‟s agricultural support services (para. 6.9).
    2. While financial independence for providers of agricultural services is generally
       desirable, self-financing options need to take account of the public goods nature of
       some services, the special needs of poorer rural communities, and the rate at which
       communities and entrepreneurs can adapt to a pay-for-service environment. The
       ASSP/AISP program‟s drive to achieve financially independent agricultural extension
       services could apply a sharper differentiation between charged (private goods)
       services and services for which charging would be impractical or socially costly (for
       instance, extension to poor and isolated communities), and for charged services, the
       time frame to achieve self-sufficiency should be adaptive as experience is gained and
       farmers and service providers respond to the changing financing environment (paras.
       9.1 to 9.6).

44. As found in a World Bank survey of four ECA countries: “Legislation and procedures that appear gender
neutral because they do not make a distinction between the rights of men and women may, nevertheless, affect
men and women in very different ways, given how traditional gender relationships and stereotypes affect access
to information, resources and power.” Dudwick, N., Fock, K and Sedik.D, 2007. “Land Reform and Farm
Restructuring in Transition Countries. The Experience of Bulgaria, Moldova, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan.”
(World Bank, 2007).
                                       33


3. Inclusion of women and poorer families in rural development can be particularly
   effective if based on proactive investigation of the needs of vulnerable groups,
   practical social and economic measures to respond to these needs, and monitoring
   and adapting these measures during implementation. ASSP‟s proactive approach
   found ways to enhance participation of vulnerable groups across all components
   (paras. 9.7 to 9.10).
4. A strong M&E system is particularly important for projects that pioneer new
   approaches, and may need adjustment as implementation progresses. Monitorable
   indicators to measure achievements against the project objectives, and M&E
   arrangements, need to be detailed prior to project commencement including
   processes that enable learning from evaluation results. Had a responsive M&E
   system been in place for ASSP, decisions could have been more sharply focused on
   what activities needed adjustment and what interventions yielded strong results
   (paras. 2.7, 2.8 and 6.5).
