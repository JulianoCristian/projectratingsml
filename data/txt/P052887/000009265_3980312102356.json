There are three components: 1)\n            rehabilitating and equipping selected health facilities to\n            facilitate the delivery of good quality health care to the\n            population, which will also have a direct favorable impact\n            on cost recovery by those facilities; 2) controlling malaria\n            by improving the case management at all levels of the health\n            service, educating the population for a better use of\n            services and to improve case management at home, and\n            preventive activities including mosquito control to reduce\n            the incidence of the disease; and 3) institutional\n            strengthening to facilitate and support the increased use of\n            quality care by the population and to further implement\n            health sector reforms, including a) training the staff of\n            the public health and population ministry (MOH) and the\n            health facilities staff in the delivery of quality health\n            care, management, and accounting; b) studies to develop\n            alternative mechanisms for health financing; and c)\n            technical assistance, logistical support, and equipment for\n            MOH's central and regional directorates and for PNAC\n            (the agency in charge of marketing drugs)."}, "docdt": "1998-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
