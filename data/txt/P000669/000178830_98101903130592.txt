TO THE EKECUTIVE DIRECTCRS CN A PRCPOSED
BANK LOAN TO THE ETHICPIAN ELECTRIC
LIGHIT AND PaOdER AUTHORITY
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $23.1 million
to the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.          The proposed Loan would be the second Bank loan to EELPA.
The first (375/ET) was a $23.5 million loan, approved in 1964, for
financing the construction of Awash II and III hydroelectric plants and
associated transmission facilities. Awash II has been in service since
1967 and is operating successfully. When the pressure tunnel for Awash
III was filled with water in February 1968, it became apparent that there
were serious defects in the concrete lining which necessitated shutting
down the plant. An investigation determined that the failure was due
partly to poor rock conditions for which inadequate allowance was made in
design and partly to poor construction. The works required to rectify
these defects are estimated to cost about US $700,000 and commissioning
of Awash III is not now expected until the first half of 1970. The
closing date has been extended until December 31, 1970 to enable these works
to be financed from the unallocated balance of the loan. Aside from the
technical problems with Awash III, for which little blame can be laid
to ZELPA, performance under 375/ET has been satisfactory.
3.          In October 1968, the Ethi,opian Government and the Ethiopian
Electric Light and Power Authority (3ELPA) requested the Bank to finance
the 100 MW Finchaa hydroelectric development and the associated 215 Km,
200 Kv transmission line and terminal substation. Financing of this
project had been arranged with USAID on a tied basis but when bids for
civil works wrere received from United States contractors, EELPA and
its consultants considered them to be too high. The Ethiopian Government
and EFJLPA therefore decided to seek Bank financing so as to obtain the
lower costs expected through international competitive bidding. With the
full concurrence of USAID, the Bank sent a mission in November 1968 to
appraise the project. In order to avoid any disruption in the preparation
of thae project, USAID has agreed to continue to finance, undor a revised
and rrodified loan agreement, the services of engineering consultants
through the preparation of bid documents for international tender and
evaluation of bids. These engineering services would be performed in
accordance with Bank requirements.
4.          Negotiations for the proposed Bank loan took place in
Washington in March 1969. The Empire of Ethiopia (Guarantor) was re-
presented by Ato Asfaw Damte, Economic and Financial Attache, Ethiopian
Embassy. EELPA was represented by Ato Assefa Tilahun, General lanager
and Mr. Erik Thorsen, Comptroller.

6.          Aside from the 1968 loan and credit for highways, there are
no outstanding problems of delays in disbursements. For the highway
project a second tender was required due to an insufficient number of
responses to the first tender. Bids on the second tender were opened in
March and are currently being evaluated.
7.          I expect to present shortly a proposed loan of US $4.5
million to the Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia. It is
expected that a proposed agricultural loan of about US $4 million will be
ready for presentation within a few months. Other operations under
consideration are in education, agriculture, urban water and sewerage.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.          A report on the proposed project entitled "Ethiopia -
Appraisal of the Finchaa Hydroelectric Project of the Ethiopian Electric
Light and Power Authority" (PU-9a, dated April 10, 196   is attached.
10.         With the exception of Asmara and Ntassawa in Eritrea, all
public electricity supply in Ethiopia is the responsibility of EELPA, a
statutory corporation of the Ethiopian Government. Generation of
electric power by EELPA has increased at a rate of about 18% a year
since 1956. This relatively high rate is a reflection of low past pro-
duction, and even the present consumption of electricity is one of the
lowest among developing countries on a per capita basis. Investment in
power generation has helped to make possible the vigorous rate of growth
in manufacturing (about 15% a year since 1960).
11.         The proposed project would consist of the construction of a
low earth-filled dam on the Finchaa River, a tributory of the Blue Nile,
approximately 170 Km northwest of Addis Ababa and a power station equipped
with three 33.3 PR generators. An associated 220 KV transmission line
would be constructed, together wfith a 105 MVA terminal substation near
Addis Ababa.
12.         The proposed project is necessary to keep the capability of
EELPA in pace with the expected needs for power from 1972. The
incremental rate of return to EELPA on the proposed investment, before
income taxes, valuing output at current tariffs, is estimated at
19/. The project cost of US$33.8 million represents 68% of EFLPA½e
expansion program during the period 1969-73. The remainder of the program
consists of the establishment of self contained systems in 17 communities
now without electricity and expansion of the distribution system, estimated
to cost about US$15 million. The proposed loan would finance the foreign
exchange cost of the project, estimated at 68% of the total project cost
and about 50% of the total cost of EELPA's 1969-73 program. EELPA should
be able to provide the balance of the funds required to finance its 1969-
73 program out of cash flow, with the assistance of a US$2 million over-
draft from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia which will provide for temporary
shortages predicted for 1971 and 1972.
13.         Assuming that present tariffs are maintained, it is estimated
that the rate of return on EELPA¶s average net fixed assets in operation,after
income taxes,will fluctuate generally between 7% ana 8% per annum over
the next five years. EELPA has agreed to adjust rates
4s necessary to maintain a return of at least 7% per annum. Internal cash



generation is expected to cover annual debt service 2.3 times on average.
EELPA agreed not to incur long-term debt if net revenues were less
than 1.4 times the debt service requirements, without the Bank's agreement.
124.        EELPA is well managed and operated, and is satisfactorily
organized.  Qh the basis of its past performance EELPA, with the assistance
of its consulting engineers, is considered capable of carrying out the
construction of the project and operating it efficiently after it is
completed.
15.         With the exception of the 90 Km access road to the dam site,
(excluded from Bank financing) construction will be carried out under a
civil works contract awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Procurement of equipment (except for minor items) will also be
on the basis of international competitive bidding.
16.         The proposed project is located on the Finchaa River, a
tributary of the Blue Nile. However, the Finchaa River is estimated to
contribute only about one percent to the average flow of the Blue Nile
and less than one half of one percent of the average flow of the Nile.
The Bank has considered the possible effects of the proposed project on
the interests of other riparians and concluded that the volume of water
stored and released, when compared with the flow of the Blue Nile where
the Finchaa enters its stream, would be insignificant.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.         The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and EELPA, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Empire of Ethiopia and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III Section h(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
18.         The draft Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement are substan-
tially in the form, usuaUly used for public utility projects. Sections 5.08
and 5.10 of the Loan Agreement provide for amendments to the loan agreement
for the first loan to EELPA (375/ET) so as to avoid conflicts between the
provisions of the two loan agreements relating to the rate of return and
debt service.
PART V - THE ECoNoMY
19.         A "1'Mmrandum on Recent Economic Development in Ethiopia"
dated April 17, 1969 is attached (Annex 2). The memorandum describes the
slowdown in economic activities in Ethiopia in the years after 1965/66 as a



- 6 -
result of the lower volume of external trade. A fall in the price of
coffee, which accounts for more than half of Ethiopia's export earnings,
and the closure of the Suez canal have brought about declines in exports.
Consequently, the monetary sector of the econony has undergone a mild
recession. This had a direct impact on the budget because receipts of
taxes from imports and exports have fallen and have not been offset by
increased revenues frcn the domestic sources.
20.          The budget for 1967/68 closed with a relatively large deficit
financed by borrowing from the central bank, and in the current fiscal year
the Government is facing a cash problem because it has already reached the
relatively restrictive statutory limits of central bank borrowing. The
situation wiLl be relieved by a forthcoming issue of Treasury bills but
the Government also proposes to change the banking legislation and raise
the limit on government bank borrowing along lines recently recommended
by the IMP.
21.          Although these changes will permit the Government to overcome
the liquidity difficulties which it has encountered this year, longer
tern measures to deal with the underlying causes have to be taken.
Following cabinet changes in February 1969, the Prime Minister assured
me of his Government's intention to deal with the problem. Fortunately
foreign exchange reserves equivalent to five-months imports provide a
margin of time in which new policies can be introduced and take effect.
The restoration of a sound budget position and the generation of an
adequate volume of public savings will be an important pre-condition for
the execution of the new Five-Year Plan. A mission from the Bank will
visit Ethiopia later this year to appraise the plan and to advise the
Government on the measures needed to implement it.
22.          Ethiopia's total external public debt as of June 30, 1968,
was US$127 million net of undisbursed loans, and US$234 million including
undisbursed amounts. The net foreign reserves, which were equivalent to
seven months' imports at the end of 1966, have since declined but were a
little over five months' imports at the end of 1968. The debt service
ratio has been rising slowly and had reached 10.6% in 1967, a year in
which e;port earnings were depressed. Although, therefore, Ethiopia
has some margin for additional borrowing on conventional terms, the low
per capita income and the predominant role in export played by coffee
makes it advisable for her to obtain as much capital as possible on con-
cessionary terms.
