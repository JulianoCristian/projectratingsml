MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
Subject:     Project Completion Note on Pakistan
Tubewells Project (Credit 208-PAK)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Note on Pakistan
Tubewells Project (Credit 208-PAK)" prepared by the South Asia Regional Office.
The project, approved in 1970, was terminated in 1972 following the emergence of
Bangladesh. However, implementation continued with little interruption in a slightly revised form,
as the Northwest Region Tubewells Project to Bangladesh (Cr. 341, with provision for repayment to
IDA of the amount withdrawn under Cr. 208).
The Note clarifies the apparent absence of a PCR for Cr. 208. The PCR and the
performance audit for the Northwest Region Tubewells Project (Report No. 3946) identify the
continuity between the two credits and treat the Cr. 208 appraisal as the first appraisal for Cr. 341,
so they serve as PCR and audit of Cr. 208 as well. The satisfactory rating given to the Northwest
Region Tubewells Project in its PCR and performance audit also apply to Cr. 208.

PAKISTAN
Tubewells Project
(Credit 208-PAK)
1.          In June 1970, IDA made a credit of US$14 million (Cr. 208-PAK) for the East
Pakistan Tubewells Project jointly with Sweden, which provided US$6 million equivalent.
Simultaneously, Canada made a parallel loan of about US$6.5 million equivalent to finance the
purchase of fiberglass screens and casings for the tubewells. The project was to irrigate about 180,000
acres and provide technical assistance (TA) together with essential improvements in agricultural
support services. Project works included drilling of about 3,000 (diesel powered) tubewells,
distribution channels to be built by farmer cooperatives, and three field trial and demonstration farms.
2.           The events of 1971, leading to the emergence of Bangladesh, interrupted project
execution. While TA consultants continued their activities for some time, no works contracts had
been awarded when disbursements were suspended from the IDA credit on December 29, 1971, and
from the Swedish credit on February 1, 1972.
3.          In early 1972, Bangladesh requested financial assistance to complete the project and
applied for membership in the Bank Group. Canada converted its loan to a grant of about US$6
million equivalent. In consultation with Sweden, IDA sent a mission to Bangladesh in May 1972 to
reappraise the project. In June 1972, Sweden provided an interim credit of US$11 million equivalent
to finance urgent expenditures incurred under this and other projects after January 1, 1972.
4.           On September 29, 1972, IDA terminated the right of Pakistan to make withdrawals
from Cr. 208-PAK, and cancelled the undisbursed balance of about US$13.88 million. On October
24, 1972, the Board approved a credit of US$14 million to Bangladesh to help finance completion
of the (somewhat modified) project, renamed Northwest Region Tubewells Project. It was the third
of some eleven new credits to replace credits made earlier to Pakistan for projects located in the former
East Wmg. Credit 341-BD included provision for repayment to IDA of the principal amount
withdrawn from Cr. 208-PAK (US$118,287.50). It was signed on November 6, 1972, and became
effective on January 17, 1973. Sweden provided joint financing of US$6 million equivalent.
5.           Implementation proceeded without further disruption, although the closing date was
extended three times, and physical targets have been mainly achieved, resulting in a recalculated ERR
of 23.3 percent. The PCR (February 1981) and the performance audit report (May 1982, Report
No.3946) for the Northwest Region Tubewells project describe the relationship between the two
credits and discuss the appraisal of Cr. 208 as the first appraisal for Cr. 341. Report No.3946
therefore serves as de facto PCR and performance audit report for the East Pakistan Tubewells
project.
