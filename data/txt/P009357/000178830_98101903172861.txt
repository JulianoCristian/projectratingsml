INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED     CREDIT
TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE
EAST PAKISTAN TUBEWELLS PROJECT

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE EAST PAKISTAN TUBEWELLS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $14 million to
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to assist in financing a tubewell project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        To date, the Association has made seven credits totalling US $29.4
million equivalent (net of cancellations) to assist in the development of
East Pakistan's water resources. Four credits have been made for the con-
struction of flood control and irrigation works: the Dacca-Demra Project
(Credit No. 11-PAK; made in 1961 for US $1 million equivalent), the Brahma-
putra Embankment Project (Credit No. 39-PAK; made in 1963 for US $5
million), the initial Chandpur Project (Credit No. 40-PAK; made in 1963
for US $9 million and reduced to US $5.2 million in 1965), and the Chandpur
II Project (Credit No. 184-PAK;   made in May 1970 for US $13 million).   Two
credits have been made to help finance engineering services for prospective
irrigation and flood control projects: The Dacca Southwest Irrigation-
Engineering Project (Credit No. S-8 PAK; made in 1969 for US $0.8 million),
and the Karnaphuli-Muhuri Irrigation-Engineering Project (made in June
1970 for US $2.4 million). In addition, the Association and the UNDP
in 1969 agreed to share in the financing of foreign exchange costs for
the first two years of general consulting services to the East Pakistan
Water and Power Development Authority (Credit No. 136-PAK, for US $2
million).
3.        The proposed credit would be the Association's first assistance
to East Pakistan for the purpose of constructing tubewells for irrigation
purposes. The use of tubewells to utilize ground water resources has only
recently been introduced to East Pakistan, but promises to yield significant
returns. The Association is providing assistance for this project together
with Sweden (through the Swedish International Development Authority - SIDA)
which will provide US $6 million equivalent through joint financing, and
Canada (through the Canadian International Development Agency - CIDA) which
will provide about US $6.5 million equivalent through parallel financing.
Together these three credits will finance approximately 60 percent of the
total project cost (US $44.6 million equivalent). The Swedish credit re-
quires Government approval, which is expected shortly. The Canadian credit
has already been approved. The effectiveness of all three credits will be
conditional upon each other.

4.        The proposed project was appraised in November/December 1969.
Negotiations for the proposed credit took place between May 18 and May 27,
1970. Messrs. L. Kalderen (Director, Department of National Assistance,
SIDA), S. Ohlunid and T. Kvarnback represented SIDA. Messrs. N. Overend
(Head, Asia Section, Planning Division, CIDA) and P.A. Carter represented
CIDA.  Mr. A.R. Bashir (Economic Minister, Embassy of Pakistan), Mr. A.M.A.
Muhith (Economic Counselor, Embassy of Pakistan), Mr. H.R. Malik (Chair-
man, East Pakistan Agricultural Development Corporation - EPADC), and
Mr. M.M.R. Shaziruddin (Supervising Engineer, EPADC) represented the
Borrower and the Province of East Pakistan.
5.        A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC invest-
ments in Pakistan as of April 30, 1970, together with a statement on dis-
bursements and current operations of the Bank Group, is contained in my
Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan -to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines
Limited, dated June 3, 1970 (R70-104).

PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        A report, entitled "Appraisal of the Tubewells Project - East
Pakistan" (No. PA-49a), dated June 9, 1970 is attached.
8.        East Pakistan covers 55,000 square miles and is predominantly
agricultural. Nlinety-five percent of the total population, estimated
roughly at 71 million, is rural, and 56 percent of gross production comes
from agriculture. Approximately 22 million acres (64 percent of the total
area) are cultivated. Holdings are small (average 3.4 acres) and highly
fragmented. Little capital is employed. Yields and productivity in
agriculture are among the lowest in the world. Much of the production is
for subsistence. Rice, by far the most important crop, accounts for as
much as 82 percent of the total output of major crops. Jute is the princi-
pal export.
9.        The climate is tropical and one of extremes -- heavy rainfall and
floods occur from June to October, with 4 to 5 months of relative dryness
during the winter. During the dry season cultivation has been restricted by
a lack of suitable means for lifting water from streams and low-lying areas.
The area irrigated by traditional methods in the winter season is only about
1.1 million acres or 5 percent of the cultivated area.
10.       The Province has embarked upon a major effort to stimulate agricul-
tural growth, attain self-sufficiency in foodgrain production and substan-
tially expand output of exportable crops. This effort comprises a broad
range of measures -- including irrigation and flood protection works, the
provision of improved seeds (such as L=2>i rice) and sufficient anounts of
fertilizer, and plant protection.
11.       A principal vehicle for improving irrigation is the Province's
Thanai/ Irrigation Programme (TIP), which has thus far placed major emphasis
on the use of 2-cusec low-lift pumps to utilize water from natural drainage
channels. About 10,700 low-lift pumps serving 515,000 acres were in use in
1°68/69. Tubewell development has been slow07; only abojt 1,360 had been
completed by the end of 1968/69 -- 800 under the TIP. The draft Fourth Five-
Year Plan (1970/71-1974/75) calls for a major expansion of tubewell construc-
tion under the TIP. In the preparation of this program the Province is being
assisted by the Bank's East Pakistan Study Group.
12.       The project consists of the construction by the East Pakistan
Agricultural Development Corporation (EPADC), assisted by engineering and
agricultural consultants, of 3,000 2-cusec tubewells, and related field
channel irrigation distribution systems to the extent that these are not
constructed by the farmers themselves, to serve a total area of about
180,000 acres. Concurrently with the installation of the tubewells, the
Departmenu of Agriculture of the Province, also assisted by consultants,
will provide an agricultural support program, which will incluide three
1/ The thana is a basic unit of government; there are about 400 of these
in East Pakistan.



field trial and demonstration farms. Included in the consultants' terms
of reference will be the preparation of feasibility studies for future
stages of the tubewell program. The appointment of these consultants is
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
13.       An additional output of about 216,000 long tons of rice is ex-
pected as a result of the project, thereby reducing imports and resulting
in a saving of about US $22 million equivalent per annum in foreign ex-
change. It is estimated that if the additional inputs of labor used in
farming in the project area were disregarded, the economic rate of return
would be 32 percent. When the cost of this additional farm labor is in-
cluded, the estimated economic rate of return is 20 percent.
14.       The total costs of the proposed project are estimated at about
US $44.6 million equivalent, net of duties and taxes, of which foreign
exchange requirements are estimated at US $22.8 million equivalent (51
percent of total project cost). Contracts for well construction and the
supply of pumps, engines, vehicles and other supplies and equipment
totalling about US $30 million equivalent would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. It is expected that Pakistani drilling
contractors and pump manufacturers will participate in the bidding; the
latter will receive a preference of 15 percent (or the prevailing customs
duty, whichever is lower). Local contractors are likely to win contracts
for the drilling of about 900 wells (about US $4.4 million equivalent),
and local pump manufacturers contracts for the supply of all pumps (about
US $3.5 million equivalent). Reimbursement for all construction contracts,
whether Pakistani or foreign, will be on an agreed percentage basis.
Provision would be made for retroactive financing not exceeding US $150,000
on account of expenditures for consulting services incurred since May 15,
1970.
15.       The Government of Canada would provide about US $6.5 million
equivalent through a parallel loan agreement to finance the purchase of
fiberglass screens and casings for the tubewells. The terms of the Cana-
dian loan are highly concessional, with repayment over 50 years and no
interest or service charge. The Canadian loan is restricted to procurement
within Canada, as is the case for all Canadian foreign assistance, but there
will be competitive bidding among six to eight Canadian manufacturers; and
their prices appear to be well within the estimates given in the Appraisal
Report, which were based on recent experience in West Pakistan. Canada
will also finance the shipping cost of this equipment (estimated at about
US $500,000) irrespective of the flag under which the shipments would be
made.
16.       Sweden and the Association would together finance US $20 million
equivalent of which US $16.3 million equivalent would represent foreign
expenditures and US $3.7 million equivalent, local. As in previous cases
of joint financing with Sweden, the terms of the two credits would be the
same and procedures for their utilization would be identical, with unre-
stricted procurement from any member country of the Bank or Switzerland.



17.       The operating and maintenance costs of each tubewell will be
recovered from each irrigation group through an annual charge. During
the first year of operation the charge will be Rs. 300 per annum, grad-
ually rising each year so that in the sixth year it will be sufficient to
recover the full operating and maintenance costs, and in the tenth year
and thereafter sufficient to recover also the full replacement costs of
engines and pumps.  The Province, in consultation with the Association
and after a study by the consultants of farm family incomes and prevailing
conditions in the project area, will also make arrangements for recovery
of as much as practicable of the capital costs of the project.
18.       The Government of East Pakistan would open two special revolving
accounts to handle the funds required for the implementation of the project.
The establishment of these revolving accounts, including initial deposits,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
19.       The sinking of 3,000 tubewells provided for in this project will
require a major increase in EPADC's capacity. Further conditions of effec-
tiveness of the credit would therefore be the enlargement and reorganization
of the Tubewells Division of EPADC, to be carried out in consultation with
the Association. Provision would be made for the establishment within this
Division of a Project Control and Record Section which would be responsible
for the development and implementation of a suitable project control system.
20.       The Province would assure the Association (Section 4.08 (d) of the
draft Joint Financing Agreement) that it would not undertake any additional
tubewell construction which might jeopardize or delay the execution of the
proposed project and in this regard has promised to keep the Association in-
formed of its plans.
PART IV - LEGAL TNSTRUIJ34TS AND AUTHORITY
21.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Joint Financing Agreement between
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Province of East Pakistan, the Kingdom
of Sweden and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of
a draft Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
22.       The contents of the various agreements conform substantially to
the pattern of agreements used for irrigation projects, and in particular
that of the Development Credit Agreement for the Chandpur II Irrigation
Project (Credit No. 184-PAK). To reflect the joint financing arrangements,
matters of common interest to the Association and Sweden are contained in a
draft Joint Financing Agreement: the draft Association Development Credit
Agreement and the Swedish Credit Agreement contain the financial terms and
other matters of primary interest to the Association and Sweden respectively.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
23.       During the latter half of the 1960's Pakistan's economy continued
to expand quite rapidly, achieving a growth comparable to the 5.5 percent
per annum attained in the Second Plan period (1960/61-1964/65). Improve-
ments in per capita national income, however, slowed down over the decade
as the rate of growth of population accelerated, despite the introduction
of a family planning program. Moreover, it appears that inter-regional and
inter-personal distribution of income became more uneven.   The majority of
Pakistan's population, therefore, witnessed only a very small rise in its
standard of living, and the need for policies and programs designed to
accelerate the rate of economic and social progress is still very acute.
The Basic Data Sheet which is attached as an Annex, sets out the main eco-
nomic developments of the past decade.
24.       The most important achievement of the Third Plan (1965/66-1969/70)
was the acceleration of agricultural production growth from 3.3 percent per
annum in the Second Plan period to 4.2 percent in the latter half of the
sixties. The agricultural breakthrough, however, remained confined to West
Pakistan where significant advances in wheat and rice production were made.
In the East, foodgrain production did not rise by more than 2 percent per
annum, thus necessitating continuing large and rising food imports. In
contrast, growth in the manufacturing sector accelerated significantly, but
its effects on the economy as a whole were outweighed by continuing sluggish-
ness in agriculture. Thus, East Pakistan's regional income grew only by
some 4 percent per annum in the Third Plan period, not much above the rate
of population increase (nearly 3 percent per year) so that there was only
a nominal improvement in per capita incomes in East Pakistan. As a result,
income disparity between Pakistan's two wings has tended to widen, and the
increasing income gap has aggravated the problems inherent in the geographic
division of the country.
25.       The need to reduce regional income disparity represents one of the
principal compulsions for a new development strategy for Pakistan which the
Government is endeavoring to develop in preparing the Fourth Five-Year Plan,
due to begin on July 1, 1970. Indeed, much of the discussion in Pakistan
about the proposed Plan has centered around the disparity issue and ways of
tackling it effectively. In addition, however, a number of other difficult
issues require resolution, in particular policies affecting domestic resource
mobilization, investment planning and balance of payments management.
(Please refer to paragraphs 23-27 of my Report and Recommendation on a pro-
posed loan to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, dated June 3, 1970;
R70-104.)
26.       Clearly there is no easy approach to overcoming the sluggishness
of economic growth in East Pakistan. There is undoubtedly a need for in-
creasing the availability of resources for investment, but to translate them
into actual investment and economic growth, strenuous efforts will be required
to expand absorptive capacity and to improve the management of public invest-
ment. However, it also needs to be recognized that much of the investment
will have to go towards improving the infra-structure of East Pakistan's
economy and thus capital expenditures cannot be relied upon to produce im-
mediate returns in accelerating the growth of output. Efforts to raise the



- 7 -
level of total investment, with a view to laying the basis for more rapid
growth in the longer-term future, will have to go hand in hand with efforts
to exploit to the full, possibilities for making more productive use of
existing investment and opportunities for investments promising to yield
additional output quickly. The proposed tubewell project represents such
an opportunity. Its importance is further enhanced by the fact that it is
in the agricultural sector for, considering the dominance of agriculture in
the economy -- contributing some 55 percent of regional income and employ-
ing close to 80 percent of the labor force -- it is clear that the pace of
East Pakistan's economic and social progress will very largely hinge on the
performance in that sector.
27.       East Pakistan's population is presently growing at an annual rate
close to 3 percent. A successful family planning program will therefore be
of crucial importance for improving living standards. The Government
realizes this, and the program proposed for the Fourth Plan period aims at
bringing about a significant reduction in the birth rate.
28.       The economic position and prospects of Pakistan justify continued
assistance on concessional terms as provided by the Association. The foreign
exchange component of high priority projects suitable for external financing
falls substantially short of the external assistance required for Pakistan's
development. In this special circumstance, I consider that the Association
is justified in including some local expenditures in the credit proposed.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
