Environmental Sanitation Project are: 1) to promote\n            productivity and raise living standards in Ghana's\n            major cities, especially for lower-income people, by\n            improving drainage, sanitation, and solid waste services; 2)\n            to help establish better institutional and financing\n            mechanisms and more effective policy frameworks so that\n            improvements are sustained overtime; and 3) to build up the\n            capacity of the Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies to\n            manage environmental sanitation services. The project will\n            cover Ghana's five major cities: Accra, Kumasi,\n            Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema, and Tamale. It will have five main\n            components: 1) storm drainage; 2) sanitation; 3) solid\n            waste; 4) upgrading of low-income urban areas; and 5) capacity-building."}, "docdt": "1996-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
