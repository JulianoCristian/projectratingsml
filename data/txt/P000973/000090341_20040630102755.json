  follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was unlikely, the institutional development impact was\n            modest, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that capacity\n            building for urban environmental management should be broad\n            enough to include strengthening capabilities in planning,\n            budgeting and revenue collection and include all related\n            departments of the Metropolitan/Municipal Assemblies (Mas)\n            and the decision makers. Project budgets should be allocated\n            - at least partially -- on the basis of Operations and\n            Maintenance (O&M) performance in order to provide an\n            incentive for the local implementing agencies. The Ministry\n            of Local Government and Rural Development should be more\n            pro-active in providing institutional development support to\n            the MAs. Addressing environmental health requires a\n            cross-sectoral approach. Decentralization is a crosscutting\n            theme that involves several sectors and coordination with\n            work on improving the macro and governance. At the same time\n            it should be recognized that the urban sector is a key\n            player in that group."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
