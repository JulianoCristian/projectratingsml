The loan was\n            approved in May 1977 and became effective in September 1977.\n            Loan received were substantially lower than original\n            estimates and US$ 411,399 or 27 percent of the loan was\n            eventually cancelled. The consultants mobilized rapidly and\n            produced their reports with diligence. The Government\n            accepted these reports, except the one on institutional\n            aspects which it found inappropriate. The Bank concurred\n            with this view. The project was very successful, the major\n            objective of rehabilitating and expanding the power and\n            water supply sector having been rapidly undertaken by the\n            Government. Supplies of electricity and water have already\n            improved dramatically while water losses have been\n            substantially reduced."}, "docdt": "1982-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
