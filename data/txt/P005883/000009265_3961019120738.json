The\n            primary objective of the project aimed at: (a) completing\n            the establishment of an effective road maintenance\n            organization; (b) creating an efficient, well-trained\n            Highway Authority work force; and, (c) creating a sound\n            basis for planning the future development of the road\n            system. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was deficient. The key lessons\n            learned were as follows: (i) after the major political event\n            of the unification of the northern and southern parts of\n            Yemen, the consequences of the Gulf crisis, and\n            non-compliance with the legal covenants, project design\n            should have been reassessed and the project restructured to\n            ensure continued relevance and borrower commitment; (ii) the\n            Association should not finance equipment, supplies and\n            workshops until sufficient maintenance capabilities have\n            been established, and sufficient funding for road\n            maintenance has been made available to use the equipment;\n            (iii) more care could be given to the process of selecting\n            qualified consultants for technical assistance assignments\n            that are critical to achieving project objectives and\n            sustainability of the project; and (iv) parastatal\n            contractors should only be allowed to bid for civil works\n            contracts in competition with the private sector when their\n            operations are managerially and financially autonomous."}, "docdt": "1995-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
