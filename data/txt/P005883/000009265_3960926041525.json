(a)\n            complete the establishment of an effective road maintenance\n            organization; (b) create a well trained workforce; and (c)\n            create a sound basis for planning the development of the\n            road system.  Accordingly, the project comprises (a) a\n            three-year slice of a routine and periodic maintenance\n            program (including procurement of routine maintenance\n            equipment and buildings and additional workshop equipment\n            for a new central workshop near Aden.  In addition, it\n            entails (b) reconditioning of existing training facilities\n            and provision of training equipment and materials; (c)\n            technical assistance; (d) preparation of a road master plan;\n            and (e) repair of road flood damage.  The Road Maintenance\n            Program will benefit Government through less frequent costly\n            road reconstruction, as well as road transport operators and\n            motorists through lower vehicle operating costs on better roads."}, "docdt": "1987-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
