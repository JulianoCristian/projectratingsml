Accordingly, the project comprises (a) a\n            three-year slice of a routine and periodic maintenance\n            program (including procurement of routine maintenance\n            equipment and buildings and additional workshop equipment\n            for a new central workshop near Aden.

The Road Maintenance\n            Program will benefit Government through less frequent costly\n            road reconstruction, as well as road transport operators and\n            motorists through lower vehicle operating costs on better roads."}, "docdt": "1987-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
