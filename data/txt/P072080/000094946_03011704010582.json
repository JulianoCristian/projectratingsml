ten-year\n            program that will assist the Government of Mozambique in\n            bringing: 1) transformation of the public service so that by\n            the end of the program, poor as well as rich citizens in all\n            parts of the country will have much better access to public\n            services, and 2) businesses will have to deal with less red\n            tape as they invest to provide the basis for sustainable\n            economic growth. Services will be provided by the\n            citizen's own local governments, via partnerships\n            between the public and private sector, the private sector\n            and executive agencies, all accountable to citizens. It will\n            be a citizen's right rather than a privilege to have\n            access to public services. The project will have a major\n            impact on improving governance and citizens empowerment by\n            making the Government more responsive to business needs and\n            promoting private sector growth. Improved delivery of social\n            and economic services will help citizens reach their full\n            productive potential. The project components are: 1) begin a\n            process of restructuring central government; 2)\n            professionalization by motivating public servants to become\n            more responsive to the needs of citizens; 3) governance by\n            improving allocation, efficient use and accountability of\n            public resources; and 4) program coordination by enhancing\n            capacity to coordinate and monitor the reforms and\n            communicate with key stockholders."}, "docdt": "2003-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
