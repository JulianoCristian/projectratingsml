                     FOURTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT 



                            CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY



Borrower:              Government of Senegal.

Implementing Agency:   Ministry of Economy and Finance.

Financing data:        Credit on standard IDA terms (40-year maturity and I O-year grace period).

Operation type:        First in a new series of two programmatic Development Policy Operations,
                       single tranche.

Main policy areas:     Public financial management, including budget management, procurement,
                       and debt management (20%), education (20%), health, (20%), social
                       protection (15%), environment (15%), statistics (5%), and business
                       environment (5%).

Key Outcome            Detailed outcomes indicators are reported in the Policy Matrix (Annex 9).
Indicators:
Program Development    The proposed operation, the first in a new series of two PRSCs, is to
Objective(s) and       contribute to strengthening the Government of Senegal's policy making
Contribution to CAS:   and institutional capabilities to accelerate broad-based growth, to improve
                       access to social services, to mitigate vulnerabilities, and to foster good
                       governance.

                       The proposed operation is consistent with the objectives of the Bank's
                       FY07-10 Country Assistance Strategy. The proposed credit would be the
                       first in a new, second series of two Poverty Reduction Support Credits
                       (PRSCs). It follows the first series of three PRSCs successfully completed
                       over 2004-07, and two stand-alone Development Policy Operations, one in
                       2008 (focusing on the energy sector) and another in 2009 (under the IDA
                       Financial Crisis Response Fast-track Facility). Policies and reforms
                       supported by this operation are well aligned with the four pillars of
                       Senegal's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II), which the CAS
                       supports.

                       Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of this
Risks:
                       operation. All of these risks could lead to a smaller-than-expected impact
                       of the policies supported by the proposed PRSC. Yet, key risk mitigating
                       factors are integrated in the design of the operation, including a focused
                       agenda and high donor involvement. Risks include:

                       Developments in the global economy. A slower normalization and/or a
                       longer macroeconomic downturn in the current global context than



                                                VI
                       anticipated represent a significant risk, contingent on developments in
                        partner country economies, mainly in Europe. One key mitigation strategy
                        is for the authorities to continue to steer a stable fiscal course for the year
                       and adopt resolute reforms, especially in the PFM area, that may in tum
                       mobilize donors to provide additional resources to buffer the budget from
                       the consequences of a protracted global recession. In this regard, credit
                       augmentation from the pilot CR W resources provides pre-emptive support
                       to the authorities' ability to sustain their fiscal stance, one of the main
                       channels for risks of an amplification of the effects of external shocks onto
                       the domestic economy.

                       Political opposition, including from vested interests. The risk of an uneven
                       commitment to reforms is heightened in the context of the next
                       presidential elections currently scheduled for 2012, following the recent
                       municipal elections, which saw the victory of opposition parties in several
                       key urban centers. Nonetheless, the balance of risks to the policy
                       objectives of the proposed series, including the proposed PRSC N, is still
                       viewed as favorable to moving forward with it. Vested interests can also
                       represent important obstacles to reform, especially reforms that foster
                       transparency in the use of public resources. Under the proposed operation,
                       risks arising from opposition and vested interests are mitigated by the fact
                       that all policy measures are implemented before credit approval. While
                       risks of reversals of already implemented measures should not be
                       neglected, continued close Bank engagement by a core team almost
                       entirely field-based also enhances the Bank's monitoring of reforms and its
                       ability to take steps to ensure that reform objectives are being followed
                       through. The design of the series also aims to mitigate risks by ensuring a
                       built-in process of collaborative analytical, dialogue and stakeholder
                       consultations process.

                       Weak administrative capacity and slow program implementation. This
                       risk is relatively minor in Senegal, in part given the large number of highly
                       trained technocrats, especially at the Ministry of Economy and Finance. In
                       this area, the implementation of PFM and procurement reforms is
                       supported by several donors (IMF, France, EU, Canada, and The
                       Netherlands) and the Bank with technical and financial assistance. In
                       other areas, the proposed PRSC series builds on, complements or leverages
                       existing or plaIUled Bank and donor development policy, capacity
                       building, and investment operations and a broad program of analytical
                       work that should considerably mitigate risks of limited implementation
                       capacity.

                        FOURTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                           1. INTRODUCTION

1.1       This program document proposes a Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (pRSC IV) for
the Republic of Senegal in the amount of SDR28.4 million (US$43 million equivalent). The amount of
this credit has been increased from US$33 million equivalent envisaged in the CAS to SDR28.4 million
(US$ 43 million equivalent) through the addition of SDR6 million from the pilot Crisis Response Window
resources to help Senegal mitigate the lingering impact of the global economic slowdown. This operation is
the first of a programmatic series of two PRSCs-PRSC IV of PRSCs IV -v. The proposed series supports
the implementation of the final year of the Government's Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP
II) and assists in the development and early implementation of its successor PRPS-III in the challenging
context of an exceptionally unfavorable global environment. The overarching objective of this second series
is to contribute to strengthening the Government of Senegal's policy making and institutional capabilities to
accelerate broad-based growth, to improve access to social services, to mitigate vulnerabilities, and to foster
good governance.
1.2      As Senegal embarks on the last year of its 2006-10 PRSP-II, the country is at an unusually
challenging juncture. First, successive external and internal shocks since 2006, including the 2009 global
crisis, have taken a toll on Senegal's fairly open economy, slowed the growth process to a near halt, and
clawed back some of the gains in poverty reduction of the early decade. This experience has also highlighted
the inadequacy of the public policy toolbox to help the population at large, and the poor in particular, to cope
with these shocks. While the global crisis appears to be waning, risks remain, and importantly, the
cumulative impact of repeated shocks on a population with only limited coping mechanisms is potentially
undermining the foundations for future growth and poverty reduction (section B and Annex 4). Second,
despite a IS-year long period of positive economic growth, the economy has shown little structural change,
with limited diversification, a continued dependence of the growth momentum on public spending, no export
drive and virtually no net job creation in the formal private sector (section B and Annex 3). Third, even
Senegal's notable macro-fiscal success, a five-fold expansion of the public finances over the decade on a
broadly sustainable track, is turning out to constitute a critical challenge on the efficiency, equity and
governance fronts, confronting the authorities with the urgency to strengthen further their public financial
management institutions and their spending policies (section B and Annex 3). Fourth, tackling the main
structural feature of poverty in Senegal-the deepening of entrenched disparities between the capital Dakar
and the rest of the country-remains as relevant today as it has ever been, even as the successive shocks of
recent years have taken a disproportionate toll on the urban poor, especially in the greater Dakar area (section
D and Annex 4). Fifth and finally, the scope for a return to a medium-term development focus in public
policy, as opposed to short-term crisis response or mitigation, should be expected to be tested in the coming
political context. Though Senegal continues to enjoy a broadly stable political climate, the political economy
of reforms is likely to become markedly more complex in the next two years, with the upcoming presidential
elections in 2012, following the opposition parties' victory in local elections in early 2009 . In this context,
commitment to difficult reforms may become more hesitant at a time when a new momentum of reforms
seems more needed than ever to tackle Senegal's challenges of dealing with shocks, boosting growth,
improving public sector governance and addressing the regional disparities. (section A).
1.3      It is in this challenging context that the proposed programmatic series of PRSC IV-V aims to
support the implementation of Senegal's reform agenda. The recent history of shocks has exposed the
fragility of Senegal's institutions of economic and financial management but also the resolve of policy
makers to sustain their achievement of stability. Policy responses have sometimes been slow and uneven,
but throughout the period       authorities have          to maintain a broadly stable macroeconomic policy
stance and momentum in their structural policies. In successive PRSP Progress Reports, they have candidly
noted both successes and shortcomings, but they have          affirmed their               to     long-term
objectives, to correcting slippages and to working with development partners.
1.4      The reform policies supported by this new series are aligned with Senegal's PRSp-n covering
the period 2006-2010. 1 While the authorities have already initiated the preparation of a successor PRSP-III,
they          to finalize by        O. In this          a           programmatic          is better suited than a
stand-alone operation or a longer series to help Senegal address its unusually complex development
               This        the authorities have indicated that PRSP-III, covering the period 2011-15, was
expected to maintain the first two PRSPs' objectives of accelerating growth and aiming to meet the
Millennium Development             by 2015, even as several of these appear                  unlikely to     met.
Just as it was the case for PRSP-II, many components         PRSP-IH are            to reflect a range of sector
strategies already adopted or        updated by the authorities (See Annex 8). At the same time, a clear lesson
from the implementation of PRSP-II, which is expected to be                into the successor PRSP-HI, is that
poverty reduction               should be seen as live, evolving policy documents, especially given the
successive shocks that have altered the policy landscape since PRSP-II was adopted in 2007.
1.5     The proposed PRSC series is an integral part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for Senegal discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on June 20, 2007, and leverages other Bank
operations that directly support Senegal's agenda in all reforms areas supported under this new      2 The
reform program supported by this series continues and deepens the agenda supported by previous operations,
including the first PRSC          (PRSC I-III, FY04-07), the FY08             Sector Reform Credit and the
FY09 Public Finance Support Credit. The design of the PRSC series is complementary to critical actions
being taken by the authorities under their IMF-supported Policy Support Instrument program. The series also
aims to contribute to fostering enhanced collaboration between the government and donor              of the
Framework                 for Budget Support (Accord Cadre relatif aux Appuis                     ACAB),
including Canada, the European Union, France,              the Netherlands and Spain.

                                  A. RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

2. I     Senegal still enjoys a broadly stable political climate. The Senegalese political system continued
to show a          of democratic maturity with the recent holding of local elections on March         2009.
local elections were widely viewed as fair and transparent and saw the victory of opposition parties in several
key urban centers.       electoral outcomes       tended to sharpen the            political debates between the
presidential majority and a still fragmented but emboldened opposition. In part as a result of this new
political balance,                  repeated Cabinet          in the past year, albeit without significant policy
discontinuity. Overall, the victory of the opposition in important municipalities suggests that policies and
reforms on which a broad consensus has not been forged could be significantly more               to advance.
        The political climate for economic reforms in the next few years is Ukely to become markedly
more complex, with the upcoming presidential elections in 2012. The campaign for these elections
for all         purposes, already started, boosted in part by the success of opposition parties at local

elections. President Wade has announced his intention to run in 2012 for a third term/ and has initiated the
consolidation of his political base around his party, the Parti Democratique Senegalais (POS). In this
context, ambivalence toward developmentally important but politically difficult reforms, frequent changes in
leadership appointments, and pressures on the public finances are all likely to be part of the political
economy of economic management over the next two years. The political debate is also becoming
increasingly crystallized on the governance record of President Wade's administration.
2.3      More fundamentally, the Senegalese authorities should be expected to have to confront difficult
issues of consensus building on economic policy, even as the impact of successive external shocks wanes
and a return to trend conditions emerges. Commitment to difficult reforms may become more hesitant at
a time when a new momentum of reforms seems more needed than ever to tackle Senegal's challenges of
dealing with shocks, boosting growth, improving public sector governance and addressing the regional
disparities. This said, the new political context presents both risks and opportunities. Risks because the
political economy of reforms will become markedly more complex, backtracking may become attractive and
populist demands may become pressing. Opportunities because of demand for results can be potentially
channeled towards a more forceful implementation of the authorities' policy platforms in their growth,
human development, social protection, environmental and governance agendas.

                                  B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.4      Economic developments in the closing decade marked a continuation of a trend initiated since
the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 (see Annex 3 for more detailed background on economic and
fiscal developments in the 2000 decade). From the mid-90s until 2005, Senegal had one of the best
economic performances in Sub-Saharan Africa. Though there were brief episodes of low growth, real GOP
grew on average by about 5 percent annually, about 2~ percent a year on a per capita basis, contributing to a
sharp drop in poverty incidence and marking the first sustained increase in average per capita growth since
independence in 1960. Poverty declined rapidly-the fraction of the population that fell below the national
poverty line declined from 68 percent in 1994/95, to 57 percent in 2000101, and to 51 percent in 2005106.
However, the economy has shown little structural change. Growth has remained concentrated on the modem,
largely urban, services sector (telecom, business services, transport, and banking) and construction, fueled by
public works spending and growing remittances from Senegalese abroad. The economy has exhibited little
diversification, a continued dependence of economic . growth on public investment, no export drive and
almost no formal job creation. Pursuing a long trend from previous decades, agriculture, having contributed
nothing to decadal growth, has continued to decline in relative terms, and now represents only a little over
7 percent of nominal GOP, despite its considerable importance as a partial source of livelihood for a majority
of the population. The regional monetary arrangement-a currency union, managed by the supranational
Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO), with a peg to the French franc until 1999, and the euro
since then-provided a framework of monetary and price stability. On the fiscal policy front, the authorities
pursued expansive but broadly sustainable fiscal policies, enhancing revenue mobilization and maintaining
control on current expenditures, while allowing for a steady increase in capital and pro-poor spending-in
the space of the 2000 decade, Senegal's total non-debt spending, expressed in US dollars, will have increased
five-fold, from about US$700 million in 2000 to a projected US$3.5 billion in 2010. The achievement of the
HIPC completion point in 2004 and, in 2005, MDRI, and prudent concessional external borrowing allowed a
sharp reduction in the stock of external debt.
2.5     Since the mid-decade, however, a rapid succession of shocks, some external and some internal,
compounding each other, have taken a toll on the economy (see Annex 4 for a summary account of these
successive shocks). The run up in oil prices and, starting in 2007, the surge in food prices weighed down on

3 President Wade won his first term, for a seven year mandate, in 2000. A subsequent amendment to the Constitution
allows two five-year terms for the Presidency, effective from the 2007 elections, in which President Wade won his
second term.

Senegal's open economy, drove end-of-period inflation to 4 percent in 2006 and 6 percent in 2007 and 2008
from an average of Yz            over the previous three          and contributed to a widening of the external
current account deficit. Sharply higher oil prices and a policy-mandated incomplete pass-through to retail
electricity prices compounded                   (the public electricity company) protracted inefficiency-with
repeated blackouts every               2006; more than 60 percent of firms in a recent enterprise survey named
poor electricity the main impediment to private investment, far ahead of other constraints. Fiscal slippages in
2008, related in part to the fiscalization of food and fuel price crises, led to the accumulation of unpaid bills
by the government to domestic suppliers, equivalent to some            percent of GOP,4 hurting private growth,
especially in the construction and public works sector. The onset of the global                   in 2008 and
deepening in 2009 produced further headwinds against a rapid rebound from previous shocks. More
recently, floods in the Oakar area, affecting an               450,000 people,          constituted an additional
shock, albeit one with a fairly narrow impact in time and place, at a low cost to aggregate GOP.                of
these                    has had      own time frame, channels of transmission, economic             and social or
regional targets, but taken together, they largely account for Senegal's weaker performance in the second half
of the """,au..,.
2.6      Real GDP growth for 2009 is estimated at 1Y.. percent, down from an earlier projection of 5~
percent, itself revised to 3 percent at mid-year on account of tbe estimated impact of tbe global crisis
on Senegal (Table 2.1 below and Annex Table A.I). Good rains have allowed agriculture to mitigate, albeit
only modestly, the impact of shocks on the                Growth in construction and energy has fallen well
below trend, offset only in part by the resumption of a normal activity level at the private phosphate mining
and phosphoric        production firm ICS. The bankruptcy of Senegal Air (former subsidiary of Royal Air
Maroc) and financial difficulties at the Malian and Senegalese jointly-owned railroad company Transrail,
       with a reduction in activities at    Port of Oakar           the domestic and global slowdown have
translated into a sharp estimated drop in transport activity.5 Telecommunications and value-added in the
tourism           have      declined        to lower demand. Part of the nominal demand shock from lower
exports and transfers was mitigated by lower prices for imports: falling imported fuel and food prices have
contributed to       average annual inflation down to a         -1.0 percent for 2009.
2.7      The prompt clearance of 2008 domestic arrears in early 2009 proved to be an important
element of tbe policy response to the crisis. In addition to substantial support from donors at the end of
2008, the government managed to mobilize additional short-term domestic bank financing in early 2009, as
liquidity conditions eased somewhat in the regional money market in the wake of BCEAO's more forceful
liquidity injections in January and February. As a result, by the end of February 2009 (the two-month period
for closing previous         budgetary books), the stock of domestic arrears had been reduced from its peak of
3% percent of GOP at end-October 2008 to less than % percent (FCF A 50 billion). However, arrears owed
by autonomous public agencies-about CFAF [50] billion-have so far not been repaid in full as budget
resources             early in 2009. Their prompt repayment           in 2010 is a short-term priority for the
budget.
2.8      Since the 2009 budget bad been prepared before evidence of tbe impact of the global crisis and
a resulting domestic growth slowdown began to emerge, its original macroeconomic assumptions
quickly proved unrealistic. A Supplemental               for 2009 (Loi de           Rectificative, LFR) was
adopted in Parliament in May 2009 that left overall spending envelopes broadly intact, and targeted the fiscal
deficit at 4Yz percent of GOP, with financing           from additional recourse to domestic borrowing and
additional donor support. Tax revenue projections were        . by about 10 percent downward, on account
of a slower real economy, falling domestic prices and lower import values. In the event, revenues came out

4 The bulk of these arrears were incurred by ministerial departments executing their regular budget; however, additional 

arrears were incurred by autonomous public                  having experienced sharp shortfalls in government budget 

transfers, their main source of financing. 

5 The authorities' estimates for a drop in the value-added of the transport sector are likely to        the contraction, 

as informal road            is probably under-represented in their estimates of sector value-added. 



                                                          4
only slightly below the revised target at end-year, which, together with tight controls on aggregate spending,
allowed the deficit (including grants) to meet the 4'li percent of GDP target of the LFR.
2.9      Overall, the fiscal macroeconomic response was broadly appropriate. Though the fiscal stance
imparted only a modest stimulus, this was appropriate given Senegal's financing constraints. Thus, for
practical policy purposes, mitigating cuts, or, if financing is available, fiscal stimulus remains one of the
main policy steps against the negative impacts of the global crisis. This said, current economic monitoring
tools do not have enough resolution to assess rapidly sector-level, distributional or regional effects with any
significant precision, nor are the government's targeting instruments and programs adapted to the use of
distributional information in well targeted mitigation interventions. There is a clear need to develop better
more effective, better targeted, and fiscally sustainable-responses to shocks. 6
2.10    The IMF approved the third and fourth reviews of the PSI program in June and December
2009, respectively. On that occasion, the IMF Board also approved drawings under the IMF's Exogenous
Shock Facility to deal with the balance of payments impact of the food,' fuel and financial crises.
Performance under the PSI program was broadly satisfactory, with all quantitative assessment criteria met,
and most structural benclunarks-mainly in public financial management-met or partially met. Budget
financing included (i) budget support from France, the European Union, African Development Bank, the
Netherlands and the IDA Public Finance Support Credit; (ii) government paper issues on the regional money
market; and (iii) central bank (BCEAO) lending to the budget against IMF purchases and the recent
additional SDR allocation ofCFAF 94 billion (about US$210 million).
2.11     The external current account balance is estimated to have narrowed because of lower import
volumes and values. The current account deficit (including official grants), estimated at a revised
10'li percent of GDP in 2008, narrowed to about 9'li percent of GDP, with imports down by 12'li percent
reflecting the decline in oil and food prices and a decrease in private capital inflows (FDI and loans) with
high import content. Partly offsetting the favorable impact of lower imports on the current account balance,
remittances and tourism receipts declined as a result of the global crisis, while merchandise exports-still
dominated by a few sectors with long-standing structural constraints, such as phosphate products, fish and
groundnut-dropped further to about II 'i4 percent of GDP in 2009, its lowest level since 1993 (see Annex 3,
Figure A.l). As a result of these developments, the overall balance of payments was barely balanced in
2009-the narrowing of the overall deficit from about US$200 million in 2008 to only US$7 million
reflecting mainly the injection of the IMF SDR allocation to Senegal through the BCEAO. With lower
imports, Senegal's contribution to the regional West African Monetary Union's pool of reserves was broadly
unchanged in currency terms but increased in terms of imports to about 3.9 months at end 2009.

                         C.   MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

2.12      Contingent on international developments, economic growth is projected to return over the
medium term to the 3Yz-4Yz percent range. The full return to fiscal stability and recent private and public
investment momentum should continue to yield a growth dividend for Senegal. Thus, if the global recovery
is confirmed, and export demand, remittances and tourism stabilize or tum upward, growth in 20 I 0 could
reach 3'li percent. Inflation should return to its historical trend of about 2 percent per year. The maintenance
of stability and a continued improvement in the efficiency of public investment could contribute to a return to
historic trends by 20l2-real growth over 4'li percent annually. However, the speed at which Senegal's
growth profile would return to this baseline hinges mainly on the evolving global context. In particular, if
the global crisis does not abate by mid-20 I 0, per capita economic growth in Senegal would remain anemic
for a fifth consecutive year, while social and political pressures on fiscal and other policy areas may build.

2.15     Though risks of direct financial contagion from the global crisis to tile Senegalese banking
sector appear to have          enhanced monitoring by regional supervisors               in order to guard
against unforeseen developments. Bank regulatory policy and supervision are under the purview of
regional                                  the BCEAO and West African             Commission. Senegalese
banks, even               ones, were broadly insulated from the problems                       that affected
their parent banks.                    do not appear to have been exposed to

worsening of local economic           could negatively impact liquidity or solvency of local banks, even as

2.16     The dominant risk factors for banking system soundness in Senegal are related to bank
quality, risks that mainly reflect local economic conditions. At 3.6 percent, growth

performing loans, net of provisions, increased marginally from      percent in 2008 to 9.8 percent at end-June
2009, even as gross                                                    loan portfolio of banks to 18 percent,

2009 as imports pick up with a                               With remittances expected to stabilize, and
imports picking up as growth resumes and FDI           upward, the external current account deficit should
return to the range of 9Yz to 10      of GDP.       a                          of payments is expected to
show a modest deficit-Senegal's contribution to the             West African Monetary Union's pool of
        exchange reserves should remain small in currency       though            notional reserves should

developments as the global crisis wanes. Short-term adjustments to        authorities' policy stance, if needed,
would focus mainly on fiscal policy-the sole                                          clearly under their direct
control. Developments in 2008 and 2009 underscored                    to ensure a credible, fully funded and
sustainable fiscal stance--and indeed, when confronted with                         revenue prospects early in
2009,     authorities promptly adjusted it. Beyond policy                   recent measures to               the
budget process should help ensure that the authorities are in a                      to       through possible
        spending plans. In this context, since the main             a

2.20    The most recent joint Bank and Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis' shows that the risk of debt
                       1
distress in Senegal wi, I remain low over the following twenty years given the low current level of debt
and a commitment to prudent external borrowing. The nominal stock of external debt has risen to 24\12
percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting the non-concessional loan from France taken out at end-2008 to repay
domestic arrears, and the downward revision in GDP nominal growth in 2008 and 2009. Domestic debt is
expected to remain low and stable (5\12 percent of GDP). Even at this higher level, total debt remains well
below critical thresholds, and the risk of debt distress remains low. The scenario assumes that fiscal deficit
and the inflow of concessional funds are in line with historical trends. However, debt indicators would
worsen significantly if GDP growth became permanently lower than the 4-5 percent trend at unchanged
borrowing policy, if the fiscal deficit remains well above 4 percent of GDP for a sustained period, and if
borrowing terms deteriorate. Inversely, debt sustainability can be maintained under a prudent borrowing
policy-with a trend fiscal primary deficit of about 3\12 percent of GDP and concessional financing terms,
both of which are feasible. The authorities have confirmed their policy to borrow externally on concessional
terms, with exceptions only in the case of specific projects of a return and risk profile fully justifying higher
funding costs. They might also need to continue reinforcing the monitoring capacity of the Debt Unit within
the Ministry of Finance and continue to conduct twice a year a debt sustainability analysis as part of this
monitoring, in order to keep borrowing policy in line with the macroeconomic outlook.

                                 D.   POVERTY OUTCOMES AND THE          MDGs

2.21     The last poverty estimates, based on a household survey conducted in 2005/06, showed the
incidence of poverty at 50Y: of the popUlation-more than 6 million Senegalese people live on a
household income below the national poverty line. Two thirds of the poor live in rural areas, and their
sociological profile is contrasted-households headed by people above the age of 60 contribute more than
36 percent of the poor households; poverty incidence is lower for households headed by women than for
those headed by men; household size correlates with poverty (60 percent of all households have 10 people or
more, and they contribute more than three fourths of the total number of poor households). Inequality rose
only moderately between 2001-02 and 2005-06 (the periods of the last two poverty survey), but while it may
have even decreased in urban areas, where the richer have seen relatively lower gains in income than the rest,
it appears to have increased in rural areas, where the poorest have not benefited from the country's positive
growth experience.
2.22    Since 2005-06, repeated shocks have contributed to bringing per capita income growth to a
virtual standstill, with a likely negative impact on poverty incidence. Simulating the impact of just two of
Senegal's recent large shocks, the oil and food price surges, the last Poverty Assessment prepared by the
World Bank team 8 estimated that the declining trend in poverty incidence may have reversed, with a possible
increase in poverty incidence by 2~ points from 2005 to 2007. This said, while GDP growth has been below
trend over 2006-09, barely keeping up with population growth, the impact of shocks on national poverty
incidence may have been mitigated by several factors, including better results in the agricultural sector in the
past two years and the fact that several shocks are likely to have disproportionately impacted urban
population, which is overall less poor than rural populations. A new household survey to be carried out in
2010 shou Id shed light on aggregate and regional trends in poverty over the second half of the decade.
2.23    The summary statistic of poverty incidence at the national level hides significant inequality
among regions and departments. Figure 2.1 below shows that poverty incidence in only 10 of
34 departments stood below the national poverty level in 2005, and that poverty incidence in 10 departments
reached above 60 percent. These departments are located in the centre, mainly the historic groundnut areas
(Louga, Diourbel, K6b6mer, Fatick) or in the South or South-East of the country (K6dougou, Oussouye,

        urban concentration of population, firms, foreign investment,                   in Dakar - play an

sharp         in the momentum of efforts to address regional disparities         in order.
        Moreover, despite clear progress over the past decade, many MDGs will be difficult to ,".".",.,.,r.
without targeted interventions in tbe poorest regions or for tbe poorest households. Regional disparities
in access and overall     quality of basic                         a         concern. In the            sector,
    primary       of 90 percent at the national level masks important regional disparities. Rates vary widely,
from less than 57          in regions        the lowest access to 100          in            a few       areas.
With appropriate interventions targeted at the areas where performance is lower, Senegal could meet the
MDG relative to       primary school enrollment. It will be more             to reach     MDG relative to the
primary school completion rate because          poor performance in quality      education and inefficiency in
service delivery. The high           repetition and dropout rates     hindered         progress on     primary
completion rate. Only about half the students        enter grade one in primary schools complete
year primary schooling cycle.

2.25     More generally, there remains significant scope for improving the efficiency and equity of
public spending and the quality of services. Public finance management refonns, stronger sector policies,
and a new focus on social protection and safety nets will all be crucial to further underpin human capital
development and poverty reduction. The authorities' effort to develop medium-tenn budgeting tools for
several key sectors is a step in the right direction to achieve greater predictability in budgetary allocations to
priority sectors but the sectoral medium-term expenditure frameworks have had little traction on annual
budget fonnulation and execution. A comprehensive program of analytical work on public financial
management and sector policy and public expenditure issues is being developed, collaboratively between the
government, the World Bank and other donors, under the Senegal Programmatic Public Finance Review
(PPFR}- a multi-year programmatic series of public revenue and expenditure reviews extending over FYI 0
FYI2, and covering, inter alia, (volume I) PFM, education, and health; (volume II) agriculture, infrastructure,
and decentralization; and (volume III) non-tax revenues, social protection and environment. Donors are
supporting the PPFR, including Canada (education), Fonds des Nations Unies pour les Enfan!s - UNICEF
(health), and the Netherlands (environment).

                                   A.   THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

3.1             second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) was adopted by tbe Government in
July 2006. 9 The             built on lessons learned during the implementation of      first 2003--05 ......,,, ... c.,,
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP-I). It pushes the poverty reduction agenda forward so as to meet the
objective of           economic growth to about 7 percent per year,      level           to be needed to halve
n''''..rlv incidence by 2015, in line      the        set out in the Millennium Development Goals (MOGs).
PRSP-II has a broad scope, encompassing 505 priority actions aiming at 144              objectives in       sector
or             stmctured under 4 strategic pillars. The poverty strategy       was prepared in a participatory
manner            extensive consultations both at the national and district levels with a broad
stakeholders, including                    from the                       and local governments,
private sector, think tanks, trade unions, and      society organizations. Its      is aligned with
agenda.
3.2      The PRSP-II has four strategic pillars: (i) wealth creation; (ii) capacity building     the provision
   basic                 (iii) the protection vulnerable groups; and (iv)      promotion of        governance
     participation. While the         three      were already at the center of the PRSP-I, the fourth pillar
         the government's acknowledgement that improving the quality of public services and strengthening
transparency       accountability both in the public and            sectors are          to make            on
poverty reduction.
    ..        first pillar reflects the authorities' continued commitment to private-sector led growth, and now
         subsumes           Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS). By                  the AGS at the center of
         pillar of the PRSP-II, the authorities have rightly emphasized the need to encourage private sector-
         led           and to expand and                exports. The           is        on two key objectives: (i)
         improving the overall investment climate in the economy              focusing on a         of cross-cutting
                                   doing business, trade facilitation); and (ii) promoting the development five
         cluster                            tourism, information                 textile   fish/aquaculture-with a
         presumed good export growth and job creation potential.
    ..  The                aims at promoting access to basic            services by a growing
        population. The implementation of the national strategies in the education and health
        as new commitments to enhance nutrition and access to sanitation and water, are      key "" . . ,'''~,''

         through specifically targeted interventions, and               actions to ensure that these     benefit
         from wealth           and gain better access to                     Vulnerable groups are numerous and

        to promote private sector development. 

         As the authorities candidly acknowledge in their last PRSP Annual Progress Report (APR) in
2009, progress in the implementation of tbe strategy has been uneven. On the upside, the APR
underscored                    decline in                   during     1995-2005      (see above).

         The 2009 APR acknowledges that performance on the                          has fallen short
strategy's ambitious goals.           one hand, economic              at             in 2008, fell              the
population growth rate and has remained well below the rate of7-8 percent that is needed to
below 30 percent by 2015, as             in the PRSP-II. On                   performance in the
sector has been encouraging, thanks in part to better rains and, in the government's assessment, to
agriculture and food                 initiative (GOANA).         APR indicated that reforms to                  the
           environment,           by annual meetings of the Presidential Investment Council, have been
commendable.                        momentum and gains in                outcomes in improving

3.6      This said,     APR also concedes that               in sustaining earlier                 efforts has
slowed considerably, in part in relation to the 2008 budget problems. While quantitative outcomes
indicators in               sector continued to               APR recognizes that      main              in the
health sector worsened and that social projects were put on hold, because of         cuts in 2008 and a tight
budget in 2009. Construction of new government~funded classrooms stalled and                      and primary
consultation rates decreased from 2007 to 2008.         APR also notes that               regional disparities
remain. In                example, while the           primary school enrol        could still be met through
targeted               the MDG for primary          completion will be difficult to        mainly because of
the poor        and quality of education in a number of regions.

performance has been weak.            APR                  that efforts be stepped up to strengthen safety nets.
There is a            more appropriate                             in the face of            shocks and limited

 area of judicial governance but that, despite greater efforts spent in modernizing the judicial sector, access
 remains relatively         and costly for a large     of the population.
  3.9      The Government has initiated the preparation of its third Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 

. (pRPS-III) which it intends to finalize by end-December 2010. A                    towards the preparation of 

  PRSP III has been published by the government's PRSP Monitoring unit in the Ministry of Economy and

                       B.    OVERALL FRAMEWORK OF THE NEW SERIES OF PRSCs

 3.10    The overarching objectives of this proposed second programmatic series of PRSCs are to
 support implementation of PRSP-ll in its remaining year and assist the authorities in the development
 and early implementation of PRSP-Ill. The focus of the                 is on a set of critical policy actions aimed
 at strengthening the Government's policy making and institutional capabilities with a                      focus on
     'M"''''''''''''' the            of public resources   institutions. At the same time, in            to        the
 development and early implementation of PRSP-IH,              proposed                supports the                 in
                a range of issues on which progress under PRSP-ll has been weakest, and in particular in social
 protection and environmental sustainability. The design of                        has built on             from the
 implementation of the                 of PRSCs (PRSC I, II      IU)-an                that showed a          positive
 impact of Bank dialogue under PRSC instruments on government ownership of the structural reform

 leadership and accountability.

3.11    The selection of specific areas from the PRSP II, to be supported by the new series, has relied
on four core principles: (i) ensuring a full and flexible alignment with the relevant              of a subset of
the          and with early intentions to strengthen the design of PRSP-HI, drawing on lessons from
implementation      its             (ii)         complementarities between            efforts in different areas,
with a          attention to policy and public expenditure                 complementarities,        example in
education, health, social protection and the environment; (iii) assessing criticality with respect to the
Government's development objectives, with a                        paid to areas where         costs of
outweigh the risks, such as                   vulnerabilities and state land property management, and (iv)
leveraging of the Bank's and other donors efforts to support Senegal's policies in a coherent, Government-

              C.   THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM AGENDA SUPPORTED BY THE

3.13     The           is entering a period of political flux, ahead of the 2012 elections, while just
emerging from a long series of                 including a year of extraordinary stress in the global
environment. Throughout 2009, the authorities made good progress in implementing their plan fiscal and
structural                   to     with the 2008             The slow recovery       the                whose
      also have not completely disappeared, and the political calendar both create a challenging context for a
return to a development-oriented agenda,          several years                                  said, the new
political context presents both risks and opportunities, the latter because demand for results can
potentially channeled towards a more forceful implementation of         authorities' policy

these areas, the government's track record has shown that even when policy responses were slow and uneven
and         were mixed, momentum in structural reform was maintained. There               a particularly strong
commitment towards improving the business climate, expanding transport infrastructure, dedicating
            public resources to                            broadly stable                   policies. There is

Investnumt Climate
3.15         Tbe Senegalese autborities want to improve Senegal's investment climate to meet tbe level of
an average OECD country. Progress has been substantial in trade facilitation. Senegal has introduced a
single window for customs                in 2008, cutting document requirements in         It    also set up an
electronic                              implemented risk-based inspections, extended the operating hours of
customs, and                                         core measures        led Senegal to have       rated a top

3.16     Tbe autborities bave initiated a Justice Sector                (pSJ) to            tbe justice sector's
 performance, credibility and transparency, and to foster a greater adberence to tbe rule of law. The
PSJ covers all areas of       law. As regards business law more specifically,                legal framework is
framed under the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (Organisation pour
I 'Harmonisation en Afrique du Droit des AjJaires,               The           Act, which        at harmonizing
          law in 16 countries mainly in francophone Africa, establishes the common rules governing
establishment, operation,       closing down of               These        can    changed only at        regional
      and they therefore constitute a solid foundation for business-related laws in        country, putting the
onus on improved justice sector                 in enforcement. In tum, an improved                  will depend
on the effective implementation      the PSJ in several areas, including (a) improving institutional capacity to
support     effective implementation the           which        severe resource constraints (material, financial,
and human); (b) broadening access to justice; and (c) improving the availability and analysis of data on
                performance, to           to monitor              performance in a periodic and           manner
and adopt corrective measures. Important additional policy actions in this area will include (i)     adoption
the Government's judicial map, to support better                   resource allocation to, and planning of, the
justice         (ii) the development         a            budget consistent with WAEMU Public Financial
Management                (see below); and (iii) the establishment of an economic and financial section at the
Prosecutor's office to reduce the time to enforce contracts          commercial courts.

Small business taxation

tbe informal sector in Senegal. Informality is a multi-faceted issue in Senegal, as elsewhere. To a large
extent, the         and growing infonnal sector remains     main outlet for            cohorts of low-skill job
''''''''VP'cc and                     Enterprise surveys show, however, that                    tend to
low human capital use and very low productivity, and that few seem to grow and graduate into the formal
sector. Thus, an expansion of the informal sector has tended to correlate with limited          of productivity,
output and            for   economy at large, possibly also as it reflects the foregoing of possible gains from
externalities related to the acquisition of labor skills in modem firms and faster adoption of modem

                 To      extent that formalization itself could help             and firms tap into options for
productivity growth, and generate productivity-enhancing externalities, the removal             tax, regulatory or
          obstacles to firm formalization could significantly support               long-term growth objectives,
along with          to develop institutions, policies and mechanisms that help informal sector workers acquire
      skills 10.                 the heterogeneity of incentives and motivations             and workers to enter
    stay in the informal sector, or           into     formal sector, the causes of informality are manifold and
no single policy solution is likely to be effective to foster formalization. Moreover, a recent study conducted
by the University      Dakar in collaboration with the Bank showed a                           of       within the
informal sector. It highlighted      existence of several         of informal                              is at the
boundary of       formal sector with a tax- or regulation-avoiding            that creates the potential for unfair
competition between informal and regulated firms and the loss of tax revenues from firms that, using
goods                 should pay for
3.18    For these reasons, there is a case for tax policy and administration reforms to gradually shift to
second generation reforms, focused on facilitating the formalization of small businesses operating in
tbe       class informal economy and supporting tbe viability of business start-ups.                 generation

          operate in      informal sector to             into the formal         and     new entrepreneurs to
launch start-up              A tax system         adapted to both tax administration capacity and     nature of

Trade Promotion
3.19     Senegal's trade policy, whicb is set witbin regional agreements under the ECOWAS (Economic
Commission for West Africa) and WAEMU, broadly supports tbe country's efforts to integrate in the
global economy. Regional agreements dictate the bulk of Senegal's tariff policy, even if some departure
      the common framework is allowed under regional agreements. With                     to trade agreements,
         enjoys preferential access to the US through         and to         through the Everything But Arms
                  and                  Partnership             (EPA). To date, however,               has taken
virtually no advantage of AGOA                 but    been relatively active in       with the W AEMU
and Europe. Fostering trade will require moving more forcefully on structural reforms and efficient public
investment, the core agenda of                                However,          remain distortions in

             The planned Dakar Integrated Special Economic Zone could provide a critical opportunity for
Senegal to foster export and industrialization, and potentially serve as a reform pilot in complex
reform areas. The Government of                   signed an           with the Dubai World group Jebel Ali Free

world's foremost developers and operators of            zones, having launched           zones in countries like

12,000                 approximately 40      from downtown            which is expected to include commercial,
tourism, and residential projects.             also offers a      to implement the Accelerated Growth "':""<,+",r,,

          by             rate movements (the dalasi is a          float).
   However, the November 2009 Trade Policy Review by the WTO Secretariat notes                      while               to the

14 The zone is officially called the Dakar             Special Economic Zone (DISEZ), and is in principle open to more
than a       promoter.
IS DISEZ is governed          the ad hoc Law 2007-16 of               2007. This law, modeled on the legal framework

is expected to be initiated soon.          plans on being operational in the near future, although there have
been some delays          to                        Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Highway project.
              institutional set-up of the Dakar SEZ reflects best international practice. The law that
creates DISEZ defines a High Authority with a                       role         that
responsibilities of the High Authority are to administer          DISEZ and               the economic activities
within the zone. The          Authority, whose        is vested with       Investment Promotion Agency

zone. It will therefore be in a position to operate as a one-stop-shop service for          formation, registration
and licensing of companies, with delegation        signature of       different administrations involved. Thus,
APIX's role in the zone will be a purely regulatory one, avoiding                of interest with the functions
owning, developing, or              the zone. The responsibility for promotion and investor                will

Road maintenance
3.24      Providing for the maintenance of Senegal's growing road capital will remain an important
investment in the country's growth prospects.                    the ultimate objective adequate maintenance
of            road capital requires complementary reforms in institutions       planning, executing and securely
funding                          Until recently, inadequate funding for road maintenance supported an
equilibrium of low performance in planning and execution. There has been significant                 on all fronts
in recent years.      new road maintenance funding                FERA           d'Entretien Routier Autonome),
has become operational in 2009. 16 Total budget resources for road maintenance in 2009 increased by over 56
n""'f'P"t compared to 2008, though they fell short of the target                           an 80 percent
from the previous year-by about US$10 million, reflecting mainly a volume-related drop in the nrr'."...'"

             can be awarded a concession as a                 in the SEZ. The first such concession has been awarded to
          though the law allows for other             to set up additional zones I industrial parks within DISEZ.
16 The implementation of this reform was initiated at end-2007 but it was sidetracked by the authorities' 2008 financial
difficulties and challenged further by the difficult economic context of 2009. The Fund itself was created by decree in
October 2007; the road user charge was instituted, again by decree, in early 2008; the chief executive was,selected
        the year and formally             in December 2008; and fmancial arrangements were finalized in early 2009,
supported by the FY09 Public Finance Support Credit.

      which it will      grow in line with user consumption. To maintain some flexibility in    transition to
a system where the entire financing target would        met by the road user charge, the authorities want to
phase the implementation      the new financing                 over    next       years; in     interim, the
FERA will be funded through a mix of budget appropriations, declining over time, and the user charge,
increasing over time. Consistent with this strategy, the government has included, in the 2010 budget, both a
CF AF 22.5 billion appropriation, and                proceeds from the road user charge,      of         22.5
billion, for a total of CFAF 45 billion, the equivalent of US$1 00 million at the current exchange rate. In
parallel, the government has solicited      donor community to help           the               maintenance
backlog during this period.

costs of formalization of informal firms and transition to a FERA-based funding to maintain       country's
road capital.
3.26    The proposed PRSC IV supports two policy actions that are critical to improving the
investment climate and foster private sector development: (i) the adoption by the Ministry of Urbanism of
new procedures for issuing a building permit, so as to reduce the time and cost involved in securing a
building permit;    (ii) the inclusion  a CFAF 45 billion appropriation     road maintenance in the 2010

environment and fostering private sector development and trade. Two indicative                    PRSC V
are (i) the satisfactory execution of the 2010 Finance Law appropriation for road maintenance, and the
          of an adequate appropriation for road maintenance in the 2011              including an increase
in the share    FERA funding from the road user charge; and (ii) the adoption by the Ministry    Economy

PRSP Pillar II: Access to Basic Social Services

Education
3.28     Since 2005, the education sector has made significant progress in Senegal in terms of access.
The GER at the primary level, which was 81 percent in 2005, has increased to 92 percent in 2009.
dynamics     access at the early       remain strong: the         rate to grade 1 which was at      percent in
2005 has reached] 17 percent in 2009. The secondary level is expanding as well, reflecting       growth in the
size of incoming cohorts. At the lower secondary level,       GER stood at 40 percent in 2009, a one third
increase from 29 percent in 2005. For the high secondary level, the GER remains low,
from 12 percent in 2005 to only ] 8 percent in 2009. Meanwhile, the supply             tertiary education has
diversified with an expanding private sector and the creation of the public Regional University             in
three provincial                                         in addition to      Universities     Dakar and Saint
Louis which already existed. The total number of university students        increased       59,400 in 2005 to
90,500 in 2009-a 52 percent             in just 4            which 23            are in the         university
sector.
3      Inequity in school enrollment bas also been reduced at the primary level. With a forceful policy
and expenditure drive over the past     years, the GER for       now          that of        Although



                                                     21 

wealthier households continue to capture more education resources than the poor, children from poor
households are enrolling in larger numbers. Analyses of primary enrolment by income quintile show that the
GER of children in the poorest income quintile increased from 52.3 percent in 2001 to 67 percent in 2005
(the last year in which a household survey provided data) while that of children in the wealthiest income
quintile increased from 93.6 percent to 108 percent, a trend itself accompanied by increasing enrolment of 6
year olds in the wealthiest households.
3.30     With the support of its development partners, Senegal has prepared a ten-year education
program that has been implemented since 2000. This program is designed as a sector wide approach
combining planning of investment and recurrent spending as well as policy reforms to achieve the
Government's education policy goals, to reach the relevant MDGs. The Letter of Development Policy of
January 2005 revised the one of 1999 and developed both the strategic choices needed to reach the MDGs,
and the related allocations to the key sub-sectors. The main objectives in that Letter include: universal
primary completion and increased access to the other levels; improved education quality at all levels;
eradication of illiteracy and promotion of national languages; increased responsibilities for local
communities including in school management; monitoring of quality and mobilization of resources;
increased linkage between vocational training and the labor market; elimination of disparities including
regional, gender, rich/poor, ruraVurban and inclusion of students with disabilities. In addition to the
construction of an average of 2,500 classrooms per year and the recruitment of sufficient teachers to sustain
the development of the sector, the Senegal education program includes also policy reforms, notably in budget
allocation and management, staff management reform and the development of a new curriculum.
3.31     In terms of resource allocations, Senegal has historically demonstrated strong commitment to
education, including primary education. Currently, the authorities allocate about 32 percent of the
recurrent budget and 26 percent of total domestic resources to education, the equivalent of about 5.4 percent
of GDP. An estimated 48 percent of the recurrent budget contribution to education is allocated to primary
education, nearly reaching the recommended Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) benchmark
of 50 percent. However, there are significant inefficiencies in resource management in the sector that imply
that results are not commensurate to the level of investment. The main challenges that need to be tackled in
this regard are the management of teachers, which impacts 80 percent of education expenditure, and of
instructional materials. Furthermore, overall sector financing remains regressive due to heavy and increasing
subsidies to higher education which, given negligible cost recovery at that level, are mainly captured by the
wealthiest households.
3.32     Despite a significant commitment of public resources, however, there is a concern that progress
on grounds of effectiveness, efficiency and equity of spending has fallen short of the government's
objectives. Despite this significant progress in access and equity, dropout rates remain high. Furthermore,
Senegal will not be able to reach universal primary completion without tackling the low demand in some
regions. Quality remains a major concern. With respect to the management of the single largest input in the
system-teachers-, current recruitment and allocation practices are non-transparent and pose numerous
risks of misuse of funds. Issues in higher education are numerous, recurring and acute, including the capture
of an increasing fraction of public resources. In addition to sector policy issues, budgeting for education
needs to improve as well. One element of the government's agenda in this regard is the preparation of a
program budget for education consistent with WAEMU directives (see PFM reforms below), and a move
towards the transfer of budget execution responsibility ("deconcentration de /'ordonnancemenf') to the
Education Ministry, as a step toward the future development of a performance-based budgeting system.
3.33    Despite significant progress in access and equity, dropout rates remain high. Despite an intake
rate of 117 percent and a GER of 92 percent, the primary completion rate only reaches 59 percent in 2009.
An analysis of the profile of retention shows that a child entering first grade has only a 62 percent chance of
reaching grade 6. At the primary level, the causes of low completion are related to factors on both the supply
and demand side. On the supply side, the main factor preventing children from progressing through
completion is the failure to offer a complete cycle of education in many areas. Regional differences are


                                                     22 

 again significant: in urban areas, only 16 percent      schools     not offer a complete cycle, while in rural
 areas, 69 percent    schools offer an incomplete cycle, forcing students to either drop out or to travel long
           to schools in nearby towns.          other main causes of drop-out include family decisions to
 withdraw their children from school due to poor performance (26 percent of dropouts), the need for children
 to assist             work (15 percent) and an inability to pay the costs of schooling (9 percent).
 3        Furthermore, Senegal will not be able to reach universal primary completion without tackling
 the low demand in some regions. The                     Diourbel,        and Kaolack register GERs well below
      national            of               (at 56 percent, 70 percent and 72 percent, respectively)             a
 widespread supply       primary schools, mainly due to        type    education offered which is considered by
 local populations not             to their religious         and beliefs. A         conducted in 2004 on
 sociological demand        education in        areas concluded that parents would    amenable to enrolling
 children in public schools if Arabic were also used as a medium of instruction.         option was adopted by
 the authorities and reflected in the national education sector policy. The reform program in this area will
 include the adoption      a costed and timed Master Plan for introducing bilingual schools in             areas,
 the training of bilingual teachers, and the development of appropriate textbooks. Also, the Government
 intends to        a text (Circular or Arrete')              the elimination of the           of
 students for insufficient results prior to grade 6.
 3.35       Quality remains a major concern. Student                outcomes in reading and mathematics were
 among the lowest relative to                 countries as demonstrated by the continuously poor performance in
 the Program on the Analysis of the Educational System (P ASEC) assessment. A national assessment in 2002
 Systeme National d'Evaluation des Rendements                   (SNERS) showed similar results: in French,
 desired mastery level (751100) was reached by only 11 percent of fourth graders; in mathematics, only 12
 ,",PT'''PTUreached          level.      minimum acceptable level (5011 00) was reached by 52 and 56 percent of
 fourth graders in French and Mathematics, respectively. A recent Early Grade Reading Assessment l7 shows
        this situation has not improved. However, no national assessment has           carried out      2002 to
 inform policy options and decisions. A critical reform will be the adoption of a first-phase plan for
 '''J"t"nn.,t.f' assessment   learning outcomes in primary     junior            schools.
  3.36     With respect to teacher management, current recruitment practices are non-transparent and
  pose numerous risks of misuse of funds. Until 2005,                       policy had been that all primary teachers
  entered                   through a contractual stream (volontaires et contractuels) so that a sufficiently
                           be           within resource constraints to meet enrollment and other objectives.

resource management systems at the MoE have not improved to meet the needs                      a          educational
system. In particular, the payment of contractual teachers is still budgeted and disbursed as operating costs
                 as         and they             to    paid manually with insufficient internal or external controls.
        Government intends to introduce a series of measures to strengthen HR management in the education
             including the launch of an update of         education personnel        based on       2009 audit of
education staff;          reconfirmation through issuance of a Ministry of Education Circular of a competitive

three years of the "quotas securitaires" recruitment; the adoption by the HR department of the Ministry of

rollout ofSIGFIP linking            central administration     all remaining regions      the education sector.
3.37     Issues in bigber education are numerous, recurring and acute. They include: (a)
costs; (b) inequitable and regressive financing; (c) a poor and deteriorating learning environment due to
understaffing relative to student            insufficient qualifications of university       and lack sufficient
financing for instructional, operations and maintenance costs; and (d) extremely low productivity in graduate
                                financing              education needs to        rebalanced. Currently, budget
appropriations for universities and scholarships have fallen regularly short of actual financing needs-
universities typically         budget contributions to support              9 to 10 months
as costs have grown. Almost all quality expenditures are frozen and the scarce budget resources are used to
pay            In addition to the delays to pay even             the impossibility to support        costs leads to
recurrent student strikes and protests. The policy to allocate a scholarship to all incoming students is
becoming unsustainable and the cost of scholarship is under-budgeted.                  quality and           living
conditions suffer, in particular at the                  Dakar, which is overcrowded with more than 60,000
students. Finally,         number of Senegalese students abroad            benefit from public scholarships has
ballooned         1,200 in 2000 to 5,600 in 2008. Many of                       are           to study for courses
available in           and provided by local universities, and only an estimated 5 percent return to              at
the end     their studies. To       a headway in addressing                       government will develop a new
higher education development strategy, together with the adequate budgeting for the higher education sector,
and the adoption new              for a more            allocation scholarships to new students.
Health
3.38            has been progress on a range of health indicators in Senegal over the 10-year period of
the National Healtb Development Program (1998-2007). In particular, MDG-related indicators have
improved, though not at a pace           ensures the achievement of the government's
Maternal mortality has declined from 510 per 100,000 live births in 1992 to 401 in 2005, the year of the last
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in               Infant mortality has             from 150 per thousand in
1997 to 121 in 2005.          were gains also in the fight                                             of mv-
AIDS was               at a low 0.7 percent in 2005. In addition,       vaccination coverage rate for DTC3
increased                  in 2001 to 93 percent in 2007 at the national leveL Efforts were made to
drug accessibility such as        of pharmacist-inspectors, the fight against illicit drugs,    the design a
national drug policy-although the funding of basic                still          heavily on external funding,
which can create problems of sustain ability        sudden              Finally,       supply    care has also
reC:Of<lea some improvement, for example in                       of health care professionals: the number of
doctors and nurses have both increased from,                one doctor per 28,000 people and one nurse per
4,700 people in 1994, to one doctor per 18,600 people and one nurse per 4,200 people in 2008, over a period
where popu lation has increased by at     40 percent.
3.39    This said, tbere remain significant cballenges in the pace of improvement, and in terms of
equity and efficiency of tbe healtb care system. Crucially, the progress documented above has       highly
uneven between urban and rural areas. Infant mortality, for example, is         at 91 per         in urban
areas against 160 in      areas. Moreover, progress       not been uniform across the whole system. There

has been a near standstill in fighting diseases such as tuberculosis, in preventive care and in family planning,
with a low rate of contraceptive use. Even where                   on MDG indicators                           the
slower-than-needed pace of improvement implies that most of the MDGs will likely not be met on current
trends without                               resources and additional            to reforms. Other areas where
progress remains urgent include (i) improving the planning, development and allocation of human resources
across the system, (ii) strengthening its                (iii)                                                  in
part with the development of risk pooling mechanisms that currently cover only about 20 percent of the
population, and currently elude the poor, (iv)                  the role of the private sector in   whole health
systpm, as the largest component of health care spending in Senegal is through out-of-pocket contribution by
households, and (v)              hospital         One element the government's                 in           is the
                a           budget for health consistent with WAEMU directives (see PFM reforms below),
and a move towards the transfer of budget execution responsibility ("deconcentration de J'ordonnancement")
to                      as a               the future development of a performance-based                 system.
The government also intends to extend the            to the central administration and regions for the sector.
3.40     Tbe government's policy agenda in tbe bealtb sector bas been developed into tbe new National
Healtb Development Program (NHDP) for tbe ten-year period of 2009-18. The NHDP, with 4 broad
objectives and 11 strategic directions, covers comprehensively all the health care system               Its
distinctive focus,         to its predecessor, includes harnessing the existing private health care sector
resources, results-based            human resource management, and medical technology. The cost        the
NHDP has been broadly estimated at an annual US$570 million, with the budget contributing 65 percent,
      governments 5 percent,        users 18.5 percent and donors    remainder (about 12 percent).
3.41    The main planks of the NHDP include: (i) accelerating the                           maternal and infant
mortality; (ii) improving health promotion; (iii) strengthening health and epidemic monitoring; (iv) human
resource development; (v)              public infrastructure, and the equipment and maintenance of public
health center; (vi) improving access to and availability of drugs, vaccines and surgical products; (vii)
improving information and               (viii) promoting                                 (ix) improving public
capacity in planning; budgeting and financial management; (x) developing public-private partnerships for
health service delivery; and Ox)                      coverage and financial protection, especially    the most
vulnerable groups and the poorest.
3.42     In Senegal, bospitals make for a significant proportion of the public health budget. Nonetheless,
      are doubts about     efficiency and              these expenditures. Analytical work under a Bank T A
operation suggests that, since the 1998 hospital reform, technical efficiency had significantly decreased,
mostly because      uncontrolled recruitments of non-skilled workers by hospitals. This explains the
financial situation faced by many facilities now,         close to bankruptcy-the aggregate debt of public
hospitals (which are supposed to balance their budget) was estimated at close to CFAF21 billion in 2009,
most often in the form of arrears to suppliers. Yet, hospitals do not serve the very poor-less than 3 percent
of their patients-and there is some evidence that this trend has been               in   past 10 years.
        The government is currently preparing a new hospital policy to address the issues of hospital
corporate and financial governance. A            requirement is to   back the Ministry Health in control of
hospitals, given that the 1998 reform went too far in terms of granting autonomy to poorly monitored public
hospital establishments.         government intends to adopt and put in place a regulatory and financial
oversight framework for hospitals. This framework would include three components: (i) an updated financial
regulation                 hospitals; (ii) a strengthened Hospital            within    Ministry;    (iii) a
new regulation framework to control and fund hospitals through performance contracts.
3.44    Initiatives that could benefit the poor include the development of mutual health insurance and
other risk          mechanisms.        Government approved in 2008 a national strategy    extending social
health protection which includes the development of mutual health organizations with government technical
and financial support building on commitments under the third pillar of     PRSP-II. However, despite all



                                                      25 

efforts undertaken to date to promote mutual health insurance (MHI)--the development of MHI             is
supported by USAID, ILO,             Luxembourg and Belgium--only half a million people are estimated
to     covered by        mechanism. The government has              to adopt     Mill          and create
appropriate (budget-funded) financing and support mechanisms for extending benefit packages covered
under participation in, and strengthening                capacities   Mutual                      (MHO)
targeted at populations employed in the rural and informal sectors. Extending benefit packages to include
comprehensive services at the primary, secondary       tertiary      will improve
benefit-contribution ratio (value-for-money) of mutual health organizations, while strengthening
management capacities will strengthen trust       members in their              MHO. The government's
objective is to expand        system to 50 mutual health organizations in 2011 and 100 mutual health
organizations in 2012 to provide a strong     for subsequently boosting           and generate operational
experience to adapt financial support mechanisms for a scale-up of MHOs in subsequent years.
3.45      Out-of-pocket spending on pharmaceuticals is one of the main items in the country's total
health expenditure. In fact, the largest share total health spending in Senegal comes from out-of-pocket
expenditure, of which 69 percent is spent in the private health care sector to buy                (two-third) and
"pr'flt"~" (one third). There is thus an                to ensure that those drugs are of good quality           as
affordable as possible. The NHDP intends to implement              following strategies: (i) implement a quality
insurance             by accreditation     quality control; (ii) develop a new legal and regulatory framework
for the drug sector; (iii) ensure reliable source of quality drugs, with no shortages; (iv) market improved
traditional drugs; (v) promote generic drugs; (vi) continue to fight      illicit drug market; (vii) put in place a
pricing code; and (viii) the publication of administered price lists for relevant medication and procedures in
all Public Health           local media and website. Finally,       government's goal to provide 100             of
funding for basic vaccines through the national budget will be pursued actively.
3.46      The Government recently adopted a national plan that calls for fully subsidized coverage of
care for people of age 60 and above, the Sesame Plan (Plan Sesame).             program is not                 it

management of invoice reimbursements to providers, mainly hospitals, is poor, opening the door for abuse

Nutrition
3.48     Despite recent progress, malnutrition, especially of young infants, is still a public health
problem. The fight against malnutrition in                          a major national priority and investing in
nutrition for young children has already proven to be a highly cost-effective means to promote long-lasting
skills       cognitive developments, The nutritional situation of the population is characterized by a
predominance       stunting, low weight, iron deficiency (anemia), vitamin A and iodine deficiency, mainly
among                           and women. Micronutrient deficiency is another feature of             nutritional
situation in Senegal. Anemia affects 84 percent of children under five and 61 percent all women; and the
prevalence of goiter is 33.5 percent in the southeast part of the country. Vitamin A              is           to
affect 61 percent of children under        and is probably the underlying cause of 30 percent of all infant
juvenile mortality, These nutritional shortcomings have serious               consequences in terms of illness,
mortality, and lifetime health expenditure, as well as reduced economic productivity and performance in
school. Regional disparities are also significant in       area. Low           is twice as prevalent in the rural

has actually improved in recent years. These results were achieved thanks to the successive nutrition

Project (PNC, 1995-2000) and the Nutrition Reinforcement Program (PRN, 2002-2006), implemented by the
Government. The Government intends to             up the PRN towards full national           by adequately
budgeting resources for the program to accelerate and entrench recent gains,

3.54      Unfortunately, the current social protection system is fragmented and inefficient and does not
respond to the needs of the most vulnerable. The existing fonnal social protection mechanisms, which cover risks

         A key lesson learnt from the recent wave of crises is to reprioritize prevention. Senegal has been
particularly     by the food and fuel        and continues to suffer from the          economic slowdown. In
addition, natural           such as floods and droughts are             both the urban and rural poor to stress
and poverty. Highly                   untargeted subsidies have proven impossible to maintain during
food          episodes in 2007/8 and humanitarian               in times of emergencies is               both for
Senegal and the international community. Shifting from mitigating the                 impacts of shocks on the
population at         to                   shocks to         both the income and human capital of           most
vulnerable appears to be a         step towards inclusive growth. In the past       years, a growing number of
developing countries have successfully introduced large-scale cash transfer programs as effective social
protection mechanisms to respond to                of poverty and vulnerability. For Senegal, this option would
involve the consolidation of the various transfers to vulnerable groups into a           set of interventions
a transition from      current mode to a        focus on the truly vulnerable, use     improved targeting tools,
adequate linking to human capital promotion and more systematic monitoring outputs and impacts.

natural catastrophes and shocks. Such a concerted approach has helped improve coordination between
various stakeholders. Various initiatives such as the recent "Suqa/i Jaboot" designed by the Ministry of
State, Ministry of Family, Food Security, Early Childhood, and Women to reach sixty families in each region
through a direct cash transfer have been announced. The authorities have sought advisory and technical
assistance from the World Bank to ensure that design parameters-targeting, generosity, operational
institutions and practices, information systems for operations and impact monitoring, benefit payment
arrangements and fiduciary safeguards-are based on best practices.
3.57     The Government intends to implement policy actions to improve the effectiveness of social
safety nets and to enhance the fiscal sustainability of the government's social assistance programs. It
has held consultations with development partners on a common communication roadmap, a joint action plan
and a rigorous evaluation of ongoing pilots. Medium-term policy actions would include: (i) the completion
and publication of a Social Safety Net Public Expenditure and Beneficiary Assessment; (ii) the issuance of a
Policy Statement identifYing the basic parameters and instruments for counter-cyclical and emergency
response social safety nets, linked to human capital; (iii) the adoption of a medium-term Policy Commitment
on Core Government Social Responsibilities in protection and promotion of human capital as a prioritization
basis for the first implementation phase of a revamped social safety net system; and (iv) the establishment of
an institutional anchoring (e.g. a coordination and implementation custodian equipped with tools and human
capacity) for Social Safety Nets. Regarding implementation, a close coordination between the Bank and on
the one hand (i) the Comite de Lutte contre la Malnutrition (CLM), executing the first cash transfer pilot and

programs and the third pillar of the PRSP-II in the Cabinet of the Ministry of Family, Women,. Food
Security, in charge of implementing the national social protection strategy will be crucial. An examination
of institutional options will allow a better delineation of the roles of the Office of the Coordinator and CLM,
for example giving the CLM the role of an implementing agency, while the coordination and policy role,
especially vis-a-vis the Ministry of Finance for funds allocation, analytical and strategic guidance, would lie
with the Office of the Coordinator.
Environmental Vulnerabilities

Fisheries
3.58    Fishing and related activities represent an important economic activity at risk in Senegal. The
sector accounts directly or indirectly for close to 5 percent of GDP, and up to 25 percent of export revenues.
An estimated 17 percent of the working population has its livelihood drawn directly or indirectly from
fishing and related activities, including industrial transformation and commerce. Fish also contributes to
roughly 70 percent of the animal protein intake of the country's population.
3.59     The key issues affecting the fisheries sector in Senegal are the dwindling size of fish stocks due
to overexploitation resulting from the government's limited capacity to govern and manage the use of the
resources to sustainable levels. This lack of an effective governance and management regime for the
fisheries allowed a large expansion of small-scale fishing effort until 2007-and the initial expansion and
then decline of industrial fishing-beyond levels that were both economically profitable and environmentally
sustainable. As a result, fish stocks and catches of high-value coastal demersals, shrimp and cephalopods
(CDSC) have been seriously declining, along with total volumes of exports. This decline in catches of high
value coastal demersals and volumes of exports has been partly offset by corresponding increases in global
and local prices, so that total export revenues have remained relatively constant. To limit the impact of
declining catches of small-scale fisheries targeting coastal demersals in Senegal, some fishermen started to
catch alternative and often lower value species, while others moved abroad.
3.60    As a result of declining catches of high-value CDSC, the Senegalese fisheries sector is at risk of
failing to contribute to economic growth and poverty alleviation, a risk that translates into enhanced
vulnerability to the livelihood of a significant group of people and communities, many of which are already

         the poor. On current trends,     pressure on   resources is only expected to increase, driven by
sustained global and regional demand outpacing supply, pushing         higher,           industrial fishing
       in the West African waters, and, coupled with the low local cost of entry into the fisheries sector,
driving      development of local fleets.
3.61     The Government has committed itself to developing the institutions, policies and programs to
mitigate                of      commons already evident in Senegalese fisheries. The Government of
Senegal has recognized the social and economic importance of the fisheries sector, by giving it a central
place in the country's                   policies               The               Reduction ~tT't>t~'cnf
named the sector as one of the key drivers under the "wealth creation" pillar of the strategy, assigning it a
central role in the fight against poverty.         role was further elaborated in       PRSP-H and in the
Accelerated Growth Strategy that identifies fisheries one    the five economic clusters with high potential
and a potential driver                economic growth.     AGS, however,               the     challenges to

resources would help to meet the             of            by      Accelerated Growth           "
3.62    To achieve these objectives, the Government completed a Letter of Sector Policy for the
          in 2008, prioritizing the sustainable              and restoration of fish resources and their habitats
as the sector's top objective. In order to meet this objective, the Letter of Sector Policy concentrates on the
"control and                of maritime         capacities to meet allowable catch              and the "control
of access to fishery resources" as the first two six key areas of policy intervention. In particular, to control
access to the resources the Letter of Policy          on                 and                               to all

Coastal Erosion
3.63    The coastal zone is of             socio-economic importance for the country.                  major city,
                  of close to 3 million people-lies at the edge of a peninsula surrounded north, west and south
by the              ocean. Overall, an             % the population lives within 75 km of                    where
about 70 percent GOP is                   in key sectors such as fishery, tourism, recreation, industry, transport,
mining, nr.'''f>ornrn
3.64     The coastal zones, including in urban centers, are highly exposed to a range of vulnerabilities,
related to both demographic pressure-increasing and uncontrolled urbanization in a context of continued
rural-urban migration and against a background of limited functional municipal infrastructure-,
    water and soil pollution and related degradation of natural resources, and coastal erosion. Coastal erosion
occurs in most coastal urban            (Saint      Camberene, Yoff,           Rufisque,      Mbour, Joal) and
in many rural areas (Cote Nord,                 Delta du Saloum, Basse Casamance,          de          Against
increasing natural pressures on the coast stands a lack of             coastal zone development and land use
planning and zoning/permitting enforcement, and weak capacity to          with the challenges-in national and
local institutional capacity, technical knowledge, and financial and enforcement capacity.
3.65      Coastal erosion has a large potential impact on coastal communities, infrastructure and
resource users.           is           with land      (about I to 2 meters of sandy beaches is lost each

conflicts over land use, and loss of revenue-generation potential due to           environmental          such
as lost tourism opportunities.
3.66     In Senegal, the causes of coastal erosion are complex, with human pressure and
mismanagement severely aggravating natural phenomena: these causes include sediment deficit, natural
instability slopes,             as a result of urbanization which creates     areas impermeable

infrastructure.
3.67     In order to develop a comprehensive solution to coastal erosion and environmental
degradation in general, the authorities have launched a variety of initiatives including the drawing up
of a sustainable development strategy and a Letter of Environmental Sector Policy, with the intention
of            these trends. Building on       National Adaptation           of Actions (2006), the Government
     prepared a national program to fight coastal erosion, the National Integrated Program against Coastal
          (2008), which aims to address               problems       challenges      mitigate and adapt to
impact of coastal            The     pillars of             include     preparation a master plan for coastal
zones,       adoption      a      for coastal zones management (Loi Littoral), the strengthening             the
institutional framework, the promotion         research and development activities, the establishment of an
observatory, putting in place protection measures adapted to the local context, the rehabilitation/protection of
affected areas, or areas at      risks. In addition,             highlights the      to explore alternatives to
coastal sand mining, and the enforcement of the laws           public maritime domain to avoid uncontrolled
urbanization.
3.68    With respect to coastal sand mining (CSM), the Government has started to address the issue by
implementing awareness                       on the risks related to it,          sound sand                  in

comprehensive approach has           initiated, and a more integrated effort seems to         needed, including
looking at      demand/supply and cost sides. The                   Ministry (Ministere    I 'Environnement, de
fa Protection de fa Nature, des Bassins de Retention et des Lacs Artificiels) is leading the national program,
in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including the National Committee             Climate Change
under the Ministry      Environment (COMNAC), the national coastal tourism development agency (Societe
d'Amenagement et de Promotion des               et Zones Touristiques, SAPCO), local governments in urban
municipalities and rural communities, and the Center for Ecological Monitoring (Centre de Suivi Ecologique,
CSE). Several initiatives are               on           protection and adaptation,               by UNESCO,
UEMOA an EC study and pilot actions, UNDP/JICA and others but none of them so far provides a
comprehensive approach to the problems raised by CSM.

Forest Resources Management
3.69    Wood fuels remain the poor households' main energy source. Over time, there
              heavy           on forest resources mostly located in eastern            of Senegal
and Kolda), far away from the main urban centers. Wood fuels, mainly firewood and charcoal used for
household cooking purposes and water heating, account for about          percent of national energy consumption
and               of total household energy. The overexploitation           forest resources coupled with land
             agricultural           drought, soil erosion, and overgrazing       resulted over the years in a loss
         cover and biodiversity.         loss of forest cover has been estimated to 40,000 ha per year. The
promotion      LPG as an alternative           cooking has been introduced        the Government to reduce the
over exploitation of        cover. To date LPG consumption is about 150,000 tons per year accounting for
about 7 percent of total energy consumption. Kerosene used mainly             lighting purpose in rural and
urban area is         due to its             and lack of suitable distribution system. Other alternative energy
sources such as charcoal briquettes from agricultural residues have been introduced but their use is very
limited. Even with these alternative sources,                  will remain an important source of household
energy in the foreseeable future.

3.70     The government's policy framework for forest resources management entails a transfer of
responsibility to local communities and support to community-managed forests. In particular, under
Senegal's decentralization laws (the last one in 1996), the management of natural resources and community
forests where charcoal is produced is a decentralized competence to local governments. Starting in 1998, the
government requested support from the Bank to launch a project (Sustainable and Participatory Energy
Management Project) whose main objective was to meet an important part of the rapidly growing urban
demand for household fuels without the loss of forest cover and the ecosystem's carbon sequestration
potential and biodiversity.19 These objectives were achieved through the successful implementation of a
sustainable wood fuels supply management component in target areas and a demand management and inter
fuel substitution options component at the national level. The main achievement was the establishment of
sustainable community based forest management systems covering more than 600,000 hectares, the
establishment of a Forestry Based Geographical Information System generating reliable forest resources data
for the elaboration of forest management plans, and the implementation of income generating activities for
local communities in an environmentally sound manner. Under the second component, alternative wood-fuel
sources were promoted as well as efficient cook-stoves.
3.71     However, until early 2009, progress towards a strict enforcement of the laws underpinning the
policy and the achievement of its objectives has continued to be undermined by the persistence of an
outdated charcoal quota system?O Because of its origin as a centrally-controlled administrative allocation
system for wood cutting licenses, the quota system is fundamentally inconsistent with the government policy
objectives of transferring to local communities the management of forest resources. Licenses issued under
the quota system were fraudulently used to produce charcoal outside the zones managed under locally
approved forest management plans, undermining progress made under the government's policy. It was also
reportedly a system rife with opportunities for corruption, with wood cutting licenses being issued by the
Forestry Service and re-sold to non professionals. Moreover, as long as ' this system is maintained, little
revenues from charcoal resource exploitation should be expected to benefit local communities, further
undermining their ability and incentive to manage their forestry resources sustainably. Indeed, according to a
recent study, only 7 percent of the FCFA 6.5 billion turnover generated by the charcoal and wood fuel
market trickles down to local communities, with the lion's share captured by the charcoal production and
distribution networks. The abolition of the quota system in 2009 was an important step by the Government
to move towards the universal enforcement of decentralization principles for community forest resource
management. Continued support to local communities to expand areas under community management
remains a key priority.
3.72     In addition to sub-sector policy reform initiatives, the authorities want to strengthen public
resource management for the environment. One element of the government's agenda in this regard is the
preparation of a program budget for environment consistent with W AEMU directives (see PFM reforms
below), and a move towards the transfer of budget execution responsibility ("deconcentration de
I 'ordonnancement") to the environment ministry, as a step toward the future development of a performance
based budgeting system.

20 The directives are written into ministerial ordinances (Arrete Ministerie!). In 2008, the Ministry determined the
charcoal production quota at 74,000 tons to be levied in the regions of Tambacounda and Kolda in managed forests. The
same quantity was determined for 2009 under the "Arrete Ministeriel" signed on January 9, 2009, but the principle of
removing the quota system, effective 2010, was adopted under a follow-up Arrete in March 2009.

        On the        to this difficult reform, the authorities intend to foster transparency on     functioning of
the current access system: transparency, which underpins fairness, is critical to ensuring broad support from

3.75      Recent diagnoses performed by or at the request of             authorities have identified a range of
weaknesses in Senegal's Public Financial Management (PFM) system. Over 2002-07, PFM
drew on the Bank's assessment of the public finance management system (the 2002                         Country
Financial Accountability                  and     2003 CPAR, Country Procurement                  Review), with
an inter-ministerial committee established to monitor their implementation. There was significant progress,
overall, with in particular the                of a powerful budget management                           laid the
foundations         improved                 and            of          execution.
slippages in 2008 exposed lingering weaknesses. An audit of budgetary                           by      Finance
Inspectorate in July 2008 identified several                   in budget             procedures including (i) an
         broad use     emergency (simplified) expenditure procedures; (ii) insufficient respect of the principle
   annual                (iii) weak monitoring of the para-public sector, including autonomous             public
universities and public hospitals; (iv) ponderous, slow and excessively centralized budget execution
procedures; and (v) a            to strengthen accounting systems to ensure sound               information
           controllability of public accounts. Recent         supported                  PSI-program, the World
Bank under the FY09 Public Finance Support Credit and other ACAB donors, have aimed at supporting
critical short-term measures to
3.76   More recent diagnoses, in particular    2007 PEFA, a 2008 IMF technical assistance report
and recent analytical work under the Bank's PPFR, have identified mixed results:
·  Strengths in Senegal's         system include: (i) a             legal framework consistent with good
   international             Oi) a rational institutional organization; (iii) good          for
   forecasting; and (iv) a commitment to develop budgeting methods on a multiyear results-based approach.
·  A strong       in        preparation is             reliability  revenue             notwithstanding the
   inherent complexity of assessing revenue prospects in a highly uncertain context, as has been the case in
   recent years.
·  Weaknesses in budget preparation modalities have a             impact on         quality and """ ..",,,uv...
   Weaknesses on expenditure estimates undermine the credibility       the budget and complicate budget
   execution. Additional measures must be         to                              particular by developing
   adequate techniques     revising approved funding, estimated appropriations, personnel expenditure, and
               expenditure.       parliamentary                  budget and            execution could
   strengthened.
·    The implementation                                        Framework (MTEF) has only yielded limited
           so      MTEFs      sector ministries are mere annexes to       budget     having limited        In
     budget debates, approval           by Parliament        reporting on execution. The reform       budget
     preparation through a            budget approach with a          basis is an ambitious project that will
     require, among other things, a new           law on budget       a strengthening the units responsible
     for preparing program budgets to ensure that       fully master this budgeting               significant
           well beyond the horizon        the proposed PRSC series, to mainstream a performance-based
                approach.
·  The budgetary slippages in 2008 exposed several weaknesses in budget execution procedures. Immediate
   remedial measures were               in late 2008 and 2009 but making further progress will require, in addition
   to improving budget preparation, (i) to move to a more forceful delegation of the responsibility
          PVI'·l'l1t.,.,n to sector              and (ii) to undertaken a full roll-out  the tWo public financial
   management systems, SIGFIP and                            both horizontally, across Ministries and regional
   departments, and              Iy, by             the budget and treasury systems.
·  The              vests the execution of a significant part of public investment program to a number of
   autonomous public sector agencies and specialized funds to which it transfers an increasing fraction
      investment budget. As a result, the principle of           comprehensiveness           weakened in
   recent years. A Law on agencies was adopted in 2009, among other things to strengthen oversight of
                 execution     the                             next     in the        agenda is to ensure
   enforcement of this
·  With       roll-out    the                     and                    now well advanced, the authorities
   intend to shift      focus on completing the computer systems infrastructure by installing and operating
   a more powerful accounting system. An                            is the backbone     the PFM
   architecture. In the meantime, exploiting the power of SIGFIP could already generate significant gains in
                          SIGFIP can support       use of spatial codes in       data entry, allowing
   visibility on budget allocations ex ante (budget preparation) and ex post                  execution) on


II        remain significant weaknesses in the management           the public wage bill. New             resource
     management procedures, organizational                                     to be developed.
·  The tools               management of public assets, particularly      land property, are only
   developed. At a time when the real estate assets of   State have gained considerably in value,
   framework is critically                     the      texts having not       updated in more
   decades; the current         does not require transparent competitive procedures for sales of State

..   The financing pressures that emerged on the treasury of                   State in the third quarter of 2008, have
              U,"'''V'''''''''''''' in cash and financing management, with the inability to           public expenditures
     in a context of tight bank lending and a lack of alternative public resources. Weak cash management

     short frequencies (of weeks or months) the rhythm of budget execution at                         the commitment or
     payment                     practice that among other things may undermine         quality of the process and would
     be inconsistent with                     responsibility by sector Ministries in the execution      their policies and
     budgets.
..  The Constitution of 1999 provides        an Audit Office that has been functional           2001. Until
    recently, the Audit Office's effectiveness has been hampered by long delays in examining public
    accounts, opacity in          information and weak                            have committed to
    up the transmission of budget execution laws and public accounts to the Audit Office and improve their
    quality. They also intend to create a permanent position               Prosecutor at the Audit '-'..."'....
              the currently temporary position, to strengthen the Audit Office's prosecutorial capabilities,
               Audit Office will adopt and implement a                                audits     the largest
    accounts ("comptes de gestion") public accountants.                                      that ultimately
    underpins compliance with      laws must be developed.
3.77    The Government has              pursuing a program of public financial management reforms
tbe early 2000s.            mobilization of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) around the
modernization of       public financial                system has        it possible to    substantial .....r'crr',.'
with the support from the technical and financial partners, including from the World Bank. This
modernization of public            management constitutes       cornerstone                       to implement
    n,nJPr,v reduction           (PRSP-II) and is an essential component in the dialogue with donors on the
management of external assistance in       spirit of the Paris Declaration. The modernization of public finance
management is also an               plank         current             program supported by the IMF within the
framework ofthe PSI approved in November
3      To move more forcefully on these issues, the MEF bas developed an overall action plan that
was adopted in October 2009. The               action plan is a comprehensive attempt by      authorities to
           ",,,,''V,,,""""',, of their system. Its          actions    capacity          span the full
of PMF issues mentioned above, under an exhaustive, time-bound and sequenced program, drawing on
assessment         recommendations from development partners, including the European Union,       IMF and
the Bank. Most reforms supported          the proposed PRSC         draw on this PFM       plan.

Public Procurement
3.79     Building on the findings and recommendations from several recent assessments of its public
procurement system, tbe Government made substantial progress towards tbe modernization of the
National Procurement System (NPS). The quality             the new public procurement system         a score of
2.46 out of a maximum score of 3 according to the 2008 OECDIDAC assessment.                        procurement
regulatory and institutional framework and                            have        considerably improved. The
efficiency of procurement transactions      been                      level contracting authorities. Internal
and external controls     procurement transactions do           and contribute to uphold                 of
system. The        of the Authorities is to move towards a sound NPS in which procurement transactions
comply with the procurement legal                and are efficient. Substantial financial and technical
from      Bank and other        for         up a modernized NPS have led to positive changes.
3.80  Despite substantial progress, a Government's strong political commitment is required to take
up remaining            with a view of moving towards a sound          A sound procurement
requires effective means and mechanism that ensure compliance with the procurement legal framework and
good                    both public and private actors involved           in                          and
contracts execution. The Bank's recent assessment (UCS-stage 1 report) raised the following key remaining
issues to be dealt with in order to consolidate and ensure sustainability
·  the procurement             regulatory framework still provides for provisions that do not promote
   transparency and limit competition and    efficiency of operations;
·  the           institutional framework and capacity management are not established in a way to ensure
   sustainability and effectiveness refonns; and
·  the internal and external controls framework is not sufficiently functional to contribute to
   enforcement              and uphold            of the system.
3.81          The procurement legal and regulatory framework still provides for provisions that do not
promote                         limit competition and the efficiency of operations. First, the current procurement
code (PC) should be revised to address               following issues: (i) no rules exist to govern the participation of
state owned enterprise; (ii) participation to NCBs is limited to                         from WAEMU countries only;
(iii) no clear rules exist to             international competitive bidding (ICB) based on a sound development and
v ...." ...""" logic; (iv)    use and acceptable evaluation methods         alternative bids needs are not clarified; (v)
conciliation as a method            settlement disputes is not foreseen; and (vi) quality control (QC) procedures
of delivery are not adequately defined             being carried out efficiently and transparently. Second, the '"''''''.''''F,
law               with Public and Private Partnership (PPP)            not provide for external and internal controls,
respectively from ARMP (Audits, Complaints) and DCMP (prior review), to be                       in             with the
main            governing public contracts (COA).             the current procurement code does not apply to APIX, a
state owned                   using public funds. And finally, the General                  of Contracts (GCC) are not
adopted                    Government and NSBDs            by contracting authorities need to be updated to address all
of the                                             code.
3.82    The existing institutional              and capacity management are not established in a way to
ensure sustainability and effectiveness of reforms. The new integrated procurement information and
                      (SIGMAP) is not sufficiently          over the                 entities in order to ensure
adequate data collection and monitoring of compliance and performance of procurement transactions. While
     ARMP is well staffed and fully operational, it is still facing practical problems in                    the
regulatory       which ensure its financial autonomy with a view to        building procurement capacity in a
sustainable manner; (ii)           out                     audits;22 (iii) efficiently           complaints
investigating fraudulent and corruptive practices in procurement and contracts execution. Finally, there are
no comprehensive guidelines for quality assurance and standards in processing procurement transactions.
3.83    The internal and external controls framework is not sufficiently fnnctional to contrihute to the
enforcement of regulations and uphold the integrity           the system.     internal control framework is
composed      the DCMP       the central leve!)     procurement units (PUs) set up within
authority. Due to financial             decentralized divisions of     DCMP are not fully operational across
the country to ensure efficient controls of procurement transactions undertaken by municipalities and
dec~ntralized civil           In the same vein, only 70 percen!?3 of PUs have been set up at the
contracting authorities, out of which     percent are facing staffing      to adequately deal with quality

21 The ARMP is currently             on a new Public and Private Partnership (PPS) legal framework to improve the
         text               such as concession contracts or private-public joint ventures for the provision of
works and consulting services.

recommendations.

Debt management
3.S4         Debt management in Senegal shows strengths relating to the legal framework, macro-policy
coordination and cash management. A recent evaluation                   debt                              - using
Debt Management Performance Assessment tool, DeMPA) reveals the following: (i) the legal framework
".."""",,,_,.,,,... clearly     responsibilities for public debt           vesting the           and Parliament with
ultimate decision making powers. In addition, a recently established National Committee for Public Debt
Management (Comile National de la DeUe Publique, CNDP) ensures the coordination                                   all
institutions involved in public debt management; (ii) the policy coordination between debt management and
fiscal and                     policies is fairly strong, through  formulation of the medium-term macroeconomic
framework that is the foundation for the annual budget laws; and (iii) there is a strong coordination between
the BCEAO                   the            in the management of domestic debt markets, including through
reconciliation of accounts                      between the       and the Central Bank, and cash flow management
for the Treasury. This coordination is also accompanied by a                   distinction of functions           of
monetary, budgetary, and debt management authorities in public debt management decisions.
3.S5      Senegal can further improve its debt management framework, by strengthening its debt
management                  and other ancillary debt management functions. A                    debt
strategy (DMS) is still to be placed at the center of debt management policies in Senegal with a medium- to
long-term framework (currently it covers only one                            including alternative
macroeconomic projections and a deeper analysis of cost-risk tradeoffs of different debt management
options, medium- to long-term debt                      plans, debt structure profiles (maturity and currency
denomination options), and an enhanced data                    to include debt by public enterprises and regional
                                  the DMS would          to      a Cabinet and                        and publicly
available policy document, duly subject to evaluations, internal and external audits and controls by the
relevant authorities and the public in              Also, there is a       to                      and systems, in
particular with an increase in             number of qualified staff with appropriate profiles (economists,
statisticians), to strengthen                   operational risk, and ensure the periodic publication of statistical
bulletins on public debt. Both, the strengthening         the       management strategy and the ancillary areas
could      the        of an institutional reform program aimed to reinforce       debt management                on
a sustainable basis.
3.S6          A more recent issue concerns the risks related to a fragmentation in the authority to sign, and
the institutional responsibilities to                external debt.        June 2009, the responsibility to initiate
and undersign cooperation agreements, including the                   public debt               has been fragmented
in two                         Ministry of Finance and      Ministry in             International Cooperation. The
latter is currently mandated to ensure creditor-debtor relationships with a set of Asian countries excluding
Japan. This new institutional                       carries a                  that debt           and management
~"'''''''''U'''' and decisions, including          will         increasingly fragmented as well, with the potential
to weaken overall             management in Senegal.

Statistics
3.87     Senegal has been at the forefront of a longstanding program of strengthening national
statistical systems in francophone Africa.   national experts are widely considered to   among the
                in                     and recent institutional'                     the creation


                                                        37 

autonomous National Agency     Statistics       Demography (Agence Nationale pour les Statistiques et la
               ANSD), have     a long        towards        a favorable context    the development of a
modem public statistical system-a critical component        the institutional foundations      improved
governance, in which   State   a          role to play.
3.88     Despite recent progress in improving the policy, institutional and capacity framework for
statistics in Senegal, the remaining weaknesses undermine the authorities' core objectives in               area.
The operations      the National Statistical Council, a forum where statistical supply and demand meet, have
not          mainstreamed into a regular consultations                              on actions, and follow-up.
Macroeconomic and sector statistics still show weaknesses in methodology, frequency, and data collection,
compilation and treatment:                 agricultural           are critically             agricultural census
having not        conducted in over a decade.           satisfaction surveys have not been undertaken, leaving
policy makers and ANSD managers with almost no                             information to measure and enhance
performance. Historic data              and a             and open dissemination of        and more recent data
remain to be developed. Finally, the national statistical program (Schema Directeur de la Statistique) is still
not playing     role as a coordinating framework for       planning of, and donor support     national statistical
development.

Focus of the PRSC under Component 4--Governance
3.89      The PRSC series wonld support critical reforms to improving economic governance in Senegal,
with a focus on public financial management, procurement, debt management and statistics. The
medium-term objectives of the                   reforms in public financial management are to lay the legal
                   a multi-year performance                        improve financial                                of

budget deconcentration process, improve management                   the wage bill         state land property, and
strengthen external control of the budget. In procurement, the proposed series                PRSCs would support
actions to ensure         sustainability of the                        and institutional framework          uphold the
              the system. In public debt management, the medium-term                      of                       are
to strengthen        quality and policy relevance           public        management strategy and to reinforce the
capacity of       debt                        In statistics, the PRSC

PRSP-III.
3.90         Under PRSC-IV, prior actions would include: in public financial management (i) the                   by
the Ministry Economy and Finance of implementing regulations allowing the examination of the approved
budgets           of     previous        financial reports of public entities; (ii) the adoption of an       by
Ministry of Economy and Finance mandating the publication on its website of budget execution tables on a
monthly             and a         execution report on a quarterly basis within 30 days        the end  the relevant
period, so as to enhance transparency in budget execution; (iii) the adoption through an Arrete of the
H~"'''"'''''' of Economy and Finance        a new              for the Tax Directorate, including the Cadastre
Domaines departments-a critical step towards the adoption of a new Land Property Code (Code Foncier)
that includes provisions              limiting State land property sales through non open and non competitive
bidding procedures; and (iv) the submission to          Audit Office (Cour des Comptes) of the execution laws up
to 2008 and the submission to the Parliament of the                   - by the Audit Office - execution laws from
1999 to 2002 as           toward     adoption of the             laws up to 2009 before 2011. In procurement, the
prior action under PRSC IV will be                 adoption of the revised procurement regulatory framework
(Procurement Code, NSBDs and                   Procurement Units) to address                                  in the
UL,~-S;IaIl'e 1 report. No prior actions are envisaged             PRSC IV in the area of debt management and
statistics.

open access by users to primary data.

                      4.  BANK SUPPORT TO     GOVERNMENT AGENDA
                                AND THE PROPOSED PRSC SERIES

                         A.   LINK TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

4.1      The FY07-10 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Senegal was discussed by the Bank's
Board on June 20, 2007 (Report No. 36608-SN). The CAS describes how the Bank Group, including
plans to contribute to         development and is structured around a "governance" filter and three main
pillars: (a)           growth/wealth creation; (b) human                      growth; and (c) rural and
urban synergy.
        In the        program, policy-based lending is seen as a critical instrument in support   the
PRSP agenda. The focus of policy-based lending operations was expected to cover budgetary reforms,
economic reforms for wealth creation, and support for policies that improve the delivery of     social
services to the poorest segments of the population over the medium· term. The CAS envisaged the
preparation and implementation of a new     of PRSCs focused on these areas.
4.3       The Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) that assessed progress in
                  the                 for Senegal was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on
June 18, 2009 (Report No. 48600).            Progress Report confirmed that, while progress against CPS goals
has been                         objectives set out in    CPS remained consistent with national priorities. It
also presented adjustments made to assist the Government in mitigating the impacts of the fuel and food
       crisis, and     recent global            downturn.             team            working closely with the
authorities to take proactive measures in addressing policy and implementation challenges so as to raise the
likelihood of an overall positive outcome              CPS. Portfolio performance was             as generally
satisfactory. A new CPS is slated to be presented to the Board IDA in FYI1, covering the period FYl1
14. The June 2009 Country Partnership                          Report outlined       analytical work that will
underpin the preparation the next partnership program with Senegal.
4.4       The proposed PRSC series constitutes a return to programmatic policy-based lending. The new
               would follow two stand-alone               policy operations, one in 2008 on      energy sector
and the other in 2009 on public finance support, both justified by the exceptional context of the fuel price
       and the subsequent onset of the global           In                 a stand-alone
in 2009, the team noted that both the urgent need for financial assistance and the focus of policy makers on
fiscal issues made a stand-alone operation a more appropriate instrument for Bank support to the authorities
at that juncture than a new          Poverty Reduction Support Credits. This             also provided      to
     authorities to advance in the preparation of a medium-term reform agenda to be supported under this
series of PRSCs.

                                  AND ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS 


 4.5      The proposed series ofPRSCs is the first series of Development Policy Operations in Senegal to
 be designed, developed and monitored by a core team that is almost entirely field-based. The core team
 involved in the design of the proposed operations, as well as in dialogue, analytical work and project
 preparation and supervision in the areas of focus of the proposed series is almost entirely based in the Dakar
 country office. The team maintains frequent contacts with technical counterparts, is called upon by
 Government and development partners in mUltiple discussion fora and workshops, and engages, as a matter
 of routine, in outreach activities to the media and stakeholders in policy-relevant areas.
 4.6     The proposed PRSC series builds on, complements and/or leverages existing or planned Bank
 development policy, capacity building, and investment operations and a broad program of analytical
 work. Annex 6 provides detailed coverage on analytical underpinnings and the instrument mix deployed by
 the Bank on individual PRSC components. In several refonn areas covered under the proposed PRSC
 series-private sector development, education, health, nutrition, fisheries, forest resource management, PFM,
 procurement, and debt management, the Bank already has a range of active instruments or partnerships with
 other donors to support the implementation of the Government's strategies, through capacity building,
 technical assistance and knowledge generation, or investment financing. As noted above, the core analytical
 work on public financial management and sector policy and public expenditure issues underpinning the
 proposed PRSC series is being developed under the Senegal Programmatic Public Finance Review (PPFR).
 In other refonn areas (small business taxation, trade, social protection, statistical development), the
 collaborative development by the Government, the Bank and donor partners of the analytical basis for policy
 development and implementation is built into the design of the PRSC series.

                        c.   COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

 4.7      The IMF and the World Bank staffs maintain a close working relationship, especially with
 respect to refonns in public financial management and structural measures in specific sectors, such as the
 electricity and hydrocarbon sub-sectors which have a systemic impact on public finances and on
 macroeconomic stability. Regarding the division of responsibilities between the two institutions, the lMF
 takes the lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies, while the Bank takes the lead in long-tenn
 growth, social and poverty analysis, sector policy issues, and public expenditure analysis. In a number of
 areas where the mandates of the two institutions overlap, especially in public financial management, there is
 close coordination and collaboration to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. This
 productive collaboration has continued under the IMF three-year program under the Policy Support
 Instrument (PSI). The current PSI-supported program is expected to end by November 2010; the authorities
 have not indicated their intentions with respect to requesting a successor PSI-supported program:
  4.8     Because of Senegal's strategic regional role, a stable policy environment and broadly favorable
  development outcomes, its PRSP-ll continues to benefit from foreign assistance. Many bilateral and
  multilateral development agencies have an active presence in Senegal, with the World Bank, the European
  Union, France and the United States being the largest contributors. Most donors in Senegal subscribe to the
  principles articulated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and in the Africa Action Plan (AAP).
  Donors providing budget support (the European Union, France, the Netherlands, Canada, the AIDB and the
  World Bank) or having expressed an interest in doing so (Gennany and Spain) have enhanced their
. collaboration in the design of budget support operations, including with the adoption in early 2008 of a
  Memorandum of Understanding-the Framework Agreement on Budget Support (Accord Cadre pour les
  Appuis Budgetaires, ACAB). Under the ACAB, common evaluation processes have been set up on
  macroeconomic conditions, progress in implementing the PRSP-II, and public financial management
  refonns. The ACAB framework is still in its infancy, however, and, while progress has been made with the
  adoption of joint monitoring indicators, and a regular quarterly meeting of a Steering Committee chaired by



                                                     40 

the Prime Minister, the government and ACAB donor representatives have also collectively acknowledged
that more could be done, on both the government and donors sides, to improve hannonization mechanisms
and exchange of information, better align donor support on the government-led reform agenda, and enhance
the predictability of budget support.
4.9      In the area of social protection, various development partners have approached the
Government to assist it in strengthening both the coverage and effectiveness of social assistance
programs. UNICEF, the World Food Program (WFP) and the World Bank have been forestalling these
efforts by supporting pilot direct transfers operations (food-, cash- or voucher-based), with UNICEF taking
an early lead in the necessary advocacy around investing in social protection. UNDP, ILO, as well as some
bilateral donors (France, USAID) are also highly engaged with the Government on the broader social
protection policy platform (pension, health and unemployment insurance). More coordination will be
essential as the Government further invests in social safety nets as a poverty alleviation strategy. Along the
lines of the Paris declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action, a consolidated action plan, framework of
activities and associated assistance needs identification will be needed to ensure that each partner leverages
its comparative advantages in assisting the Government harmoniously.

                                          D. LESSONS LEARNED
4.10    The design of the proposed series of PRSCs has drawn extensively from lessons learned in
implementing the previous series of PRSCs and in implementing the broader CAS/CPS. Several
lessons emerged from the experience of the first series ofPRSCs:
·  The Implementation Completion and Results Report for the first series of three PRSCs
   underscored the importance of focusing on a limited number of objectives--the PRSCs themselves
   had over 50 objectives or sub-objectives, an agenda whose sheer extended scope was considered
   excessively broad . However, as noted above, PRSP-II has a broad scope, encompassing 505 priority
   actions aiming at 144 strategic objectives in 46 sector or domains, structured under 4 strategic pillars.
   The proposed PRSC IV has retained 10 policy actions while the PRSC V has 10 possible triggers. Also,
   the proposed PRSC series (i) emphasizes reform complementarities-between PFM reforms and reforms
   in education, health, environment, and social protection; between sustaining macroeconomic stability and
   social protection; or between environmental concerns and vulnerabilities; and (ii) focuses, as an
   organizing framework, on the core institutions of the State. with a special emphasis on the budget
   processes and institutions.
·  Policy-based lending under a harmonized approach among donors can be an effective tool in
   Senegal to strengthen the country-based development model. The first series of PRSCs had a clear
   impact on government ownership of the reform program and helped reformers to mobilize the entire
   Government on cross-cutting issues and provide leadership and accountability. The improved alignment
   of support has begun to lead to improved decision-making by the Government at various levels. The
   implementation of the hannonized and multi-donor budgetary support instrument under the ACAB, with
   the Bank focusing on policy reforms and other donors on outcomes indicators, should provide a
   mechanism for effectively coordinating expanded donor budgetary support, unifYing donor assistance
   around a coherent set of policy actions, lowering government transaction costs from dealing with
   mUltiple donors, and generating substantial reform momentum.
·  As highlighted in the CPSPR, effective implementation of the Bank program has strongly
   benefited from a flexible approach, responsive to changing external or domestic circumstances.
   The Bank responded to the fuel price crisis in 2008 with an Energy DPO, although no funding for it was
   originally planned in the CAS. The Bank's response to the food price crisis led to the reallocation of
   IDA funds to two rapid response operations under the GFRP program. The emerging international crisis
   in late 2008 and 2009, and the Government's fiscal crisis of 2008, led to the Government's request for
   contingency funds to mitigate risks, including a stand-alone DPO and the scaling up of the Dakar


                                                    41
    Diamniadio Toll Highway project. Drawing on the lessons of this experience, the design of the proposed
          was built with the need       flexibility on   reform           as implementation            and
    new contingencies may emerge-an approach that is especially relevant in     current external economic
    environment      political context in Senegal.
4.11   More general lessons from Bank-wide reviews of policy-based lending were integrated into the
design of the proposed PRSC series. In particular:
·   Attention should be paid to the quality of outcome indicators at the outset, making sure that these
    indicators are relevant to the objectives, and that                can be measured at every             of
    implementation. It is crucial to align closely performance indicators for the PRSCs with those for the
    PRSP-II and        CAS. It is       important that      various donors involved in budget support use
    same set of indicatprs. However, dialogue             the proposed PRSC          will also aim to help the
    Government design its next PRSP. To meet the ensuing need for flexible design in relevant areas, the
                    of measureable outcomes indicators, the measurement of                     values
    selection of targets will themselves be part of reform implementation as     series proceeds.
·   Lending for development policy should not rely on conditionality alone to catalyze reforms. To
    fully effective, the policy dialogue must be supported by other instruments that identifY institutional
                            build          capacity step    step (OPCS, 2001).       proposed operation is
    complemented by a broad range of support and technical assistance provided under other ongoing Bank
    projects (see         B         and planned ones, while monitoring of implementation will be        out
    by a core team that is almost fully decentralized in   Dakar office.
4.12    Capacity constraints broadly construed, but especially constraints to government capacity to
steer the broad array of policy reforms underpinned by its PRSP-II, should not be underestimated.
The focus of the proposed          on the core institutions    the State has made it        to establish an
improved institutional anchoring for discussing, evaluating and monitoring reforms. The               of the
proposed PRSC was coordinated, on the government's side, by a newly created Technical Committee for
Budget Support, with active participation from line ministry                 Monitoring of implementation
and contingent adjustments to       policy framework will be facilitated within the forum for information
exchange and dialogue provided by this committee.

                               5. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION

5.1     The proposed operation is the first in a second programmatic series of two annual PRSCs
(pRSC IV and V). The                 supported by     PRSC IV is outlined above in Section 3 and in the
                      Development Policy (LDP) attached as Annex 2 and its policy matrix in Annex 8.
Through its LDP,                 has requested      IDA supports an important           of the reforms
outlined in  PRSP-II.

5.2      The proposed PRSC IV would support ten policy actions deemed critical to achieving its
development objective. Table 5.1 below details these prior           and their implementation status.
rationale for their selection has been discussed in Section 3, namely their criticality to the government's
short-term program,           government commitment, and technical readiness. They are drawn           the
larger Government's matrix of policy measures in priority sectors. Compliance with these prior actions
forms      basis for     to         with the proposed operation.

                             Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

 Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
 This operation is fully aligned with the Government's PRSP-II. The entity responsible for the program supported by
 this operation within the Government is the Ministry of Economy and Finance, in close associations with the Ministries
 of Education, Health, Environment, Justice, Family, Fisheries, and Mining.

 Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
 framework
 The coordinated               framework has been developed under the ACAB and PRSP                       system. The
 program has been closely coordinated with and supported by other development              such as the IMF, EC and
 bilateral donors. The       results of the program supported by the proposed credit are detailed in the Policy Matrix
 in Annex.

 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
 The         modality and scope of this             is fully customized to Senegal's current country circumstances.

           4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
 The         matrix uses a limited set of twelve      actions for Board presentation and disbursement of the ....rl'....."c"'f1
 operation, actions that are critical to move the Government's agenda forward, and are fully i"l"''''.. . lpn'Pl1it''rv
 Government's reform program supported        the IMF PSI. The chosen policy measures were
 Government and in close consultation with other development n"t'tnpr"

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
 support
! The  Bank has worked in close coordination with the IMF, EC and bilateral donors in supporting the Government's
  reform program.           forward, the Bank will continue to coordinate closely with these institutions, within the ACAB

        Tbe proposed operation is expected to have a significant positive direct impact on tbe medium
term poverty reduction trend. This            will be through an                     of     government's
policy making and institutional capabilities to ensure an enabling environment for the private sector

envisages actions that may ultimately impact selected groups, notably fishermen and coastal sand         users.
In     case    fisheries,    PRSC          supports policy reforms              with       projects that
been subject to Bank safeguards policies. Policies to            access to coastal sand mines may impact
            on the livelihood       resource users. A·                     analytical       and stakeholder
consultations process is envisaged as       of developing the policy program to ensure that any measures
supported        future           are implemented in a manner that is             with Bank policies.

                                               FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
              Government bas been pursuing a program of public financial management
tbe early 2000s. The mobilization of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) around the
modernization of the public financial management                  made it possible to make substantial
     the support of      technical and financial partners, including the World Bank. To move more forcefully
on PFM             the           developed an overall              that was         in October 2009.      PFM
action plan is a comprehensive attempt by the authorities to address the weaknesses their PFM system. Its
                   and capacity upgrading span          full array of PMF          mentioned above, under an
exhaustive, time-bound and sequenced program, drawing on self-assessment and recommendations from
development             including the European Union,         IMF          Bank. Most reforms supported under
the proposed PRSC            draw on        PFM action               Government is committed to carry out the
PFM reform agenda, and           established a        Reform Secretariat under       Ministry    Economy and
         with representation by all departments responsible for                        and whose role is to (i)
coordinate      reforms to    undertaken; (ii) harmonize government actions; (iii) monitor      implementation
                    and (iv) hold different actors accountable for progress.
        Strengtbening fiduciary systems is at tbe core of tbe proposed operation and tbe PRSC series.
As noted above, the design   the              on various analytical inputs,         a 2002 CF AA and a
2003 CPAR with an action       for PFM reforms supported by           through a Multi-Donors

donors, should     a long way to mitigate fiduciary risks. Overall, the Bank has judged implementation

its improvement as satisfactory.
6.6      Tbe BCEAO is tbe common central bank of tbe West African States, wbicb includes Senegal.
          the IMF       carried out an on-site          assessment of                 and found that progress
has been made in strengthening the BCEAO's safeguard framework                 2002,             last
assessment was conducted. The BCEAO now publishes a                  set of audited financial statements, and
improvements have been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial
Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted         the BCEAO had improved            explanatory notes to the financial
statements and further changes are scheduled for next fiscal year, with a view to gradual                  with
International Accounting Standards (lAS), as adopted internationally by other central banks. Furthermore,
an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms have been established to improve
management and risk prevention, and follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations               been
strengthened. The assessment identified a number        areas where further steps would help solidifY
          made in recent years. The main                    relate to: (i) improving              audit process
by adopting a formal rotation policy and further enhancing the transparency of         financial statements by
adopting         In full; and (ii) enhancing                          the internal audit              by
strengthening             to management        the BCEAO. The status report of              implementation of
recommendations,             from     Central Bank in        2007, indicates that some progress was achieved
in corporate governance and strength and transparency of internal financial reports.

6.7     Credit amount and trancbing.             borrower is the Republic of Senegal, represented by
Ministry of Economy and Finance. The credit will be released in one tranche of SDR 28.4 million (US$43
million equivalent) upon credit effectiveness. The closing date of the operation will be March 31, 2011.

management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. Based on previous experience,               execution of
such               from the Central Bank (BCEAO) to          Treasury (Ministry    Economy and Finance) does

                                       E.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

6.10    Under Operational Policy 8.60 on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is required to
determine whether specific country policies supported under the operation are likely to cause
significant effects on the country's environment, and, in the event of such likely effects, assess country
systems for reducing any such adverse effects and enhancing such positive effects. In the event of significant
gaps in the analysis, or shortcomings in the country systems, the Bank is required to identify how such gaps
or shortcomings would be addressed before or during program implementation, as appropriate.

6.11     The specific reforms supported by the proposed development policy credit are not likely to
have significant negative impacts on the country's environment, forests and other natural resources.
None of the policy measures supported by PRSC IV outside the "Managing Vulnerabilities" component
(Component 3) are likely to have direct negative effects on Senegal's environment and natural resources.
The structural reforms supported by PRSC IV aim generally at strengthening policy making and institutional
capabilities of the State through legal, institutional, operational and systems reforms that by themselves entail
no specific impact on the environment. The significant increase is road maintenance activity is not expected
to cause environmental degradation. Road maintenance comprises routine maintenance and periodic
maintenance. Usually, these two activities do not involve any reconstruction or road widening. In
exceptional circumstances, particularly when there is a significant backlog on periodic maintenance, one can
face heavy periodic maintenance that involves quasi- rehabilitation work, and can include in some cases
restoration of shoulders in rural areas or widening of shoulders in towns or rural district capitals.
As a result, there are generally no major environmental concerns, except the necessary preventive measures
such as: (i) the management of contractors' work camp and workshop areas; (ii) the general management and
reinstatement of borrow pits; (iii) the disposal of waste material; (iv) health and safety measures; (v) traffic
signals; (vi) traffic diversion, etc. The agency in charge of road maintenance (AA TR) is subject to strict
environmental standards, and has a good track record of compliance. Reforms supported under the PRSC
series' Component 3-fisheries, and those under this component for the PRSC series (coastal erosion, forest
resource management and environment budgeting) are intended to reinforce the Senegalese Government
ability to mitigate critical vulnerabilities to its environment and natural resources and thus have a positive
impact on the country's environment, forests and coastal areas. The context, rationale, Government agenda
and focus of the PRSC series in this reform area are discussed at length in Section 3 above.

                                     F.     RISKS AND RISKS MITIGATION
6.12      Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of this operation. These
include: (i) a deeper and/or longer macroeconomic downturn in the current global context than anticipated;
(ii) political opposition, including from vested interests and heightened in the context of the 2012 presidential
elections; and (iii) weak capacity to implement reforms. Yet, the design of this operation, with a relatively
focused agenda and high donor involvement, should help mitigate these risks.
6.13      Senegal's short-term prospects continue to depend on developments in the global economy. A
slower normalization and/or longer macroeconomic downturn in the current global context than anticipated
still represent a significant risk, contingent on developments in partner country economies, mainly in Europe.
One clear mitigation strategy is for the authorities to continue to steer a stable fiscal course for the year and
adopt resolute reforms, especially in the PFM area, that may in tum mobilize donors to provide additional
resources to buffer the budget from the consequences of a more abrupt slow down.
6.14     Political opposition, including from vested interests, represents a major potential obstacle to
reforms and the achievement of the operation's objectives, especially in the context of the next
presidential elections currently scheduled for 2012. Nonetheless, the balance of risks to the policy
objectives of the proposed series, including the proposed PRSC IV, is still viewed as favorable to moving
forward with it. Vested interests can also represent important obstacles to reform, especially reforms that
foster transparency in the use of public resources. Under the proposed operation, risks arising from

                                       LETTER OF ECONOMIC POLICY

                                                   I.     Introduction

1.       Senegal's development strategy will continue to target poverty reduction and improved living
conditions for the population, as well as the gradual establishment of conditions conducive to strong,
sustainable, and pro-poor growth and the development of human capital. To this end, the Government will
continue to enhance the quality of public affairs management and the functioning of markets by reducing
distortions and eliminating other barriers to private sector development, in particular by maintaining
macroeconomic stability and accelerating the pace of implementation of structural reforms.
2.       This docwnent summarizes Senegal's recent economic and social performance and then goes on to
discuss the key macro- and microeconomic reforms that the Government plans to implement over the next
three years. It has been prepared in a context of completed implementation of the second Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP II) and preparation of the third generation Economic and Social Policy document. The
priorities set forth herein have either already been outlined in sectoral policies or respond to new challenges
arising from recent changes in the national and international landscape.

                                 II.     Recent Economic and Social Developments
3.       During tbe 2006-2009 period, global conditions were cballenging, owing to a series of sbocks
(energy, food, and financial), wbicb bad a negative impact on tbe economy. Real GDP growth declined
sharply, falling from 6 percent in the 2003-2005 period, during which the first PRSP was implemented, to
under 3 percent during the 2006-2009 period. The primary sector's performance, which was modest in 2006
and 2007, gained momentum in 2008 and 2009, posting an average growth rate of close to 8 percent during
the latter two-year period, owing to higher agricultural productivity and favorable rainfall. Performance of
the secondary sector, already weak in 2006 and 2007 partly as a result of the ICS (Chemical Industries of
Senegal) crisis, deteriorated further in the wake of series of shocks, the adverse effect of payment delays by
the State to the local private sector in 2008, and the delayed resumption of ICS activities. While the tertiary
sector, traditionally a strong sector of the Senegalese economy, continued to grow in 2008 (3.5 percent), this
rate was cut in half relative to the 2007 rate, before declining (0.5 percent) for the first time since 1993, just
before the devaluation of the country's currency.
4.       In addition to slower growth, tbe sbocks also bad a somewbat adverse effect on tbe
macroeconomic equilibrium that Senegal bad managed to acbieve in previous years. In 2007 and 2008,
consumer prices increased by an annual average of 5.8 percent, reflecting the sharp rise in the price of a
barrel of oil and in food prices, before declining in 2009. Inflationary pressures started to ease toward end
2008 as a result of lower oil and food prices on the international market. The current account balance of
payments deficit stood at 10.5 percent of GDP in the 2006-2009 period, a 2.25 percent deterioration relative
to the 2003-2005 period . In the public finance area, fiscal management was affected in 2008 and 2009 by the



                                                        53 

impact of payment entities and lower-than-expected        revenue, The overall balance (including grants)
stood at 4,5 percent ofGDP        the 2006-2009 period, against 3 percent in 2003-2005.
5.       The public finance situation      however,                         in 2009           to 2008, the
latter being a particularly difficult year in terms of budget execution. Unlike 2008 when expenditure
execution             available        owing, inter alia, to the       of subsidies to blunt     impact
the oil and food shocks, in 2009 adjustments were made very               impact    the           crisis on
fiscal revenue. During the first     months    the year, the            made the decision to revise
revenue goals downward, in light of the capital losses recorded during the        quarter.              and
composition of public expenditure were revised through a supplementary budget law aU~J!J'~'U by Parliament
during the first half of the year.
6.         Despite the cancellation appropriations amounting to             percent of      and the problems
noted with construction work involving classrooms and hospitals, the Government managed to contain
the decrease in the volume of priority expenditures, particularly in the education, health, and
infrastructure sectors. The share of social expenditures relative to total expenditures rose from      percent
to      percent between 2008 and 2010. Performance of          education sector continued to improve in 2009.
Indeed,                 entrance and the gross enrollment ratios rose, respectively, from 113 percent and 90
npr'{,p,nt in 2008 to 117 percent      92 percent in 2009. Access by girls to education continues to expand,
        that                   entrance and    gross enrolment ratios for       remained higher than the
for boys, maintaining parity ratios higher than 1       the        consecutive year. Nonetheless, the primary
school completion rate, which rose       3            points relative to 2007 (59 percent)    falls      of the
Government's                  that
7.          The                of the health sector is                   improving as the Government hoped,
owing to the problems being experienced by the sector, particularly hospitals. The overall primary
consultation rate                 and             fell   two              points, from 60          in 2007 to 58
percent in 2008. At the same time, the percentage of deliveries assisted by qualified              fell from 62.5
np,'{'",,,r in 2007 to 61          in 2008. The proportion      children           the ages   0 and 11 who were
fully vaccinated fell from 89 percent in 2007 to 80 percent in 2008, while          rate of PENTA 3 vaccinations
     from       percent in 2007 to     percent in 2008 (a decline       percentage points). These slippages could
have an adverse            on maternal and infant mortality and could seriously jeopardize achievement of MOG
4 and MDG 5 by 15,
8.      In the water          performance in recent years has been strong, thus keeping Senegal on
track to           the MDG in        area in 2015.        rate     access to potable water in urban areas
increased from 72.4 percent in 2007 to      percent in 2008 in rural areas     held        at 98 percent in

                                           B.l Macroeconomic Outlook
10.             Despite     challenges           by the                 environment which ,",VI'H""'''_'' to be clouded with
uncertainty,                   macroeconomic outlook              the 20 I 0-20 12 period is              encouraging.
GDP growth averaging                       4 percent is expected over             next         years, reflecting      gradual
resumption            ICS             a higher          of activity in       buildings and public works (BTPs) area, and
continued growth in               telecommunications and transport sectors. Inflation is expected to return to
historical level 2 percent in              medium term.            current external deficit is projected to remain below 10

                and contributing to the            stability of WAEMU.

                                        B.2 Private             Development

Investment Council is the appropriate forum for moving the reform program forward in the area of cross-
                        progress is          regularly.      Government will continue to implement structural
                                    obstacles to private sector development and     functioning of markets. It
will monitor, in particular, improvements in the business             the justice        analysis   tax policy

12.      With regard to lower             start-up
                                    U;>1U"",,,,            in December         the Government adopted a decree
           the                          the urban planning code, following                  by Parliament     the
legislative                              decree outlines the                 for     processing and issuance of
                                build, and             and for                    urban planning               A
circular                          of Urban Planning has         set a 30-day            for             of urban
           certificates, a 28-day                for authorizations to build or divide           when cases are
straightforward,        40 days when        are complex, as well as an 18-day timeframe for the issuance of
certificates      compliance. Implementation            important measures should reduce significantly the
timeframes        obtaining construction permits, estimated at 220 days in Doing Business 2010. In order to
             these gains,     Government          plans to          wait            connections to     water and
sanitation network and for the payment fees for              connections.

of the justice system. The frequency of           hearings will    increased from once every two weeks to
once            in order to       the decision-making process.
14.     Despite      recent measures aimed at facilitating enterprise creation and formalization, the informal
sector remains very large in           and is           to be a constraint on higher productivity.
comprehensive tax [Contribution Globale Unique CGU] was implemented with a                    to
streamlining, and lowering taxes associated with the formal establishment of enterprises. While this reform
has           significant        additional resources are           The Government will              conduct a
study of the tax policy and system applicable to SMEs in order to identify and propose suitable corrective
measures capable of definitively eliminating the remaining barriers to the formal establishment of informal
SMEs.
15.      Furthermore, the Government remains firmly committed to boosting the competitiveness of the
economy and strengthening its integration into the regional and global economy, as set forth in the
Accelerated Growth Strategy. Dakar's Special Integrated Economic Zone [Zone Economique Speciale .
Integree de Dakar ZESID] will playa particularly important role in strengthening the competiveness and
development of exports. In order to burnish the appeal of this zone, the Government will conduct
consultations on labor regulation issues in ZESID, as a pilot for making the labor code more flexible . This
measure will supplement those already adopted by the Government, in particular a series of decrees to
strengthen and improve the enforcement of labor laws, with the aim of making manpower use more flexible.
In addition to these measures, the Government will assess the economic and social cost of protecting a
number of key sectors of the economy. To this end, it will undertake a study of the cost of protecting the
agricultural and food sector.
16.      In the infrastructure area, the Government continues to place emphasis on improving urban,
interurban, and rural transport and will step up the pace of implementation of its program to build new roads,
including the Dakar-Diamniadio toll highway. With the aim of preserving capital assets, both existing and
under construction, the Government has establ ished a second generation Autonomous Road Maintenance
Fund [Fonds d'Entretien Routier Autonome FERA], spearheaded by a tripartite entity on which the central
and local authorities as well as transport, employer, and consumer organizations are represented. The Fund
will be financed on an ongoing basis by an annual subsidy from the State budget and proceeds from a quasi
fiscal tax imposed on users. Over time, the proceeds from the quasi-fiscal tax should cover all Fund-related
expenses . The FERA became operational in 2009 and is projected to expand over the next five years. The
2010 budget has already allocated CFAF 45 billion for road maintenance, 50 percent of which is expected to
come from the quasi-fiscal tax levied on road users. This approach will be carried over into the 2011 budget,
in which the share of FERA resources from this quasi-fiscal tax is expected to increase to 70 percent before
rising to 100 percent in 2015, based on a medium-term framework.
17.      In the energy sector, progress has been noted with implementation of the energy sector Letter of
Development Policy, despite record-breaking high oil prices in 2008. Electricity production has increased,
owing in particular to expanded production capacity, rate adjustments, and grid inversion aimed at limiting
the impact on lower-income households. However, problems in the sector persist, given the fact that
international oil prices remain high.

                                   B. Human Capital Development
18.     Human capital development is central to Senegal's economic and social development strategy.
Significant resources have been allocated to the education and health sectors in recent years, and Senegal is
currently among the African countries investing most heavily in these sectors relative to its overall budget.
There is, however, room for improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of expenditure in this sector.
By contrast, the resources allocated to nutrition remain scant and should be increased in the years ahead.

Formation PDEF] is the mainstay of Senegal's education policy. Implementation              this program over a
         spanning more than ten years has                    to improve significantly its indicators relative to
access and equal opportunity for boys and girls. Although the                 school completion rate has
        steadily in recent years, it stands at 60       a figure that falls below the Government's

rate, enhance the quality of instruction, and respond appropriately to       different educational        in
          of Diourbel, Louga, Kaolack, and Matam. The Government            adopted measures to ensure that
decision to dismiss primary school students for poor performance is not made before students reach their
       year     primary              (CM2). Lastly,    Government will continue its              to build 1,500
classrooms per year.
20.    In the area    human resource management, the Government           decided to eliminate,
      of teacher recruitment on a contractual basis       the        quota" [quota                       In
   2009-2010 academic year, the              of          hired under the "safety quota" system fell to 500,
compared to 1,400 in          2008-2009 academic year. Beginning in            2010-20 II school        the
Government will institute a fully competitive system for       teachers on a contractual basis.
Consequently, recruitment under the "safety          system will be         entirely on the waiting      resulting
       the competitive recruitment process. In addition, the Government will strengthen human resource
management in the             sector          the adoption of a registration         for all contractual ''''',,"''1U.1'',

21.                 the              is cognizant of      fact that    universal         education goal will not
be achieved without targeted intervention in the regions of Diourbel,              Kolda, and Matam, owing to
their                       school             rates are well below the national average
traditional educational opportunities. As a          the Government entered into discussions with       partners
in               and conducted a study to determine        profiles      bilingual         to be        In

particular, it will ensure the sustainability of funding for higher education and reduce the strain placed on the
system in Dakar. Consequently, efforts to promote community colleges and/or regional university centers
[centres universitaires regionaux CUR] will be stepped up via the construction of new CURs to
accommodate, in particular, first and second year students. In-depth discussions will be held with the aim of
fonnulating a new strategy for the development of higher education. A national team has already been
established to spearhead the discussions.

                                               B.2 Health
24.       The 2009-2018 National Health Plan [Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire PNDS] is the
mainstay of Senegal's health policy. It is part of the strategy to expedite implementation of the various
prevention and health services programs and seeks to contribute to achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals in the health sector. Problems have been experienced with the implementation of this
plan owing to the situation in public hospitals [Etablissements Publics Hospitaliers EPH]. The first phase
(1998-2006) of hospital refonn focused on institutional aspects and administrative management of public
health facilities along with the introduction of management tools, with a view to increasing the autonomy of
these facilities. Thus far, the results of this refonn have been mixed. While hospital stays increased
significantly during the period, the pennanent nature of outcomes and the financial sustainability of refonns
are not guaranteed, given that the issue of funding for the refonn project was not settled beforehand. In order
to rebuild the public health facilities surveillance system, the Government will strengthen the framework for
dialogue between the State and hospitals by establishing an intenninisterial committee on which all the units
of the relevant ministries are represented. Recovery plans were prepared by these services and submitted to
the authorities in 2009, based on a joint framework. The reorganization of health care and the institution of a
new national hospital policy will be followed by the fonnulation of a strategic hospital plan. Based on this
work, the Government will fonnulate and adopt a new public hospital management strategy by end-20 1O.
Prior to end-March 2011, it will adopt a decree establishing the financial system applicable to public health
facilities and executing agencies, a decree strengthening the role of the Directorate of Health Facilities
[Direction des Etablissements de Sante DES], and a decree outlining the financing and surveillance
mechanisms for public health facilities through multi-year perfonnance contracts. Furthennore, the
Government will adopt the new master plan for the organization of hospitals (submitted as an annex to the
health map) and will conclude perfonnance contracts with at least five public health facilities.
25.      In addition, the Government is seeking to increase the proportion of the population covered by
microinsurance health plans [mutuelles de sante]. To this end, the Government has prepared a National
Strategy to Expand Health Risk Coverage [Strategie Nationale d'Extension de la Couverture du Risque
Maladie au Senegal SNECRMS]. This strategy is part of the effort to implement the National Social
Protection Strategy [Strategie Nationale de Protection Sociale SNPS] and is an integral part of the PNDS. Its
main objective is to raise health risk coverage from 20 percent in 2007 to 50 percent in 2015. The
SNECRMS has three main pillars: (i) improving the procedures for managing free services by establishing a
National Health Support Fund [Fonds National de Solidarite Santel, which will assume responsibility for all
initiatives provided free of charge; (ii) developing and improving existing initiatives and expanding
microinsurance health plans, services provided free of charge, and employer-based insurance [Instituts de
Prevoyance Maladie IPM] and (iii) developing such new initiatives as implementation of the pilot phase of
the "decentralization and extension of health insurance coverage" project, the creation of a special system for
persons living in rural areas, and a system of coverage for truck drivers and other lines of work. With a view

to implementation, the Government created a coordination and monitoring steering committee in April 2010,
by means           an interministerial decree          signed     the Ministers             Health     Labor, and
          Security.       March 2011,        Government plans to provide              to at     50 microinsurance
health plans                               in rural areas     in the informal sector. The Government will conduct

reJ:)re~;el1ltat1Ve sample of           persons. The Government will also conduct a           of options related to
billing, targeting, and identifYing beneficiaries.
         Despite the      that             resources            to the sector are substantial and are trending
upward, sustainable financing of      health sector continues to pose a challenge. To          it has been proven
that      solution to     various             linked to funding the health sector will entail, inter          the
development of a public-private partnership (PPP). It will             be necessary to strengthen the PPP by; 0)

           The Nutrition Enhancement Program (PRN 2007-2011) is the                of Senegal's health policy.
      strategies formulated by the        focus on two complementary areas, namely: (i)      promotion
integration      nutrition-related objectives into the      of the           technical ministries; and     the

reduce production times      accounts and draft budget review laws.     management accounts and    draft
budget execution law      2009 will therefore be submitted to    Audit Office     to end-2010. Moreover,
the Government will support completion of the reform of the Audit Court.
          In addition to the improvement and control of             operations      the central administration,
Government intends to restore the unity of the budget, enhance its                                    and

 42.       With regard to budget resource mobilization, the Directorate General of Taxes and State-Owned
 Property [Direction Generale des Impots et des Domaines DGID] of Senegal fonnulated a strategic
 development plan for tax administration (PDSAF) for the period 2008-2012. Constituting a relevant
 approach, this plan reflects the desire to completely overhaul tax management methods, modernize the
 DGID's services, and increase fiscal revenue. Based on this PDSAF, a perfonnance contract was signed by
 the DGID, which is intended to serve as an important support tool for the Government's structural refonn
 program. The DGID's mandate covers two areas: taxes and land. Remarkable progress has already been
 made with respect to its tax mandate. Several actions were successfully implemented, among them the
 establishment of the Large Enterprises Center [Centre des Grandes Entreprises CGE], which should
 facilitate the collection of close to 80 percent of domestic tax revenue and the transfer of responsibility for
 the col.lection of direct taxes to the DGID, as well as the establishment of Tax Services Centers [Centres des
 Services Fiscaux CSF]-all signs of significant progress.
  43.     However, it is clear that much remains to be done with respect to its land mandate. Among the major
  challenges facing the DGID are its mandates pertaining to land and State-owned property. Its current
  administrative organization is inappropriate and is hampering modernization of the land mandate. With a
  view to streamlining its organization and clearly delineating the responsibilities of the General Directorate
  and the tax centers, a number of modifications were made to the DGID's organizational chart. A decree
  revising the tax schedules and fixed rates that had become obsolete and had not been updated in years was
  also adopted. In addition to these rapid corrective measures, the Government intends to revise the legal
. provisions governing the State's land policy by March 2011. The land ownership code and its implementing
  decrees will therefore be revised. Discussions were conducted and an action plan was developed to make the
  land management process transparent, expeditious (by bringing the services closer to users), and secure.
 44.     In the area of procurement, implementation of a new procurement framework has been ongoing since
 January 2008 and the Government is finnly committed to its continued implementation. The procurement
 regulatory agency [Autorile de Regulation des Marches Publics ARMP] completed the audits of government
 contracts, which were conducted in 2008 and have all been posted on the ARMP's website.· In order to
 complete the public procurement refonn process, the ARMP undertook to revise the legal provisions
 governing public procurement and, in April 20 I 0, adopted these amended provisions, which are expected to
 promote the use of national systems by the Technical and Financial Partners.

                          D. 3.   Strengthening of the National Statistical System
45 .     The Statistical Master Plan (SDS 2008-2013) is Senegal's national statistical development
framework. It was developed through a broadly participatory process, and its implementation is being
spearheaded by the upper tiers of the National Statistical System (SSN), in particular the National Statistical
Council [Conseil National de la Statistique] and its executive secretariat. To implement this program, the
Government continues to allocate more resources to the sector, particularly through an increase in the budget
of the National Statistics and Demographics Agency [Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la
Demographie ANSD], as well as through assumption of responsibility for such flagship activities as general
population consensus, housing, agriculture, and livestock rearing. The SSN's steering bodies are, however,
not yet fully operational. The Government therefore intends to organize the first meeting of the National
Statistical Council by end-September 2010. It also plans to complete the legal framework governing the
development of statistics, particularly the provisions pertaining to access to anonymous primary data. To that




                                                      63 

    a proposal to amend the law on statistics to provide greater access to anonymous primary data will be
submitted to Parliament prior to end-January 2011.
46.     In         to improve coordination of support to the sector and streamline human resources,
particularly expertise in the area of household surveys, the Government will conduct consultations to develop
a       census framework          the            period (2011-2021). The National Survey Framework [Cadre
National d'Enquetes CNE] could: (i) Respond to the needs            the third generation Economic and Social
Policy document and           MDGs, as well as to          sectoral development              other
commitments, and other users; (ii) Reflect the outcome         a national debate among the various users and
producers         SSN, technical and financial            lawmakers, civil           and the private        (iii)
      current SSN capacity and existing constraints into account; and (iv)      updated every two years to take
new                  status     planned          into account.         the Government will undertake a public
expenditure           of statistics in order to enhance the visibility     resources aIloeated to the SSN, and
ensure their           use and

                     B.l        Perspectives macroeconomiques
10.     En depit d'un environnemcnt international difficile et marque par des incertitudes
pcrsistantes, les perspectives macroeconomiques du Senegal sur la periode 2010-12 sont
generalement bien orientces. La croissance du PIB reel est attcndue it 4 pour cent environ
en moyenne sur les trois annees it venir, refletant une reprise progressive des activites des
IeS, une redynamisation de l'activite dans Ie BTP et un maintien de la croissance des
secteurs des teleeommunjcations et des transports. L' inflation devrait revenir a son
nivcau historique de 2 pour cent a moyen terme. Le deficit exterieur courant devrait rester
en dcssous de 10 pour cent du PIB, finance de plus en plus par des flux d'Investissements
Directs Etrangers (IDE). La dette publiquc totale (exterieure et interieurc) devrait
atteindre environ 35 pour cent du PIB en 2010. Le cadre sous regional qui regit les
politiques monetaire et de change continuera de contribuer it presenter une faiblc
inflation, mais une politique budgetaire prudente demeurera un instrument cle pour
atteindre la stabilite maeroeconomique au Senegal et contribuer it la stabilite extericure de

                       B.2        Developpement secteur prive
11.     La Strategic de Croissance Acceleree (SCA) restera Ie point d'ancrage du
calendrier de r6fomlCs et d'actions prioritaires pour accroitre Ie potentiel de croissance de
I'economie senegalaise. Le Conseil Presidcntiel de l'Investissement (CPI) est Ie forum
approp'dc pour faire avancer Ie programme de rtformcs sur les mesures transversales et
                                                                         a

Gouvernement a pris en decembre 2009 un deeret portant partie reglementaire du code de

sur l'amelioration     mobiHte       intcrurbaine et rurale et         Ia mise en

           a peage Dakar-Diamniadio.       de preserver Ie capital            et en
constTIlction, Ie Gouvernement a cree et mis en place un Fonds d'Entretien Roulier
Autonomc (FERA) de seconde gemSration, pilote par une entite tripru1ite OU les
Administrations centrale et locale, les associations de transporteurs, les organisations
patronales et les groupements de consommateurs sont representes. Le financement
perenne du Fonds sera assure par une subvention annuelle du budget de l'Etat et Ie
produit de 1a taxe parafiscale a la charge des utilisateurs. A terme, Ie produit de 1a taxe
parafiscale devra couvrir la totalitc des charges du fonds. Le FERA a ete rendu
operationnel en 2009 et sa montee en puissance cst prevue dans les 5 annees a veniT. Deja
Ie budget de 2010 a alloue 45 milliards pour I'entretien routier dont 50 pour cent sont
attendus de la taxc parafiscale a la charge des usagers de 1a route. Le budget 2011
poursuivra cette tendance en partant la part de cette taxe parafiscale dans les res sources
du FERA a 70 pour cent avant de passer it moyen tenne a 100 pour cent en 2015.
17.     Dans Ie secteur de I' energie, des progres ont ete notes dans la mise en ceuvre de la
lettrc de politique de developpement du secteur malgre des niveaux historiquement eleves
des cours du petrole en 2008. La production d'eJectricite a connu des ameliorations
notables grace notrunment a l'accroissement des capacites de production et I'ajustement
des tarifs ainsi que 1'inversion de gri1le pour limiter I' impact de I'ajustement sur les
menages a plus faibles revenus. Toutefois, les difficultes du secteur continuent de
persister dans un environnement international marque par un cours du petrole qui reste
cleve.

                        B. Renforcement du capital humain
18.     Le developpement du capital humain occupe une place centrale dans la strategic de
developpement economique et sociale du Senegal. Les ressources allouees aux sccteurs
de I'Education et de la Sante ont atteint des proportions significatives ces .demieres
annees et Ie Senegal est aujourd'hui un des pays africains qui allouc Ie plus de ressourccs
aces secteurs en termes de prop0l1ion du budget global. Toutefois, l'efficacite et
l'ei1icience de Ja depense dans ces secteur reste a am6liorer. Par contre, les ressourccs
a1\ouees a la nutrition restent faibles et devraient etre ameliorees dans les prochaines
annees.

] 9.   Le Programme de D6veloppement de l'Education ct de la Formation (PDEF) est Ie
point d'ancrage de la politique educative du Senegal. Sa mise en ceuvrc sur plus d'une
decennie a permis au pays d'ameliorer sensiblement les indicateurs en matiere d'acces ct
d'egaLit6 de chance entre filles et garyons. Cependant, Ie taux d'achevement du primaire,
bien qu'en hausse constante au cours des demieres annees, reste a 60 pour cent, encore en
dessous des objectifs du Gouvemement Pour attcindre un taux de scolarisation au
primaire a 100 pour cent ct augmenter significativement        taux d'achevemcnt, Ie
Gouvemement compte ameliorer la                     et                     gestion

dispositions afin que I'exclusion     61eves du primairc pour resultats insuffisants ne

Direction des Etablissements de Sru1te (DES) et tm decret decrivant les mecanismes de
financement et de surveillance des EPS it travers des contrats d'execution pluriannuels. II
va par ailleurs, adopter Ie nouveau pl811 directeur de I'organisation de l'h6pital (joint en
annexe a la calte sanitaire) et signer un contrat de pClformance avec au moins 5 EPS.
25.     Par ailleurs, Ie Gouvemement ambitionne augmenter la proportion des populations
couvertes par les mutuelles de sante. A cet dTet, Ie Gouvernement a elabore une Strategic
Nationale d'Extension de la Couverture du Risque MaJadie au Senegal (SNECRMS).
Cette strategie s'inscrit dans Ie cadre de la mise en ceuvre de la Strategic Nationale de
Protection Sociale (SNPS) et fait partie integranlc du PNDS. Son objectifprincipal est de
porter Ie taux de couverture du risque maladie de 20 pourcenl en 2007 a 50 pourccnt en
2015. La SNECRMS se decline en trois axes: 0) amelioration des modalites de gcstion
des dispositifs de gratuite par la creation d'un Fonds National de Solidal"ite Sante prenant
en charge toutes les initiatives de gratuite; (ii) developpement et amelioration des
dispositi£<; existants et extension des mutuelles de sante, initiatives de gratuite et IPM; et
(iii) developpement de nouvelles initiatives comme la mise en ceuvre de la phase pilote
dn projet « Decentralisation et extension de 1a couverture d'assurance maladie », la
creation d 'un regime special pour les ruraux, systeme de couverture des routiers et autres
corps des metiers. Pour sa mise en ouvre, Ie Gouvernement a cree en avril 20 10 un
Co mite de pilotage charge de sa coordination et de son suivi, pru· alTete interministeriel
cosignc pal" les Ministres en charge des tlnances, de la sante et du travail ct de la securite
sociale. D'ici mars 201 I, Ie Gouvemement compte soutenir au moins 50 mutuelles de
sante couvrant les populations nlrales et du secteur informel. S'agissant de I'amelioration
de la gestion des initiatives existantcs, Ie Gouvernement va mener une enquete sur Ie plan
SESAME sur la base d'un echantillon representatif de persormes eligibles. Le
Gouvernement effectuera egalement une etude sur les options de facturation, de ciblage
et d'identification des beneficiaires.
26.    Bien que les ressources publiques aUouces au secteur soient importantcs et en
croissance, Ie fin811cement soutenable du secteur de la sante reste un defi . Aujourd'hui, il
a etc demontrc que la solution aux differents problemes lies au financement de la sante
passera, entrcs autrcs, par Ie developpemcnt du partenariat public - prive (PPP). Aussi
faudra-t- il renforcer Ie partenariat public prive (PPP) pal" : (i) 1'identification,
I'infonnation et la sensibilisation des differents acteurs sur Ie PPP ; (ii) ]'eIaboration de
terules reference d6finissant les domaincs d'intervention, les objectifs, les resultats
attendus, la rn6thodologic et Ie suivi-evaluation du partenariat, l'elaboration d'unc
strategie nationale de PPP; (iii) la connaissance pal" les differents acteurs du PPP, du
contenu       document de la politique de contractualisation ainsi      du
d'operationnalisation dudit          montrant           d'un tel            (iv)le

           ; et (Ii) la mise en oeuvre d'interventions                                     ou
allaitantes et      enfants de moins     5 ans.                         ce programme et 8es
                     a permis au Senegal d' attcindrc                           en
reduction de la              de malnutrition. Aujourd'hui Ie              reste sur une bonne
tendance vers                I'OMD dans Ie domaine       la nutrition. Afin     perenniser
acquis, Ie Gouvemement adoptera un plan          financernent it moyen terrne de la nutrition

                C. Protection sociale et reduction des vulncrabilites
       La              Nationale de Protection Sociale (SNPS) est une composante
                                             Reduction       1a Pauvrete          Son objectif
est                                        menacent                 les             de      des
populations notamment les groupes les plus 'vulnerables en               ces           a
      les        qui conduisent it des          de revenue ou en capital et a favoriser l'acces
des couches les plus vulnerables de la population aux services sociaux de base. Plus
specifiquement la SNPS doh contribuer aux objectifs suivants: (i) 6tendre et diversifier
                de protection sociale en           passer Ie taux    couverture maladies a 50
pourcent de la population en 201 . (ii) ameliorer la                     n!ponse aux choes et
risques pour les           vulnerables ; (ii) ameliorer Faeces des groupes vulncrables aux
                  y cornpris la          (iii) augmenter l'acccs alL'" instruments de gestion

          dans    systemes formels de protection sodale.
29.     A ce stade, Ie niveau de mise en reuvre de la SNPS reste limite du fait d'une faibIc
allocation de ressources mais egalement d'une multiplicite et d'un manque de
coordination des initiatives existantes. Afin d' avoir une plus grande visibilite des
ressources allouees au secteur, Ie Gouvernemcnt entreprendra line revue des depenses
publiques de protection sociale et une identification des beneficiaires du systeme des
filets sociaux. Le Gouvernement a lance deux experiences pilotes sur les transferts
moneta ires directs aux menages dotces de systeme de sui vi-evaluation rigoureux afin de
mieux tirer les enseignements de ces experiences. II lancera une etude de faisabilitc sur:
(i) Ie ciblage efficace; (ii) les mecanismcs de gestion de I'information et de SUIVI
evaluation, y compris les options en faveur de I'enregistrement des beneficiaires.
30.     Concernant la rCduction des vulnerabilices, notamment celles liees a la gestion
soutenab1c des ressources naturclles, Ie Gouvernement compte mettre en reuvre une
politiqlIe trans parente de limitation de I'effort de peche et de controle de J'acces aux
ressources halieutiques, limiter les prejudices causes a I'environnemcnt et it l'habitat par
un prelevement insoutenab1e du sable cotier et ameliorer la gestion des for<~ts
communautaires. Concernant I'amelioration de la transparence dans la gestion durable
des ressources halieutiques, Ie Gouvemement a publie sur Ie site internet du ministere en
charge de la peche, les accords de pecbe ou contrats assimil.6s en vigueur. II compte
desormais publicr de · fa90n systematique ces informations et selon une periodicite
semestriel1e, Ia situation des licences de peche (nombre, duree eUlUulee et droits payes)
par regime d'acces. Par ailleurs, Ie Gouvernement etablira un registre des navires de
peche industrielle et une base dc donnees d'immatriculation des navires de peche
artisanale acccssible en ligne au public d'ici mars 2011. A cet dIet, Ie Gouvemement
procedera it l'enregistrement de toute 1a petite t10tte (pres de 100 pourccnt) y compris les
navires qui pechent a l'etranger.
3 I.   Concernant l'erosion c6tiere, Ie Gouvernement adoptera un decret pour empecher
I'erosion c6tiere par lc prelevement de sable des I'adoption par Ie Parlement de la Ioi sur
la protection du littoral qui sera bientot soumise it l'Assemblee Nationale et au Senat. A
eet dIet il entrcprendra une evaluation de l'impact economique, environnemental et
social d'options de pre!evement de sable a I'interieur du pays ou au large comme
alternative au preh~vement de sable de plage. II entreprendra par aiUeurs une revue des
dcpenses pubJiques dans Ie secteur de I' environnement.
32.    S 'agissant de la gestion durable des ressources forestieres. Ia levee de la
subvention sur Ie gaz butane va induire une augmentation de la demande de charbon de
bois et de bois de chauffe de la part des populations et poser une pression adclitionnelle
sur les ressources forestieres. Afin de transferer definitivement la gestion de ces
ressources aux collcctivites locales et domiciUer en                       l'exploitation du
charbon      bois strietemcnt dans les forets amenagees, lc                 a

institutionnelles       que les mesurcs pratiques necessaires seront prises. En particulier,
Le Gouvcmement veillera it adopter une fonne de gestion administrative permettant
notamment       coordination de la               volets            et exterieur      la dcttc et

travers Ie Comite National de Ia Dette Publique (CNDP). En                             de cette
         budgetaire et d'endcttement, Ie Gouvemement s'attachera a ameliorer la gestion
de Ia tresorerie publique par Ia            en ceuvre de mesmes permettant d'eviter la
dispersion de cette tn~sorerie et l'immobilisation d'une tresorerie OISIve par la
rcstauration du Compte unique du Treso1'. De meme la centralisation integrale et rapide
de la tresorerie collectee vers les comptes du Tresor sera realisee.

            D. 2. RHormes budgetaires et passation de marches publics
36.    Lc point d'ancrage des reformes budgetaires et de passation de marches publics est
Ie Plan de Reformes Budgetaires et FinancicTes (2009-2012). Ce plan fait la synthese des
recommandations issues des differents diagnostics du systeme de gestion des depenses
pubUques conduits au cours de trois demiercs annees. II poursuit les efforts du
Gouvemement visant it ameliorcr la productivite de la depense publique, a accro'itre la
transparence budgetaire ct a renforccr revaluation, Ie suivi et Ia comptabilisation des
risques budgetaircs. 11 se veut egalcment flexible et evoluti f dans la mesurc ou des
espaces de dialogue seront ouvelts pour l'integration concertee de nouveaux domaines
dans Ie plan d'action.La coordination ct Ie suivi seront poursuivis it travers Ie Comite
Conjoint d'Harmonisation et de Suivi (CCHS) des rMonnes budgetaires et financieres
redynamise et Ie haut comite de pilotage mis en place au sein du ministere de I'Economie
ct des Finances. Le CCHS continuera a se reunir tous les quatre ruois.
37.      Ainsi, le Gouvernemcnt continuera a mettre en reuvre les rCformes visant it
 ameliorer la planification des depenses ct la preparation du budget, son execution
transparente ainsi que son contrale a posteriori par Ie Parlement et la Cour des Comptes.
Deja d'importants progrcs ont ete enregistres dans la mise en reuvrc de ce plan de
reformes. Le Gouvernement a pris en 2009 un decret fixant Ie calendrjer budgetaire et les
prineipales methodes d'elaboration du budget. Celui-ci vise it consolider les bonnes
pratiques en matiere de gestion des finances publiques en instituant un cadre de
coherence entre Ie cadrage macroeconomique et budgetaire, Ie CDMT et les CDSMT
ainsi que Ie budget. 11 a etc mis en reuvre en 2009 dans Ie cadre de la preparation budget
2010. L'experience deja acquise en matiere de CDMT sera un important atout 101'5 de
[' application des nouvelles directives de l'UEMOA adoptees cn juin 2009 pour ce qui
concerne les aspects relatifs aux budgets-programmes. Le Senegal a deja mis en place un
Comite national charge de la transposition de ces directives qui vont marquer la
trajectoire des refonnes budgetaires des annces a venir. Les ministeres qui sont les plus
avances en matiere CDSMT serviront de pilote pour Ie passage au budget programme et
I'orientation vers Ie pilotage par la performance.
38.    Au niveau de I'execution du budget, de nouvelles dispositions ont etc pJ;ses pour
limiter Ie recours aux procedures derogatoires en matiere de dCpenses publiques qui ont
eu des impacts positifs dans I'execution du budget en fin 2008 et en 2009. Le
Gouvernement poursuit la modernisation de son systeme de gestion des finances
publiques et continue d'am6liorer les fonctionnalitcs, la couvcrtme, I'cfficacite ot 1a
         du Systerne lntegre de Gestion         Finances Publiques (SIGFJP).          logiciel a

d'execution budgetaire tout en                 ta flabilite de l'infonnation budgetaire. Pour
accroltre la transparence et renforcer l'acces du public a l'information budgetaire, Ie
Gouvernernent a au cours de l'annee 2009 regulierement public sur Ie site internet du
Ministere des finances ou de ses                           situations d'execution
              par            et                          delais               courts.

publication de situations d'cxecution blldgetaire mensuelles dans un d6lai         trente jours
(30 joms) et          rapport              sur l'execution budgctaire.          Gouvernemcnt
exploitera                                         du budget 20 II Ie code                    Ia

pour les secteurs de !'education, de la sante, de lajustice et de la decentralisation.

Gouvemement revisera par arrete ministericl l'organisation de la Direction     la Soide

     rentes viageres. Cette phase de redaction sera completee d'iei dccembre 2010. A

41.     Au dela de l'assainissement et la maitrise des operations de l'Administration
centrale, Ie Oouvemement compte restaurer I'unite du budget, ameiiorer son exhaustivite
et renforeer Ie suivi et Ie eontrole des risques budgetaires lies aux activites des autres
entites du secteur public tcUes les agences autonomes et les etablissements publics, dont
les hopitaux qui beneficient de plus en plus de transferts de la part du budget de 1, Etat. A
eet eflet, une loi d'orientation des agences definissant notamment Ie cadre de creation;
de fonctionnemcnt ; de controle et de dissolution de ces entites a ete adoptee. 11 s'agit it
present de parachever ce dispositif par la signature; Ie cas echeant des textes
d'accompagnement et la prise des mesures pratiques d'application. Ce dispositif
renforcera la transparence de ce seeteur et permettra la mise a disposition d'une
information complete sLlr les agences dans les lois de finances, offrant au Par1emcnt une
vision glob ale sur l'action publique. Concernant Ie suivi de I'execution, des rapports
reJatifs a I'execution du budget et de la tresorerie des agences seront periodiqucment
soumis au ministere en charge des fUlances. Pour un meilleur exercice de la tutelle
tinanciere des agences, une Direction du Secteur Parapublic a etc creee au sein du tresor
ct sera renforcee en moyens et capacites techniques et financierc. Cela devrait permettre
une meilleure gestion de ces entites dont les risques potentiels qU'elles font peser sur les
finances publiques sont tn~s importants
42.     Pour ce qui est de la mobilisation des ressources budgetaircs, la Direction
Generalc des Jmpots et des Domaines (DGID) du Senegal a d6veIoppe un plan de
dCveloppement strategique de l'administration fiscale (PDSAF) qui couvre 1a peri ode
2008-2012 : demarche pertinente, ce plan concretise la volonte de chan.ger radicaJement
les methodes de gestion de l'impot, de moderniser les services de la DOID et d'ameliorer
les performances en matiere de recettes fiscales. Sill" la base de ce PDSAF, un contrat de
performance a etC signe par la DOlD: il se veut un outil d'appui significatif au
programme de rCformes structurelles du Gouvernement. La DOID a deux corps de
metier: la mission fiscale et la mission fonciere. En ce qui conceme la mission fisca1e,
les progrcs d' ores et deja enregistrcs sont remarquables. De nombrcuses actions ont ete
mises en ceuvre avec succes. Parmi ces mesures, on peut citer Ia creation du Centre des
Grandes Entreprises (COE) qui devrait permettre la securisation de pres de · 80% des
recettes fiscales interieures, Ie transfert du recouvrement des impots directs a la DOID et
1'implantation des Centres des Services .Fiscaux (CSF) constituent des avancees
significatives.
43.    Par contre, au niveau de la mission fonciere, il reste manifestcment beaucoup a
faire. Pamli les grands defis auxque1s 1a DG1D est confrontee, figurent les missions
fonciere et domaniale. Son organisation administrative actuelle est inadaptee et constitue
un frein a 1a modernisation de la mission fonciere. Afin de simplifier son organisation et
clarifier    responsabilitcs entre la direction
             de                      la DGlD ont
adopte mettant a                                        qui etaient devenus obsoletes et non
              depuis des                             ces mesures                            Ie

l'Etat. Ainsi, Ie code de propriete fonciere sera revise            meme que ses decrets
d'application. Des              ant ete menees et un plan                                 pour

44.     Concernant la passation des marches publics, un nouveau cadre des marches
publics est mis en reuvre                   2008 ct Ie Gouvernement est
poursuivre son application avec fermete.                           des Marches Publics
(ARMP) a complete les audits        marches publics passes en 2008 qui ont fait l'objet
d'une publication          sur Ie              l'ARlvlY. Afin de parachcver la rHomlc
des marches publics, I'ARMP a entrepris unc revision
marches publics et a adopte en avril 2010 ces textcs           qui            favoriser

             Annex 3: Structure and Change of the Senegalese Economy Over the Past Decade

1.      Senegal has grown from being a US$4 billion economy in 2000 to being a US$14 billion
economy in 2010. With a population growth of nearly                          ten years,25 per capita GDP in
Senegal is projected to reach US$1,100 in current dollars in 2010, from US$425 in 2000, a near tripling.
Evidently, part of              in         total current GDP or per capita income is notional, rCIlecung
appreciation against the US dollar of the CF A franc, pegged to the French franc, then
unchanged               1994. Nonetheless, the 2000 decade in Senegal has been a u"",,,",uu,",
growth at about 4 percent per year, or 1.5 percent on a per capita basis.
2.        However, Senegal's growth experience over the decade has been marked by little structural
change in the economy. (See Table A.I) Pursuing a long trend from previous decades, agriculture, having
contributed nothing to decadal growth, has continued to decline in relative          and now             only a
little over 7 percent of nominal GDP, despite still considerable importance as a partial source livelihood
for a majority of the population.            a historically          sector               has          as well,
reflecting mainly increasing pressure on the fish stocks. In the secondary sector, construction, fueled by
modest           in bank        a sustained          in                  abroad and a public investment boom,
    the context of continued urbanization, has allowed the share of the secondary sector to remain at about 20
percent in                             that manufacturing has      stagnant at best.
3.       About two thirds of the cumulative 40 percent growth in real GDP over the decade has come
from the service sector, which now represents about 52 percent of GDP.                           transport
largely accompanied other sectors' growth, though port development, by improving                   and reducing
bottlenecks has          growth within                  transport sector. Steadily growing tourist
until the bankruptcy of Air Senegal 2009, supported the air transport sector. The telecom sector has
registered stunning triple-digit cumulative                    in part in the number of              to      or
mobile phone lines, which stood at more than 90 per 100 people in 2008, compared to 44 in 2000, and only 7
     years          Public                  including public education       public health, has been the second
pillar of national output growth in the 2000 decade in Senegal. Overall, the actual record of the decade
        that the             economy is                     to some extent                            economy,
with a large urban informal sector, the emergence of modem services such as banking, telecommunications,
tourism, and                     and an                         sector.
4.     Importantly for Senegal's medium-term prospects, an expansion of investment underpinned
these developments.                        expanded        about 20         of GDP in 2000 to 31
GDP by 2007-the last year for which good estimates are available--, with both private and public
investment contributing an        share in   increase.      investment             itself was         against a
background of political, macroeconomic and price stability, by the continued robust growth in remittances
(20         a year in nominal terms),26                         public works, and increasing foreign
investment in the telecom, port, and mining sectors. This said, the economy has shown little structural
                   diversification has     limited and, as         A.l illustrates, there has been no
drive. While there is no conclusive           on trends in growth of total factor productivity, it is likely to
have contributed only a small share of




25  This overall rate assumes an annual rate of population increase of 2.5               per annum. However, current
demographic estimates are likely to be revised with a national population census in 2010-11, and it is possible that
estimates of a trend of        declining population growth observed from 1980 to           the date of the last census, will
   revised.
  There remains a large uncertainty on both the level and annual growth in total remittances, as                  flows are
thought to be transferred from abroad outside official banking and cash-transfer channels.

27 The table must be interpreted with caution.                  point to point annual numbers may               changes if the
           point (2000) and/or the end         (2009) are          of long-term trends, because of shocks for example. This is
the case for the               sector in particular in 2009, but for most sectors, the point-to-point            does capture
trends accurately. In addition, there remains weaknesses in data collection and compilation in national accounts, as a
               share of activity remains informal, eluding precise statistical          Finally, sector value added shares are

More importantly, they reflect not only real (volume)                   but relative                as well. For example, the
decline in energy's share in GOP largely reflects the compression of value-added in recent years brought about by
higher fuel input costs and an imperfect pass-through of these costs on to consumers. Similarly, while real cumulative
growth of VA in vegetable oil milling has been negative (-60.9 percent), value-added in the industrial sub-sector has in
fact turned around from a minor negative to a minor positive value-added.

5.              There is too little data on employment to assess how the economy's labor markets have
performed but performance in tbis area is unlikely to bave been impressive. Fragmentary information
 u",~".... ",,,> that there has been little growth in private formal employment, along a small expansion of public
sector employment. Total formal employment, private and public, accounts for no more                   8 percent
employment,              which more than half is in the public sector. This low proportion does not appear to have
expanded over the decade. Formal wages and benefits are                   but informal wages are low-an estimated
median salary of US$68 dollars                 month. To a         extent, the                    cohorts    young
people looking for work-estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000 annually-have been absorbed mainly
through the deep but poorly                     informal urban labor markets in and around Dakar; in subsistence
primary activities (agriculture, livestock, fisheries and forestry) throughout the country's rural areas; or, to an
imperfectly known extent, migration abroad. Even in urban informal                            the         of labor
absorption is likely to have been highly imperfect: 2002 estimates for example indicated that close to
60                 of the unemployed were aged between 15 and 34, and that 75 percent of this group was in Dakar,
where unemployment reached about 19 percent in 2007 and underemployment was likely significant.
6.         There is no clear individual factor that accounts for the lack of a strong jobs performance.
Senegal's still rigid labor market regulations, often much more rigid than in other countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa (see Table A.2 below) and high formal labor taxes appear to            an important part of the
accounting for both limited progress in expanding                   employment and, possibly, for part of the
substantial increase in investment in labor-substituting               but the current political context is unlikely
to allow              in     area to     part     the medium-term solution, given the historic strength of unions.
This said, besides the sheer fact that labor activities of92 percent of the work force are                 rigidities
in labor market regulation are rarely reported by business actors, including in          formal sector, as a major
impediment to doing business, as opposed to electricity costs, the functioning of the judicial sector, access to
 r\n'T_T~'rrn finance, the low level of skills in the work      and tax policy and administration.

Tile Public Finance Context: the 2000-10 decade
7.      By 2010, non-debt government spending in Senegal will bave expanded five-fold in US dollar
terms over the decade, from USS700 million in 2000 to a projected                billion in 2010.
expansion of public spending over the decade, yet on a broadly stable and sustainable trajectory, is the
defining feature of Senegal's recent fiscal performance. Just as for nominal GDP expressed in US dollars,
part of this five-fold, 400 percent increase in total non-debt spending is only notional, reflecting the
appreciation of the CFA        against     dollar over the period. Nonetheless, it         a      indicator
of a decade-long quantitative change in Senegal's public finance position.
8.     The broadest factors accounting for this sharp increase include a decade of growth, successful
revenue mobilization efforts, and debt consolidation. A breakdown of the 400 percent increase in non-
    spending          the role of       factors:
  ...  Debt          has brought some of fiscal space: debt                     increased though moderately in
       nominal dollar terms, and fallen from US$150 million to US$113 million in real 2000 US$ terms, on
       account of the             debt relief initiatives (HlPC and MDRI)                    benefitted from over
       the period, as well as the maintenance of a prudent borrowing policy. Put another way, if Senegal
             as much as a share of total           on debt service as it did in 2000, its debt service         in
       2010 would amount to US$670 million dollars, against a projected US$233 million. Thus a 400
       np"('p"t increase in non-debt spending has been made possible by a somewhat slower increase in total

       spending-350 percent.
  ...  Real total spending has increased by 120 percent over the decade 2000-10, equivalent to a
       70 percent increase per capita. In 2000 US dollar terms, spending has increased by 175 percent (a
       near tripling) over the decade. A small part            increase in          spending is again notional,
       reflecting domestic inflation, but with cumulative inflation over 2000-10 at about a low 25 percent,
            total spending has             by 120 percent.              a cumulative population growth       30
       percent over the decade, this still represents a sharp increase, close to 70 percent, in public spending
       per                                    per                  by only 20         over the same
  ...    Domestic revenue mobilization was instrumental in supporting the expansion of spending. The

     ·  Over tbe decade, donors bave kept pace witb tbe growtb of spending, maintaining a sbare of
        about 21 percent in tbe government's sources of fiscal resources.                    or project support, in
                    loans, accounted for 21           of total              level that, though not without year-to
        year variations, has remained on a broadly constant trend over the decade. Since many of these donors
        had also       creditors to the government, the maintenance of a stable share of gross financing in total
        government spending implies that debt relief did not lead donors, in                to        their new aid
        flows dollar-for-dollar with debt relief. Nor have they                the terms of support: the share of
        grants in total gross donor support has               broadly unchanged (about 40              with    rest
        on concessional terms. The form of aid-projects or budget support-has not evolved in the direction
        of increasing budget support over         decade: in       the        of budget support in total aid flows

African countries. While      ODA                                        between 35 percent and 45         in

government budget could decline.
11.      Developments on the spending side of Senegal's budget have been equally significant, with a
drop in wages creating substantial fiscal space. The                                 has been          to
significantly the share of what it used to call "mandatory expenditure" in the overall budget-wages,
pensions,                      providing room for                  and development expenditure. While total
nominal spending has increased by about lOY:! percent a year over the decade, recurrent spending has
           by about 9 percent. Part of this trend reflects lower interest spending, but even in terms of
recurrent non-debt spending, the rate of increase has been less than overall spending: as a result,
non-debt current spending in total            fell from about 60 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2010. The
wage bill, in particular, which in 1996 had been close to 90 percent of domestic revenues,          stabilized at
about 32          of revenues, and 23 percent of total spending,        budget classification
ratios downward.
12.     The fiscal space generated by relative wage containment and debt relief has been used largely
to finance capital spending and subsidies (see Figure A.3). Public investment spending                    from
below 6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 11.3 percent of GDP in 2010. With a                donor contribution to the
budget, mainly on capital spending, this overall growth in capital spending         a sustained increase in the

              in 1996, 17 percent in 2000, and should      26          in 2010. In addition, a      proportion
of budgetary             go to          in charge of                government investment programs. As the

                                      Annex 4: Senegal's Five "F" Crises

I.       The second half of the 2000 decade in Senegal has been marked by a series of shocks that have
all but stopped per capita GDP growth. Growth over the first half of the decade averaged about 5 percent a
year, well above population growth of about 2.5 percent a year. Since 2006, however, a series of shocks
have buffeted the Senegalese economy, bringing average growth over 2006-09 to an average of about
2.7 percent per year, barely in line with population growth.
2.       Initial shocks, starting in 2006, were largely internal. Poor rains in both 2006 and 2007 led to a
fall of agricultural output of about 15 percent in each year. Despite the sector's small share in GDP, falling
agricultural output contributed to trim at least one percentage point in overall GDP growth in both years and
to exacerbate the impact on the population of the forthcoming escalation in food prices. Deep financial
difficulties in the largest exporting finn, the phosphate mining and phosphoric acid production finn ICS
which is majority foreign private-owned, led to a sharp slowdown in its activity, and another loss of one
percentage point of GDP growth in 2006 (the company was recapitalized in early 2008). Internal
inefficiency in the electricity parastatal, SENELEC, resulting in high costs and blackouts, has continued hurt
economic activity.3D
3.      A rapid succession of more recent shocks, some external and some internal, compounding each
other, have taken a toll on the economy. Each of these successive crises has had its own time frame,
channels of transmission, economic scale and social targets, but taken together, they largely account for
Senegal's weaker perfonnance in the second half of the decade.
·  The food price shocks, which peaked at mid-2008 and has now largely receded, was a significant shock
   to Senegal, which imports respectively 80 percent of its rice and close to 100 percent of its wheat. The
   shock was broadly regressive to income distribution in urban areas, which were among the most affected.
   The impact on the rural poor is ambiguous, as higher food prices constituted both a positive supply shock
   on the food-producing fann sector, and a mainly negative one on rural consumers devoid of access to
   land.
·  The fuel price shock also peaked at mid-2008 and was significant in its macro-economic impact,
   affecting inflation and purchasing power, business costs, fiscal accounts, and Senegal's external position.
   Senegal imports all its oil, which powers most of its electricity. About half the cumulative price shock
   was mediated through increases in prices for fuel for cars and trucks, which is generally flexibly passed
   through from world oil prices to domestic retail prices, and thus constituted a broadly distributed price
   shock. About half of the impact of the oil price shock was mediated through the local electric utility,
   SENELEC, which relies heavily on fuel for power. The shock took the fonn of a mixed combination of
   higher electricity prices for consumers when the government decided to adjust prices, lost budget
   resources when it didn't and, when neither prices nor budget subsidies were involved, poor electricity
   quality borne by consumers putting up with blackouts or the high cost of alternatives. With access to
   electricity having reached 95 percent in Dakar, and about 25 percent in the country, the vast majority of
   SENELEC's clients are the urban poor and non-poor, which remain a powerful political constituency in
   Senegal.
·  The 2008 fiscal slippage culminated at end-2008 with the accumulation of unpaid bi/ls to domestic
   suppliers reaching CFAF 225 billion (3% percent of GDP) by October 2008. 31 Faced with a continued


30 SENELEC's losses over 2006-09 required repeated injections of budgetary subsidies and recapitalization funds
equivalent to close to 6 percent of2009 GDP.
31 Part of the stock of unpaid bills outstanding reflects normal payment delays between the time a supplier bills the
government and the time the Treasury pays, while arrears are defmed as bills unpaid beyond contractual payment rules
(e.g. 90 days). With the relatively high degree of goods, services and construction contracts in Senegal's budget, a stock
of unpaid bills within 90-days payment delays would normally total about 2 percent of GDP. The authorities have


                                                          90 

    surge in oil and food prices, the authorities enacted in both 2007 and 2008 unbudgeted tax cuts and
    subsidies equivalent to about I Y2 percent ofGDP. The initial fiscal policy response proved inadequate
    attempts by the authorities to tighten commitment controls ("pone/ions") already by May 2008 could not
    rein in overall spending to a commensurate degree. At the same time, the Treasury faced growing cash
    constraints as access to domestic financing through short- and medium-tenn paper issues in the local and
    regional money markets fell short of budget plans by a significant margin (about 1Y2 percent of GDP),
    reflecting tight liquidity conditions in these markets in early 2008 in the wake of unusually high and
    early access by other countries in the zone. The inability to promptly pay suppliers was a clear factor in
    a slowdown in the economy in 2008, especially in the urban construction sector. Conversely, the
    repayment of a large fraction of domestic arrears in early 2009 has constituted a significant injection of
    liquidity in the economy-equivalent to about a sixth of total bank credit to the private sector-that
    contributed to strengthening private sector balance sheets, increasing bank liquidity and providing
    stimulus to the local economy.
·  The global financial crisis and ensuing recession, in full fledge over 2009, has taken a toll on Senegal's
   economy. Being an open economy, Senegal's exposure to the global recession has been significant. The
   main transmission channels have included declines in export demand and prices, tourism, remittances
   and foreign direct investment (FOl). To a large extent, however, the evidence so far suggests that the
   declines in external demand, transfers or capital have been smaller than feared earlier in the year, though
   their joint impact accounts for a significant fraction of the slowdown in real growth in 2009. Moreover,
   the global slowdown also has had an upside for Senegal, with the recent fall in fuel and food prices,
   though it has been an upside tainted with high uncertainty.
·  The response to global conditions of a few large and critical private foreign investment projects augurs
   well for Senegal's ability to weather the impact of the global crisis, but uncertainties remain. Three large
   scale FOI projects had been expected to be initiated by 2008-09-an iron ore mining project by Mittal, a
   PPP-structured toll highway, and Dubai Ports World (DPW)'s planned modernization of the container
   port of Dakar. Of these, the Mittal project is being clearly postponed, if not abandoned altogether. The
   IDA-supported PPP project to develop the Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Highway Project proceeded broadly
   as planned, though its multi-year phasing and modes of financing were revised to account for the impact
   of the global crisis. So far, DPW is not revising its current plans, and is expected to continue to pursue
   its port expansion project, even though the recent financial crisis at its parent company Dubai World has
   heightened uncertainty on DPW's ability to continue its worldwide expansion, of which the Port of
   Dakar is only an element. Overall, the slowdown in the overall scope of FDI projects may amount
   mainly to the loss of a source of short-tenn growth acceleration for Senegal, rather than contribute to a
   growth decline.
·  The last, smaller crisis to hit Senegal was the August 2009 floods in the Dakar and some other urban
   areas. Though floods lasted only a few weeks and affected a small area of the country, a recent Post
   Disaster Risk Assessment indicates that they affected close to 475,000 people, mainly in the Dakar area,
   leading to losses in homes, schools, roads, inventories of unsold goods, and stalls for produce. Capital
   and income losses were relatively small, however, estimated at respectively about US$103 million (about
   :y.. percent of GDP) and less than 0.1 percent of GDP. 32 Nonetheless, for the affected population, the
   floods resulted in an estimated 14 percent loss of annual average income and aggravated the food
   insecurity in peri-urban areas. In October 2009, two months after the beginning of the floods, 800 ha
   were still under water, placing many people at high risk for malaria, diarrhea and other water-borne
   diseases.



nonetheless committed themselves to keeping the total stock of unpaid bills at any point in time to under Y2 percent of 

GDP. 

32 Electricity blackouts in August 2009 also contributed a negative shock to the urban economy.

        Annex        Issues and Agenda on Public Financial Management and Procurement

                                        Public Financial Management

1.           Recent diagnoses performed by or at the request of the authorities have identified a range of
weaknesses in Senegal's PFM                      Over 2002-08, PFM refonns drew on the               assessment of the
public finance management system (the 2002 CF AA, Country Financial Accountability Assessment, and the
2003                Country Procurement Assessment Review), with an                                      established to
monitor their implementation. More recent diagnoses, in particular the 2007 PEF A and a 2008 IMF
technical                  report, confinned progress      identified weaknesses. The main               of       latter
  H.''''UV.,,,,,, were consistent with the analysis budgetary slippages reported by the Finance Inspectorate audit
in July 2008 which identified several deficiencies in budget execution                         including (i) an overly
broad use of                      (simplified)                          (ii) insufficient respect of the principle of
annual budgeting; (iii) weak monitoring of the para-public sector, including autonomous                          public
                         public hospitals; (iv) ponderous, slow and                    centralized budget
procedures; and (v) a                to strengthen accounting systems to ensure sound financial information and
improve controllability of public accounts.
2.       Nonetheless, Senegal's PFM system has several strengths. Senegal               (i) a coherent legal
framework                with        international practices, though in need         modernization towards
perfonnance-based budgeting; Oi) a rational institutional organization; (iii) good capacity       economic
             and (iv) a commitment to develop budgeting              on a multiyear results-based approach.
The country has a sol id and well-structured legal framework,                  in the Constitution and the
transcription in national law of WAEMU               on      budgetary and             framework--Organic
Law on the Budget            Decree on Government Accounting, the Budget Nomenclature,             Chart of
            and                Code. This            new             Directives, approved in June 2009 by
member countries, including Senegal, point to          direction of a needed modernization of this legal
framework. The institutional framework is also broadly                        is a clear role         to the
Minister of Economy and Finance in the area of budget preparation and execution, to Parliament responsible
for approving budget laws, and to an Audit Office            CompIes, CC)     external control.
3.              A strong point in budget preparation is the general reliability of revenue forecasts,
notwithstanding the inherent complexity of assessing revenue prospects in a highly uncertain context,
as has been the case in recent years. Nonetheless, the links between forecasts, the macroeconomic
framework, and new measures should be strengthened, especially with the recent                  in the        cost
of tax incentives for private investment. In view of this, the authorities intend to conduct a complete review
of tax                        (that  the          cost of           departures from general tax        proVISions,
including tax incentives, exemptions or exclusions, whether statutory or discretionary) to obtain a
...",.........'" of the overall cost     tax provisions,      impact on the economy, and their alignment
government's economic and social objectives, thereby also enhancing transparency in the use--even
implicit--of public resources. Going forward,                     should      enable    government to assess the
relevance of maintaining such exemptions in          tax policy framework.
4.      Budget preparation modalities have a number of weaknesses that have a negative impact on
budget quality and execution. On the expenditure                         on expenditure             undennine
the credibility of the budget and complicate budget              Poor expenditure              often create the
need      many subsequent adjustments through shifts and line transfers of budget appropriations, and may
result             overruns, as well as cash flow problems. To address these                    a new
preparation          was        in February 2009. This decree has introduced greater rigor and realism in
respect of the budget preparation timetable, with a budget ceilings circular sent to the spending ministries at
an earlier       of                                             The          also            the quality of
Parliamentary budget debate-the Government must present by early July a report on recent economic and
public finance developments, including a medium-term evaluation of                 State's resources and the
composition of the budgets on broad functional lines. Additional measures must be taken to improve these
           in particular by                           techniques       revIsing            funding, estimated
appropriations, personnel expenditure, and unforeseen expenditure. As part of an overall effort to improve
ex ante budget planning,      Parliament should         be     to     on technical advice, including from
Audit Office with respect to     initial draft budget laws and amended or supplemental budget laws, and the
Audit        should    able to voice its opinion on              with budgetary principles and the accuracy
                          draft laws are submitted to      National Assembly.
5.            implementation of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) has only yielded
limited gains so        Assessing public policies is made more difficult by a budgeting methodology based
largely on resources, by               of an appropriate program-based budget classification             and by
weaknesses in the                            debate that could easily be improved. The Senegalese authorities
have made major efforts in recent           to modernize budget law programming             preparation. These
                   aimed primarily at evolving from a                 inspired by budget forecasting principles
based on agencies' resources toward expenditure frameworks in a multiyear context. MTEFs were prepared
in twelve            in        of          sectors.            at     current stage, MTEFs of sector ministries
are mere annexes to the budget law, having limited force in budget debates, approval seeking by Parliament
and             on            The           of budget              through a program budget approach with a
legal basis is an ambitious project that will require, among other things, a new organic law on budget laws,
and a strengthening of the          responsible       preparing MTEFs to ensure that they fully master this
budgeting technique.          will be needed to mainstream a performance-based budgeting approach-
currently, only a      departments in the Administration operate under                    performance contracts
and annual performance                 An                         covering       entire budget, should also be
improved over time.
6.       The budgetary slippages in 2008 exposed weaknesses in budget execution procedures. First,
      was an overly broad and frequent recourse to simplified expenditure payment procedures ("treasury
advances"), normally reserved       emergencies.       response, the              adopted revised             that
now prohibit "treasury advances", and strictly confine derogatory expenditure procedures to the cases
            by the               (a            list of                or special cases)--regulations which
effectively restored the standard expenditure procedures. Second, the principle of circumscribing budget
execution operations strictly within                                was found not to be strictly followed, with
budget operations taking place well after the end of the budget year,         large carry-overs from year to year.
In response,                          by decree in early 2009 the budget-closing schedule, and           a decree
by      February 2009 that strictly limits carry-overs to no more than 5 percent current year appropriations,
with residual carry-overs applied             (and substituting for) current year appropriations. While these
essentially regulatory measures were critical               palliatives to improve         execution     enhance
   transparency, the                        aware that a coherent platform of reforms is needed to address
fundamental sources of                 in this area, including by, inter       0) considerably improving budget
preparation           and methodologies, and a more                 integration of medium-term planning lU"""-
from sector policies to sector program budgets-with annual budget                          (ii) moving to a more
forceful               the responsibility for budget execution to sector ministries; and (iii) a full roll-out of
the two public financial management                SIGFIP and ASTER, both horizontally, across Ministries and
regIonal departments,      vertically, by interfacing     budget and treasury systems.

7.      The Senegalese government vests           execution of a significant part of       public investment
program to a number of autonomous public sector agencies and specialized funds to which it transfers
an increasing fraction of        investment budget,33 leaving mainly         and             functions in
ministries.           receive budget transfers but enjoy relative management autonomy, the legal nature of
which                      in the statutes.     principal agencies are     Road Works                      the
Private Investment and Major Works Promotion Agency (APIX), the Agency for the Organization of the
Islamic              Summit (ANOCI}-an agency in                  implementing infrastructure projects related
to the organization of the OIC Summit-and the State Property Construction and Rehabilitation Program
                   nUag(!ml"Y information on individual           remains limited. It is however      that
            agencies has increased in recent years, and they account            a growing proportion of the
investment budget               In 2009, more than SO                   were identified of which     received
budget allocations from the central government in the period 2007-2009. Nowadays, roughly one quarter of
the investment         (or about 2 percent ofGDP) is           by
8.      As a result, the principle of budget comprehensiveness has been weakened in recent years.
While a separation of policy and implementation         undeniable advantages, it should be accompanied by a
strong monitoring, accountability and control apparatus of the management of public resources by these
           Currently, their budgets and budget execution plans are only weakly monitored, and the Finance
           not fully        budget plans. A law and implementing decrees have                  to

strengthen the monitoring of              budget preparation and             and these
quarterly budget execution statements and             accounts to the Ministry.
9.       With the roll-out of the budget preparation and execution system now well advanced, the
authorities intend to shift their focus on                the computer systems infrastructure by installing
and operating a more powerful accounting system. The computerized budget management system
(SIGFIP}-similar to the             used in Benin and Cote d'Ivoire-has already proven           usefulness in
Senegal. At the present stage, however, the computerization of the budget and accounting system has not
yielded all its potential                 increased transparency       controllability of the budget, in part
because of delays in completing       upgrading of       accounting computer system and the development
             tools     budget and                          The obsolescence     the             tool used for
accounting has hampered the capacity to produce timely and reliable information        budget payments, cash
flow management         budget          as well as the production of             public accounts. The current
IT application at Treasury is rudimentary and outdated.        Treasury does not have a networked IT system
                                          applications are not                                    of       and
making it extremely difficult to reconcile budgetary operations between       Budget and
       the                         with difficulty to provide         information on

          their       of              and                government                To start addressing these
weaknesses, the authorities intend to implement the ASTER accounting system, beginning with 2009 budget
                 to       detailed                   produced by the new             As a          policy, the
authorities have also committed to more regularly disseminate information on budget execution to the public.
10.    There remain significant weaknesses in the management of the public wage bill. Lingering
weaknesses have been identified in multiple diagnoses and in particular the 2007              quality of
management of the wage bill was        D +. In the action plan adopted in October 2009 to aQ(]re~;s

11.      Tbe tools for strategic management of pnblic assets, particularly State land property, are only
partially developed. The legal                   is critically outdated-some of                texts having not
updated in more than         decades. The current system does not require transparent competitive procedures
for sales of        property. Modem information                on land assets and transactions, maintenance,
and purchase operations, as well as collection of real estate revenue are in practice inexistent. A basic
inventory      state property in developed or undeveloped land remains to be                  out, at a time when
property in the Dakar area, where the State reportedly owns a broad land and real estate portfolio, has gained
considerably in market value-the 500         of the current airport, slated to be                    in a few years
when the new airport will have been built well outside Dakar, would currently fetch about US$2 billion at
current       estate        in Dakar. In this context and taking          account the considerable impact         a
modem         transparent management        state property could have on public resources, the Authorities are
planning to modernize their          institutional and operational land                  apparatus.         General
Tax Directorate             MEF intends to develop a new framework for                  State         to
the legislative and regulatory missions in this area; to improve and make fully transparent and market-based
standard procedures for acquisition, management              disposal of state             to         the       for
establishing       basis and control of State                 fees     to
revenues of any kind.
12.       Tbe financing pressures tbat emerged on tbe treasury of tbe State in tbe tbird quarter of 2008,
bave revealed weaknesses in casb and financing management, witb tbe inability to finance public
expenditures in a context of tigbt bank lending and a lack of alternative public resources. During these
episodes, the monetary               were not in a position to intervene to lend liquidity to    public treasury
in such context, even if                 were only temporary.34 More generally,                phase out in 2000
central bank direct Treasury financing                  BCEAO's statutory advance facility, the short-term
financing and cash management arm of the Treasury has not been developed on par               overall budget and
cash flow                    As a result, temporary cash                  need to     met by altering on short
frequencies of weeks or months the rhythm of budget execution at either                commitment or payment
stag:e!s--a practice that among other                 undermine the quality of                         would
inconsistent with effective responsibility by sector Ministries in the execution of their policies and budgets.
To address this             the MEF intends to create a new entity responsible for        and debt
to appoint and train financial management specialists and to develop modern strategies and instruments for
tapping the regional money market. The strategy will aim at                       following four objectives: (i)
managing the State's debt and cash positions in the best interest of taxpayers and under the most secure
conditions; (ij) ensure liquidity in    Treasury's                 (iii) developing innovative tools to improve
cash management and to maintain security; (iv) managing the risks inherent in financial transactions.
13.     Tbe Constitution of 1999 provides for an Audit Office tbat bas been functional since 2001. The
Audit Office's mandate is to pass judgment on the accounts the public accountants, ensure the auditing of
accounts and of the                  of public                                    the Parliament       the
Government in controlling budget law execution, and conduct all manner     studies on the public finances
and the government accounts. Until              however, its            had        hampered by delays in
examining public accounts. The authorities have committed to speed up the transmission of budget
execution laws and public accounts to       Audit        At the same      while the     filing of accounts
by the Treasury was one reason for limited effectiveness, there is also a           improve the technical
capacity of the Audit Office staff, for which     assistance     been                 the               of


34The accumulation of arrears over 2008 mainly revealed a distinct problem,       that of executing          annual
budget envelopes in line with predictably available annual resources and of coping with fundamental imbalances
between the former and the       but the short-term cash management issues were exacerbated in this context.

 subject to the ex post control of the Audit Office under            procedure of "jugement des
 cornerstone of francophone PFM systems. The                 entails         monetary liability by accountants

 francophone                       neither       individual accounts been              last audit of two of the
 largest accounts, that of the           Payor's         and     the General Revenue Office covered the 1998
 accounts-, nor has the liability system been enforced.
 14.    Tbe Government of Senegal bas been pnrsuing a program of public financial management
 reforms         the early 2000s. The mobilization of the Ministry of Economy and                (MEF) around
 the modernization      the public financial management system has made it possible to make substantial
          with        support of the technical and financial               including the World Bank. This
 modernization of public finance management constitutes the cornerstone for successful efforts to implement
     poverty                    (PRSP II) and is an essential               in the dialogue with        on the
 management of external assistance in the spirit of the Paris Declaration. The modernization of public finance
              is       an            plank of      current             program supported by the International
 Monetary Fund (IMF) within the framework of the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) approved in November
 2007.
 15.      To move more forcefully on these issues, the       has built an overall action plan adopted in
 October 2009. The PFM action plan is a comprehensive attempt by the authorities. to                  the
 weaknesses of       PFM system. Its 115            reforms, actions and capacity upgrading span the full
 array PMF issues mentioned above, under an exhaustive, time-bound and sequenced program, drawing on
 self-assessment and recommendations from development partners, including the             Union, the IMF
 and     Bank.
  1        Moreover, since tbe adoption oftbis Action Plan, Senegal bas undertaken to modernize furtber
. its budget framework witbin tbe context of new WAEMU Directives adopted in June 2009. Through
  the adoption the new               directives,                  to address some                     of
        new budget framework will incorporate modem PFM concepts and techniques such as program
  budgeting, medium-term budgets and expenditure                          (MTBFIMTEF),               accounting,
  delegation of the Minister of Finance's power to authorize payments ("ordonnancemenf') to other Ministers,
  and a            single account          whose                      account is at the central bank. This new
  framework also addresses other issues considered as core weaknesses, such as (i) the strict limitations on
  carry-over of           appropriations--only                spending is eligible for carry-over and then under
  specific defined conditions; (ii) the strict limitation.            "estimated" appropriations-"estimated"
  appropriations can be             without parliamentary approval; henceforth, only appropriations for
  service payments will be "estimated" appropriations and all other appropriations will be cash-constrained so
  that the        in annual budget laws will constitute binding caps on budget appropriations that can be
  committed and spent; (iii) the strict limitation of the complementary period, to one month, exclusively
  n"'fAY"" to accounting adjustments; (iv) the classification of medium- and             borrowing, privatization
  receipts and reimbursement of loans and advances as financing items in the budget law; and (v) the approval
  of MTBFslMTEFs by the Government

 17.     Building on tbe findings and recommendations from several recent assessments of its public
 procurement system, the Government made substantial progress towards tbe modernization of tbe
 National Procurement System (NPS). The quality of           new public procurement system got a score of
 2.46 out of a              score of 3             to the 2008 OECDIDAC assessment. The procurement
 regulatory and institutional framework and capacity management have been considerably improved. The
 efficiency of procurement transactions has been strengthened at   level   contracting authorities. Internal

and external controls of procurement transactions do exist and contribute to uphold the integrity of the
system. The goal of the Authorities is to move towards a sound NPS in which procurement transactions
comply with the procurement legal framework and are efficient. Substantial financial and technical support
from the Bank and other donors for setting up a modernized NPS have led to positive changes.
18.    The Government's efforts, with substantial financial and technical support from the Bank and
other donors towards setting up a modernized NPS, have led to positive changes:
·  The procurement regulatory and institutional framework and capacity management have been
   considerably improved. Several additional key implementing regulations and NSBDs drafted on the
   basis of the Bank's standard bidding documents has been adopted and used. The Public Procurement
   Regulatory Authority (ARMP), an autonomous, independent and tripartite 35 structure, is now fully
   operational and responsible for policy, handling complaints from bidders, carrying out independent
   audits and designing national capacity development strategy. To ensure appropriate and reliable
                                                                                                        36
   collection and monitoring of procurement statistics and the dissemination of procurement information ,
   the Government has set up an integrated procurement information and management system (SIGMAP)
                                                                                38
   which includes an open-access website. 37 This system is being connected to the SIGFIP/ASTER in
   order to increase the integration of the public procurement into the national public finance management
   system. The newly adopted strategy for capacity development in public procurement enabled to get
   training materials, a roster of trainers (50 people).
·  The efficiency of procurement transactions has been strengthened at the level of contracting
   authorities. In accordance with the regulatory framework, procurement transactions have been
   delegated to Technical Departments of contracting authorities, and are supervised by a procurement unit
   to ensure quality, safekeeping of records and contracts documents. This institutional organization aims at
   preparing/facilitating the increase of procurement competence and responsibilities among the
   government officials. Several public procurement training workshops are ongoing across the country, on
   a demand basis, to strengthen the capacity of people involved in procurement transactions to understand
   the rules and regulations and how they should be implemented. More than 650 people have been trained
   in procurement from different sectors (administration, private sector and civil society). The ARMP is
   also entrusted with oversight functions for Public & Private Partnership (PPP) contracts, such as
   concession contracts or private-public joint ventures for the provision of goods, works and consulting
   services. In this context, civil society participation in the ARMP was instrumental in convincing the
   authorities to revise the procurement method for an Independent Power Producer contract for a coal
   powered station in late 2008 that they had originally planned to grant on a sole-source basis in an amount
   of $US200 million.
·  Internal and external controls of procurement transactions do exist and contribute to uphold the
   integrity of the system. The current procurement system in the country operates with internal controls
   to ensure implementation of procurement procedures in compliance with the legal and regulatory
   framework. In addition to regula~9 external controls carried out by the ARMP, a National Procurement
   Department (DeMP) has been set up to ensure appropriate internal controls of procurement transactions

35 The Regulatory Council of the ARMP is composed of representatives from the private sector and civil society, in 

addition to those from civil services.

Component 1. Private Sector Development.

L         A planned Economic Governance Project will provide focused assistance that fosters an improved

improve economic governance through the following actions: (a) strengthening the Cellule d'Execution
Administrative et               (CENTlF); (b)              the Public Procurement Investigation Unit, and (c)
fostering business-led actions against corruption. Project design benefited from lessons learned in the
implementation        two World Bank investment operations in               that supported investment
reform and institution building-the Private Investment Promotion Project (Credit 3762 SE) and the Private
Sector Adjustment Credit (Credit SE                                      two projects         that investment
climate reform is interactive and requires strong champions and consensus building. Project preparation also
benefited          WBl's knowledge                 good practices and international experience in economic
governance, in line with the World Bank's governance and anticorruption (GAC) strategy. Finally, the
Project also builds on the 2006 Report on the                   of              and        (ROSC) Corporate
Governance Country Assessment, Senegal, which was drafted following wide-ranging consultation. In the
areas      small       medium           taxation and            trade, the collaborative development by the

National Education Development Program, including the Quality Education for All APL 2 (P089254), and a
successor              program to support construction and rehabilitation of             classrooms, also
funded under the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund (US$81.5 million, FY09-11), and several trust funds (see CPSPR).
Additional analytical inputs in the preparation of       were provided under the Education component

3.      Health and Nutrition. Bank support to the Government's health sector program has included
support through the            ofPRSC (PRSC I, II and III),      HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control project,
and several technical assistance projects, including a Hospital Reform TA and a T A to support the MoH's

characteristics. Finally, the PRSC-supported analytical program will seek to (i) determine the efficacy of
different targeting mechanisms; and (ii) map out and assess existing         safety nets programs under
social safety nets component of      PPFR, including beneficiary          assessments. Additional analytical
underpinnings to this component of the PRSC program include donor-supported analytical work on social

Environmental Sustainability

5.           Fisheries. In the          sector, the World Bank is      supporting       investment in the reform
                     sector in         First, the Bank is supporting a $10 million IDA credit for fisheries in the
~ .· ,~,.,.~.~,~ Coastal and Marine Resource Management (GJRMaC) project and $9.5 million in IDA credits and
         grants through the Sustainable Management ofFish Resources (GDRH) project. These two projects are
          jointly implemented, with the GlRMaC beginning in 2005 and                  until the end of II, and
the GDRH starting in 2010 and continuing until the end of 2012.

6.       The objective of both projects is to empower communities to reduce fishing pressure on the fish
stocks supporting the          coastal           of Senegal, with     area serving as a pilot
reform throughout the country. The two projects are supporting        establishment of government partnerships
with 12 coastal                in this region to more sustainably          the central coastal demersal fisheries
                              both private community fishers management groups and public-private multi-
community local artisanal               councils, in              with a pilot fund to help support
livelihoods to fishing by providing micro-finance and technical                to fishers. At the national level,
       two projects are supporting the development          two national fisheries                plans, and the
introduction of a national fishing vessel registration program.

7.       Building on the pilot introduced by these two projects in the central coastal fisheries,       Board of
IDA recently approved the West Africa                                     (W ARFP).         regional multi-phase·
APL is providing $15 million in IDA credits to Senegal from 2010 to the end of 20 14, in order to (i) expand
to the        country              coastal pilots of                                                 community
fishing groups and public-private mUlti-community local artisanal fisheries councils, together with the
alternative livelihoods fund),·        the size of       industrial fishing fleet targeting the coastal demersal
fisheries by decommissioning a number of vessels, strengthen fisheries surveillance capacity to reduce illegal
fishing in                 and support the introduction of new fish landing site clusters to                local
value-added to        products. Through the GDRH              subsequently       WARPF, the World Bank will
finance              in a mechanism,       alternative livelihoods fund, to help provide a social         net for
those fishers negatively impacted by restrictions on access to the fish resources.

8.      Analytical material underpinning                                projects          proposed PRSC
support are based on          analytical      of work, including (a) a 2005 formal economic and sector
work (ESW) on the fisheries sector in Senegal; (b) a 2007       of grey literature prepared as part of the
appraisal of the GDRH project; (c) a 2008/2009          grey          prepared as part        appraisal of
the WARFP in            (including an economic model of the coastal demersal fisheries, and a summary of

9.       Coastal erosion.         collaborative development by the Government, the Bank and donor
of the analytical       for policy development and implementation is built into the design of the        series.
The WB will support the                     efforts in climate       adaptation, and disaster risk reduction,
            coastal           which is a key natural - and economic -- risk faced by Senegal. Given the
economic importance of the country's coastal zone, a particular attention will           in the            CPS
to its sustainable development and management, including protection against coastal erosion and long-term
adaptation to climate change. An economic study will be           out to                  level ofvulnerability
of            assets at risk, using a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) approach to inform decision-makers and
investors and improve            investments, and make a case    the most            use of available as well as
additional funding for protection and adaptation measures.

 10.    Forest Resource Mauagement The Bank has a long-standing program to support the development
of community-managed forests. Starting in 1998, the government            support from the       to launch
a project (Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project) whose        objective was to meet an
important part of the rapidly growing urban demand for household fuels without     loss of      cover and
the                                             and biodiversity. The funding of a first operation which
ended in December 2004 was US$20 million, followed by a successor operation in a transition phase ending
December 2008        US$7.2 million. A successor operation is      contemplated as part of the preparation
of the upcoming CPS.

Component 4: Governance

11.      Public Financial Management. PFM                  have been supported under the first      of
and the agenda presented in this operation builds on these efforts. The preparation of the proposed PRSC
       relied on extensive core diagnostic assessments by other donors or the World Bank in collaboration
with the government in the PFM area. They include past Public Expenditure Reviews (2005 and 2006), the
2002 CF AA and         2003 CPAR which document fiscal policy            as well as the numerous
PFM, and provide a range of recommendations on the legal framework and operational
including                  PFM           on which      proposed operation has drawn extensively. In addition,
    design of PFM reforms in the proposed operation also relied heavily on         EU-funded        diagnostic
of2007, an IMF                    Department Technical              report on public financial management that

areas     land property                 integrated financial management             and wage bill
An extensive review of emerging PFM issues is also planned to be a component of the PPFR. This material
will form       basis of the design of a technical            and capacity building operation developed within
the framework of the Economic Governance Project                            1 above). Donors have

12.      Public Procurement. The Bank has a long-standing program        support to                reforms in
Senegal, including with capacity building under the          Investment Promotion Project and the planned
                       project. Analytical         underpinning the design of the          series in this area
drew the 2003 CPAR that initiated an in-depth            for improving transparency and efficiency of the
national             system (NPS). The CPAR identified several                            (i) inconsistencies
           of procurement documentation at the level of the           and regulatory framework; (ii) non
transparent procurement methods and procedures leading to abusive use of sale source method
public contracts and unjustified derogatory             several public            (iii) weak and
internal and external controls mechanisms (for prior reviews, audits, complaints) and (iv) inefficient
measures to prevent and detect fraud and corruption in public procurement. More recently, in the context of

a Use of Country Systems program, the Bank team carried out a comprehensive assessment was under
2008                methodology.         assessment concluded that persisting        remain to     dealt     in
order to benefit from the new procurement legal and regulatory framework. The key                 raised are as
follows: (i) lack of procurement documentation and National Standard Bidding Documents (NSBDs); (ii)
delay in          fully operational the new institutional framework for respectively regulating and controlling
procurement transactions; (iii) non-functional                and tools    integrating procurement into public
                                 (PFM),               and                         and            effective and
sustainable procurement capacity development; and (iv) persistence of weak internal and external controls of
              transactions.

13.     Debt management. The authorities' debt management    agenda benefited from a recent
led Senegal Debt Management Perfonnance Assessment (DeMPA). The assessment identified strengths
weaknesses in debt management mentioned in paragraphs above.

14.     Statistics. The Bank is supporting the design of the 2010 Household Survey and has a long-standing
collaboration with                       including in          building and survey            collaborative

Agriculture
3.        Agriculture remains, if no longer a major source of accelerated growth, the bedrock for
            economic and social development
 """,II .. "",v<>                                               With                    in GDP now at only
7 percent, growth arithmetic is not favorable to the notion that Senegal can succeed in an agriculture-led

an estimated population of close to 12 million, 58 percent live in rural areas, and the livelihood of an
estimated 70 percent of them is        based on                    sector is        dominated by smallholder
producers engaged in rain-fed farming and extensive animal husbandry. Constraints to productivity growth,
diversification and intensification          limited access to knowledge, inputs and working capital,
fertility degradation, decreasing quality of       stock and inadequate responses from agricultural services.
Water        remains a deep constraint to productivity: although        to 20 percent   total land is arable-
about 3.8 million hectares (ha) in the country's total area of about 20 million ha-, only a small fraction has
                                 water (400,000 ha,         10 percent arable land).
4.     Promoting a modern and diversified agriculture sector remains a priority for the authorities.
The Government and donors have a longstanding partnership to advance agricultural                    and rural
development in Senegal. A 2006 Government              of Agriculture Sector Policy defines the institutional
