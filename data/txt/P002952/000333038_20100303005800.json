"Ratings for the Northern Uganda Social\n            Action Fund (NUSAF) Project for Uganda were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: transparency and accountability\n            can be a challenge in hard-to-reach areas. However,\n            participatory involvement of communities in sub-project\n            management, public sharing of expenditures at the local\n            level and follow-up on misuse of funds resulted in improved\n            accountability and transparency. NUSAF 2 aims to further\n            strengthen bottom-up accountability through the TAAC\n            (transparency, accountability, and anti-corruption)\n            subcomponent. One of the key lessons from this project is\n            the challenge of targeting transient/nomadic communities.\n            For this reason, and with the exception of subprojects that\n            were implemented through the missionary Non-Governmental\n            Organizations (NGOs), the Karamoja sub-region remained a\n            challenge throughout the life of the project. Placement of\n            the executing agency under the Office of the Prime Minister\n            (OPM) made difficult decision-making processes possible,\n            allowed for mediation between local governments, and\n            facilitated the flexible approach to project implementation.\n            For instance, the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP)\n            randomized experimental design is likely to deliver robust\n            lessons that can be used in other regions with similar youth\n            unemployment challenges."}, "docdt": "2009-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
