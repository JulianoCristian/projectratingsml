The project\n            consists of four components. The community demand initiative\n            component will support community-driven initiatives that\n            improve the accessibility to and the delivery of small-scale\n            socio-economic services and enhance the capacity of\n            communities and other stakeholders involved in the process.\n            The vulnerable group support component will identify the\n            vulnerable groups and Civil Society Organizations,\n            nongovernmental organizations, and private sector agencies\n            in order to develop strategies likely to contribute to their\n            poverty alleviation. The third component will provide\n            support and encourage communities to identify innovative\n            ways for community reconciliation and conflict management\n            using traditional and non-traditional approaches, base on\n            indigenous knowledge, the way communities have in the past\n            managed conflict so that it has not led to open warfare, and\n            helping communities reclaim this knowledge for use in\n            modern-day living in Uganda. The institutional development\n            component will support training and capacity building for\n            different sets of stakeholders. It will also support\n            activities to inform and educate the concerned stakeholders\n            on the project objectives, processes an"}, "docdt": "2002-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
