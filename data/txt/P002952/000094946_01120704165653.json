consisted of screening to determine if the project hah\n            significant impacts. Because this project was determined not\n            to have the potential to have significant environmental\n            impacts, it is excluded from further environmental impact\n            assessment. However, this report contains recommendations to\n            the developer for sound environmental management of the\n            project, as is customary for projects in this category. As\n            this project is classified as a Financial Intermediary\n            Project (FI), any activites which might violate World Bank\n            safeguard policies have to be identified. Accordingly, what\n            follows is a summation of an analysis of relevant safeguard\n            policies: This project will put in place in place and EA\n            framework for the sub-projects cycle to ensure environmental\n            awareness and compliance. Subprojects supporting protection\n            and maintenance of natural habitats will be funded. Possible\n            subprojects might address pest control and rodent extinction\n            for sanitary reasons. DDT can potentially be procured, e.g.,\n            for malaria vector control. Cumulative effects of\n            deforestation due to brick-burning, charcoal-making, and\n            cultivation will be prevented or mitigated. The preservation\n            of cultural property may be safeguard relevant to this project."}, "docdt": "2001-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
