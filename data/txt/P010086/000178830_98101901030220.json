The\n            International Development Association (IDA) was successful\n            in strengthening NDFC's appraisal, supervision and\n            economic analysis procedures. IDA's performance in\n            getting NDFC to increase long-term loans was not as\n            successful as expected, mainly due to the structural\n            disincentive in term lending. IDA's objective of\n            assisting NDFC to develop into a sound financial institution\n            capable of mobilizing domestic resources has been met as\n            NDFC has emerged as a mixed bank, which is highly regarded\n            by its clients, the financial community and the Government\n            of Pakistan (GOP) IDA also expected NDFC to play a key\n            developmental role in carrying out studies, collecting data\n            on public sector enterprises and formulating policies\n            affecting the public manufacturing sector for GOP. However,\n            NDFC was less successful in meeting these objectives due to\n            resources constraints and the rapidly changing\n            socio-political factors during the implementation period.\n            With the benefits of hindsight, these objectives were\n            relatively ambitious given the \"infant\" status of\n            NDFC at the time of the credit and unforeseen domestic\n            changes in GOP policies. NDFC's management has\n            responded well to the changes in environment and has built\n            this project into a viable financial institution."}, "docdt": "1983-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
