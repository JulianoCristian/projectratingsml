APPRAISAL OF THE
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC) was established
as a mixed bank in January 1973 to provide financial assistance, both short
and long term, in both foreign and local currencies, to undertakings which
were wholly or partly owned by the Federal Government, which had been taken
over and managed by the Government undrer the Economic Reforms Order of 1972,
or had been declared by the Government to be an eligible enterprise. NDFC
began lending operations in July 1973.
ii.       The manufacturing sector has recovered substantially from the
serious production difficulties it experienced in FY71 and FY72 registering
a growth of 11.8% in FY73 and 6.8% in FY74, and now represents approxi-
mately 15% of GNP. Up until 1972, new industrial investment was predomi-
nantly in the private sector (90%). However, the new Government which came
to power in 1971 advocated the establishment of a mixed economy operated on
a sound commercial basis in the industrial sector.  Consequently, it took
over management control of 31 units in ten basic industries which were sub-
sequently nationalized as were the vegetable ghee and shipping industries.
It is estimated that the pdblic industrial sector now accounts for 25% of
total industrial assets.
iii.      As a result of the nationalizations, a reorganization of the
public sector took place in 1973 with the establishment of 12 Sector Cor-
porations for specific industries encompassing about 40% by number of all
public sector units. A Board of Industrial Management (BIM) had previously
been established to provide managerial guidance to public sector units
through reviews of budgets, control of most capital expenditures, and
appointment of key personnel.
iv.       Though it is difficult to isolate the performance of the public
sector over the past three years from the effects of exogenous factors,
nevertheless, substantial improvements in such units have been recorded
in the areas of production, capacity utilization and sales, profitability,
export performance, and in managerial efficiency, particularly in the
taken-over units.
v.        Historically, the long-term financing of public sector industry
has been undertakeg through appropriations of Government funds from the
Annual Development Plan largely channelled through the Pakistan Industrial
Development Corporation, which has since become one of the 12 Sector Cor-
porations.



- ii -
vi.       NDFC was established as a 100% Government-owned development bank
with an authorized share capital of Rs 100 million which has since been
fully paid in. It has a six-man Board of Directors including an Executive
Chairman who are all appointed by the Government. The Chairman, who has
been with NDFC since it began operations, is an experienced banker having
spent most of his career with the First National City Bank. NDFC had 20
professional staff as of September 30, 1974 who have been carefully recruited
over the past eighteen months.
vii.      NDFC has succeeded in mobilizing Rs 154 million in deposits, both
short and long term, in addition to its share capital, to provide the basis
for its local currency. lending. In the case of foreign exchange, about
Rs 30 million has been allocated by Government to NDFC's local currency
borrowers, of which only Rs 0.7 million has been disbursed.
viii.     As of September 30, 1974, NDFC had approved Rs 362.9 million for
loans to 53 projects (of which Rs 104 million and 26 projects represented
working capital financing). Cumulative disbursements totalled Rs 120.7
million as of the same date. NDFC has, for the most part, financed the
more advanced technological industries, and its appraisal standards have
been reasonable.
ix.       Though NDFC is a 100% Government-owned institution, it has none-
theless demonstrated its independence through its rejection of 18% by number
of all public sector investment applications. At the same time, it is ex-
pected that NDFC will become an important repository of detailed informa-
tion on individual operating units in the industrial public sector which
would place it in an advantageous position to provide industrial policy
advice to the Government.
x.        NDFC's financial position is sound.  For the first nine months
of 1974, it has earned a net profit of Rs 7.9 million (on share capital
of Rs 100 million) while the total debt/equity ratio was 0.4:1, with debt
service coverage of 4.8:1. A contractual long-term debt/equity ratio
limit of 5:1 is recommended. NDFC's accounts have been audited by two of
the top auditing firms in Pakistan without qualification.
xi.       The Draft Five-Year Plan anticipates a growth rate of 15% per
annum in total industrial output. About 67% of industrial investment is
expected to be in the public sector including a few extremely large projects
such as the Karachi Steel Mill. On the basis of NDFC's fotecasts, it will
finance about 14% of total public industrial investment on a disbursement
basis concentrated mainly in the areas of chemicals, cement, automotive
assembly, steel and engineering, energy and agro-industries.
xii.      NDFC's total foreign currency requirements for the two-year
period beginning April 1, 1975 are expected to be about $60 million. It
is recommended that an IDA Credit be made to NDFC of $30 million to meet
a maximum of about 50% of its requirements on terms similar to those of



- iii -
recent IDA Credits to development-finance companies. The balance will
probably be met by borrowings from OPEC countries and the Asian Develop-
ment Bank. A free limit of $1 million is recommended.

APPRAISAL OF THE
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Pakistan has requested an IDA Credit to be lent
to the newly established National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC)
to assist in financing industrial enterprises in Pakistan which have govern-
ment equity participation.
1.02      The Bank Group has until now financed two industrial development
banks in Pakistan; (i) the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corpo-
ration (PICIC) which has received eight direct loans since 1957 totalling .
$185 million and an administered loani of $25 million, all of which were re-
stricted to the private industrial sector, and (ii) the Industrial Develop-
ment Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) which received an IDA Credit of $20 million in
1970 to be used for medium and small scale units primarily in the private
sector.
II. ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
Economic Environment
2.01      An assessment of Pakistan's present economic position is con-
tained in the Bank's latest Economic Report No. 658a-PAK, dated March 28,
1975. The Pakistan economy has recovered significantly from the disas-
trous events of FY71 and FY72 caused by the war in the former East Pakistan
as well as severe droughts resulting in no growth. In FY73, GDP grew by
7.3% and is estimated to have grown by 5.0% in FY74, despite the severe
floods in August 1973 which caused considerable damage to agricultural
production. Agriculture continues to represent the largest sector of GDP
(36%) compared to manufacturing (15%).
2.02      However, Pakistan's balance of payments position deteriorated in
FY74j/ after the strong performance in FY73 when foreign exchange reserves
grew from $171 million to $463 million, as the country experienced its
first balance of trade surplus in 21 years spurred on by the rupee deval-
uation and a successful effort in the redirecting of its markets away from
the former East Pakistan. The cause of the deterioration in FY74 were (a)
the flood which caused a loss of agricultural production for export (cotton)
and increased import requirements for wheat and vegetable oil (b) the gen-
eral rapid increase in prices of foreign equipment and (c) the impact of
the increase in oil prices in 1973 which increased the import bill from
1/   The current account deficit for 1973/74 is estimated to be about
$566 million.



- 2 -
$60 million in FY73 (7.4% of total imports) to $385 million in FY74. Over
the past five years, the composition of exports has changed significantly
with the share of manufactured exports increasing from 59% to 69%. Export
performance should improve again in FY75.
2.03      An additional problem facing Pakistan over the past few years has
been inflation. The consumer price index (CPI) increased by 26.5% from June
1973 to March 1974. The inflation has been caused by excessive domestic
monetary expansion in FY72, large increases in import prices, and the August
1973 floods which forced up the prices of essential domestic commodities.  In
order to stem the rate, the Government in August 1973 increased the Bank rate
from 6% to 8% and increased the liquidity ratios of commercial banks from
30%-35%, as well as adopting a variety of other fiscal measures.  This had
some success as the CPI increased by only 2.7% between December 1973 and
March 1974. However, the wholesale price index increased by 14.3% in the
first half of FY75 (July-December) compared to the same period in FY74. The
Bank rate was further increased to 9% on September 3, 1974.
Industrial Sector
2.04      Recent Performance.  The manufacturing sector suffered a major
setback in FY71 and FY72, after having enjoyed growth rates in excess of
10% per annum during the sixties. Manufacturing production increased by
only 1.1% in FY71 and then fell by 9.3% in FY72 (Annex 1). However, the
impact of the devaluation of the rupee, the import liberalization policy,
improvements in labor/management relations, better utilization of existing
capacity and the rapid adjustment to the loss of the East Pakistan market
resulted in a growth in manufacturing production of 11.8% in FY73. In
FY74, the growth rate was 6.8%, the drop reflecting the high price and
lack of availability of certain raw materials, a softening in demand in
the export market, the impact of the floods, and the low levels of invest-
ment in the private sector (para 2.07).
2.05      Structure.  The manufacturing sector represents 15.5% of GNP of
which 12.2% represents medium and large scale industry (firms with more
than 10 employees) with the balance in the small scale sector. The former
grew at a rate of almost 8% in FY74 compared to 2.7% for small scale indus-
try. 1/ Total industrial employment is estimated to be slightly less than
1 million, or 5% of the labor force.
2.06      The sectoral distribution of industry reflects'the importance of
agro-based industries. The textile sector accounted for 32.3% of value
added in FY70, 2/ followed by food and beverages (15.4%), non-metallic
mineral products (12.3%) and chemicals (8.9%) (Annex 2). -Consumer goods
represented 62.7% of industrial value added, followed by intermediate
goods (36.4%) and capital goods (0.9%). Nearly 50% of Pakistan's indus-
trial labor force is engaged in textiles. The geographic distribution of

due to a lack of reliable data.

the industrial sector is also quite uneven with nearly 50% of industrial
output in Sind, 40% in the Punjab, while only 10% in NWFP and 1% in Balu-
chistan, despite the Government's incentives to promote industries in:
backward areas.
2.07      Investment.  For the period 1962-1972, private investment repre-
sented almost 90% of total industrial investment in the country (Annex 3).
Total industrial investment declined from Rs 1.5 billion (current prices)
in FY71 to Rs 1.15 billion in both FY73 and FY74. The decline was accounted
for entirely by a significant decrease in total private industrial invest-
ment from Rs 1.4 billion to Rs 0.7 billion over the same period. The fall
was caused primarily by a lack of investor confidence given the recent
nationalization of large-scale firms (small scale private industrial invest-
ment continued to experience a significant growth during this period), and
the existing levels of unutilized capacity in many industries. The latter
situation reflected shortages in power and raw materials, as well as a lack
of demand in certain industries.
Industrial Policy
2.08      GOP's industrial policy has undergone many significant changes
since the new Government took over in 1971. These have included the estab-
lishment in May 1972 of a more realistic exchange rate for the rupee to
reduce the serious distortions in the economy and to make Pakistan exports
more competitive. Further, the export bonus system with multiple exchange
rates was abolished and import restrictions liberalized. In addition, the
GOP introduced important labor reforms which have significantly reduced
labor tension and production lost due to strikes. Because of the upheavals
in the Pakistan economy from 1970-72, the fourth Five-Year Plan (1970-75)
quickly become obsolete, and industrial policy over the past few years has
been conducted within the framework of Annual Plans and the Industrial In-
vestment Scheduhe (IIS). A new draft Five-Year Plan (1975-80) is being
prepared, and should take effect from July 1975 (para 6.01).
2.09      The Role of the Public Sector.  Until 1971, the public industrial
sector had consisted primarily of units under the management and control of
the West Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (WPIDC). 1/ It had
been established to fill gaps in industrial subsectors where entrepreneur-
ship was lacking, particularly in mining, with the objective of eventually
transferring the ownership of such enterprises to the private sector. WPIDC
was also expected to promote regional growth, particularly since financial
viability was not considered the main criterion for financing. Indeed many
projects were established with inadequate equity bases and, in certain cases,
in locations which virtually guaranteed project failure. In FY73, 24 of 40
PIDC projects (where data are available) showed a return of 4.5% on invest-
ment compared to 6.8% in FY72 but in both years, the projects in the prov-
inces of Baluchistan and NWFP showed losses on a gross basis. The largest
1/   Since known as PIDC which acted as the channel for government appro-
priations for particular projects.



- 4 -
loss was in the mining sector. As of June 30, 1973, PIDC had provided Rs
895 million for 60 projects (total project costs Rs 1.2 billion) of which
40 projects remained under PIDC management. The largest amount of invest-
ment went to fertilizer (33.8%), followed by gas (21.6%) and cement (14.4%).
2.10      Under the Economic Reforms Order of January 1972, the Government
took over the management of 31 industrial concerns in ten basic industries 1/
which, until then, had been in the private sector, and which represented
total assets of Rs 2.2 billion and approximately 8% of Pakistan's total in-
dustrial assets at the time. The Government's objective in the takeover was
to (a) improve the performance of such key industries through the infusion
of top professional managers carefully selected from the private sector,
(b) break the concentration of wealth in a small group of families, and (c)
lay the basis for the growth of a mixed economy in the industrial sector.
2.11      A Board of Industrial Management (BIM), responsible to the Min-
istry of Production (the Minister in fact became the Chairman of the BIM)
was established at the same time to oversee the performance of the taken-
over units. Since the Boards of Directors of the units were abolished at
the time of takeover, the BIM took control over the major decisions of the
units (para 2.15). The BIM is composed of a Finance Group of about 12 pro-
fessionals as well as two or three technical/financial specialists in each
industry headed by the Chairman of the individual Sector Corporations.
2.12      In August 1973, an amendment to the Economic Reforms Order was
passed, which enabled the Federal Government to acquire a majority owner-
ship in the units the management of which had been taken over. In November
1973, the Government took over the entire equity of the private limited com-
panies as well as acquired a majority ownership in the public limited com-
panies of the taken-over units. The Government agreed to pay compensation,
and after lengthy discussions, amounts were agreed on the basis of market
prices in the case of 18 units, book value in 13. Initially, certificates
of entitlement were issued to shareholders, but in July 1970 these were
replaced by compensation bonds carrying interest rates at one percent above
the Bank rate and repayable at par after 15 years.
2.13      At the time of nationalization of the 31 industries, the Government
indicated that there would be no additional nationalizations, provided that
the private sector fulfilled its responsibilities. In September 1973, the
Government nationalized the vegetable ghee industry (26 of 28 units) 2/ on
the grounds, according to Government, that owners had created artificial
shortages through hoarding and production cuts and engaged in smuggling to
force up prices. Provincial Governments were given responsibility for the
1/   Iron and steel, basic metals, heavy engineering, heavy electrical,
automotive assembly and manufacture, tractor assembly and manufac-
ture, chemicals, petrochemicals, cement, and public utilities.
2/   The two remaining units were foreign-owned.



industry. Later, in January 1974, nationalization was extended to shipping,
oil distribution, raw cotton exports, and commercial banking (para 2.29).
2.14      In December 1973, the Government, after studying the experience of
Italy in organizing the industrial public sector, set up 12 Sector Corpora-
tions under the Federal Ministry of Production comprising the taken-over
industries, new public units, as well as a large number transferred from
the PIDC which is now primarily responsible for forestry, sugar, and textile
projects in the public sector (Annex 4). A breakdown of public enterprises
in the industrial sector by industry, region, and control is given in Annex
5 (excluding provincial units such as Provincial Industrial Development
Boards). The manufacturing sector represents 65% of the 118 units by num-
ber while the BIM is responsible for 62 of the total units (53% by number).
As of June 30, 1974, total fixed assets of the Sector Corporations under
BIM control amounted to Rs 4.6 billion. Finally, nearly 20% by number of
the units were located in the backward provincies of NWFP and Baluchistan,
well above the national average (10-11%). It is estimated that the public
sector now constitutes approximately 25% of total industrial assets.
2.15      In July 1974, the Government transferred its shares in the
operating units to the Sector Corporations which now function basically
as holding companies. However, no Boards of Directors were reinstituted
for the individual operating units, while the Sector Corporations were
normally headed by a Chairman and perhaps one or two Directors. Essen-
tially, the BIM and the Ministry of Production took the role of managing
the individual units on the basis of control of capital expenditures
in excess of Rs 50,000, appointment of key personnel, review of annual
budgets, and receipt of monthly operational reports.
2.16      It is Government policy that the industrial public sector be
operated on a sound commercial basis including the retention of profits
in individual units after the payment of reasonable levels of dividends
and taxes, and that commercial relations with other public sector units
would normally be at market rates of interest for borrowing and lending
and at market prices for purchases and sales. Moreover, other things
being equal, the Government's policy is to give equal treatment to indus-
trial firms in the public and private sectors.
2.17      In an important speech in October 1974, the Prime Minister pledged
once again that there would be no further nationalizations during his term
of office which has helped the private sector investment climate somewhat.
In the case of certain industries (iron and steel, cement, heavy electrical
equipment) the Government has restricted ownership to the public sector.
However, in the case of other industries (fertilizer, engineering, textiles,
sugar, etc.), the Government has encouraged investment in both public and
private sectors.
The Performance of the Public Sector
2.18      Because of the series of exogenous factors that have had a sig-
nificant impact on industrial performance over the past few years (the war
with India, the devaluation of the rupee, significant changes in import



- 6 -
policy, and the 1973 floods) it is difficult to isolate the performance
of the public industrial sector over the past three years. Nevertheless,
detailed information on the original 31 BIM units from 1971/72 to 1973/74
provides a reasonably clear picture of performance.
2.19      Production.  The Sector Corporations enjoyed an overall growth
in industrial production of 31.2% (Annex 6) from FY73 to FY74 which is far
in excess of the national average of 6.8%. The largest increase was re-
corded by PACO 1/ (83.9%), followed by SHE and MTC 2/ (74.0%) and NFCP 3/
(26.7%).
2.20      Capacity Utilization.  In line with the national trend, the aver-
age rate of capacity utilization has increased over the past few years
reaching 69.2% in 1974, with cement showing the highest rate of utiliza-
tion (89.7%) (Annex 7). A more detailed analysis of the capacity utiliza-
tion of BIM units over the past two years shows a similar improving trend
in nearly all units, though the BIM appears to have outperformed the public
sector as a whole (Annex 8).
2.21      Sales.  BIM units have recorded substantial increases in sales
over the past two years from Rs 948.3 million in FY72 to Rs 2.3 billion in
FY74. In the latter year, 41% of total sales was represented by auto and
farm equipment (Annex 9). Similarly, the profitability of the enterprises
has shown a rapid improvement from a Rs 23.4 million loss in FY72 (-1.2%
return on fixed assets) to a profit of Rs 136.3 million in FY74 (6.0%
return on fixed assets) (Annex 10). Income, sales and property taxes
amounted to Rs 84 million in the latter year.  Nevertheless, a number of
public sector enterprises have suffered from the fact that Government has
held prices of certain commodities at below market levels thereby reducing
profitability.
2.22      Exports.  Though many of the industries in the public sector are
import substitution oriented, BIM enterprises managed to export goods worth
Rs 111 million in FY73 and Rs 239 million in FY74 (115% increase) or 9% of
the total value of manufactured exports (Annex 11). The cement industry
was the top export performer (Rs 122 million). The Middle East has proven
to be a very good export market for cement, light engineering goods and
certain chemicals.
2.23      Employment.  BIN units employed nearly 28,000 people at the end
of FY74 (Annex 12) representing 5.4% of the total industrial labor force
in registered factories or 10.6% of the employment in industrial units with
more than 500 workers. BIM units are quite capital intens'ive with a fixed
asset/employment ratio of about $17,000.
2.24      Value Added.  Gross value added 4/ as a percentage of sales ranged
from a low of about 24% in the automotive sector to about 56% in the cement
1/   Pakistan Automobile Corporation.
2/   State Heavy Engineering and Machine Tool Corporation.
3/   National Fertilizer Corporation.
4/   Sales - raw materials - manufacturing overheads.



industry. The results in nearly all industries conform substantially to
those in the industrial sector as a whole.
2.25      Linkages with the Small Scale Sector.  Though no data are avail-
able, certain industries in the public sector have important forward and
backward linkages with the small scale sector. It is estimated that 15-20%
of light engineering and 5-10% of automobile and farm equipment components
come from the small scale sector.  Further, about 20-30% of industrial
chemical output from public sector units is sold to small scale units.
2.26      Managerial Performance.  As a result of the infusion of competent
management from the private sector at the time of takeover as well as the
managerial improvements instigated by the BIM such as capital budgeting,
monthly operational reports, improved accounting procedures, etc., on the
whole, the BIM units must be considered better from a management point of
view at present than when in private hands. In many cases, new competent
auditors have been appointed for the units which has led to a more accurate
assessment of the financial condition of the companies.
Sources of Industrial Finance for the Public Sector
2.27      Prior to the EconQmic Reforms Order of 1972, long-term public
industrial investment was confined largely to PIDC industries and was pro-
vided through budgetary allocations which reached their peak, in terms of
utilization, in FY72 at Rs 140 million:

1974-75  45.45    33.05    75.50
The rupee expenditures were met through allocations from the Annual Develop-
ment Plan (ADP) while foreign exchange expenditures were met largely from
foreign loans and credits from international aid agencies, bilateral donors,
and supplemented by the country's own foreign exchange resources. Up until
FY65, such rupee funds were treated as equity, but thereafter the Government
began making loans and charging interest which reached a level of 6-1/2% in
FY72.  This compounded the financial difficulties of some firms, given their
initial weak financial prospects.

2.28      With the takeover of the 31 units in the private sector and sub-
sequent nationalizations, the sources of financing took on a different pat-
tern. A breakdown of the amount of financial assistance outstanding to BIM
units for the two years ending June 30, 1974, is given below:

Total financial assistance outstanding to BIM units increased from Rs 1.46
billion in FY73 to Rs 1.88 billion in FY74, or by 28.6%. Working capital
financing represented nearly 50% of the total.
2.29      The largest single source of finance were the comnercial banks
(Rs 952 million) of which 88% represented short term funds. The Pakistani
banks (including IDBP, ADBP, the Punjab Provincial Cooperative Bank and all
scheduled commercial banks) were nationalized on January 1, 1974. The
objectives of nationalization were:
(a) to direct banking activities towards national
socio-economic objectives;
(b) to distribute equitably bank credit to different
classes, sectors and regions;



- 9 -
(c) to coordinate banking policy in various areas of
feasible joint activity; and
(d) to ensure safety and security of deposits of account
holders.
In the case of commercial banks, 9 were merged into 5 following national-
ization, and had total assets of Rs 45.5 billion as of June 30, 1974.  Fur-
ther, a Banking Council was established (made up of six people including
the Deputy Governor of the State Bank) to formulate policy guidelines for
banks and lay down performance criteria.  Given the Government's attempts
to control inflation (para 2.03), credit ceilings were established for both
nationalized and foreign commercial banks for FY75 amounting to Rs 2.35
billion for the private sector and Rs 1.28 billion for the public sector
(the latter primarily for the vegetable ghee and transport industries).
However, short-term lending to the public sector has and will continue to
be supplemented by NDFC, and to a small extent by IDBP.
2.30      In the case of term lending, PICIC and IDBP are predominant at
present. PICIC's large involvement reflects the fact that 19 of the 31
units originally taken over by Government were PICIC clients. Since
PICIC is barred by its Charter and Policy Statement from lending to the
public sector, its former clients have now become ineligible for financial
assistance from PICIC except where loan commitments had taken place prior
to the actual Government takeover of shares in November 1973. PICIC's
management has felt that if there is a revival in the investment climate
in the private sector, particularly large-scale industry, it would prefer
to maintain its present policy rather than amend it to be enabled to fi-
nance public sector units. IDBP, on the other hand, has always been per-
mitted to lend to the public sector but has preferred, particularly over
the last five years, to restrict its activities to medium and small scale
financing in the private sector. IDBP's maximum lending limit in foreign
exchange is Rs 3.0 million and Rs 1.5 million in local currency for limited
liability companies.
2.31      Capital market activities are undertaken primarily by the Invest-
ment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP), a Government-owned institution estab-
lished in 1966, and the National Investment Trust (NIT), an open-ended
mutual fund also Government-owned with total assets of Rs 492.6 million
as of June 30, 1973. Historically both institutions financed private in-
dustry, though with the spate of nationalizations, this has changed. The
stock market had experienced such a slump over the past few years that
both institutions have been relatively inactive. The general index of
share prices fell from Rs 87.4 in June 1973 to Rs 65.5 in November 1974,
but has since recovered to Rs 81.1 by March 1975. Both ICP and NIT have
been actively involved in consortia arrangements organized by NDFC (para
4.05).
2.32      Thus, it is anticipated that NDFC's small role in financing BIM
units (4% of total outstandings) will substantially increase in future.



- 10 -
Its financing of non-BIM units in the public sector, as well as a high
proportion of new investment that will be in the public sector in future
(para 6.02) will further increase NDFC's developmental role.
III. THE INSTITUTION
A. Organizational Structure
3.01      Origins.  NDFC was established under the NDFC Act (No. 13) of
January 1973. The purpose of the institution was to finance through loans
(short- and long-term), equity investments, underwriting and guarantees
sound undertakings in the industrial sector (manufacturing, transport,
mining and utilities) which were wholly or partly owned by the Federal
Government, which had been taken over and managed by the Government under
the Economic Reforms Order of 1972, or had been declared by the Government
to be an eligible enterprise (Article 17). NDFC has submitted a number
of amendments to the Act which are presently pending with the Government.
These include an amendment to Article 17 to redefine "eligible" enterprises,
in the light of the recent organizational changes in the public sector
(para 2.12), to include (a) undertakings which are wholly or partly owned
by the Federal Government and (b) undertakings which are wholly or partly
owned by undertakings in sub-section (a) in order to allow for the creation
of Sector Corporations.
3.02      Ownership.  NDFC, located in Karachi, was established as a 100%
Government-owned Corporation with a total authorized capital of Rs 100 mil-
lion, which had been fully paid-in as of September 30, 1974.
3.03      Board of Directors.  NDFC's Board (Annex 13) consists of 6 per-
sons who are appointed by the Government, of whom two must come from finan-
cial institutions. The Chairman, who is the Chief Executive, is appointed
by Government to hold office for a three-year term, though this can be
altered. There is no fixed term for the remaining Board members. The
composition accurately reflects the nature of NDFC's business with repre-
sentatives from the BIM, the Ministry of Production (responsible for public
sector projects), the Ministry of Finance (responsibl.e for NDFC), ICP (in-
volved in local currency join financing with NDFC), and the State Bank
of Pakistan. The Board meets regularly once a month with at least two-
thirds of the Board in attendance. The Board is empowered to establish
an Executive Committee though, given the small size of the overall Board,
this has not taken place.
3.04      Organization.  NDFC's organizational structure is contained in
the attached chart and at present consists of four active divisions. Given
the small size of the organization, this structure is appropriate. In
November 1974, NDFC opened a Regional Office in Lahore, with one profes-
sional, as a means of better serving its clients (potential and existing)



- 11 -
in this important industrial region, as well as contributing to its own
deposit base. NDFC is planning to establish additional branches in
Karachi, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Quetta over the next year to facili-
tate appraisal and supervision work, and increase NDFC's deposit base.
3.05      Management.  NDFC's Chairman, Mr. Amin Ullah, is 42 years old with
long banking experience with First National City Bank, both in Pakistan and
New York, as well as with the Bank of China in London. He is concurrently
the Chairman of the NIT. For a year prior to joining NDFC, he held the
position of Member-Finance with the BIM. He is a capable individual
who is in the process of building NDFC into a strong viable institution.
He has been delegated authority by the Board to approve loans up to
Rs 2 million.
3.06      Staff.  As of September 30, 1974, NDFC's professional staff num-
bered 20 people including 5 accountants, 2 economists, 1 engineer, 10 finan-
cial analysts, 1 lawyer, and 1 commercial banker. 1/ Given the newness of
the organization, the smallness of the staff is understandable.  The Chair-
manis recruitment policy has been to hire experienced individuals as divi-
sion heads (from PICIC, IDBP and commercial banks and industry) while de-
veloping lower echelon staff straight from graduate school. The Chairman
exercises complete freedom in the selection of staff, and 'has been actively
recruiting over the past year. NDFC's salary scales are competitive with
those of other financial institutions except in the area of fringe benefits.
Nevertheless in 1974, NDFC lost an engineer to a commercial bank. Given the
great shortage of experienced development bankers in Pakistan, which has
been compounded by the "brain drain" to the Middle East, the Chaiman's
approach is a sensible one. The greatest need in NDFC at present is tech-
nical staff (the engineering staff consists of two well-qualified individ-
uals), even though NDFC benefits from the technological input from consult-
ants who prepare the feasibility studies for operating units as well as the
technical expertise available within the BIM. However, the latter is not
available to non-BIM units. An additional need is the recruitment of mar-
ket analysts which the Chairman considers to be of high priority. During
negotiations, NDFC's recruitment program over the next few years was re-
viewed. Over the next 18 months, NDFC intends to recruit 3 additional
engineers and 4 market analysts to strengthen the Economic Research and
Project Division. In addition, sufficient staff will also be recruited
to man the proposed new branches, and handle the appraisal and supervision
work at the Head Office as business grows.
1/   4 additional professionals have since been recruited.



- 12 -
B. Operating Policies and Procedures
3.07      Statement of Policies.  NDFC's Board adopted a Policy Statement
on June 5, 1974. During negotiations, this was reviewed and a number of
changes were agreed upon (Annex 14). NDFC intends to present the revised
Policy Statement to its Board shortly, whose approval will be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed Credit. Article 1 states that NDFC's
objectives are "to promote industrial expansion and economic growth in the
country by providing financial and technical assistance for the establishment
of new enterprises as well as for the balance, modernization and expansion of
existing enterprises in the public sector." NDFC is empowered to provide
financial assistance in the form of direct loans both in local and foreign
currency, for medium- and long-term, as well as for working capital, and
subscribe and underwrite debentures and equity participations, as well as
guarantee both local and foreign currency loans. NDFC will finance only
those projects "which are financially sound, technically feasible and
economically viable and contribute to the economic development of the
country" (Article 4).
3.08      Exposure limit.  NDFC proposes not to commit normally more than 30%
of its own paid-up capital and reserves to a single enterprise. Further,
NDFC's equity participation in any single enterprise will not normally ex-
ceed 20% of the paid-up capital of that enterprise or 5% of its own paid-up
capital and reserves whichever is lower.
3.09      Project cost.  In view of NDFC's potential involvement with large
projects in the public sector and its present small size, the proposed
Policy Statement provides that NDFC will not normally finance a project
whose total cost is greater than $40 million to ensure that NDFC's involve-
ment is significant enough to allow for active involvement in project
formulation. Secondly, NDFC should not normally finance more than 75% of
total cost for new and significant expansion projects to ensure sufficient
sponsor contribution though some flexibility should be adopted depending
upon the capital structure of the firm.
3.10      Appraisal Procedures.  Over the past few months, NDFC's appraisal
procedures have undergone significant changes in the case of its term loans.
Under the old arrangement, NDFC had not become involved in public sector
projects at a sufficiently early stage where it could contribute in a
significant way to project formulation. However, at NDFC's insistence, a
new procedure has developed. Specifically, once a feasibility study has
been prepared on the basis of a project idea from the operating unit, it
is then submitted to NDFC for appraisal (if financial assistance is being
sought) and concurrently to the Planning Commission, which will look at the
project in terms of overall national priorities; to the Ministry of Pro-
duction, which is responsible for public sector units; and to the relevant
Provincial Government, which checks the availability of suitable infra-
structure. Once each organization has had an opportunity to review the



- 13 -
project in detail, which normally takes two months, the project (where the
total cost is greater than Rs 10 million) is submitted to the Central
Development Working Party (CDWP) at which all interested Ministries as well
as NDFC are represented. Final approval rests with the Economic Coordinating
Committee chaired by the Ministry of Finance and consisting of five or six
Cabinet members. NDFC is satisfied that at present it is in a position
to make a significant contribution to projects and is in a position to
reject projects which has occurred in 6 of the 33 cases to date for both
financial and economic reasons. Nevertheless, during negotiations, it was
agreed that Government would write to the Association formalizing NDFC's
present role in project formulation.
3.11      Appraisal Standards.  Despite NDFC's short history, it has already
established reasonably good appraisal standards particularly in the finan-
cial area. The head of NDFC's Appraisal Department (Development Banking
Division) was formerly with PICIC (9 years) and has succeeded for the most
part in introducing PICIC's appraisal techniques into NDFC. However, im-
provements are still desirable in the technical, marketing, and managerial
areas, which will be facilitated by an increase in staff size. NDFC is
already routinely calculating financial and economic rates of return.
3.12      Follow-Up Procedures.  Given the fact that the long-term portfolio
is still in the disbursement rather than the repayment stage, follow-up
activities consist primarily of construction visits, and reviews of reports
received from clients. NDFC has laid down elaborate follow-up procedures
which, if effectively implemented as NDFC's portfolio matures, should be
more than sufficient to monitor the portfolio. Further, NDFC intends to
become a repository of operational and financial information for its
own public sector clients and will endeavout to collect and analyze such
information from non-clients as well where feasible.
3.13      Procurement and Disbursement.  NDFC's staff review the equipment
recommended as to suitability of price and quality based on quotations from
at least three different sources. Once satisfied, NDFC arranges a letter
of credit in favor of the foreign suppliers through a designated commercial
bank. In the case of local currency, NDFC reviews the procurement of local
machinery on the basis of competitive bids and when satisfied will make pay-
ments to the suppliers directly.
C. External Relations
3.14      Relations with Government.  Given NDFC's ownership structure
(para 3.02), the composition of its Board (para 3.03) and the nature of
its clientele, it is understandable that NDFC maintains close relations
with Government. Nevertheless, since its inception, NDFC has demonstrated
its own independence in decision-making through its rejection of projects,



- 14 -
and also its own innovativeness in developing schemes for suppliers' credits
(para 4.20). NDFC's newly-developed active participation in project formula-
tion (para 3.10) should ensure itself of an important role in decision-making.
In due course, NDFC should become a prime repository of information on the
public sector through its lending operations (para 3.12) after which it should
be in a good position to make a valuable contribution to the Government's
planning for the public industrial sector.
3.15      Relations with Financial Institutions and Clients.  NDFC has played
and should continue to play, an important role in the mobilization of domes-
tic resources from other financial institutions through consortia arrange-
ments for its projects (para 4.05). Moreover, it expects to be in a position
to engage in joint financing with IDBP in public sector projects (within the
latter's upper lending limits) as well as PICIC in the case of private sector
projects with Government participation. NDFC's clients have expressed satis-
faction with the speed and efficiency with which NDFC has processed loans,
and for its contribution to financial planning.
IV. NDFC'S ROLE IN THE ECONOMY
Resource Mobilization
4.01      Long-term Resources.  NDFC's resource position as of September 30,
1974 is shown in Annex 15. Long term resources consisted of Rs 108.9 mil-
lion in share capital and reserves and Rs 110.9 million in long-term depo-
sits (para 4.02). NDFC does not at present have its own long-term foreign
exchange though it has until now received foreign exchange authorizations
from the Government amounting to approximately Rs 30 million of which Rs 0.7
million has been disbursed for clients who-had borrowed from NDFC in local
currency to purchase the foreign exchange. Taking into account all dis-
bursements and undisbursed commitments with respect to long-term lending,
NDFC had Rs 125.2 million in long term resources available for commitment
as of September 30, 1974.
4.02      NDFC's long-term deposit base has grown rapidly from Rs 29.5 million
at the end of 1973 to Rs 110.9 million in the following nine months despite
the absence of a branch network. Nearly 90% of the long-term deposits have
carried maturities between 1 and 3 years while the remaipder have gone up
to 7 years. NDFC has been able to attract deposits on account of its ability
to offer rates of interest between 1/2-1% above those of the commercial banks
since it is not classified as a bank under the direction of the SBP. A com-
parison of various investment opportunities is given in Annex 16,.which re-
flect the revisions that took place following the increase in the Bank Rate
in September 1974. NDFC is more competitive with deposits of short maturity
(less than one year). NDFC also has adopted a policy of rewarding compen-
sating deposits with reductions in lending rates. Not surprisingly, the
great majority of depositors are public sector units which to a great extent
are already receiving financial assistance from NDFC.

4.03      Short-Term Resources.  As of September 30, 1974, NDFC's short term
resources consisted of Rs 43.5 million in short-term deposits (8-8-1/2%) and
Rs 12.3 million of a Rs 50 million revolving line of credit from the State
Bank of Pakistan (SBP) at 9% for a period of 12 months which can be extended
(Annex 15). Thus, NDFC had Rs 19.2 million available for short-term dis-
bursements as well as the balance of Rs 37.7 million from SBP and Rs 153.4
million available for long-term disbursements. NDFC also received a short-
term deposit in foreign currency of Rs 8.22 million from the State Cement
Corporation which it has placed on deposit in the Eurodollar market.
4.04      NDFC's proposed liquidity policy (revised Policy Statement) is to
keep 25% of its deposits in the form of cash in hand and with approved banks
and investments in short-term paper. 1/ It also includes a commitment in
its proposed Policy Statement to match as much as possible the maturities
of its sources and uses of funds and to maintain a prudent mix of short and
long-term deposits. NDFC has invested up to Rs 10 million in compensation
bonds (for the various nationalizations) in order to earn 10% per annum.
NDFC has successfully developed a secondary market in these bonds.
4.05      Mobilization at Project Level.  NDFC has taken the lead in organiz-
ing consortia with commercial banks, ICP, NIT and the State Life Insurance
Corporation of Pakistan. To date, six such arrangements have been organized
involving debentures of Rs 225.5 million (of which NDFC subscribed Rs 51.5
million), Rs 24.5 million in equity (Rs 2.0 million from NDFC), and Rs 50
million in working capital. NDFC should continue to play an important role
in this area for its clients. On average (by number), NDFC has financed
only about 20% of total project cost to date though this has ranged from 1%
to 75%. The percentage should increase as NDFC obtains foreign exchange,
though NDFC should be encouraged not to finance normally more than 75% of
total individual project costs (para 3.09).
Terms and Conditions of Financial Assistance
4.06      NDFC's interest rates and other charges on its overall operations
are given in Annex 17 while the general interest rate level in the country
is given in Annex 18. In the case of local currency lending, NDFC's rates
approximate those of commercial banks being 12% for long-term (3% above
Bank rate) compared with a range of 11-13% for commercial banks. However,
NDFC can make a reduction of up to 1% in exchange for compensating deposits
of up to 10% of the value of the loan. NDFC is entitled to convert 20% of
the loan account into ordinary shares of the borrower at par, though this
has not yet occurred.
4.07      In the case of suppliers' credits (para 4.20), NDFC is-obliged to
offer a rate of interest on foreign currency 1% below the lowest rate availa-
1/   Under NDFC's present Policy Statement, the ratio is 20%.  Though even
25% is below the 35% ratio of commercial banks (para 2.03), unlike
the commercial banks, NDFC does not accept demand deposits.



- 16 -
able from either itself, PICIC or IDBP, which at present is 8-1/2% (IDBP).
Refinance from the SBP is available at 2% below NDFC's foreign lending rate,
which would be 5-1/2% at present.
4.08           In its short term operations, NDFC also charges 12% per annum,
except for export credits (none have as yet been granted) which carry a
rate of 10% per annum. NDFC normally charges a penal rate over the regular
rate of interest ranging from 2%-6% for overdues depending on the amount of
the loan.
4.09      NDFC's foreign currency rate will be 2% above the rate of interest
on its foreign credits. In the case of the IDA Credit, the GOP will on-lend
at 8.5% with NDFC relending at a minimum of 10.5% with the subborrower bear-
ing the exchange risk. This will ensure an adequate spread. Though the rate
of inflation in Pakistan is presently running at 14% per annum, a 10.5%
relending rate is appropriate since end-users will be bearing the exchange
risk. This rate would be somewhat higher than practised by other DFCs for
foreign exchange term lending. IDBP's foreign currency lending rate ranges
from 8-1/2-9%, while PICIC's has ranged from 8-1/2-9-1/2%, though it was
recently increased to 10-1/4% under the latest ADB loan. While the lending
rates vary somewhat between the three industrial development banks, the
differentials are temporary since all lend at a 2% spread, the difference
being explained by the timing of each institution's borrowing.
Resource Allocation
4.10      Overall Operations.  A summary of NDFC's operational results
through September 30, 1974 is given in Annex 19. Cumulative approvals
(net of cancellations) since its inception in July 1973 have totalled
Rs 362.9 million for loans to 53 projects and Rs 7.0 million for equity
investments in 7 companies. Cumulative disbursements totalled Rs 120.7
million ($12.2 million) as of the same date. Total approvals increased
from Rs 48.7 million in 1973 (six months) to Rs 321.2 million in 1974
(nine months).
4.11      Sector Distribution.  Annex 20 shows the subsectoral distribution
of NDFC's loan approvals since inception. The chemical industry has been
the most important recipient of NDFC assistance by amount (29.1%) while
steel and engineering have accounted for 39.6% by number and in the case
of working capital loans, 63% by amount. Overall, NDFC's portfolio has
been well diversified by industry.
4.12      Local Currency and Import Financing.  One of the important con-
tributions of NDFC's lending activities to date has been the magnitude of
its local currency financing which represented 56% of total approvals as
of September 30, 1974 (Annex 21). This has been possible due to NDFC's
success to date in deposit mobilization (para 4.02) as well as from the
initial use of share capital. This proportion is expected to decline some-
what over the years to about 45%.



- 17 -
4.13      Loan Maturities.  The maturities of NDFC's loans have ranged from
less than one year (14.5% by amount) for working capital loans to over ten
years (41.8% by amount) for term loans. Nearly 70% of the loans by amount
have had maturities of greater than five years (Annex 21).
4.14      Geographical Distribution.  NDFC's loan approvals by amount have
been concentrated in the two most industrialized provinces, namely Sind
(72.8%) and Punjab (25.8%), while N.W.F.P. has received only 1.4% and
Baluchistan nothing at all (Annex 21). Given the fact that the Govern-
ment is in an advantageous position in the case of public sector projects
to influence project location, the Government and NDFC intend to promote
a better regional balance in the public sector though not by establishing
non-viable units due to faulty location.
4.15      Ownership Structure.  NDFC's initial lending operations have been
heavily concentrated in BIM units (72.8% by amount) (Annex 21).- This re-
flects the fact that NDFC's initial orientation was to assist those units
that had been recently taken over. However, with subsequent. nationaliza-
tion and a broader public sector coverage on the part of NDFC, the BIM
proportion of future financing is expected to decline to around 30%.
4.16      Type of Project.  Of the 53 projects approved by NDFC to date,
26 have been for working capital, 20 for new and expansion, and 7 for
balancing and replacement (Annex 21). In the long run, NDFC expects that
its term lending operations will represent approximately 75% of its total
lending activities.
4.17      Size of Loan.  The breakdown of NDFC's loans by size is in Annex
22. In the case of long-term loans, 37% by number and 87% by amount have
been for amounts greater than Rs 10 million while the balance involved loans
of less than Rs 6 million. In the case of working capital loan the break-
down has ranged from 25% by amount of less than Rs 3 million and 29% by
amount greater than Rs 9 million.
4.18      Guarantees.  NDFC had issued two guarantees for a 1% fee as of
September 30, 1974 (one was actually a counter-guarantee) totalling Rs 36.4
million involving Rumanian and Russian suppliers. In general, NDFC prefers
to make direct loans or investments.
4.19      Suppliers Credits.  In order to support the growth of the local
machinery industry, NDFC recently inaugurated a suppliers credit scheme to
finance the purchase of equipment from its public sector clients by wholly
private units which are beyond the scope of its lending activity. As of
September 30, 1974, NDFC has arranged for two suppliers credits with com-
mercial bank guarantees amounting to Rs 1.97 million, 1/ though the growth
of this business is constrained by the lack of domestic machinery.
1/   Included in loan operation totals above.



- 18 -
4.20      Equity Investments.  NDFC's role in equity investments has been
rather marginal to date involving approvals of Rs 7.0 million in 7 compa-
nies and disbursements of Rs 3.5 million. This has been largely due to the
poor state of the capital market, though with the recent upturn (para 2.31),
NDFC's activities should increase.
Development Impact
4.21      Aside from NDFC's important contributions to date in domestic
resource mobilization (paras 4.01-4.03), its contribution can also be meas-
ured at the micro level through an analysis, on an ex ante basis, of NDFC's
subprojects. Using a sample of 11 projects (out of 27 term loans approved
since inception), the financial rates of return varied from 6.0 - 21.5%
(weighted average of 13.5%) while the economic rates of returns varied
from 17.2% to 49.0% (weighted averaged of 33.2%) (Annex 23). The wide
variation in a number of cases (sugar, fertilizer) between the financial
and economic rates of return reflects the wide discrepancy between domestic
and international prices in many commodities. Moreover, on average, NDFC
financed 24.2% of total project cost, created 211 jobs per project, its
clients exported 11.3% of their output, and the annual incremental for-
eign exchange saved/earned was Rs 43 million.
4.22      Given NDFC's small staff, the opportunities for actively engaging
in promotional work are not very great at present. Nevertheless, as the
staff is strengthened both in terms of numbers and disciplines, and as NDFC
becomes the repository of detailed knowledge of the public industrial sector,
this promotional aspect including subsector reviews should be emphasized
which should be facilitated by NDFC's profitability prospects (para 6.09).
V. NDFC'S FINANCIAL POSITION
5.01      Profitability.  In 1973, NDFC earned slightly more than Rs 1 mil-
lion in net profit (it is tax exempt) on the basis of gross income of Rs 2.35
million (Annex 24). Net profit as a percentage of year-end share capital
amounted to 2.80%. Administrative costs as a percentage of average total
assets amounted to 1.5% (Annex 25). For the first nine months of 1974,
NDFC recorded a net profit of Rs 7.9 million on a gross income of Rs 14.8
million. Under its Act, NDFC is required to transfer 5,0% of its annual rev-
enue to reserves. Book value per share reached Rs 109 as of September 30,
1974 while NDFC is expected to begin paying a dividend of 8% in 1975.
5.02      Quality of Portfolio.  Given the newness of the institution, no
repayment pattern on term loans has emerged since all clients are enjoying
periods of grace. In the case of working capital loans, all have been
repaid on time. To foster a good collection performance, NDFC will be re-
quired, under the proposed Project Agreement, to maintain as a condition of
further subproject authorizations by IDA, at a minimum, a collection ratio of



- 19 -
80% of all principal and interest falling due during the financial year
plus overdues from previous financial years (excluding arrears of less
than three months). Notwithstanding this, NDFC's basic objective will still
be to strive for a 100% collection performance.
5.03      Financial Position.  Balance sheets as of December 31, 1973 and
September 30, 1974 are contained in Annex 26. NDFC's total assets grew from
Rs 102 million to Rs 288 million over this period, for an almost threefold
increase. NDFC's total debt/equity ratio was 0.4:1 as of December 31, 1973
while its debt service coverage position was a substantial 4.8:1. NDFC's
reserves and retained earnings as a percentage of year-end share capital
were 2.55%, while no provisions were made given the newness of the portfolio.
NDFC's liquidity position remains extremely strong with net current assets
of Rs 167 million (current ratio of 9.8) and undisbursed commitments (short
and long term) of Rs 60.6 million.
5.04      Audit.  NDFC's 1973 accounts were audited without qualification by
the well-known and qualified firms of A.F. Ferguson & Co. and Ford, Rhodes,
Robbins and Morrow. NDFC is obliged under Article 23 of its Act to have
its accounts audited annually by two separate auditors, the results of which
must be submitted to its Board, and the Federal Government, which in turn,
submits the accounts to the National Assembly. NDFC has agreed to have
its 1974 accounts audited in the "long form".
VI. PROSPECTS
General Outlook
6.01      The preliminary Draft Five-Year Plan (1975-80) provides for a
growth rate of 15% per annum in nominal terms of industrial output compared
to the 9% achieved during the last three years of the Fourth Plan. Total
industrial investment during the Fifth Plan is projected to be Rs 35 bil-
lion compared to Rs 7.2 billion in the Fourth Plan.
6.02      Significantly, public industrial investment as a percentage of
total investment is expected to increase substantially from 36.5% to 67%
reflecting the Government's commitment to a mixed economy with a signifi-
cant public sector. Though the Government is encouraging the revitaliza-
tion of private sector investment through promises of no further nationali-
zations as well as through provision of certain fiscal incentives, it is
estimated that this will have an impact only on the medium and small-scale
sector. The ADP for the Sector Corporations in 1974/75 is given in Annex 27.
Industrial investment in the Fifth Plan will be based on the following
priorities:



- 20 -
(a) agro-based industries (textile, sugar, vegetable ghee,
paper, cigarettes, rice milling)
(b) industries producing essential wage goods
(c) basic and heavy industries (steel)
(d) export-oriented industries (textiles, cement,
engineering)
(e) import-substitution industries not included
under (a)-(b) (fertilizer)
6.03       The Government has also outlined a number of additional policy
objectives including:
(a) the need to promote regional development based on
integrated regional plans to develop economically
feasible projects that would have forward and
backward linkages; and
(b) the use of appropriate technology to favor labor
intensive projects (where appropriate), the greater
use- of local raw materials, and the need to develop
indigenous designs to encourage manufacture of
domestic capital goods.
Business Forecasts
6.04      Annex 28 shows a forecast of NDFC's total approvals, commitments
and disbursements for the years 1974 through 1979. Total approvals are
expected to increase from Rs 498 million in 1974 to Rs 1,040 million in
1979 reflecting an overall growth rate of 15% per annum (except for sup-
pliers credits and equity investments) which is directly comparable to
the growth rate of industrial output for large scale industry envisioned
in the draft Five-Year Plan. 1/ Thus, foreign currency approvals are
expected to grow from Rs 248 million in 1974 to Rs 498 million in 1979,
constituting a relatively constant proportion (50%) of total approvals
over this period. Of the balance, approximately 30% will take the form
of working capital loans, 60% long term local currency loans, with the
remainder split between suppliers credits, export credits, and equity
investments. A similar pattern is anticipated in the case of disburse-
ments which are expected to grow from Rs 204 million in 1974 to Rs 910
million in 1979. Thus, over the next five years NDFC is expected to
finance about 14% on a disbursement basis of large-scale industrial in-
vestment in the public sector, though the percentage would be considerably
higher if a few large projects such as the Karachi Steel Mill were excluded.
It is expected that NDFC's foreign exchange lending will go primarily for
1/   The capital/output ratio for large scale industry is estimated
to be 1.1:1.



- 21 -
cement, chemicals, agro-industries, automotive, and steel and engineering
industries which have shown improving performance (paras 2.18 - 2.26).
Nevertheless, given NDFC's relatively small role over the next few years
in total public industrial finance, it intends to concentrate its lending
activities on those projects where it can make a significant contribution,
and where its contribution to total project cost will be significant.
Resource Requirements
6.05      Foreign Currency.  As of September 30, 1974, NDFC had not mobil-
ized any foreign currency on its own (aside from Rs 8.22 million in foreign
currency deposits), but instead had relied on allocations from the Govern-
ment on a priority basis. As of that date, foreign currency commitments
amounted to Rs 24.92 million, while disbursements were Rs 0.7 million.
From April 1, 1975 to April 1, 1977, NDFC's total foreign currency resource
commitment requirements are expected to be approximately US$58 million,
which is a conservative estimate since projects amounting to US$18.7 million
were expected to be committed between October 1, 1974 and April 1, 1975
and could be postponed, though a portion of the foreign exchange require-
ment is being met by direct government allocations.  In addition, the
proposed credit agreement provides fo: IDA's financing of expenditures
incurred between April 1, 1975 and the date of signature of the Credit
Agreement for not more than 3 subprojects and up to an amount not exceeding
US$2,000,000. Further, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has agreed to
mount an appraisal mission in mid-1975 so that foreign exchange could be
available early in 1976 of the order of $20 million. Later, NDFC and the
government intend to approach OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries) for funds of approximately $30 million. Thus, it is recommended
that the Bank Group provide NDFC with a $30 million credit to meet about
50% of its foreign currency requirements for the two year period beginning
April 1, 1975.
6.06      Domestic Currency.  NDFC's rupee disbursements for the period from
1974 to 1979 are expected to grow from Rs 149.8 million to Rs 508.6 million.
In the case of long-term operations, new commitments from October 1, 1974
to December 31, 1976 amounting to Rs 423.8 million should be financed pri-
marily through uncommitted long-term resources (Rs 125 million) long-term
deposits (Rs 115.6 million) as well as through the issuance of its own de-
bentures in 1976 (Rs 15 million):

6.07      NDFC's short-term local resource position for the period October 1,

Cash surplus (deficit)                         13.6        4.8      (2.2)
6.08      The slight shortfall of Rs 2.2 million in 1976 could be easily
covered by the surplus position (Rs 59.9 million) in NDFC's long-term
position.
6.09      Financial Projections.  Projected income statements for the period
1974-79 are contained in Annex 29. Net profits are expected to grow from
10.8% to 53.4% as a percentage of year-end share capital., NDFC's high
profitability performance can be attributed to the absence of tax, low
administration costs (0.3% of average total assets in 1979) due to large
loans and small staff, and favorable spreads on local currency. NDFC ex-
pects to declare an 8% dividend in 1975, increasing to 10%'in the following
two years, and then to 15%. Over the five-year period, NDFC's book value
per share is expected to more than double from Rs 111.8 to RS 233.
6.10      Projected balance sheets from 1974 to 1979 are given in Annex 30.
Total assets are expected to grow from Rs 331 million in 1974 to Rs 2.56
billion in 1979, a more than sevenfold increase. The most rapid increase



- 23 -
would occur in the case of foreign currency loans (from Rs 34.9 million to
Rs 1.3 billion). NDFC presently enjoys a long-term debt/equity limit of
20:1 both in its Act and Policy Statement. Given the newness of the insti-
tution, the nature of its clientele, the size of the loans it will be
expected to make, and the need to develop a sound equity base a long-term
debt/equity limit of 5:1 was agreed upon during negotiations (where debt
excludes deposits maturing within one year from the date of receipt).
Short-term deposits are excluded from the calculation on the grounds that
(a) NDFC's liquidity policies (para 4.04) are adequate; (b) these short-
term deposits are expected to account for a maximum of 5-6% of its total
liabilities by 1979 and (c) NDFC has undertaken to match the maturities of
its sources and uses of funds and maintain a prudent mix of short and long-
term deposits (para 4.04). NDFC's debt/equity ratio (under IDA's definition)
is expected to grow from 1.3:1 as of September 30, 1974 to 5.9:1 in 1979.
This assumes, however, that NDFC's equity base is increased by Rs 120 million
over this period. The Government has agreed to increase NDFC's share capital
by Rs 20 million in 1976. In addition, NDFC's forecasts provide for Govern-
ment subordinated loans of Rs 100 million over the 5-year period, though
the Government has reserved its option of increasing equity by share capital
or subordinated loans. Projected cash flow statements (1974-1979) are con-
tained in Annex 31. NDFC's debt service coverage position is expected to
decline from 7.6:1 in 1974 to the still adequate level of 1.6:1 in 1979.
VII. OBJECTIVES OF THE CREDIT
7.01      Since Bank Group assistance to financial intermediaries in Pakistan
has been concentrated in PICIC and IDBP, which are concerned almost entirely
with the private sector (para 2.30), a credit to NDFC would provide the first
Bank Group assistance to the public industrial sector (through a financial
intermediary). NDFC would in turn substitute, to a growing extent, for the
traditional direct government financing of public units. Thus, for the
first time, a financial intermediary would bring its appraisal and super-
vision skills to bear on the public sector which should contribute to better
project selection and performance. Moreover, NDFC's successful mobilization
of both short and long term local currency in addition to foreign currency
should provide a more balanced package of financial assistance than has
been possible by Pakistan's development banks in the past. Finally, the
newness of the institution would enable the Bank to contribute substantially
to institution building. NDFC has prepared a statement of its development
strategy own the next two years which is contained in Annex 32.
7.02      The industries to be financed under the credit would, for the most
part, provide:



- 24 -
(a) a positive impact on the balance of payments both in
terms of exports (cement, engineering goods) and import
substitution (steel, heavy engineering and automotive)
(para 2.22);
(b) a greater diversification of the industrial sector away
from- industries such as textiles which accounts for 32%
of total value added and 47% of employment, and which has
experienced a difficult period recently due to interna-
tional economic events (para 2.06);
(c) a greater potential for regional development (para 4.14).
7.03      NDFC will fill an important informational gap in becoming a
primary repository of information on public sector units which should
give it the opportunity to provide industrial policy advice to the govern-
ment (para 3.14).
VIII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      On the basis of NDFC's present foreign resource position and its
foreign currency requirements over the two-year period beginning April 1,
1975, a $30 million credit to the GOP is recommended to be on-lent to
NDFC. The use of the credit would be limited to expenditures for the
import of capital equipment. The GOP would on-lend to NDFC at an interest
rate of 8.5% to be repaid to the GOP in 18 years including 3 years grace.
The amortization schedule would be based on the aggregate amortization
schedules of NDFC's loans to sub-borrowers. NDFC would relend at a rate
of interest of 10.5% per annum, constituting a 2% spread, with the sub-
borrower bearing the foreign exchange risk. A free limit of $1 million is
proposed, given the large size of the potential loans, which would imply
that 75% by number and over 90% by amount of subprojects financed under
the proposed credit would require prior approval of IDA. A disbursement
schedule for the proposed Credit is contained in Annex 33.

Development Strategy for 1975 and 1976
(prepared by NDFC)
1.        Industrial investment in Pakistan today is characterised by a
substantial planned expansion in public sector enterprises. The expansion
is in many forms such as increase in the utilization of installed capacity,
balancing, modernization and capacity expansion of existing units and
establishment of new plants. NDFC is either involved or expected to be
involved in all these forms of industrial investment by way of providing
term loans in local and foreign currencies, working capital loans, debenture
financing, underwriting of equity issues, and financial advice to all the
public sector companies except those projects which are very large such as
the steel mill or which involve the construction of infrastructure such as
Port Qasim, Indus Super Highway etc., or which are of social necessity.
Such types of projects are to be financed through the Annual Development
Program (ADP).
2.        The public sector has prepared a very ambitious investment plan
for the next five years, of which a substantial portion is programmed for
l975 and 1976. Since a significant part of the program, which relates to
industry, energy, transport and construction (amounting to Rs. 65oo million,
including foreign exchange component of Rs. 4500 million) will not be
financed by the government through ADP, the responsibility for its financing
will have to be assumed by financial institutions in general and NDFC in
particular. In view of the obvious scarcity of resources in relation to
requirements, the government has set up priorities for investment projects
which call for a simultaneous development of industries and other related
sectors such as transport, energy, construction etc.. In the case of
industry, the priorities are assigned to energy producing, agro-based and
basic industries, and those producing essential wage goods with export
orientation. Among these industries, the emphasis is on those projects which
are based on locally made machinery and use maximum local raw material inputs.
NDFC has therefore planned its strategy over the next two years in line with
the foregoing market opportunities and government priorities. Consequently,
it has identified for its involvement energy development and distribution
projects, rice mills, sugar mills, paper mills, cement plants, engineering
and basic chemical industries etc.. To reduce the time lag between invest-
ment and production, NDFC will give special priority to undertakings which
are already in operation and need to expand, balance or modernize their
existing facilities.

3.        Keeping in view the financing requirements of the units over the
next two years, we expect our foreign currency loan sanction and disburse-
ment to be approximately $60 million and $35 million respectively and local
currency loans sanction and disbursement (including short term loans and
supplier's credit) to be about Rs. 650 million and Rs. 550 million
respectively. The requirement of foreign currency is expected to be met
through funds provided by IBRD, Asian Development Bank and oil producing
countries. The total availability of foreign resources over the next two
years is expected to reach $80 million approximately. In order to increase
its domestic resources through mobilization of private savings in deposit
schemes, NDFC has planned to open five branches during 1975 in Karachi,
Rawalpindi, Peshawar, and Quetta.  Branches in other important towns will
be opened during 1976. To maintain a healthy debt/equity ratio, NDFC hgs
also planned an increase of Rs. 20 million in its equity during 1976.
The present Rs. 50 million credit line from the State Bank of Pakistan will
not be utilized except when absolutely necessary and then only for a very
short period. The refinancing provided by the State Bank will, however, be
availed fully for our supplier's credit and export financing schemes.
4.        To keep up with the growth of its lending activities and resource
development, NDFC will require additional professional staff. Its recruit-
ment plan aims at strengthening its engineering and marketing departments
in addition to the general enlargement of other sections of the organization.
To overcome the shortage of trained personnel, on account of excessive
brain-drain, NDFC has prepared an executive development program which apart
from training on the job, provides opportunities to its executives to
participate in training programs in their respective fields organized in
Pakistan and abroad.
