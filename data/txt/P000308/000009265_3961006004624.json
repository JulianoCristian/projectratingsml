Project are to: a) enhance the onset of\n            fertility decline by increasing the prevalence of modern\n            methods of contraception; and b) slow the spread of Human\n            Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections by promoting\n            behavioral change and treating Sexually Transmitted Diseases\n            (STDs). To this end, the project will support policies and\n            investments designed to support the implementation of the\n            Government's population policy by improving quality of,\n            and access to, family planning (FP) and maternal and child\n            health care services nationwide; promoting information,\n            education, and communication programs in the areas of\n            population, FP and women's rights; and strengthening\n            institutions in charge of implementing the national\n            population policy and of planning, managing and evaluating\n            FP programs. The project will also strengthen the national\n            capacity to contain the spread of HIV, Acquired\n            Immune-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), STDs by strengthening the\n            institution in charge of implementing the national AIDS\n            program and the health system's capacity to deal with\n            AIDS needs; promoting safer health practices and behavioral\n            change through information, education, and communications\n            campaigns; promoting the use of condoms; treating STDs; and\n            strengthening clinical management and community care.\n            Finally, the project will encourage private sector and\n            non-governmental organizations participation in population,\n            FP and HIV/AIDS/STD programs by establishing a fund to\n            provide grant financing for projects in those areas."}, "docdt": "1994-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
