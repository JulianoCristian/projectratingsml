with\n            substantial institutional development impacts, and, despite\n            inadequate Bank support during the first four years of\n            implementation, its performance is rated marginally\n            satisfactory, while the borrower's performance is rated\n            satisfactory, given its ability to overcome disbursement\n            delays, and channeling of funds to communities, and line\n            ministries. Lessons address five broad categories: 1)\n            Project experience demonstrated that although\n            nongovernmental organizations, and associations do hold an\n            intimate knowledge of local communities, and in dealing with\n            beneficiaries, they have limited technical, financial\n            management, and monitoring and evaluation capacities. Thus,\n            competitive processes to award contracts should be promoted,\n            performance indicators strengthened, and monitoring criteria\n            adapted. 2) The community driven approach, and pace should\n            be adapted to the local socio-cultural context, focused on\n            care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS. 3) Behavioral change is\n            more likely to occur if preventive messages are accompanied\n            by genuine changes in gender dynamics, i.e., changes that\n            empower women to better control their sexuality, while\n            multi-sectoral common goals should transcend institutional\n            boundaries. 4) Performance indicators should be selected to\n            achieve program goals, and objectives, within realistic\n            targets, by assessing institutional arrangements capable of\n            handling monitoring and evaluation. 5) Flexible procedures\n            should be adopted for channeling funds, to improve\n            accountability, raise motivation, and accelerate the pace of implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
