The issues include the following: Reduce\n            water and land pollution caused by setting a sediment basin\n            and oil trap for factory sewage, using septic tanks to\n            control domestic sewage, treating domestic sewage, and\n            isolating and fencing disposal sites, using temporary dump\n            sites in the construction area, sending waste to a\n            government-approved landfill weekly, and strictly executing\n            a wastewater discharge standard, and recovering land after\n            site removal and replanting. To control noise nuisance,\n            select low-noise equipment, use shock absorbers and noise\n            insulation, schedule reasonable operation times, ban night\n            construction but if needed give local people advance notice,\n            prohibit night driving, and warn local residents if blasting\n            is needed. To control dust, use dustproof covers for\n            machinery and cement areas, and spray area and access roads.\n            To promote worker health and safety, set up medical\n            facilities and encourage hygiene control, and train workers.\n            To reduce soil erosion and surface water  runoff, plan\n            construction for the dry season, use designated sites for\n            deposits, avoid disposal in water bodies, use silt traps,\n            and restore farmland. Get official approval before\n            proceeding with construction when finding cultural\n            artifacts. Ban the purchase of any electrical or hydro\n            mechanical equipment that contains polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)."}, "docdt": "2005-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
