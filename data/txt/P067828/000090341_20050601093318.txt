A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1.CountryandSector Issues
China's primary energy consumption more than doubled from 600 million tons of coal
equivalent (Mtce) in 1980 to about 1,300 Mtce in 2000, whereas the gross domestic product
(GDP) quadrupled during the same period. Although based on slightly different growth
assumptions, studies carried out in the late 1990s and early 2000s by the Government of China
(GoC) and international agencies concluded that even in the case of increased and sustained
energy efficiency efforts, energy consumption will continue to grow rapidly to between 1,850
and 2,150 Mtce in2010 and to between 2,500 and 3,300 Mtce in2020.' They also concluded that
even with an aggressivefuel diversification policy, coal will remain the dominant energy source.

As did most of the studies, the one by the Chinese Energy ResearchInstitute found that coal's
share in primary energy consumption, which accounted for 66 percent in 2000, would decrease
only slightly to about 65 percent by 2010, and slightly less than 60 percent in 2020 even if
exceptional efforts were made in diversifying primary energy sources and improving overall
energy efficiency (the "green scenario"). Under business as usual, coal's share inprimary energy
consumption would decrease to about 63 percent in 2020. Evidence from the early 2000s
indicates that these and other studies have underestimated primary energy consumption growth.
Primary energy consumption has soaredfrom 1,300 Mtce in 2000 to around 1,700 Mtce in2004,
or 80 to 95 percent of the low andhigh studies' forecasts for consumption in2010.

About 50 percent of the coal consumed in 2004 was used for electricity generation. China's
electric generating capacity i s projected to increase from a little less than 400 GW in 2004 to
between 950 and 1,100 GW by 2020. During this same period, coal-based electric generation
capacity i s expected to grow threefold to about 700 GW. This will require building about 500 to
650 GW of coal-based capacity (in the case of the more likely high growth, about 450 GW to
meet the fast-growing demand and about 200 GW to replace existing capacity). Coal-based
generation will remain the predominant mode of electricity generation until 2030, and will
account for more than 60 percent of total capacity and supply about 70 percent of total electricity
generation.

The damage caused by SO2 and NO, emissions to agriculture and health i s at the center of the
debate on the 1lth    Five-Year Plan and the long-term energy plan (China 2020). Estimates of the
costs vary, according to existing studies, from 3 to 7 percent currently and could grow to as high
as 13 percent of GDP in 2020 ifenvironmental issues are not properly addressed. Emissions of
carbon from coal combustion will also increasefrom about 820 million tons in 2000 to more than
1.1billion tons in 2010 and more than 1.8 billion tons in 2020 even with sustained efforts in
energy efficiency and fuel diversification. Even then, China's carbon dioxide (CO2)emissions


    Four studies of particular relevance are (a) "Basic Concepts of the National Energy Strategy"
    2004-Unpublished    draft by the Development Research Center based on a study by the Chinese Energy
    ResearchInstitute presentedduring a workshop entitled "China Development Forum: China's National Energy
    Strategy and Reform," Beijing November 15-17, 2003; (b) World Energy Outlooks 2002 and 2004,
    InternationalEnergy Agency; and (c) International Energy Outlook 2004-Energy Information Administration,

per capita would amount to only 20 to 30 percent of Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries in 2010 and 2020, respectively.

China's highest-level authorities recognize that a business-as-usualapproach inthe energy sector
would lead to unacceptable environmental damages. They recently adopted a multipronged
energy strategy aiming at (a) improving the efficiency of the energy sector and bringing energy
intensity in line with international best practice; (b) increasing gas penetration and aggressively
developing renewable energy use, especially for power generation; (c) further developing clean
coal technologies; and (d) securing energy supply to meet the country's growing needs. Chinese
authorities recognize the vital need to pursue vigorously each prong of the strategy and to rely
more on market-based approaches to achieve the higher-level objectives of sustainable
development and a "well-off' society.

Renewable Energy Strategy. Scaling-up of renewable energy for electricity generation in
particular will require a shift from off-grid and demonstration approaches to increased
commercialization of high-potential technologies. China has abundant undeveloped resources of
small hydropower, wind, biomass, geothermal, and solar energy. Exploitation of these resources
has been constrained by an inadequate legal and regulatory framework, high costs of renewable-
based electricity generation, insufficient assessment of the resource, and lack of or inadequate
financing. Creation of an adequate legal and regulatory framework, cost reductions, and
internalization of fossil fuel externalities and capacity building to improve design, construction,
andoperation to improve competitiveness with fossil fuel-based generation are all needed.

Economic studies, undertaken as part of project preparation, have demonstrated that much more
of China's renewable resources can be developed to produce electricity below the system
avoided cost, particularly if institutional barriers are lifted and external costs of damage caused
by coal-fired generation are considered. The GoC has therefore developed a strategy for scaling
up renewable energy-based capacity for power generation based on (a) development and
implementation of a legal and regulatory framework, in step with the overall reform process,
which supports and encourages the development of renewable energy resources; (b) access to
advanced technology and techniques to improve quality, reduce cost, and permit the economic
exploitation of renewable energy resources through the assimilation of best international practice
in research, manufacturing, assembly, and installation as well as in operation; and (c)
strengthening of the capacity of existing companies to develop, finance, construct, and operate
renewable energy on a large scale and further opening of the sector to privateinvestors.

The GoC has, with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other donor assistance, prepared
a Renewable Energy Law (REL)that was approved by the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress on February 28, 2005. Implementing regulations are now under preparation.
Further details on the sector background are provided in Annex 1 and the GoC's program for
development of the renewable energy subsector i s set out in a letter from a vice Chairman of the
NationalDevelopment and ReformCommission (NDRC), which i s reproducedinAnnex 1A.

2. Rationale for BankInvolvement
The Bank and GEF provided extensive support during the preparation and discussion of the
renewable energy strategy. Studies and consultation activities supported by the Bank and GEF
introduced the concept of law- and regulation-based, market-oriented support for renewable


                                                   2

energy. Such support would address three critical barriers to renewable-based electricity
generation: (a) the financial prices of fossil fuel- (especially coal-) based electricity generation
do not reflect the costs of environmental damage; (b) the resulting incremental financial cost of
renewable-based electricity cannot be passed on to the end consumer; and (c) renewable
electricity generators are often unable to obtain access to the electricity grid on the same terms as
other generators.

The dialogue between the Bank and China has centered around the most appropriate way to
overcome these obstacles. There is now general agreement on the need to work in step with the
reform of the electricity sector and implement a policy mandating that either a share of the
electricity delivered to end consumers by power companies comes from renewable sources or by
imposing an obligation on power companies to buy renewable energy-based electricity at a
government-determined price. Concomitant with that obligation are the rights of the power
companies to recover the additional cost from consumers and for electricity generators to be able
to connect to the grid. The term mandated market policy (MMP)i s usedinthis document to refer
to systems incorporating these three principles.

The continued involvement of the Bank and GEF will increase the prospects for the successful
introduction of the MMP and the accompanying technology transfer and knowledge upgrade
neededfor the successful and sustainedscaling-up of renewable energy use inChina. The Bank's
sustained engagement, within the programmatic approach approved by the GEF Council, will
facilitate the implementation of the strategy and sustain the scaling-up through (a) support and
leverage of investment in renewable energy generation; (b) policy advice and institutional
support during the implementation of the REL based on international best practice; and (c)
transfer of technology and upgrade of renewable energy technology to improve quality and
reducecost. Annex 2 provides information on related projects and the lessons learned from them.

3. Higher-Level Objectives to Which the Project Contributes
The most recent full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board on December
19, 2002 (Report No. 25141-CHA), focuses on supporting China's sustainable transition from a
rural to an urban society and from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. An important
theme within the CAS is to facilitate an environmentally sustainable development process,
including dealing with global environment and air quality issues, to which increased electricity
generation from renewable energy sources will contribute. The program will also contribute to
the GoC objectives of economic development in the lagging regions, because much of the
renewable energy resource i s in those areas. More significant penetration of renewable energy
resources will also contribute to increased security of supply and more predictable prices.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1.LendingInstrument
The proposed Bank specific investment loan (SIL) supports the first phase of a three-phase GEF
adaptable program. The GEF program i s justified by the long-term and complex nature of the
policy issueshampering the scale-up of renewable energy and the need for a flexible approachto
adapt to the fast-changing environment and the priorities as they emerge during implementation.
The Borrower's choice of SILs to contribute to the scale-up of renewable energy-based power



                                                  3

capacity i s justified by uncertainties about the physical investment needs and the sources of
funding for them in future years. Other lending instruments, such as a sector adjustment loan on
a Bank Adaptable Program Loan (APL) synchronized with the GEF program were considered,
but rejected as unsuitable for the proposed project, especially because of the project approval
framework in China.

The Borrower has expressedpreference for a variable spread loan (VSL), which i s perceived as
having the characteristics needed for the project. The lending instruments were discussed with
the implementing agencies and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and confirmed during
negotiations.

2. Program Objective andPhases
The program objective i s to enable commercial renewable electricity suppliers to provide energy
to the electricity market efficiently, cost-effectively, and on a large scale.

The core of the program i s GEF-financed support for institution and capacity building for the
scale-up of renewable energy based electricity generation capacity. The Program Brief outlining
this concept was approvedby the GEFCouncil inMay 2001.

Phase 1
The first phase will contribute to the program's global objective through development and
implementation of the legal and regulatory framework to create and gradually increase the share
of renewable energy-based electricity generation, and will support its effective implementation
in four pilot provinces. The REL has been enacted and will be effective on January 1, 2006.
Associated implementation regulations will be prepared and promulgated during this phase.
Effective implementation and enforcement, which have always been problematic and uneven for
environmental laws, will be piloted in four provinces, namely Fujian, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu,
and Zhejiang and supported by well-targeted and sustained technical assistance (TA).
Technology transfer at the national level will be supported through capacity building and TA,
focusing particularly on wind and biomass. Investments in important technologies will be
undertaken in the four pilot provinces to demonstrate the viability of large-scale, renewable
energy-based electricity generation. Expected duration i s 3-4 years. GEF will provide a
US$40.22 million grant to support the institutional development and capacity building
component during the first phase, with cost-sharing from participants expected to contribute a
further US$48.6 million for a total cost of about US$88.82 million.'

Triggers to move from GEFphase 1to 2 will be basedon indicators of institutionalprogress and
scale-up of renewable energy development and will include (a) issuingof required regulations to
implement the REG (b) publication of resource assessments for at least two pilot provinces and
technology improvement subgrants signed with at least five companies; (c) full commitment and
disbursement of at least half of the GEF grant for the first phase; and (d) approval by State
Council of Bank-financed investments inall four pilot provinces.
'   The cost-sharing is based only on the direct costs borne by the participants in the GEF-supported, cost-shared
    activities (which comprise around 33 percent of the proposed GEFbudget), using a ratio of 1:3, which is based
    on experiencegainedduring implementation of the Renewable Energy Development Project. Indirect and other
    contributing programs' costs are more important, but difficult to quantify.


                                                        4

Phase 2
Phase 2 will continue to support the program's global objectives through institutional
development and capacity building to further decrease cost, and to improve the financing
framework and provide assistance for implementation in about 10 provinces. TA will be
provided for the implementation of the REL and regulations in an increased number of
provinces, as required. Continued support for technology transfer, quality improvement, and cost
reduction will be provided for wind and other selectedtechnologies, buildingon Phase 1results
and market needs. Expected duration i s three to four years. Total cost for TA is expected to be
about US$120 million, of which about US$50 million GEF grant.

Phase 2 to phase 3 triggers will be determined during appraisal of phase 2, but are likely to
include measures of progress in the implementation of the law and achievement of the program
performance indicators, measures of investment (Bank- and non-Bank-financed) in renewable          .
energy inthe phase 1and 2 provinces, and measures of progressincost reduction.

Phase 3
The thirdphase will contribute to the full achievement of the program's global objective through
support to the remaining less developed provinces in their implementation of the REL and
regulations. TA would continue to be provided for institutional strengthening and capacity
building to meet international and best practice standards in constructing and operating
renewable energy-based electricity production facilities in the country. Continued support for
localization, quality improvement, and cost reduction will be provided to bring selected
technologies to competitiveness with fossil fuel-based electricity generation. Further lending to
support investment (additional loans and repeater projects mainly to reduce processing time and,
exceptionally, S L s ) will be discussed, on a need basis, with GoC. Expected duration i s three to
four years. Total cost for TA i s expected to be about US$150-200 million (of which about
US$50 million GEF grant).

Bank Investment Support
Bank investment support in the first phase is aimed at supporting scale-up in the pilot provinces.
Further lendingto support investment will be discussed, on a need basis, with GoC to bridge the
gap for financing needs to sustain scale-up in phase 2. Bank investment support in each phase
will be on an "as required" basis. Its impact in terms of investment and scale-up of renewable
energy will be assessed for their contribution toward achievement of the objectives of the
program according to GEFprogramtriggers to move from one phase to the next.

pilot provinces.

Project performance indicators are set out inAnnex 3.

4. Project Components
The project comprises two components: institutional development and capacity building and
supportfor wind andbiomass inpilot provinces.

Institutional Development and CapacityBuilding: GEF grant US$40.22 million, cost-sharing
US$48.60million
The InstitutionalDevelopment and Capacity Buildingcomponent was designed to meet national
priorities and the needs of the pilot provinces to initiate the scale-up of renewable energy, and
will include the following:

     IvMPresearch and implementation support. Studies on further development of the MMP and
     its implementation, particularly on targets, tariff levels, policy development, sharing of
     incremental cost, trading and carbon trading, and long-term planning and preparation of
     implementing regulations. The main counterparts for these activities will be government
     bodies, and the mainoutcome will be legislation and regulations leading to sustained scaling-
     upof renewable energy.
     Technology improvement for wind and biomass. This will cover technology development
     based on important local investments leveraged by small grants, cost-shared grants or both,
     for wind and biomass. In addition for wind, it will cover preparation of standards,
     development of certification and establishment of a testing center. Beneficiaries will be
     Chinese wind and biomass equipment and related service suppliers, government bodies
     dealing with standards, and testing and accreditation agencies.
     Long-term capacity building. Support will be provided to selected universities to enter into
     twinning arrangements with leading international universities to develop postgraduate-level
     or specialist renewable energy engineering and other related courses and to offer fellowship
     programs to support senior specialists studying abroad.
At the provincial level, TA will be provided for effective implementation of the REL and
initiation of sustainedscale-up or renewable energy:

 e   Implementation of the MMP by focusing on the tasks to make the RELeffective in the pilot
     provinces, aimed principally at provincial government bodies and other stakeholders.

 0   Support to ensure the success of the investment projects by providing assistance in design,
     procurement, construction, and operations and maintenance, as needed by each project
     sponsor.




                                                  6

   Pilot or demonstration projects to be carried out in the pilot provinces supporting
   technologies other than wind, biomass, and small hydro with potential for replication in the
   pilot provinces component. In addition, a pilot offshore wind farm will be prepared for
   implementation inphase 2.
   Renewable resource assessments for eachof the pilot provinces.
   Capacity buildingfor market participants.
    Support for investment scale-up with the sponsors of the investment subprojects financed
   under the Support for Wind and Biomass in Pilot Provinces Component. The purpose i s to
   builda strong pipeline of bankablerenewable energy projects with strong sponsors.

   The Institutional Development and Capacity Building Component will include program
    management and will cover the sustaining costs of the Project Management Office (PMO),
    GoC, and donor coordination activities, monitoring and evaluation, and administration,
    including fiduciary duties.

Supportfor Wind and Biomass in Pilot Provinces: total cost US$140million, Bankfinancing
US$87million
Two subcomponents, one for Fujian Province and one for Rudong Province, are submitted for
Board approval.

InFujian, a 100 MW wind farm at Changjiang'ao, Pingtan Island. The Pingtan wind farm will
consist of wind turbines, associatedcivil and electrical works, an extension to an existing control
room, a switchyard, and a 15 km, 110 kV transmission line from the wind farm to the Beicuo
substation, which will be upgraded to meet the evacuation needs of the wind farm. Total cost of
the subcomponent i s expected to be US$103.92 million, of which US$67 million i s to be
financed by the Bank.

InJiangsu, a 25 MW straw-fired biomass power plant at Mabei Village, Rudong County. The
Rudongpower plant will consist of one 110ton per hour, high-temperature, high-pressure straw-
fired boiler, one 25 MW steam turbine, and associated mechanical, electrical, and civil works.
Total cost of the power plant i s expected to be US$36.08 million, of which US$20 million i s to
be financed by the Bank.

GoC has committed to the first phase of the China Renewable Energy Scale-up Program
(CRESP) consisting of four pilot provinces and four investment subcomponents.The investment
subcomponents, which have been appraised but which have not yet secured all the required
domestic approvals, are a 100 MW wind farm at Huitengxile, Inner Mongolia, and a bundle of
rehabilitation and new build small hydro projects in Zhejiang totaling 83 MW in additional
capacity. The Huitengxile wind farm and the small hydro projects will be submitted for the
Board's consideration as soon as they secure their domestic approvals.

projects inAdditional Annex 5A.

5. LessonsLearnedand Reflected inthe Project Design
The evidence accumulated over some 20 years suggests that a complementary set of coordinated
and focused policies i s necessary to correct market failures that prevent the adequate reflection of
the costs of environmental damage in electricity prices and to develop and sustain markets for
renewable energy. Supply-side policies to achieve cost reduction and quality improvement are
necessary to increase the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies, but are not on their
own sufficient to overcome barriers duringthe transition period.

Sustainability requires (a) development of a competitive environment in the renewable energy
subsector to reduce technology and project development costs; (b) flexibility to allow quick
adaptation to changing market conditions, such as restructuring and deregulation of power
sectors; and (c) minimal reliance on administrative procedures, and increased focus on market-
basedapproaches as soon as barriers are removed.

The following lessons were learnedfrom renewable energy assistanceinChina:

       Consensus among all concerned agencies i s vital to project success.
       The renewable energy resource for individual projects must be carefully assessed and
       checked.
        Attention must be paid to arrangements for procurement and construction that are in line
        with international bestpractice to ensure rapid and effective implementation.
        Agreement on important principles that are essential to the project functioning as
        envisaged (for example, power offtake and purchase agreements) should be established
        before project appraisal
        TA must be coordinated with the construction of the physical parts of the project to
        ensure that the implementing agencies have adequate and timely knowledge of
        construction, operation, and maintenance.
        Technology transfer efforts are needed to secure improvements to the supply side,
        includingreductions in cost and improvements inquality.

Incorporation of these lessons learned in the proposed program or project required full
engagement of all concerned Chinese agencies. Developing consensus on the MMF and project
strategy through intensive dialogue within China took longer than expected, but despite that has
taken less time than inmany other countries.

6. Alternatives Considered and Reasonsfor Rejection
Various options for assisting scale-up of renewable energy in China were considered. Further
investment activities following on from the successful pilot scale investment in wind under
Renewable Energy Development Project (REDP; Loan 4488-CHA) were considered, but these
alone would not have overcome the barriers to broadening participation nor the bias against
renewable energy-based electricity generation. A GEF-supported, comprehensive, stand-alone


                                                  8

TA activity designed to introduce the necessary laws and regulations was also considered, but
rejected on the basis that experience in China on implementation has been mixed and that
support for effective implementation, enforcement, and investment would be needed. A program
consisting mainly of TA, with limited investment support was originally contemplated and
pursued, but after commitment by the GoC to embark on a large-scale development of renewable
energy, it became evident that the need for investments would require strong support from both
public and private sectors, and the catalytic effect of Bank financing was considered essential,
especially inthe first phase, to the success of the project.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1.InstitutionalDevelopmentandImplementationArrangements

Institutional Development and Capacity Building Component
The Institutional and Capacity Building component will be a single national program
implemented through a national PMO under the Energy Bureau of NDRC. The CRESP PMO
was first formed in May 2002 to undertake project preparation and will increase its capacity by
adding and training new staff when the project enters into its implementation phase. The PMO
has the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of NDRC and, during preparation,
demonstratedits ability to meet Bank fiduciary requirements.

Supportfor Wind and Biomass in Pilot Provinces Component
The developers of the Pingtan wind farm in Fujian will establish a special-purpose company in
which the China Long Yuan Electric Power Group Corporation (Long Yuan), a subsidiary of
Guodian Corporation, one of the five state-owned generation companies, will be the majority
shareholder. Long Yuan will also be responsible for operation of the plant. It i s a credible
developer and a shareholder in the wind farm financed in Shanghai under the REDP. It has the
capacity to manage the technical, commercial, and fiduciary aspects of the project. Funds will be
onlent directly from,theMOF to Long Yuan with a guarantee providedby Guodian Corporation.

The Rudong power plant is sponsored by Jiangsu Guo Xin Investment Group Ltd (Guo Xin),
which i s owned by Jiangsu Province. It has established a special purpose project company that
will own and operate the power plant, Jiangsu Guo Xin New Energy Development Company
Ltd. (NED).Guo Xin is a minority owner of the Yixing PumpedStorage power plant, financed
by the Bank (Loan 4686-CHA), and has the capacity to manage the technical and commercial
aspects of the project and has knowledge of financial management procedures. TA will be
provided to address the fiduciary weaknesses identified during the financial management

plant are set out in Annex 8, and for the Huitengxile wind farm and the Zhejiang small hydro
projects in Additional Annex 8A. They have all been confirmed at appraisal with respective
counterparts.

2. MonitoringandEvaluationof OutcomesandResults
Development of capacity to enable the GoC to monitor and evaluate the impact of the RELi s an
integral part of the Institutional Development and Capacity Building Component and will be
undertaken by the PMO. A full-time member of the PMO will be assignedto collect information
and develop databases, if they are required, to monitor the performance and progress of
implementation of both components. A monitoring and evaluation plan will be prepared during
the first year of implementation, and training and support will be provided to the PMO, as
required.

Data sources include the China statistical yearbook (national and provincial), market data,
project progress reports and third-party assessments through technical and social surveys.
Monitoring data on implementing the REL will be provided to relevant agencies through the
PMO and NDRC management and information systems developed during project
implementation.

The monitoring framework for the Pingtan wind farm and the Rudong biomass power plant are
described in Annex 3, and for the Huitengxile wind farm and the Zhejiang small hydro projects
inAdditional Annex 3A.

3. SustainabilityandReplicability
The GoC's renewed commitment to the support and development of renewable energy i s
documented inthe Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP), which i s attachedin Additional
Annex 1A.

The passage of the REL introducing an MMP is a major step toward sustainable scale-up of
renewable energy. Success now hinges on adequate regulations and design of an effective
regulatory system with GEF support to ensure adequate implementation. Sustainability i s likely
because (a) the rapid progress in developing and passing the law indicates the desire of the
government to meet the sector development objectives; and (b) the programmatic approach
provides a means of steadily broadening and deepening the engagement of all concerned parties,
leading to the point where the environment for renewable energy has been embedded into the
legal and institutional framework of the country in step with the long-term plan outlined by the
GoC inits LSDP.

Sustainability of the investment projects has been aided by reflecting in their institutional
arrangements the principles set out in the law, namely creating a long-term requirement for
renewable electricity at the provincial level, backed by Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and
ensuring cost recovery. The project supports this goal through various activities envisaged under
the InstitutionalDevelopment andCapacity Buildingcomponent.

4. CriticalRisks andPossible Controversial Aspects
The progradproject risk was rated as high at the concept stage. In hindsight, difficulties
encountered during the first two to three years of preparation and even after the approval of the
GEF grant by the GEF Council justified the rating. However, continued engagement of
concerned agencies through studies and consultation seminars led to a strong support of all
concerned agencies to the approach and concept of the progrdproject. The risk has been
loweredto substantial at this stage.

5. LoanConditionsand Covenants
There are no unusual loan conditions or covenants. Standard effectiveness conditions will apply:
execution and delivery of the loan and grant agreement must be duly authorized, and a legal
opinion that the agreement i s legally binding must be furnished. Conditions of disbursement for
each of the investment subcomponents will include signature of related subsidiary loan
agreements, and for Long Yuan, the formation of the special-purpose company. To avoid holding
up the implementation of other subcomponents, individual requirements-for             example, the
signature of subsidiary loan agreements between the provincial finance bureaus and the
implementing companies-will       be made conditions of disbursement.

Implementation conditions will include agreements that sales prices and quantities for electricity
and connection arrangements will be provided for each project. Financial reporting and auditing
requirements will be followed, and the owners of the Pingtan wind farm andthe Rudongbiomass
project will be covenanted to pay in equity and limit dividend payments out of the project
companies to a maximum of net income.

D.APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.Economic andFinancialAnalyses

EconomicAnalysis
At the program level, economic, financial, and fiscal impact analyses of various MMP policy
options have been undertaken, using a simulation model. Inthe case of business as usual and no


                                                  12

renewable energy scale-up program, the likely renewable energy-based electricity generation
would be 36 TWh in 2010 or 1.2 percent of total generation. A program focused on increasing
power generation from renewable energy sources, the costs of which are below the avoided
financial cost of coal generation, would result in a renewable energy contributionof 79 TWh per
year by 2010, excluding external costs and 89 TWh if they are included. Net annual benefits are
estimated to be US$1.2 billion in 2010 and the NPV of the program estimated to be US$3.79
billion at a 12percent discount rate. It must be noted that the government has announced a more
ambitious target indicating higher assumptions on values of externalities, more optimistic
assumptions for cost reduction or, possibly more importantly, a lower discount rate.

Additional analyses were also carried out to assess the sensitivity of the results to the different
assumptions and in particular to the discount rate. A separate, additional, target of 11TWh of
wind (about 4 GW of capacity) was examined because wind does not make a contribution to the
89 TWh per year in 2010 under the assumptions considered in the study (especially the 12
percent discount rate). The analysis suggested that such a program would cost about US$410
million at a 12 percent discount rate and would be economically justified at a discount rate of
about 5 percent.

Incremental cost analyses have been carried out for the removal of barriers to investments that
are assumed to become economically viable with consideration of environmental externalities
during the lifetime of the program. With the program, and ignoring the external benefits, an
incremental 115 TWh of electricity would be generated from renewable sources. This would
result in an incremental reduction of carbon emissions of about 800 million tons during the 20-
year lifetime of the installed capacity. For a GEF incremental cost of US$140 million, this
implies that the cost perton of carbon i s around US$0.17.

Cost-benefit analyses of the Pingtan wind farrn and Rudong biomass power plants have been
carried out, and the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) are, respectively, 13.6 percent and
20.8 percent when externalities are taken into account.

Financial Analysis
Inaddition to the analysis of benefits to the economy, financial analyseshave been carried out to
assess the incremental financial costs of the policies and their impact on the distribution of costs
and benefits among different groups in society, including consumers, equity investors, renewable
electricity producers, coal electricity producers, banks, and government. The main financial
gains to the power sector are from reduced coal and financing costs. The main costs stem from
increases in civil construction and taxes. Net discounted financial benefit of achieving the 89
TWhper year by 2010 is US$2.9 billion.

Fiscal Impact
Fiscal impact to local and provincial government i s small, with a discounted gain of about
US$lOO million over the program from taxes being paid by the new power plant to provincial
and local governments.




                                                 13

InvestmentProjects
Financial performance of each individual investment project has also been analyzed. The
financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Pingtan wind farm i s 6.5 percent and for the
Rudong biomass plant 10.6 percent. The sensitivity and risk analyses carried out show that these
results are robust andindicate an adequatefinancial viability of the proposedproject.

For further discussion of the economic and financial analysis for the Pingtan wind farm and
Rudong biomass power plant, see Annex 9, and for the Huitengxile wind farm and Zhejiang
small hydro projects, see Additional Annex 9A. Incremental cost analysis i s discussed in more
detail inAnnex 15.

2. Technical
Each investment subproject has been designed in accordance with international standards and
best practice.

For the Pingtan wind farm, the design and layout used internationally recognized standards for
wind resource assessment and energy calculation. Variable-speed pitch regulated machines
meetinginternational standards will be specified for their superior performance and output power
quality, which will help improve local system stability. Design specifications require wind
turbines to meet local environmental conditions, including salt-laden air. The Institutional
Development and Capacity Building component will provide support for the wind farm to ensure
that best practices inoperation and maintenance are followed.

The biomass power plant i s based on designs and components that have been commercially
proven. Combustion technology has been chosen over more advanced, but commercially
unproven gasification concepts. Design specifications will set out requirements for dealing with
local feedstock. Feedstock availability has been carefully reviewed and risks of interruptions in
fuel supply have been offset by arrangements for stockpiling and setting up multiple sources of
supply. The InstitutionalDevelopment and Capacity BuildingComponent will provide financing
to hire consultant support during construction and to set up fuel supply arrangements. The
feasibility study has beenreviewedby the World Bank and international consultants andfound to
be adequate.

3. Fiduciary

FinancialManagement
InFujian and Jiangsu the assessment concluded that the project companies met minimumBank
financial management requirements. An action plan has been agreed to ensure that adequate
financial management capacity will be in place and developed in the special purpose companies
by project disbursement.

The financial management capacity of the CRESP PMO, which has been responsible for
implementation of the two preparation grants, was reassessed. The assessment concluded that the
PMO meets minimum Bank financial management requirements and will have in place an
adequate financial management system.

Financial management for the Pingtan wind farm and Rudong biomass power plant i s further
discussed in Annex 7, and for the Huitengxile wind farm and Zhejiang small hydro projects in
Additional Annex 7A.

Procurement
For the investment subcomponent inFujian, the procurement capacity assessment noted that the
parent company has previous experience with Bank procurement. InJiangsu the parent company
has extensive experience with power sector projects, but not with Bank procurement. Both
companies have received additional procurement and disbursement training. Procurement risk is
considered average.

The procurement capacity of the CRESPPMO was assessedas adequate.

For the potential projects, the Inner Mongolia North Long Yuan Wind Power Company
(NLYWPC) has extensive experience with wind power projects, but not with Bank procurement.
It was, however, considered to have adequate capacity to carry out procurement activities
according to Bank Guidelines. NLYWPC is, in addition, now partly owned by Long Yuan,
which is quite familiar with World Bank procurement procedures. The ZHPDMC has extensive
experience of small hydro projects and will have a dedicated procurement section. All companies
will use procurement agents familiar with Bank procedures.

Procurement arrangements for the PMO, the Pingtan wind farm andthe Rudong biomass projects
are in Annex 8. Arrangements for the Huiterigxile wind farm and the Zhejiang small hydro
projects are discussedin Additional Annex 8A.

4. Social
No major social issues have been identified. The wider social impact of the REL will be
monitored during project implementation, whereas social impacts at the investment
subcomponent level are subject to independent monitoring.

5. Environment
The project contributes to environmentally sustainable growth and protecting people's health
from environmental pollution. Reduction inlocal pollutants-S02,    NOx,andparticulates, as well
as COz, will be monitored by reference to the substitution of renewables for coal-based
electricity. Monitoring will take account of both direct investment through the project and
indirect investment induced as a result of the introductionof the MMP inpilot provinces.

Heavy Reliance on Coal

China's primary energy consumption more than doubled from 600 million tons of coal
equivalent (Mtce) in 1980 to about 1,300 Mtce in 2000, whereas the GDP quadrupled during the
same period. Although based on slightly different growth assumptions, several studies carried
out in the late 1990s and early 2000s by GoC and international agencies concluded that even in
the case of increased and sustained energy efficiency efforts, energy consumption will. continue
to grow rapidly to between 1,850 and 2,150 Mtce in 2010 and to between 2,500 and 3,300 Mtce
in 2020.3They also concluded that even with an aggressive fuel diversification policy, coal will
remain the dominant energy source.

As did most of the studies, the one by the Chinese Energy ResearchInstitute, found that coal's
share in primary energy consumption, which accounted for 66 percent in 2000, would decrease
only slightly, to about 65 percent by 2010, and slightly less than 60 percent in 2020 even if
exceptional efforts were made in diversifying primary energy sources and improving overall
energy efficiency (the "green scenario"). Under business as usual, coal's share inprimary energy
consumption would decrease to about 63 percent in 2020. Evidence from the early 2000s
indicates that these and other studies have underestimated primary energy consumption growth.
Primary energy consumption has soared from 1,300 Mtce in 2000 to around 1,700 Mtce in 2004,
or 80 to 95 percent of the low and highstudies' forecasts for consumption in2010.

About 50 percent of the coal consumed in 2004 was used for electricity generation. China's
electric generating capacity i s projected to increase from a little less than 400 GW now to
between 950 and 1,100 GW by 2020. During this same period, coal-based electric generation
capacity is expected to grow threefold to about 700 GW. This will require buildingabout 500 to
650 GW of coal-based capacity (in the case of the more likely high growth, about 450 GW to
meet the fast growing demand and about 200 GW to replace existing capacity). Coal-based
generation will remain the predominant mode of electricity generation until 2030, accounting for
more than 60 percent of total capacity and supplying around 70 percent of total electricity
generation.

The damage caused by SO2 and NO, emissions to agriculture and health i s at the center of the                    *


debate on the 11" Five-Year Plan and the long-term energy plan (China 2020). Estimates of the
costs vary, according to existing studies, from 3 to 7 percent currently and could grow to as high
as 13 percent of GDP in 2020, ifenvironmental issues are not properly addressed. Emissions of
carbon from coal combustion will also increasefrom about 820 million tons in2000 to more than
 1.1 billion tons in 2010 and more than 1.8 billion tons in 2020 even with sustained efforts in

energy efficiency and fuel diversification. Even then, China's CO2 emissions per capita would
amount to only 20 and 30 percent of OECD countries in 2010 and 2020, respectively.

China's highest level authorities recognize that a business as usual approach in the energy sector
would lead to unacceptable environmental damages. They recently adopted a multipronged
energy strategy aiming at: (a) improving the efficiency of the energy sector and bringingenergy
intensity in line with international best practice; (b) fuel switching through increased gas
penetration and aggressive development of renewable energy use, especially for power
generation; and (c) securing energy supply to meet the country's growing needs. Chinese
authorities recognize the vital need to pursue vigorously each prong of the strategy and to rely
more on market based approaches to achieve the higher level objectives of sustainable
development and a "well off' society.

Greenhouse Gas Emission by the Power Sector

This awareness results from recognition of the negative effects of emissions from the coal
combustion needed to fuel economic growth-the             damages to human health from air pollution
and the damages to agricultural crops and natural resources caused by acid rain. In addition to
severe impacts on the national environment, China's growing consumption of fossil fuels is
projected to make it, by 2015, the leading producer in the world of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Most of the increase in carbon emissions to 1.8 billion tons in 2020 will come as a
result of a rapid increase of fossil energy con~umption.~Electricity production i s expected to
generate a significant share of these emissions, as shown inTable Al.1below.

A Power Sector inTransition toward Competitive Markets

Reforms in China's power sector during the 1980s and 1990s incurred a series of incremental
 changes that have resultedin apower sector largely unrecognizable from that inthe early 1980s.

In early 2002, government functions were largely separated from enterprise management. All
 energy enterprises were corporatized and operated as commercial businesses. Budget allocations
 have been phased out and subsidies practically eliminated. Investments are financed through
 equity and debt from a variety of public and private sources. Electricity prices were increased to
 reach, on average, long-term marginal costs of supply inmost grids.



    Asian Development Bank, "ALGAS:People's Republic of China," Manila, October, 1998.As noted above,
    such studieshaveconsistently underestimatedthe actual energy consumption growth inChina inrecent years.


                                                     18

In April 2002, after approval by the highest authorities in China, the State Council released a
comprehensive reform program inDocument No. 5:

0   Outlininga long-termvision of ex anding competition, startingwith generation and focusing
    on regional markets during the 10ti! Five-Year Plan (FYP);

0   Initiating, in the areas where conditions permit, market trials that would allow generators to
    supply electricity directly to high-voltage or large customers during the lo@' Five-Year Plan
    (2001-05). Price of the contracted electricity supply will be set through negotiation between
    the generation companies and the customers, with payments of the transmission and/or
    distribution service established according to the state regulated transmission andor
    distributiontariffs; and

0   Establishing a State Power Regulatory Agency to ensure fair competition in the competitive
    segments of the industry and protection of consumers from monopoly abuses in the
    noncompetitive segments. This i s a first step toward a modem light-handed regulation of the
    sector.

The 2002 State Council Document No. 5 i s a major step forward. It clearly states that the
objectives of the reforminChina are to continue the break up of the monopolistic structure of the
industry and gradually expand competition to improve its efficiency and ultimately provide the
customers with the best service at the lower possible cost. The plan details these objectives in
eight points: (a) break up of monopolies; (b) introduction of competition; (c) increase of
efficiency; (d) improvement of pricing mechanisms with one important requirement to link the
price paid to generators to their emissions to foster the development of renewable energy and
other clean generation; (e) optimization of resource allocation; (f)development of industry; (g)
formation of a national grid; (h) establishment of competitive electricity markets.

Despite the impressive progress achieved during the last two decades, China's power sector i s
still facing the following major issues: (a) heavy reliance on coal entailing large emissions of
GHGs, particulates, S02, and NO, with consequent environmental damages-potential           climate
change, adverse health impacts, deteriorating air quality and acid rain; (b) a piecemeal approach
to restructuring of the power sector and slow development of a regulatory framework leading to
inefficiencies and abuses of monopolistic or monopsonistic power, discrimination against
independent and small power producers and disincentives to secure supply at least cost; (c)
mismatch between loan maturities and economic lives of power projects; (d) inadequate
wholesale electricity and transmission pricing systems; (e) low efficiency of electricity supply
and use; and (0 lack of access to electricity for more than 30 million people in isolated rural
areas.

Commitment to Development of Renewable Energy

China has long had one of the world's largest renewable energy programs, leading to the
development of more than 30 GW of small hydropower and large-scale installation of improved
woodstoves and biogas plants. The government's energy strategy in the 10thFYP emphasized
renewable energy more strongly than inthe past, as one measureto reduce the power sector's use
of coal in the medium to long term, and to provide modern energy services to remote rural
households. For the first time, GHG emissions and climate change issues are dealt with in the


                                                 19

Plan. The renewable energy policy in the 10thFYP identifies five objectives for which policies
will be developed:

0  Increasing the share of electricity production comingfrom renewable energy;

0  Introducing greater competition in supply of renewable electricity to the grid and improved
   incentives to do so;

0  Supporting further commercialization andlocal manufacture of renewable energy equipment;
   Encouraging better financing mechanisms, especially for private capital; and

0  Improving cooperation between government departments.

Analyses indicated that the greatest potential for displacing coal by renewable energy was in the
power sector. The technical potential for renewable electricity in China includes about 160 GW
of wind power; over 75 GW of commercially exploitable small hydropower; approximately 125
GW (300 Mtce) biomass energy; about 6.7 GW of known geothermal energy resources; and an
abundance of solar insolation. With respect to renewable electricity, these resources make China
one of the most well endowed countries in the world. Recognizing the potential, three highlevel
Commissions in 1995 jointly prepared the New and Renewable Energy Development Program
for 1995-2010. However, the targets for the year 2000 have not beenrealized and there still exist
formidable barriers to meeting future targets, which are recognized and set out in the LSDP
contained in Annex 1A.

To address these barriers the government has passed an REL. The REL achieves a major
breakthrough for the development of renewable energy in China by recognizing the need for a
mandated market to achieve the government's ambitious goals. The government has indicated
that the law andimplementation regulations are guided by the following principles:

    Adoption of best international practice for renewable energy development, adapted for
    Chinese conditions.
    Promotion of policies that are detailed, practical, and achievable. Targets should be clearly
    specified, roles and responsibilities of different parties clearly defined, investment
    requirements calculated, and sources of financing identified.
    Integration of renewable electricity policies with power sector reform.
    Integration of renewable energy development plans with the strategic objective to develop
    Western part of country, for example, with a focus on developing small hydro power, wind
    energy and solar energy.
    Transparency during development of policies to ensure support from all stakeholders during
    implementation. The NDRC should work more closely than before with other agencies and
    consults widely with national concerned agencies, provincial and local authorities, power
    companies, renewable energy industry, and banks.

Dear Mr.Dollar,

  Re: Letter of Sector DevelopmentPolicy on Renewable Energy Developmentin China

China is a bigcountry bothin energy production and consumption.Along with the rapid
development of China's economy and the livingstandard of the people, energy demand
inChinais increasingrapidly. Underthe current energystructure,coal is the dominating
resource; oil consumption depends partially on import. Environmental protection and
energy security are becomingissues of particular concerns. Developmentandutilization
of renewableenergy is animportantoptionto improvethe environment, adjust the energy
structure, increase the energy safety, achieve diversified energy supply and ensure
sustainabledevelopmentof the energy sector.

 China is rich in renewable energy resources, of which the amount of hydro is about
 40OGW (50 MW andbelow capacityof small hydro is 120GW),; wind resourceexceeds
 1,000 GW; biomass resourceexceeds 600 million tons of standardcoal, andsolar energy
 resources are also abundant. China has the full capacity to provide clean, secure and
 sustainableenergy supplyfor nationaleconomyandsocial development.

 Since 1992, the Govemment of Chinahas signed the Rio Declaration, UNConventionon
 Climate Change etc. and has issued such documents as China Agenda for 21" Century;
 10 Countermeasuresfor Environment and Developmentin China.These actions indicate
 the determinationof the ChineseGovernmentin enforcing and implementingsustainable
 development strategy. The Government of China has set up a series of specific policy
 measures to promote the development and utilization of renewable energy and the
 development of the energy industry. The Chinese Government also conducted such
 programs as Rural Energy Comprehensive Building Program in One Hundred Counties;
 Development of Initial Rural ElectrificationCounties; the Programof Brightnessandthe
 Township ElectrificationProgram; Riding the Wind Program and the pilot wind power
 concessionprojects etc,. Good achievementshave been made in these programs. By the
 end of 2003, the total hydro power capacity in China reached IOOGW (of which small




                                        21

capacity reached 560 MW, and electric power generation fuelled by biomass reached
2,000 MW. More than 12 million rural householdbiogas digesters and more than 2,000
large and medium-sized biogas digesters had been set up in China. Installation of solar
water heaters reached more than 50 million square meters and the total capacity of PV
systemswas more than 50 MW.

During the International Conference for Renewable Energies Boon 2004, from 1 to 4
June, 2004, Ihave solemnly announced, on behalfofthe ChineseGovernment, that China
would start to develop the Renewable Energy Law to speed up the development and
utilization of renewable energy. By 2020, the share of renewable energy (excludes larger
than 50MW hydro power) inthe primaryenergy consumptionwill occupy 10%. China is
now draftingthe Midand LongTerm Plan on Renewable Energy Developmentand has
incorporated such a plan into the national economic development plan. This will clarify
the strategic objective of the renewable energy development; remove marketbarriers and
firm up the incentive measures for renewable energy development; it will also help to
create the social and cultural environment for renewable energy development and
promotethe commercializationandscaleddevelopment of renewable energy.

 According to the Mid and Long Tmn Plan on Renewable Energy Development, the
 development target bythe year 2020 are: the installed capacityof hydro power will reach
 240 GW (75 GW of which will come from small hydro) and will replace an annual
 consumption of 250 million tons of standard coal equivalent; the installed capacity of
 wind powerwill reach 20 GW and will replacean annual consumptionof 15 milliontons
 of standard coal equivalent; the installed capacity for biomass power will reach20 GW
 and will replace an annual consumption of 28 million tons of standard coal equivalent,
 and the total installed capacityof PV systems will reach 1,000 MW. Based on the target
 mentioned above, we are W n g to speed up the pilot projects on wind power concession
 and biomass power generation. The development speed of small hydropower and PV
 power is beingimplementedat a speed which is obviously faster thanbefore.

 However, in general, the current production cost of renewable energy in China is
 relatively high and is not competitive compared to the traditional energy. In order to
 accelerate the development of renewable energy, the Chinese Government hopes to
 obtain financial and technical support from international organizationssuch as the World
 Bank and GEF. The aim is to increase local manufacturing ability for wind power
 generation and biomass generation; reduce generation cost o f renewable energy; and
 create conditions for the development and utilization of renewableenergy. China will be
  keen to leam from international experiences and practices. The Chinese Government is
  willing to promote the commercialization and scale up o f renewableenergy development
 jointly with the international world and contribute to the sustainable development of the
  economy.

  The China Renewable Energy Scale-up Program (CRESP) is, for the time being, the
  largest international technical assistanceprogram in China. We attach high importanceto
  this program and hope to makejoint efforts with GEF and the World Bank so as to push

and promotethe preparatorywork, and makethe implementation of the programas soon
as possible.

 Lessons Learnedfrom PreviousProjects
 The OED Report TheBank's Assistance to the Energy Sector in China (Report 21891, February
 28, 2001) notedthat "With none of the 20 completed projects rated unsatisfactory and only one
 of the 19ongoingprojects rated a problemproject, the performance of the Chinaenergy portfolio
 i s without equal.'' Today in the power sector in China, there are 18 completed projects, all rated




                                                  24

satisfactory, and 8 ongoing, again all rated satisfactory. No ongoing energy sector project is rated
less than satisfactory.

Nonetheless,important lessonscan be drawn from previous energy sector projects, including: (a)
the need for full commitment of the Borrower at all levels; (b) the importance of stakeholder
participation throughout; (c) important policy reforms, in line with government objectives,
should be incorporated into the project design; (d) project preparation should include detailed
organizational and staffing arrangements for implementation and implementing agencies should
receive institutional strengthening support; (e) counterpart funding should be committed before
implementation, with the direct participation of relevant levels in NDRC, MOF, and other
agencies; (f) projects crossing institutional lines are more difficult to implement and must
provide adequate incentives to all participants; (g) capacity building during project preparation
can achieve part of project objectives and substantially speed up implementation; and (h) power
markets should be carefully assessed and periodically reassessed to ensure a demand for output
from proposed projects.

Lessons learned from renewable energy assistance in China include: (a) the renewable energy
resource for individual projects must be carefully assessed and checked; (b) for rapid
implementation, attention must be paid to ensuring arrangements are in place for procurement
and construction that are in line with international best practice; (c) important principles of all
agreements that are essential to the project functioning as envisaged (for example, PPAs and
voluntary pilot schemes) should be established before project appraisal; and (d) TA must be
coordinated with the construction of the physical parts of the project to ensure that the
implementing agencies have adequate and timely knowledge of construction, operation and
maintenance.

Lessons learned for technology transfer and other activities to improve the supply side suggest
that (a) technology transfer i s a long-term incremental task and that "single shot" efforts are not
generally effective; (b) competitively awarded cost-sharing for major technology transfer
activities provide incentives for equipment suppliers to reduce cost and improve quality; (c)
technology transfer flourishes where market development and expansion i s taking place; (d)
supporting capacity buildingto embed institutions and skills over the long term are essential to
the overall technology transfer process; and (e) short term efforts including courses, study tours
and other activities can have an important "bridge building" role to meet specific and identified
needs, if well designed andexecuted.

OtherProjectActivities
Workshops, studies, study tours and other TA too numerous to mention individually have been
financed by multilateral and bilateral donors and foundations in the field of the MMP, sector
reform and legal frameworks supportive of renewable energy. The main bilateral donors have
included Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. The Energy Foundation has been
 active in China with a support program for five years. Multilateral institutions providing support
have included ADB, the EU,UNDP and the World Bank.

The combined effect of these efforts has been to buildconsensus for (a) the MMP concept and to
inform the debate on the relative merits of the price based and quantity based systems and their
 applicability to China; and (b) the need for a policy to be enshrined in law and regulations. The

outcome has been the REL and the work now starting on the implementing regulations. The
lessons from this consensus are incorporated into the project design.

                             Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
                          CHINA RenewableEnergy Scale-up Program

The project consists of two components, each of which i s described inmore detail below.

InstitutionalStrengthening and Capacity BuildingComponent

The Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building Component i s to be a single national
program, implemented through the CRESP PMO. The Institutional Development and Capacity
Building Component supports at the national level (a) introducing the REL and associated
regulations at national level; (b) reducing cost and improving quality of renewable energy
equipment and services, particularly for wind and biomass; and (c) long-term capacity building
for development of wind technology. In the pilot provinces it supports (a) developing province-
level regulations and other implementation tasks; (b) helping the pilot provinces meet the
requirements of REL, including by undertaking resource assessments, pilot demonstration
projects and capacity building. With the investment project sponsors, it supports investment
scale-up. It also provides resourcesfor the managementof the program, through the PMO.

GEF financing will be US$40.22 million. Where companies participate inthe project, they will
contribute through cost-sharing, a proven means of technology transfer in China that has found
successful application in the REDP. Cost-sharedamounts are difficult to estimate because of the
decentralized nature of the individual projects that have not yet been proposed. Based on
experience inthe REDP, GEF: company cost-sharing ratio i s 1:3. Applying this metric to CRESP
would result in counterpart funding of US$48.6 million. Indirect effects, for example subsequent
investment inproduction facilities, have not beencounted.

National Level Institutional Strengtheningand Capacity Building: US$20.82 million GEF,
US$33 million counterpartfunds
National level institutional strengthening and capacity buildingconsists of six subcomponentsas
follows:

0   MMP research (US$1 million GEF). Studies on further development of the MMP and its
    implementation will include (a) distributing national targets between provinces; (b) setting
    the tariff level for renewables; (c) transforming the policy from price-based to quantity-based
    (based on early versions of the law the price-based mechanism has been chosen at least as an
    interim measure); (d) sharing incremental costs between provinces; (e) developing trading
    schemes to minimize MMP cost; (f) linkingthe MMP to carbon trading mechanisms; and (g)
    preparing a medium- to long-term plan for renewable energy development. Financing will
    support consultants to undertake the studies;
    Support to MMP implementation (US$1.25 million GEF). Studies, capacity building and
    training to support implementation of the RELwill include (a) preparation of regulations that
    outline detailed implementation mechanisms; and (b) capacity building and training for
    implementing agencies, regulators, and others affected by the law. Financing will support
    consultants and training activities to implement this subcomponent;

 0  Technology improvement for wind (US$16.17 million GEF, expected counterpart funds
    US$27 million). There will be four activities under this subcomponent as follows:


                                                 34

(a)     Technology development by selected manufacturers. This activity will provide
grants to companies to share the costs of projects to accelerate the transfer of variable
speed, pitch controlled and related wind technology to China using licensing, joint
ventures, technology development using international consultants or other means. Grants
will be provided to share up to 50 percent of the cost of projects. Beneficiaries will be
selected competitively based on proposals submitted by manufacturers that will be
encouraged to collaborate with design institutes or other sources of know-how.
Beneficiaries will be selectedcompetitively basedon proposals that will be evaluated and
ranked by disinterested national and international experts. Selection will be guidedby the
market-driven and results-oriented nature of the proposals, and their ability to yield
results inthe Chinese market within five years;
(b)     Standard setting. Current Chinese standards for wind turbines are limited in scope
and requirements and are not equivalent to international standards set by the International
Standards Organization (ISO) or the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
This activity will support the development and adoption of standards by the
Standardization Administration of China. Financing will be provided for consultant
support and the formation of a technical standards committee;
(c)     Wind testing center. The project will provide assistance to a testing organization
selected by the government to establish a wind testing facility through capacity building
of staff, support to develop procedures and to become accredited as a test center by an
internationally recognized standards body such as I S 0 (IS0 25) or IEC (IEC 17025).
Financing will be provided for consultant support, training and the purchase of testing
equipment;
(d)     Certification. A certification body will be supported through capacity building,
training and consultant support with a "twinning" agency to bring it up to the standards
that will permit it to certify wind turbine design andperformance. Consultant support will
also be providedto China National Certification Accreditation Administration (CNCAA)
to assist it in deciding whether to opt for mandatory or voluntary certification of turbines
inChina;
(e)      Establishment of a National Wind Resource Assessment Center. The project will
support development of resource assessment methodologies, national wind resource
assessment standards, and a national wind resource database. It will also support overlay
of wind mapping with geographic information system (GIS) data to convert resource
measurements to identifiable projects. It will also facilitate knowledge transfer and best
practices on the international status of wind resource assessment, and support the pilot
provinces in planning and implementing wind resource assessment activities. A focal
point for the Center will be identified duringproject start-up;
(f)      Long-term capacity building. Efforts to increase the supply of skilled and
knowledgeable designers, engineers, manufacturing specialists and wind farm developers
and operators will be supported. Two universities will be supported to set up master's
level and renewable energy engineering courses, primarily focused on wind andbiomass.
Universities will be selected based on their track record and reputation for quality, the
relevance of the courses they propose, the courses' ability to meet market needs and cost-
sharing.There will also be a fellowship program to allow more senior engineers to study
abroadat existing centers of excellence;


                                          35

       (g)     Studies on interconnection to the grid and turbine micrositing. The project will
       support studies on connection of wind farms to the grid and their impacts on grid
       stability. It will raise awareness of power grid operators and wind developers of
       interconnection requirements and transfer international best practice and knowledge. It
       will conduct studies on the impact of wind farms on grid stability in one province.
       Training on turbine micrositing, which has for some time been a weak point in wind farm
       design, will be providedto complement existing activities.

0  Technology improvement for biomass (US$2.4 million GEF, expected counterpart funds
   US$6 million). This subcomponent will provide grants to companies to share the cost of
   projects to improve the quality and reduce the cost of biomass technologies, particularly
   those related to boilers and equipment handling. Grants will be provided to share up to 50
   percent of the cost of projects. Beneficiaries will be selected competitively based on
   proposals that will be evaluated and ranked by independent national and international
   experts. Selection will be guided by the ability of the proposals to yield results inthe Chinese
   market within five years. Supporting studies will also be undertaken inthis area;

Province-levelTechnical Assistance (US$10.60million GEF, expected counterpartfunds
US$9.0million)
The province-level institutional strengthening and capacity building consists of five
subcomponentsas set out below. Itwill take place inthe pilot provinces (Fujian, Inner Mongolia,
Jiangsu, andZhejiang).

0  MMP implementation (US$2.4 million GEF). Although REL has been passed at national
   level, implementation will be delegatedto the provinces. Participating pilot provinces will be
   supported to prepare provincialrenewable energy development strategies, plans and financial
   incentive policies; test renewable energy promotion models and create awareness among
    stakeholders. This subcomponent will finance consulting services and training for provincial
   counterparts and renewable energy market participants;
   Resource assessments (US$4.2 million GEF). The purpose of this subcomponent i s to
    provide detailed information to the public on the renewable energy resources in each of the
    provinces. For each province, a cost-resource curve for the main renewable resources and a
    database with resource information will be prepared and published. Measurement standards
    will also be prepared, to permit like-for-like comparisons. In Fujian, high-resolution wind
    resource measurements and wind farm siting data will be prepared. In Inner Mongolia,
    assessments on the wind, solar energy, biomass and municipal solid waste resource and wind
    farm siting in 12 counties will be undertaken and published. In Jiangsu, wind and biomass
    resources will be assessed and published. In Zhejiang, small hydro resources capable of
    producing electricity below 3,000 hourdyear will be evaluated (above 3,000 hours/year i s
    already known). Areas of biomass concentration and wind resourcewill also be assessed.

0   Cost-shared support for scaling up renewable energy (US$3 million GEF, expected
    counterpart funds US$9 million). This subcomponent will help provinces carry out studies
    and pilot or demonstration projects in renewable energy technologies other than the one in
    which the investment subproject will take place. Grants will be provided for cost-shared
    activities, awarded on a competitive basis across the four pilot provinces. Fujian will carry
    out studies to identify pilot tidal and geothermal projects. Inner Mongolia will prepare
    biomass projects and study the potential for grid connected PV. Jiangsu will demonstrate

                                                36

    building-integrated PV systems and strengthen its existing renewable energy development
    center. Zhejiang will develop standards for integrating solar water heaters into buildings and
    prepare biogas projects. This component will also support preparation for a pilot offshore
    wind farm expected to be implemented during phase 2.

0   Capacity buildingfor market participants (US$1 million GEF). Capacity buildingfor market
    participants not directly involved in projects in the pilot provinces will be carried out under
    this component. It will include training for developers, banks, and technology and service
    providers covering the project cycle. Financing will also be provided under this
    subcomponent for studies on improvements to procedures for project approval, and
    integration of renewable energy into electricity grids and identifying and removing
    bottlenecks inrenewable project development.

SupportingInvestmentScale-up (US$2.2 million GEF, expected counterpartfunds US$6.6
million)
Based on the lessons of previous renewable energy projects, this subcomponent aims to make
resources available to build a strong pipeline of bankable renewable energy projects. The
companies implementing the investment projects will be provided resources to carry out
feasibility studies, resource assessments and other preinvestment activities on a cost-shared
basis. Training and capacity building, and access to international experience and best practice
will also be eligible activities.

Funds for Inner Mongolia and Zhejiang will be retained as unallocated pending finalization of
the investment subcomponents in those two provinces. In Zhejiang, the Zhejiang Hydro Power
Development Management Center (ZHPDMC) will implement this subcomponent in
coordination with the small hydropower companies. InInner Mongolia, no GEF funds will flow
to the Huitengxile wind farm subproject described below to avoid risk of commingling GEF and
PCFfunds;

Program Management (US$3.38million GEF)
Program management will include day-to-day procurement, financial and contract management
for all tasks carried out under the TA program. It will include representation of the PMO in the
pilot provinces. Additional tasks expected to be carried out by the PMO at least initially include
coordination with other GoC renewable energy initiatives, monitoring and evaluation of the
impact of REL and CRESP, preparation of annual reports and plans on behalf of NDRC,
providing liaison between the InstitutionalDevelopment and Capacity BuildingComponent and
other stakeholders, including the World Bank, and preparation of phase 2 of CRESP. Also
included under this component are national-level studies, to be initiated by the PMO, to address
further policy development issues as they arise including, for example, development of a long-
term biomass strategy.

Unallocated(US$3.22 million GEF)
An unallocated amount of US$3.22 million.is retained. Three million dollars of the funds are
earmarked for the companies undertaking Bank-financed investment subprojects in Inner
Mongolia and Zhejiang. The balance will be put toward activities where the budget proves
inadequateor inresponse to unforeseenrequirements.

Support for Wind andBiomassinPilot ProvincesComponent

The support for Wind and Biomass in Pilot Provinces Component consists of two independent
subcomponents, implemented through separate agencies-the        project sponsors. They are:' (a) in
Fujian, a lOOMW wind farm at Changjiang'ao, Pingtan Island; and (b) in Jiangsu, a 25MW
straw-fired biomass power plant at Mabei Village, Rudong County.

Two additional potential projects have been appraised, but have not yet secured the necessary
domestic clearances. They are: (a) in Inner Mongolia, a l O O M W wind farm at Huitengxile,
Wulanchabu County; and (b) in Zhejiang, a framework to enable the Bank the Bank to finance
rehabilitation and construction of new small hydro plants. At appraisal this consisted of
rehabilitation of sixteen small hydro plants to increase their aggregate capacity from 35 to 51
MW andconstruction of thirty new hydropower plants, totaling 67MW of capacity.

Pingtan Wind Farm, Fujiun.

Estimatedcost US$103.92 million, of which US$67.00 million i s to be financed by the Bank.

The Pingtan Wind Farm i s being developed by the China Long Yuan Electric Power Group
Corporation (Long Yuan), which i s a subsidiary of China Guodian Corporation, one of the five
generation companies that were formed on the break-up of State Power Corporation of China.
The sponsor, Long Yuan, was selected to develop the wind farm under a bidding procedure
managedby Fujian provincial government based on supply price, which has been agreed at 47.8
fenlkwh.

The wind farm i s situated at Changjiang'ao, on the northeastern end of Pingtan Island, some 100
km south east of Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, which is on the eastern side of the
Taiwan Strait. The latitude and longitude of the project site i s 25'31' north and 119'47' east.
Long-term data indicate that typical year annual mean wind speedat the site i s 7.8 metershecond
( d s ) at 65 m above ground level. The proposed site i s near sea level. Annual average
temperature i s 19.5"C. The climate is generally humid and salty. The site i s in a coastal plain
formed between two chains of mountains, one to the northwest andone to the southeast. The area
i s used as farmland, interspersed with low trees, and consists of light sandy soil. The trees are
planted as wind breaks and help stabilize the soil against erosion and are specially selected non-
native species. An identified archaeological site falls within the perimeter of the wind farm, but
will not be disturbed by construction work. The site does not contain human habitation, but there
are several villages on its perimeter. There i s an existing 6 MW wind farm on the same site that
has been operating for about four years, which i s owned by Long Yuan (60 percent) and Pingtan
County Electric Power Company (40 percent).

The project consists of the installation of turbines with an aggregate capacity of 100 MW,
associated civil and electrical works, extension to an existing control room, a switchyard, and a
15 km, 110 kV transmission line from the wind farm to Beicuo. The power of the individual
turbines will be inthe range 1.5-2MW, but their number and the precise layout of the wind farm
will dependon the product offeredby the winning bidder. Based on feasibility study calculations
using 67, 1.5MW machines (considered to be the most likely configuration), permanent land
acquisition including land for turbines, roads and substations, will total 31.6 hectares within an
area of approximately 14 km2.The wind farm, when fully operational, i s expected to produce
260 GWhof electricityper year.

                                                  38

Long Yuan has established a project preparation office, registered with Fujian Economic and
Trade Commission (ETC), and expects ultimately to establish a special purpose company (with
other investors) to own and operate the wind farm, preparation and initial project implementation
will be the responsibility of Long Yuan itself. Long Yuan is inthe process of establishing a new
company (Long Yuan Pingtan Wind Power Company Ltd-LYPWP).                     The special purpose
company will be 60 percent owned by Long Yuan, 30 percent by Shandong Luneng Group, and
5 percent each by FujianWindPower Company andPingtan County Electric Power Company.

Rudong Biomass Power Plant, Jiungsu
Estimatedcost US$36.08 million, of which US$20.00 million i s to be financed by the Bank.

The Rudong biomass power plant i s being developed by Jiangsu Guo Xin Investment Group
Limited (Guo Xin), which i s an investment company wholly owned by Jiangsu Province. Guo
Xin was selected by Jiangsu provincial government to develop the project for a supply price
estimated at 58 fen/kWh at the feasibility study stage. Guo Xin has established a special purpose
company named Jiangsu Guo Xin New Energy Development Company (NED) in which it holds
65 percent of the equity. The remaining 35 percent i s owned by RudongCounty. NED will own
the plant and will be responsible for its preparation, implementation, operation andmaintenance.

The project site i s in Mabei Village, Matang Town, Rudong County, Nantong Municipality,
about 400 kmeast of Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu. The straw power plant would occupy a site
of about 66,000 m2,currently mainly paddy field owned by Mabei village and farmed by local
inhabitants. The site adjoins the MafengRiver. There i s a made road and a substation within 300
meters of the site perimeter. The area i s predominantly agricultural with about 1.23 million tons
of straw waste, mainly wheat and rice, arising each year within a radius of 25 kmof the proposed
project site. The power plant requires 176,000 tons of feedstock per year.

The project consists of installation of a 110thstraw-fired boiler and a 25 MW steam turbine; and
associated civil, mechanical and electrical works. When operational, the plant i s expected to
produce 162 GWhof electricity per year.

Two further potential subcomponents have been appraised and are expected to be brought
forward for Bank financing when their domestic approvals have been secured.

Huitengxile WindFarm, Inner Mongolia
Estimatedcost US$100.58 million, of which US$67.00 million would be financed by the Bank.

The Huitengxile wind farm i s being developed by the NLYWPC, which i s a state-owned
enterprise, 50 percent owned by Northern Union Power Company (NUPC), a holding company
owning a number of power generation companies inInner Mongolia, especially inWestern Inner
Mongolia. The other 50 percent is owned by Long Yuan, the same entity developing the Pingtan
wind farm. The sponsor, a predecessorcompany whose operations have now been subsumedinto
NLYWPC, was selected by the government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to develop
the wind farm; supply price i s basedon competitive biddingfor anot,herwind farm at the same
site and has been agreed at 38.2 fen/kWh.

Huitengxile i s about 120 km east northeast of Huhhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region. Its latitude and longitude are 41'09' north and 112'32' east. The area has
space sufficient for an estimated l,OOOMW, on which about 47 MW of wind has already been
developed by Inner Mongolia Wind Power Company, the predecessor of NLYWPC with a
further 26MW under construction. A further concession of l O O M W i s under development. The
long-term annual mean wind speed has been estimated at 8.4 m/s at 40 m above ground level.
The site elevation i s approximately 2100 m above sea level and consists of slightly rolling
grassland, usedfor grazing. It i s owned by the county through a studfarm.

The Huitengxile wind farm will consist of wind turbines, associated electrical and civil works
including a substation, switchyard and control room; a 15 km, 110 kV transmission line to
Desheng town; and upgrading of the existing 110 kV substation there. The power of the
individual wind turbines will be in the range 0.75-1.5MW, but their number and precise layout
of the wind farm will be determined at procurement and will depend on the product offered by
the winning bidder. Based on feasibility study calculations using 67, 1.5MW machines
(considered to be the most likely configuration), permanent land acquisition including land for
turbines, roads and substations, will total 23.65 hectares within an area of about 11km2.The
wind farmis expectedto produce about 245 GWh of electricityper year.

NLYWPC plans to seek carbon financing for the wind farm and it is currently developing a
proposal for consideration by the World Bank. The additionality of the project (for carbon
financing purposes) i s based on (a) the dominance of coal in Inner Mongolia where typical
power prices are around 25 fen/kWh; and (b) the demonstrated requirement for additional
financing perceived by the NLYWPC, which agreed the price contingent on NLYWPC being
authorizedby the government to seek carbon financing for the project.

For the Pingtan wind farm, the design and layout used internationally recognized standards for
wind resource assessment and energy calculation. Variable-speed pitch regulated machines
meeting international standards will be specified for their superior performance andoutput power

                                                40

quality, which will help improve local system stability. Design specifications require wind
turbines to meet local environmental conditions in particular cold weather requirements. Non-
GEFfunds will be usedto support the biddingprocess andensurebestpractices are employedin
operation and maintenance.

Small Hydro Projects, Zhejiang
Estimated cost up to US$93.00 million, of which upto US$50.00 million would be financed by
the Bank.

In Zhejiang, the Bank would finance rehabilitation and development of selected small
hydropower units. Individual state or collectively owned projects of up to 10 MW would be
selected based on an appraised framework covering technical, economic, financial, safeguards
and procurement criteria. The subcomponent will provide subloans to individual companies
carrying out rehabilitation or new construction of small hydro projects not exceeding l O M W
with guarantees from county governments. The projects are drawn from the list Zhejiang
maintains of rehabilitation and new build projects requiring financing. The preliminary list of
projects was agreed with Zhejiang at appraisal, but final decision will depend on projects
meeting the requirements set out in the appraised framework. Thus some projects may drop out
and be replacedby others from the list maintainedby Zhejiang.

The subcomponent falls into two parts: (a) rehabilitation of existing small hydro sites; and (b)
development of new sites. Based on the appraisedlist of projects, the rehabilitationwould consist
of 16 projects with a total current capacity of 35MW, which would be increased by a further
16MW. Total costs would be US$22.14 million for which Bank financing of US$15.47 million
would be sought. Thirty new buildprojects would have an aggregate capacity of 66MW with a
total cost of US$70 million for which Bank financing of US$35.5 million would be sought.
Zhejiang may request financing for either rehabilitation subprojects only, or both rehabilitation
and new build depending on financing needs. Project design permits either a fixed number of
projects to be determined beforehand or a ceiling level of Bank financing to be agreed and
projects financed untilall the Bank funds have been committed.

Investment requirements and therefore descriptions vary from project to project. In general the
component will support new construction or rehabilitation of civil works including dams,
diversion and control structures and headraces and tailraces, and supply and installation of
mechanical andelectrical works.

Zhejiang Hydropower Development Management Center (ZHPDMC) i s an experienced designer
of small hydro power plants and would undertake technical evaluation, with reputable
independent Chinese experts, of all projects that have been proposed for financing. Technical
viability of individual small hydro projects in Zhejiang has beenreviewed and found adequate.

                             Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
                         CHINA Renewable Energy Scale-up Program


A. GENERAL

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the
Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between
the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at
least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementation needs andimprovements
ininstitutionalcapacity.

Procurement of Goods: A total of US$85.87 million worth of goods would be procured for the
project, including (a) for the Pingtan wind farm, wind turbines consisting of the nacelles, blades
and control system and ancillary electrical equipment including transformers, conductors and
poles; (b) for the Rudong biomass power plant a boiler and steam turbine, mechanical handling
equipment for fuel and ash and electrical equipment and control systems; and (c) under the grant,
resource measurement equipment and office equipment for the PMO. For Pingtan and Rudong
procurement will use supply and install arrangements.

    International CompetitiveBidding (ICB). All contracts for goods costing US$500,000
    equivalent or more would be awarded through ICB procedures specified in the Procurement
    Guidelines.
0   National CompetitiveBidding (NCB).NCB procedureswould be usedfor procurement of
    goods costing less than US$500,000 equivalent per contract. Contracts each estimated to cost
    less than US$300,000 may be advertised only ina provincial newspaper.
    Shopping.Other goods would be procured usingshopping procedureswith contracts under
    US$lOO,OOO equivalent each.

Selection of Consultants: A total of US$21 million worth of consultant services will be
financed. Detaileddesign and supervision services will be procured as part of the package for the
equipment to be supplied for the Pingtan wind farm and the Rudong biomass power project.
Consultant services will be required under the TA component for: (a) advice on development and
implementation of the mandated market policy (MMP)at national and provincial level; (b) to
assist with implementation of the technology improvement and other cost-shared activities; (c) to
assist in the investment scale-up work; and (d) carrying out work to support the management of
the program, including the hiringof staff to work inthe PMO. Under the investment component,
consultants will be hired to provide services for design, procurement support (including bid
evaluation), construction management and operations and maintenance. Short lists of consultants
for services estimated to cost less than US$300,000 equivalent per contract may be composed
entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the
Consultant Guidelines. In some cases, particularly providing advice for the development of the


                                                  58

MMP, universities or government research institutions may be hired if they provide unique or
exceptional services, and CQS or QBS may be usedinstead of QCBS.

Consulting contracts, estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO equivalent or more, will be awarded
following the procedure of Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) or Quality Based Selection
(QBS). For consulting services estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract
under this project, Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQS) will be used. Chinese
universities, design and research institutes as sources of consultants may be included in the
shortlist.

ProcurementDocuments:The Bank's StandardBiddingDocuments will be adoptedfor all ICB
procurement. For NCB procurement, the Chinese Model Bidding Document (MBD) will be
used, which were issued by the MOF in May 1997 in agreement with the Bank. The latest
changes to the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be incorporated into the MBD as
appropriate. For all contracts to be awarded following QCBS, the Bank's Standard Request for
Proposals will be used. Sample procurement documents and contracts for shopping and small
consulting assignments will be developed by the implementing agencies with the Bank's
assistance.

Operating Costs. The operating costs of the PMO will be financed from the GEF grant,
including overheads and items such as travel and subsistence relating to the implementation of
the program. The PMO's staffing, management procedures and proposed work plan were
reviewed at appraisal and are considered satisfactory.

Others. Other procurement arrangements will be made for cost-shared activities. Cost-shared
activities will be supported through competitively awarded grants to commercial entities and
universities and fellowship programs. Commercial entities will be selected and appraised
according to procedures set out in the TA component PIP agreed at appraisal. Participating
commercial entities include wind and biomass equipment suppliers and manufacturers, wind
turbine testing centers, certification bodies and project developers. Activities to be supported
include wind and biomass technology improvement and cost reduction, setting up of a testing
and certification system for wind turbines, undertaking feasibility and prefeasibility studies,
resource assessments and pilotldemonstration projects. Cost-sharing with selecteduniversities, to
allow them to set up renewable energy engineering courses at master's degree level, will be
undertaken in a similar way. A fellowship program, to allow senior staff to study abroad will also
be established, with fellowships beingawarded along guidelines set out inthe PIP.

B. ASSESSMENT THEAGENCIES' CAPACITY TOIMPLEMENTPROCUREMENT
                  OF

Procurement activities will be carried out by the following entities:

0   For the Pingtan wind farm, China Long Yuan Power Group Company (Long Yuan) and
    special purpose company, LYPWP, when established. The project office, which is the
    forerunner for LYPWP, i s staffed by a general manager, a chief engineer and a chief
    financial officer and functional units covering operations, construction, administration and
    finance and accounting. Staff handling procurement are headed by a senior engineer with
    experience of World Bank procurement of wind farm equipment. A further three engineers
    and an economist form the procurement unit.


                                                59

   For the Rudongbiomass power plant, Jiangsu Guo Xin Investment Group Limited (Guo Xin)
    and the special purpose company Jiangsu Guo Xin New Energy Rudong Development
    Company (NED).The special purpose company will be staffed by a general manager, a chief
    engineer and a chief financial officer and functional units covering construction, procurement
    and contracts, administration and finance and accounting. A group, headed by the general
    manager of NED will be responsible for procurement, and includes both engineering and
    commercial staff. Provisionhas been made for a bidevaluation committee composed of staff
    working on the project, but with membership from outside the company;
    For the TA component, the established CRESP PMO. The PMO will be increased in size to
    include a director, deputy director and a technical advisor. Functional staff will be assigned
    with responsibility for specific aspects of the TA program the one person now responsible for
    financial and contract management will be replaced by a small unit. Staff handling
    procurement are headed by the director. Existing staff with procurement responsibilities are
    experienced in Bank procurement and have received additional training during project
    preparation.

An assessment of the capacity of the ImplementingAgencies to implement procurement actions
for the project has been carried out by Li Xiaoping in October 2004. The assessment reviewed
the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the
project's staff responsible for procurement. The action plan agreed to address the weaknesses
include: (a) role and responsibility of each agency in handling procurement have been clearly
defined in the PIPSprovidedby the implementing agencies to the Bank; (b) detailed procurement
plans have been agreed at negotiations; (c) procurement training for all implementing agencies
should be organized before the project implementation; (d) qualified procurement agents should
be hiredand special attentions should be paidto the experience and competenceof their key staff
assigned to this project; and (e) proper procurement filing system shall be established and
maintained by the implementing agencies up to two years after the closing date of the Loan
Agreement of the project.

   Additional Annex SA: ProcurementArrangementsfor Additional AppraisedProjects
                        CHINA RenewableEnergy Scale-upProgram


A. GENERAL

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the
Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between
the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at
least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs andimprovements
ininstitutionalcapacity.

Procurement of Works: A total of US$42.4 million of works would be required for the civil
works for the small hydro projects inZhejiang, consisting of dams, intake systems, power houses
and other similar work. Given the small size of the contracts and the large number of competitive
contractors in China, they would not be expected to attract international interest and therefore
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would not be proposed for the works contracts. All
contracts would be below the current threshold for ICB Works for China of US$15 million.

i)NationalCompetitiveBidding(NCB).ContractsforworksestimatedtocostUS$200,000
   equivalent or more wouldbe awarded under NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Works
   contracts eachestimated to cost less than US$2 million would be advertised only ina
    provincial newspaper.
ii)SmallCivilWorksProcurement(Shopping).Contractsforworksestimatedtocostlessthan
    US$200,000 equivalent per contract would be awardedthrough shopping procedures as
    specified inPara.3.5 of the Procurement Guidelines. These works would be suitable for
    lump-sumand fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least
    three qualifieddomestic contractors inresponseto a written invitation.

Procurement of Goods: A total of US$132 million worth of goods would be procured for the
potential investment projects, including (a) for the Huitengxile wind farm, wind turbines
consisting of the nacelles, blades, towers and control system and ancillary electrical equipment
including transformers, conductors and poles; and (b) for the small hydro plant in Zhejiang
turbines, generators and related equipment including controls. For both projects, procurement
would use supply and install arrangements.

InZhejiang, with the exception of three contracts, all proposed contracts for the supply of goods
would be below US$500,000 and several individual items of equipment are below US$lOO,OOO.
Given the small size of the contracts and the large number of competitive suppliers in China,
they would not be expected to attract international interest and therefore NCB or shopping as
appropriate would be proposed for the goods contracts. For the three contracts exceeding
US$500,000, Regional Procurement Advisor clearance to undertake NCB has been sought and
obtained.

Selection of Consultants: No consultants are expected to be hired to support the additional
investment projects. Nonetheless, the same procurement arrangements as set out for consultants
for the main project would apply. Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less
than US$300,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in
accordancewith the provisions of paragraph2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.

Consulting contracts, each estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO equivalent or more, will be awarded
following the procedure of Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) or Quality Based Selection
(QBS). For consulting services estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract
under this project, the Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQS) would be used for
these contracts. Chinese universities, design andresearchinstitutes as sources of consultants may
beincludedinthe shortlist.

Procurement Documents: The Bank's StandardBiddingDocuments will be adoptedfor all ICB
procurement. For NCB procurement, the Chinese Model Bidding Document (MBD) will be
used, which was issued by the MOF in May 1997 in agreement with the Bank. The latest
changes to the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be incorporated into the MBD, as
appropriate. For all contracts to be awarded following QCBS or QBS, the Bank's Standard
Request for Proposals will be used. Sample procurement documents and contracts for shopping
and small consulting assignments will be developed by the implementing agencies with the
Bank's assistance.

B. ASSESSMENT THEAGENCIES' CAPACITYTO IMPLEMENT PROCUREMENT
                  OF

Procurement activities will be carried out by:

e   For the Huitengxile wind f m , NLYWPC. The company includes functional departments
    covering development, construction, operations and finance. The development department i s
    responsible for the project. Staff handling procurement include the deputy general manager,
    the chief engineer and the manager of the development department. Specialist members of
    the development department have been assigned to address specific aspects of procurement
    includingtechnical, financial andconstruction;

 e  For the Zhejiang small hydro projects the Zhejiang PPO, staffed by the ZHPMDC, will be
    responsible for procurement. Staff handling procurement are overseen by the director of
    ZHPDMC, and assignedstaff for procurement are electrical engineers.
An assessment of the capacity of Inner Mongolia Wind Power Company, the predecessor to
NLYWPC, and ZHPMDC to implement procurement actions for the project was carried out by
Li Xiaoping in November 2004. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementing the project and the interaction between the project's staff responsible for

                                                69

procurement. The action plan agreed to address the weaknesses include: (a) waivers for Bank-
financed NCB procurement shall be included inthe legal agreements of the project; (b) role and
responsibility of each agency inhandling procurement have been clearly defined in the PIP; (c) a
detailed procurement plan has been agreed for Inner Mongolia, but i s pendingfor Zhejiang; (d)
procurement training for all implementing agencies should be organized before the project
implementation; (e) qualified procurement agents should be hired and special attentions should
be paid to the experience and competence of their key staff assigned to this project; and (f) a
proper procurement filing system shall be established and maintained by the implementing
agencies up to two years after the closing date of the Loan Agreement of the project.

The overall procurement risk for the additional projects was assessed as average,

C. PROCUREMENTPLAN

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed procurement plans for the implementation of the
additional investment projects. The plan for Huitengxile has been agreed between the Borrower
and the Project Team during technical discussions and i s available at the offices of NLYWPC,
Power Building, South Xilin Street, Huhhot, Inner Mongolia. For the Zhejiang hydro projects, no
agreement has yet been made, but a draft of the procurement plan i s available at the offices of
ZHPDMC, 7 Meihuabei, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang. They would also be available in the
project's database and in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plans would be updated
in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs andimprovements ininstitutionalcapacity.

D. FREQUENCY OFPROCUREMENTSUPERVISION

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment of the Implementing Agencies has recommended six- to eight-monthly supervision
missions to visit the field to carry out post review of procurement actions. Post review ratio
would be one out of three contracts.

                         CHINA Renewable Energy Scale-up Program

       ECONOMIC     ANALYSISOFPROGRAMAND OPTIMALQUANTITY OF"EWABLES

Objective

The objective of this section i s to provide an analytical framework for assessing and
implementing a scale-up program for grid-based electricity generation from renewable energy
sources by 2010. The core of the analysis i s a simulation model that generates supply curves for
potential renewable energy projects; selects an optimum target quantity; and evaluates the
economic and financial impacts of policy instruments designedto meet the target. The renewable
energy projects in the model's database span China's 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities. They consist of ongoing, planned or potential developments in new small
hydropower; rehabilitation of existing small hydropower; landfill gas; and wind energy. CRESP,
in the pilot provinces, will further test the validity of the preliminary analytical results and
sensitivity analyses inthis section.

Policy Rationale
China's power grid i s basedmainly on coal-fired electricity generation, which accounts for about
70 percent of total generation. This dependence on coal has substantial associatedenvironmental
damage costs. At the same time, the country has a sizeablerenewable energy potential that could
be substituted for some coal based generation and reduce environmental damage. Many
renewable energy projects are economic relative to the production costs of coal. However, they
do not contribute to electricity generation because of the absence of a proactive policy to
incorporate them into the power grid. Furthermore, production of environmental damages
stemming from coal utilization are not reflected in (internalized) its financial price. Factoring
theminwould make additional amounts of renewable energy economic.

Small-scale hydropower currently offers the greatest renewable energy potential for supplying
grid-based electricity and China has led the world in the development of this technology.
However, in the past, the focus has been on meeting the power needs of rural communities
outside the gridrather than an environmental policy to substitute for coal-based generation inthe
main grid. A renewable energy policy focusing on displacing coal for environmental reasons
would help to reorient design practices to meet the requirements of the grid.

Selection of the Economic OptimumScale-up Quantity

Methodology and Assumptions. The objective of the approach i s to determine the optimal
quantity of power generation based on renewable energy given a set of technical and economic
assumptions. The analysis begins at the provincial level, first developing the renewable energy
project database and then determining the unit costs of various renewable energy projects on a
unitcost basis (in Y per kWh). Itthen constructs aprovincial supply curve relatingcost per kWh
to electricity production. The selection of economically viable projects requires a comparison of
project costs with the production and social cost of coal on the same per unitbasis.



                                                72

To determine the social costs of coal use, the model calculates coal production costs in each
province. It adds to these costs an estimated cost of the environmental damage that results from
coal use. Since consistent data was not available for all of China's provinces, the estimate is
based on the benefit transfer method-using             well-established studies outside of China, but
adjusting the costs for country condition^.^ The cost analysis for renewable energy i s based on
production costs of the renewable energy technologies plus a capacity penalty, if applicableS6
This penalty represents the cost of not havingcontinuous power available for dispatch to the grid
and the need to establish a form of back-up generating capacity, as in the case of hydropower
projects without storagecapacity.

The simulation model extrapolates a national supply curve for electricity generation from
renewable energy from the provincial supply curves. It then allocates all electricity production
from all renewable energy projects with a unit generation cost less than that of coal in the
estimate of the quantity economically justified without considering environmental externalities
or Q ECON. It also groups all projects with a unit cost less than the production cost of coal plus the
externality cost inthe quantity Q      ENV. This quantity is considered the economic optimumfrom an
environmental perspective andforms the basecase of the analysis.

The target year for the scale-up of renewable energy to the grid i s 2010. The quantity analysis is
basedon economic costs, that is, without the inclusion of taxes and duties. Production costs were
calculated as the annual operating and maintenance costs plus an annualized equivalent of capital
costs. There were two important assumptions in the annualization of the capital coasts-a                      20
year economic life for generating plants and a discount rate of 12 percent, the rate used by the
GoC for investment projects. Other important assumptions were the externality values using the
benefit transfer method for each of China's provinces. Figure A9.1 shows the estimated
environmental damage cost per unit of electricity generated across all of China's provinces.
Overall the data show the economic benefit of avoiding environmental damage from coal much
greater for the densely populated, wealthier provinces in eastern and coastal China than in the
western provinces.




    The damage cost analysis considers damage from three main air pollutants--oxides of sulfur (SO,), oxides of
    nitrogen (NO,), and particulate matter that would be emitted from plants with pollution controls (electrostatic
    precipitators).
    Although renewable energy can have some adverse environmental impact, the model does not quantify these
    costs, given that the magnitude of damage costs from coal use are much greater andeasily quantifiable.

The Supply Curve at the Provincial Level. Figures A9.2 illustrates the methodology at the
provincial level basedon the data for Zhejiang Province. This province i s among those with coal
damage costs on the high side. The supply curves result from a set of points that represent a
renewable energy project in terms of cost per kWh, adjusted for the capacity penalty. Figure
A9.2 expresses the costs interms of boththe production costs of coal and the social costs of coal.
An avoidedcost curve, derivedby subtracting the production cost of coalfrom eachpoint, canbe
produced. The advantage of this curve i s that it can be addedto the avoided cost curves of other
provinces to arrive at quantity scenarios on a national basis. In contrast the cost curves that
include the production cost are applicable at the provincial level only becausethe production cost
varies by province, whereas the avoided damage costs per kWh are the same.

Potential Levels of Electricity from Renewable Energy. Basedon the above methodology and
assumptions, the simulation model arrived at three potential levels of renewable energy based
generation by 2010. First, with business as usual and no renewable energy scale-up program, the
likely quantity would be 35 TWh (Q          BAU) or 1.2 percent of total generation in 2010. Second, a
program focused on increasing power generation from economically viable renewable energy
sources+ven           without considering the damage costs of coal-would        result in a renewable
energy contribution of 79 TWh (Q            ECON) or more than double Q     BAU. Third, the amount of
renewable energy-based generated economically justified with the inclusion of the externality
costs of coal would be 89 TWh (QENV)considered the base case optimum economic quantity. A
more pessimistic assumption for key base case parameters, particularly a reduction in the value
of externalities, resulted in an optimum of 76 TWh. More optimistic assumptions, including a
substantially higher value of externalities and a lower opportunity cost of capital, result in an
optimum of 117 TWh. Figure A9.3 shows the economic optimum (QENV)broken down by
Province.

Technology Mix of the Economic Optimum (QEw). Table A9.1 shows a breakdown of the
base case optimum quantity by type of renewable energy technology. About 75 percent of
economic optimum production from renewable energy would come from new small hydropower


                                                        74

projects and an additional 13 percent from rehabilitated hydropower sites. The majority of small
hydropower projects in the optimal solution have some degree of water flow. All bagasse
projects would be economic without the consideration of environmental externalities. Landfill
gas projects would not be economic without incorporating these externalities. No wind energy
would be economic at the 12 percent discount rate used for the analysis. For wind energy to be
economic at a 12 percent discount rate, the capital cost of the technology would have to decrease
by 50 percent in2010 rather than the 33 percent estimated for the baseloadcase.

Environmental and Economic Impact at the National Level. Meeting the economic optimum
target would result in only half the amount of emissions that would be produced under the
business-as-usualscenario (Table A9.2) and overall would reduce overall emissions from coal in
China by about five percent. At the same time, meeting this target would result in a one percent
savings in the national cost of electricity and bring about a net increase in employment. The
model also indicated a slight increaseinGDP, less than one percent.

Comparative Provincial Results. Figure A9.3 shows the estimated economically optimum
quantity of power production from renewable energy in each of China's provinces, under the
baseline assumptions outlined above. The distribution of this quantity across provinces reflects
variations inrenewable energy resourceendowments and the costs of coal production and related
externalities. The extremes are representedby Shanghai, Sichuan, and Inner Mongolia. Shanghai
has high fossil generation costs, and high externality values, but a poor renewable energy
resource endowment. Therefore, its economically optimal quantity i s small, mainly limited to
landfill gas projects. Incontrast, Sichuan has low generation costs and low externality values, but
a large renewable energy resource endowment (mainly low cost small hydro), so its potential
quantity of renewable energy is large. However, few of its small hydropower projects have water
flow regulation, so the economics of small hydro are not as good as in provinces such as
Zhejiang, where the corresponding proportion i s much greater. Inner Mongolia also has good
wind resources, but low costs of coal-fired generation and externalities limit the economic
viability of wind power.

Decisionmaking Analysis: Assessment of Important Assumptions, Alternatives and Risk.
The parameters with the greatest impact on the results are the discount rate used, the estimated
environmental damage costs of coal; and assumptions about reductions in the cost of wind
technology. At the standard discount rate of 12 percent no wind energy would be economic.
However, at 8 percent projects producing about 3 TWh are economic. At a 12 percent discount



                                                  76

rate, meetingthe same energy target would require a40 percent decreaseinthe capital cost of the
technology combined with a five percent increaseinthe loadfactor.

The study also reviewed environmental alternatives to promoting renewable energy
development, mainly improved energy conservation and clean coal technology. It found that
even if all economically justified projects were implemented substantial new coal-basedcapacity
would still be required. It found the same to be the case for clean coal technology. Overall the
analysis indicates the three options are complementary not mutually exclusive.

A risk analysis has evaluated the impact of simultaneous changes in all of the important
variables-discount rate, world oil price, GDP growth, environmental externality value, wind
energy capital cost reduction. The study also constructed payoff and penalty matrices for the
three possibilities for the economic optimum quantity-a          base case scenario (89 TWh), a
pessimistic scenario (76 TWh), and an optimistic scenario (117 TWh). The analysis found a
probability of only 27 percent that the optimum economic quantity would be less than 89 TWh.
Concerning the higher target of 117 TWh, the penalty matrix shows that the potential maximum
penalty of this target not being the optimum i s substantially greater than the maximum benefit of
the pessimistic target, indicating that it is better to underestimate rather than overestimate. This
makes sense on the practical level as well since given uncertainty, it i s better to build
incrementally than to incur the cost of buildingunusedcapacity.

Options for Policy Instruments to Meet the Target

Methodology and Assumptions. The policy focuses on how to meet the economic optimum
target considering the distribution of benefits, especially to the western provinces, given the
GoC's policy to promote the development of this region. The starting point for the analysis was a
review of international practice and study tours to countries that have been successful in
renewable energy development for grid-based power generation. Two categories of policy
instruments have proven effective, which the analysis has reviewed in detail-quantity-based
instruments andprice-basedinstruments. Theseinstruments rely on market forces incombination
with some administrative standards or prices to stimulate the market for developing renewable
energy technology.

Quantity-based instruments establish a target quantity for renewable energy by a given date and
allow the market to set the price. This approach has been adopted in some form by Australia,
Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States. Price-based instruments guarantee a tariff
that producers will obtain, allowing the market to determine the quantity. The foremost example
of this approachis Germany, which is the world's leader inthe development of wind power. Box
A9.1 outline four cases that have been reviewed in detail. These consist o f two quantity-based
models policies-the     development of a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in Texas and the
bidding model of the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) in the United Kingdom; one price-
basedmodel-the      German Feedlaw; and one combination Feedlawmidding program in China's
Zhejiang Province.

Theoretically, with perfect knowledge of the provincial supply curves and the externalities of
coal use, the same impact should result whether the price or the quantity i s determined. However,
given real-world uncertainty, the two policies may have different outcomes. The real issue i s not



                                                   77

whether to use a feedlaw rather than a quantity-based approach. What i s more important i s the
extent to which either the target quantity or the feedlaw price would lead to achievement of a
sound and well defined economic and environmental objectives. In the case of China, the
analysis needed to take account of the varying costs of coal production and its externalities as
well as different resource endowments of its provinces. Also, the analysis should address the
extent to which the development of wind energy would require additional incentives to establish
a domestic manufacturing industry that would be necessary in order to achieve the projected
reductions inthe wind energy technology.

In addition to the economic analysis of benefits to the economy, the methodology for selecting
the policy instrument required a financial analysis to assess the incremental financial costs of the
policies and their impact on the distribution of costs and benefits among different groups in
society-consumers, equity investors, renewable electricity producers, coal electricity producers,
banks, government (taxes and so forth). Table A9.3 provides a comparison of assumptions for
some of the important elements inthe analysis. For example, the financial analysis usedan actual
cost of capital inmarketplace at around six percent insteadof the discount rate that i s double that
amount. It also includes corporate and value addedtaxes.

Concept:Legislation requiresthe productionof an agreedquantity of electricity fromaportfolio of renewable
energy sources by a given target year, with penaltiesfor underperformance.

Appliedin: UnitedStates(Stateof Texas)
Comment: The Texas RPS has beenone of the most successfulprogramsfor producing wind power. So far
producershaveexceededtheir annualtargets considerably.An important element inthe success is the production
tax credit, allowing wind projects to deliver power to the grid at less thanUS$0.03 per kWh, which is closeto
the avoided cost of fossil fuel generation.Compliance with the standardhas been accomplishedby long-term
contacts (10-15 years) betweenretailcompaniesand wind developers with strongpenaltiesfor
underperformance.

 Concept:The term comes from the original Germanlaw that means"electricity feed-in law" that provided a
 price guarantee for producersof wind energy. The governmentsets aFeedlaw price at the social cost of coal.
 Utilities are required to accept wind energyproduction from all technically qualifiedproducers.

 the Government of Germany replacedthe earlier law to correct for some of the problems of the old law,
 includinghighprices.

 Resultsof the Quantity-BasedOption.The analysisfocuses on determining a quantity standard
 for each province in order to meet the national optimum quantity target and whether the quantity
 based option should be considered. It evaluates two approaches for provinces to achieve this
 standardas shown inTable A9.4. The first is a "no trade" scheme, whereby each province would
 meet its standard from its own resources. The second is a system of tradable green certificates
 that allows provinces with higher-cost renewable energy resources to meet their target by
 buildingfacilities in other provinces with lower cost resources. This is the same as saying that
 one builds a set of renewable projects in China (totaling 89 TWh) that would yield the least
 aggregateproduction cost.

 The simulation model tested the economic and environmental impact of six quantity targets for
 2010, ranging from a low of 65 TWh to a high of 140 TWh. Figure A9.4 indicates the tradeoff
 between net economic benefits and quantity of renewable energy based electricity. The
 evaluation shows that the highest net benefits would result from setting a quantity standardof 89
 TWh for 2010 with interprovincial trade in green certificates. This case would have an NPV of
 Y 36.1 billion, which would be Y 4.7 billionor about 15 percent higher than setting the optimum
 without a TGC system (valued at Y 31.4 billion).

Estimated Financial Impact of Trade in Green Certificates. The analysis of the quantity
based option also reviewed the financial impact of trade in green certificates on the various
provinces as shown in Figure A9.5. The major winners are Xizang, Sichuan, Yunnan, and
Guangxi. All of these are western provinces with good small hydro resources. Major losers are
Shandong and Jiangsu, which would have a high obligation placed on them, but which have
relatively few low-cost resources, meaning that to meet their obligation at least cost, they would
become significant buyers of green certificates.

Evaluation of the Tariff Impact on Consumers. Although the trading system of green
certificates has net economic benefits for all provinces, the tariff impact of meeting the optimum
quantity will vary. Essentially it will depend on the extent to which the consumer or the producer


                                                                       81

captures the surplus associatedwith the sale of the green certificates. Given the varying income
levels among provinces, this impact i s a significant concern. To given an idea of the potential
magnitude of the impact the simulation model created a worst-case scenario in which producers
capture all of the surplus from the sale of green certificates. Although the provinces on the lower
end of the per capita income scale would bear the greatest burden, even the highest tariff impact
would be very small, at a 0.35 percent increase.

Financial Impact on Stakeholders. FigureA9.6 shows the impact on various stakeholders. The
positive amounts indicate savings to the power sector andto some combination of consumers and
producers, whereas the negative amounts indicate cost. However, a financial cost to the power
sector i s a financial benefit to the entity involved (and vice versa). Thus the saving to power
consumers of Y 23.7 billion also represents lost revenues (that is, a cost) to the coal industry.
However, the additional site cost of Y 9.2 billion in the west results in an increased financial
flow to western construction industry. The expected tax impacts on local and provincial entities
are small. However, there i s an apparent significant tax gain to the central government. The
model accounts for the subsidy on domestic coal as a "negative tax" to the GoC.~Therefore, as
coal consumption declines, the subsidy diminishes by a corresponding amount. Alternatively it
would accrue to the central government or the coal industry if the coal not used for power
generation i s exported instead, or usedfor some other purpose.

Reconciliation of Economic and Financial Flows. FigureA9.7 summarizes the reconciliation of
economic and financial flows resulting from the quantity standard with trade. The net benefit of
Y 36.1 billion corresponds to the economic optimumquantity of 89 TWh inthe basecase. As the


     This "subsidy" arises because the economic netback value of coal (calculated on the basis of the international
     price at the export port) is higher than the financial cost. This is in reality a resource rent that is presently
     captured by coal consumers who benefit from a coal price that is below economic cost.

rate of financial interest i s below that of the assumed discount rate, and therefore provides an

Evaluationof the Price-BasedOption. In a single province, with perfect information and no
uncertainty, setting the price instead of a quality should result inthe same economic optimum of
89 TWh. For example, suppose Zhejiang Province were to set a Feedlaw price for all qualifying
renewable energy resources at Y 40.1 per kWh, equal to the (economic) cost of coal generation
plus the externality value of 6.2 fen/kWh. Then theoretically the same set of resources should be
developed as in the case of setting a quantity standard of 6,994 GWh, which is the economic
optimum for Zhejiang. However, in a multiprovince situation, it i s virtually impossible to design
a feedlaw that gives the same result as a quantity target with tradable green certificates. Any
feedlaw equalization measure necessarily would be an administrative rather than market process
and the failures of the Soviet planned economy show that an administrative process cannot
simulate the functioning of a real marketplace.

International experience suggests that a feedlaw with a generous price can be highly effective in
promoting renewable energy technology. The surplus goes to the producers, which creates
incentives for technological innovation and cost reduction in turbine-generator equipment. This
 also creates a set of conditions that make it most likely for a domestic equipment manufacturing
 industry to be successfully established-which           i s of particular relevance for China where the
potential for reducing equipment costs through domestic manufacture i s substantial. Moreover,
 the certainty in feedlaw price makes it easier to finance projects than in systems where cost
 recovery i s through a market mechanism (such as tradable certificates) inevitably subject to
 greater uncertainty. Given all of these factors the feedlaw approach could prove beneficial to the
 development of a wind energy industry inChina

 Combined FeedlawmiddingApproach. The Zhejiang system for small hydro combines the
 features of the feedlaw price and the biddingvariant of the quantity approach. The feedlaw price
 provides certainty of revenues and the bidding ensures competitive prices. In principle it could
 be used everywhere. The system, however, needs two critical elements to be economically
 efficient. First the feed-in price should not be too far above the avoided cost, including
 externality cost. Second, for competition to work, project must be attractive to private


                                                     83

developers, meaning that the actual production costs for most projects must be significantly
below the Feedlaw price.

The Special Case of Wind Energy

Rationale. The development of wind power might deserve special consideration for two reasons.
Firstits economic potential can only be achieved inthe longrunif incentives are providedinthe
short run. And second, whatever the costs of providing such incentives in the short run, they are
likely to be outweighed by the long-term economic benefits. There are two main considerations
for the development of a separate wind power development program. The first i s the size of the
annual wind energy market to support the establishment of a domestic wind technology industry
that will bring about the substantial cost reductions. The second i s whether the requisite wind
energy market should be developed by setting a larger overall quantity target for renewable
energy or through a technology-specific target implemented either by a Feedlaw or a quantity
standard.

Need for a Technology-Specific Target. At the present stage of global technology, Chinese
manufacturers could reduce the cost of wind turbines by around 30 percent. As the global
technology advances, even larger cost reductions over present levels may be possible. However,
to achieve such cost reductions inChina, an assuredmarket will benecessary inorder to develop
the necessary industrial infrastructure. Based on the global market for wind turbine-generator
equipment, a domestic market size of at least 400 MW will be necessary. This suggests a 4,000
MW wind power target for 2015.

Policy Options for Achieving a 4000 MW Target. There are three basic options for achieving
the 4,000 MW target for wind energy development First, a feedlaw of 45 fen/kWh would induce
4,082 MW (generating 11.4 TWh), assuming the base case achievement of a 33 percent
reduction in equipment cost by 2010. The second i s the establishment of a separate wind energy
quantity standard amounting to 11.4 TWh, which could be implemented independently of a
general 89 TWh RPS for all other renewable energy generation. There i s no reason why two
types of green certificates could not be issued-one for wind and another for all other qualifying
renewable energy sources. The third option i s an increase in the overall renewable energy target
inorder to inducethe wind energytarget. The simulation modelindicates that anoveralltarget of
 127TWh by 2010 would achieve this result.

A feedlaw approachto wind energy development i s likely to require a price equalization scheme.
Tariff increases to support wind energy development are likely to be unsustainable without a
mechanism to spread the incremental costs among the provinces. For example, at a feedlaw price
of 50 fen/kWh, the tariff increasewould be 17 percent inInnerMongolia, but only 0.3 percent in
Guangdong. The funding of the equalization fund could take place through a national levy
sufficient to raise the incremental costs of Y 3.4 billion, which would be distributed to wind
project developers. However, matching the levy to the inherently unpredictable number of
projects would be difficult.

The NPVs of the quantity standard and the Feedlaw are very close-Y          32.1 billion and 32.3
billion, respectively-whereas   the NPV for an increase inthe overall renewable energy target to
 127 TWh has a significantly lower NPV (Y 25.3 billion). Thus, among the three options, that of



                                               84

increasing the overall quantity standardfrom 89 TWh to 127 TWh i s clearly inferior, becauseit
induces significant additional quantities of other noneconomic renewable energy technologies as
well. Unlike the case of wind power, increasing the market size for small hydro i s not likely to
reduce the future costs of small hydro. There are two reasonsfor this. First, the civil costs are not
a function of the scale of the overall market, only of individual project size. Second, an
establishedindustry for small hydro equipmentalready exists.

Conclusions

The conclusions of the analysis on the optimal scale-up quantity and policy instruments are
basedon a set of assumptions and tests of their robustness.However the findings are provisional
and not meant to be definitive policy statements. Rather the report provides the GoC with an
analytical tool, basedon international best practice, which it can apply to the assumptionsit finds
to be the most realistic. An important contribution of the report to the analytical literature is the
methodology for determining the target quantity for electricity supplied by renewable energy.
Although there are many examples of policy instruments designed to meet a given target, the
basis for setting the target has been, in many cases, not subject to the type of economic analysis
describedhere.

Based on the methodology and assumptions in this report, the preferred option for scaling up
renewable energy-based power generation in China would be to set a single national quantity
target of 89 TWh by 2010 rather than technology specific targets. The most viable policy
instrument for achieving this target would be a requirement that every province meet a
corresponding percentage of its total consumption from new renewable energy resources,
allowing for trade in green certificates to enable the provinces to attain their quantity standard at
least cost. This option has the highest level of net economic benefits and provides an efficient
mechanism for encouraging resource transfers to the western provinces. The establishment of a
system for trading green certificates could take place gradually and would not require the
immediate organization of a formal centralized market. In the early years of development, the
system could work perfectly well through bilateral deals between producers and power
companies who needto meet their renewable energy targets.

Wind energy is the only renewable energy source likely to need a technology specific target
 apart from the overall renewable energy target. This should be sufficiently large to induce the
development of domestic manufacturing industry. Preliminaryestimates indicate that inorder for
this to take place the size of the industry should reach 4,000 MW by 2015. The analysis shows
that the benefits of meeting this target using either a quantity standard a special Feedlaw would
be very close and it i s advisable to look more closely into each of these options. The report finds
that the alternative to each of these options-increasing     the optimum renewable energy target
 from 89 TWh to 127TWh-would           be an inferior optionbecause it could induce small hydro and
 other technologies that are uneconomic, but whose costs would unlikely decrease as a function of
 market size becausethey are already fully mature.

 There are several important parameters in,the economic and financial analysis that require
 further investigation during the pilot stage of the CRESP. On the economic side, there needs to
 be further study of the appropriate discount rate and the estimate of environmental damage costs




                                                   85

cause by the use of coal. On the financial side, there were several limitations in the analysis that
require further study.

Concerning the discount rate for the economic analysis, there are two issues that need to be
resolved, The first i s whether the standard rate of 12 percent used for investment projects i s an
accurate measure of the cost of capital in China. The second i s whether there i s some
justification for usinga different discount rate for renewable energy development considering the
fact that averting environmental damage has a strong future orientation, whereas a high discount
rate indicates a strong preference for the present. In addition, there i s some environmental
damage that mightbe irreversible. Many economists argue that the same rate must be used for all
investment projects in a given country. However, others argue for a much lower rate for
environmental projects in the order of 2-5 percent. There are precedents for differential rates in
China, notably in the educational sector. However this subject i s beyond the scope of the
economic analysis for this project and deserves further study and discussion during the first
phase of CRESP. Another area for further study is the estimation of environmental damage costs.
The values used in this report are based on studies from outside China and available estimates
vary widely.

There were several limitations in the financial analysis that could have an impact on the
estimation of financial flows of to the various stakeholders. First, renewable energy projects
located in western provinces are assumed to be developed by companies owned, located and
registered in these provinces. Some uncertainty exists, however, whether the concomitant tax
revenues actually accrue to the western governments, because they depend on the location,
ownership and registration of the corporate entities in question, rather than the location of the
project itself. Such revenues would diminish under the current tax system to the extent that
companies registered, located and owned in the East would build such projects in the West.
Second, based on international experience, the transaction cost of the proposed program i s
assumed to be small; however this assumption needs further research and confirmation. Third,
the taxes calculated in the financial analysis are based on statutory rates. However, in the past,
 actual taxes, especially income taxes, have been subject to negotiation between individual
 companies and tax authorities so that the actual tax revenues may be smaller than inthis report's
 financial analysis.

 Economic Analyses

 Cost-benefit analyses were carried out to estimate the ERRS of the two investment
 subcomponents of the proposed project (a) Fujian Pingtan Wind Power Generation Project (100
 MW);and (b) Jiangsu Rudong Biomass Generation Project (25 MW). This annex summarizes
 the methodology, assumptions andresults of the cost-benefit analyses.

 Economic Costs
 The economic costs of the investment components include (a) total investment costs of the
 renewable power generation projects and associated power network connection facilities, (b)
 O&M costs of the generation projects and related transmission and distribution facilities; (c) fuel


                                                  86

costs for the biomass generation project; and (d) cost associated with electricity losses incurred
during transmission and distribution and station uses. All the costs exclude taxes and duties and
financing costs. The conversion factor i s considered as 1.0 when estimating the economic costs
from financial costs because the distortions in the exchange and wage rates in the overall costs
are not significant enough to justify the use of shadow prices. The currency used in these
analysesi s Renminbi Yuan.

Economic Benefits
Two major benefits considered for the analyses are: (a) direct benefits from the sales of
electricity valued by the sales prices as a proxy of consumer willingness to pay; and (b) emission
reductions benefits that are estimated based on the New York Externality Model (Rowe and
others 1994).

Economic internal rate of return
The detailed estimates of ERR for the components are shown in the following tables A9.5 for
the Pingtan wind farm and A9.6 for the RudongBiomass project. The results show that EIRRsof
both project components are greater than 12 percent and the project components are thus
economically justified.

FinancialAnalysis

This section summarizes the results of the analysis of the financial soundness of the four
investment project components. It consists of two parts: (a) at the project level: financial
soundness of the project-the     financial rate of return of the project; and (b) at the entity level:
the financial structure, efficiency, and viability of the project entity.

The financial analyses of the two investment subcomponents are based on the latest feasibility
studies of the project components approved by the GoC and the project entities' audited
historical financial accounts, as well as their latest financial projection. All the project
components will be financed by IBRD loans, local loans and equity investments from the
shareholders. The terms and conditions of the IBRD loans and local loans used in these analyses
were those in late 2004. All the major assumptions are consistent with the current Chinese
financial and taxation regulations as well as common practices inthe project areas.

EconomicAnalyses

Cost-benefit analyses were carried out to estimate the EIRRs of the two investment
subcomponents of the proposed project and the two potential investment subcomponents. These
four investment components include (a) Fujian Pingtan Wind Power Generation Project (100.5
MW); (b) Inner Mongolia Wind Power Generation Project (100.5 MW); (c) Jiangsu Rudong
Biomass Generation Project (25 MW) and (d) Zhejiang Small Hydropower Development Project
(46 small hydropower station with a total incremental capacity of 82.66 MW). This annex
summarizes the methodology, assumptionsand results of the cost-benefit analyses.

Economic Costs
The economic costs of the investment components include (a) total investment costs of the
renewable power generation projects and associated power network connection facilities, (b)
O&M costs of the generation projects andrelated transmission and distribution facilities; (c) fuel
costs for the biomass generation project; and (d) cost associated with electricity losses incurred
duringtransmission and distribution and station uses. All the costs exclude taxes and duties and
financing costs. The conversion factor is considered as 1.0 when estimating the economic costs
from financial costs because the distortions in the exchange and wage rates in the overall costs
are not significant enough to justify the use of shadow prices. The currency used in these

Economic Internal Rate of Return
The detailed estimates of EIRR for the components are shown in following tables A9A.1 for
Huitengxile and A9A.2 for the Zhejiang projects. The results show that EIRRs of all the project
components are greater than 12 percent hence these project components are economically
justified.

                               Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues
                         CHINA RenewableEnergy Scale-up Program


Overview
The wider social benefits of increased renewable energy use are clearly understood by most
stakeholders and, indeed, underpin the rationale for the project. The MMP approach to support
increaseduse of renewable energy has been widely discussed among government and the public
sector, the power sector, renewable energy equipment and services suppliers and civil society.
Several large-scale meetings have beenheldto discuss the findings of the economic analysis and
the MMP while there has been unprecedented openness during preparation of the REL. There i s
wide acceptance for the concept, recognizing that whereas most groups stand to gain, as does
society as a whole, some stand to experience slightly lower growth-such     as coal producers-as
renewable energy displaces more conventional power generation (see Annex 9). Stakeholders
will continue to be involvedduring project implementation, as the law and regulations are further
developed.

There has been extensive consultation with local stakeholders who have participated fully during
preparation of the Support for Wind and Biomass in Pilot Provinces Component as part of the
safeguards process. Stakeholder perceptions of the investment subprojects are generally positive
since they clearly understand the expected local benefits from improved quality of electricity
supply, employment opportunities and, in Jiangsu, from the sale of an otherwise troublesome
waste.

Project alternatives have been compared. CRESP i s underpinned by analysis that establishes that
renewable energy can be the least economic cost solution for power production in China when
environmental externalities are taken into consideration. The projects are intended to
demonstrate the scale-up of renewables and their economic and environmental advantages over
coal-firedelectricity generation.

For phase I,  several options were discussed with the government to select a limited number of
provinces with good renewable energy resources and interest in developing them. At the same
time the government i s interested in GEF support to those technologies that are at or approaching
economic viability for electricity generation to scale-up and increase impact. A selection process
that examined all 31provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities resulted in the selection
of the four pilot provinces: Fujian, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang not only for their
interest inthe project, but also for the range of technologies that couldbe piloted.

Several other sites for subprojects were considered by each of the provinces, but rejected on
grounds of resource availability and site suitability. Sites chosen have been selected as the most
promising for demonstration at this time. Environmental and social impact analyses have been
carried out for each of the investment subprojects and are presented in environmental impact
 assessments (EIA) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs). The analyses have reviewed the
project and the site, and identified the main impacts during construction and operation. In
 addition, participatory and awareness raising techniques have been employed during the process
of preparingthe EIAs andRAPs.

The Borrower and implementing agencies have agreed to implement environment management
plans (EMPs), acceptable to the Bank, for each subproject, which include mitigation action
plans, supervision plans and monitoring plans. The sponsors appear both capable and committed
to implementingand monitoringthe plans.

Pingtan WindFarm
Potential local environment impacts duringconstruction will be noise, dust, vehicular movement,
excavation and movement of spoil, temporary vegetation loss and the effects of a small
workforce being located on the site. Potential impacts associated with the transmission line
routing are minor. Construction duration i s expected to be 24 months. Impacts and mitigation are
as follows:

    Noise. Some construction noise i s expected to exceed 60 dBa in some nearby villages, but
    will be temporary and reversible. Construction noise will be limited in areas near habitation
    by the use of machines meeting noise emission standards and by limiting construction to the
    day time;
    Dust and vehicular movement will occur, but is not expected to have a significant impact in
    the surrounding villages. Movement of spoil will be within the site andthere is no net surplus
    of spoil requiringdisposal;
    Some of the shelter trees will be cut down on the permanently acquired land and some of the
    temporarily acquired land. Lost trees will be replanted on temporarily acquired land;
    Although unlikely, it i s possible that a hitherto uncatalogued archaeological site will be
    uncoveredduringconstruction. Chance findprocedures have been identifiedinthe EIA;

During operation, potential impacts will be noise, visual and birdstrike. Impacts and mitigation
are as follows:




                                                 101

    Noise levels have been examined quantitatively. With the original turbine layout design,
    three villages would have been potentially subject to a nighttime background noise level
    above the standard of 50 dBa and two (of the same three) would have been subject to
    daytime background noise above the standard of 60 dBa. Layout adjustments proposed inthe
    EIA bringall sensitive sites below nighttimeanddaytime standards;
    Visual impact will result from the presence of the turbines and other installations. This i s
    partially mitigatedby the presence of trees, but also appears to be of no importance to locals,
    basedon their responses to surveys. Inother areas of China, wind farms have become tourist
    or educational attractions;
    The site does not lie on a migratory birdroute or i s a migratory habitat. There are no rare or
    protected species at the site. Potential impacts are expected to be minimal, based on
    experience with the existing wind farm.

Permanent land acquisition includes landfor wind machines, roads and substations, totaling 31.6
hectares, of which rural collective land i s 26.3 hectares, and 5.3 hectares i s state-owned shelter
plantation. 0.3 hectares i s required for the 110 kV line, predominantly rural collective land. A
further 28.6 hectares will be requiredfor temporary purposes duringconstruction, of which 23.1
hectares will be agricultural land and 5.5 hectares will be shelter plantation. Thirty one
households and 147 people are affected, with none needing relocation or losing more than 4.3
percent of its income from land that i s requisitioned. Compensation rates, determined by local
regulations are adequate, and a grievance procedure i s inplace.

East China Investigation and Design Institution (ECIDI) prepared the EIA and RAP, which have
been reviewed and revised to meet Bank's requirements. No potential indirect and/or long-term
impacts are expected from future activities in the project area. Environmentalmonitoring will be
carried out by the project sponsors andreported to the PingtanEnvironmentProtection Bureau.

The important stakeholders for the wind farm are the national, Fujian (provincial) and Pingtan
(county) government, the project sponsors, the provincial'power company (which will purchase
the power), and local communities. Before preparation of the project began, the project sponsors
solicited opinions from people in the affected townships and the state-owned shelter plantation
firm. County government also discussedthe proposal with staff from provincialbureaus of land
administration, forest, environment and power supply. Duringpreparation of the EL4 and RAP
there have beenextensive local consultations, including surveys inthe surrounding villages.

As part of preparation of the EIA, meetings have been held on the project's impacts and
informationhas beenreleasedto the local news media.

The sponsor has met township and village leaders andrepresentatives of project affected people.
Project affected villagers have participated in the preparation of the RAP and are expected to
continue to participate in its implementation. A grievance process has been established. Notices
of the project have been displayed in the Pingtan County government offices and the draft EIA
hasbeen displayed for comment inthe Pingtan County government offices.

Rudong Biomass Power Plant
Potential local environment impacts during construction will be noise, dust and vehicular
movement (and associatedair pollution) and the effects of a small workforce being located at the
site.

    Noise. Some construction noise i s expected to reach 66 dl3a at the site boundary.
    Construction noise will be limited in areas near habitation by the use of machines meeting
    noise emission standards andby limitingconstruction to the day time;
    Dust resulting from excavation and movement of spoil will be within the site and will be
    piled and covered. Construction areas will be screened. Air pollution from construction
    vehicles i s expected to be minor;
    Potential impacts on water during construction are expected to be minor and confined to use
    for living purposes and potential run off from the site. Mitigation is to confine and treat
    wastewater and minimize runoff;
    Although unlikely, it is possible that a hitherto uncatalogued archaeological site will be
    uncovered during construction. Chance find procedures have been included in the
    environment managementplan.

Potential impacts during operation will be from noise, atmospheric emissions, water use and
transport of biomass fuel into the plant and ash out of it. There i s an increased fire hazard
resulting from the storage of large quantities of straw.

    Noise. Main noise producing equipment will be placed at the center of the site, as far from
    the site boundary as possible and will be insulated where possible. Within the plant, control
    rooms will be insulated to protect the staff. Predicted noise at the site boundary i s expected to
    meet day- andnighttime standards;
    Atmospheric emissions. Atmospheric emissions of S02, NO, and particulates resulting from
     combustion will be within permitted levels and will be emitted through a 100 meter high
     stack;
    Water use. Likely water pollution will stem from water treatment (for boiler feedwater), oily
     residue, and sewage. Heavy metal antifouling agents will not be usedincooling tower water.
     Treated water will be disposed of to the Mafeng River. Treated sewage will be used for
     irrigation;
     Transport of fuel and ash. Biomass will be moved into the plant by road and river. Impacts
     are increased traffic, accident hazard and some vehicular pollution. Ash will be transported
     out of the plant for agricultural fertilizer by road. Procedures for road traffic safety and to
     reduce the hazards from the load are required;
     Fire hazard. Storage of large quantities of biomass increases the fire hazard through
     deliberate, accidental or spontaneous means. Extensive fire protection equipment i s included
     inthe feasibility study; an emergency response group is to be includedinthe staffing of the
     plant.
Land from Mabei Village will be acquired for the project, totaling 10.5 hectares (including 6.8

91people from 25 householdsare affected by the project, with an average loss of 30-36 percent
of their land.

Nanjing Bailing Environmental Protection Ltd. prepared the EIA, and ECIDIprepared the RAP,
which have been reviewed and revised to meet Bank's standard. New Energy Office in Rudong
County will be responsible for implementing the EMP, the Environmental Protection Bureau of
Nantong will be responsible for supervising the implementation of the Em, and the
Environmental Monitoring Station of Rudong County will be responsible for monitoring. A
detailed training plan i s also proposed to build capacity of the above institutions on EMP. No
potential indirect andor long-termimpacts are expectedfrom future activities inthe project area.

The important stakeholders for the biomass power plant are the national, Jiangsu (provincial),
and Rudong (county) governments, as well as the project sponsors, the provincial power
company (which will purchase the power), and local communities. The sponsors have
encouraged local participation through meetings, surveys and public awareness initiatives,
includingthrough television and radio. During site selection and design, project sponsors and the
Rudong County government have met township and village heads and village representatives.
Relevant departmentsof local government have also beenconsulted.

In preparation of the EIA, meetings and a survey were undertaken covering local institutions
(schools, hospitals etc) local government departments (irrigation and environment) and the
village committees. Their views have been recorded and responses provided. Local government,
towns, villages and villagers have participated in the RAP process. A survey has been carried
out. The implementing agency intends to prepare a resettlement informationbooklet and to hold
further meetings with stakeholders.A feedback and grievance procedure has been established.

Several other sites were considered by Inner Mongolia and Zhejiang but rejected on grounds of
resource availability and site suitability. Sites chosen have been selected as the most promising
for demonstration at this time. Environmental and social impact analyses have been carried out
for each of the investment subprojects and are presented in environmental impact assessments
(EIA) and RAPs. The analyses have reviewed the project and the site, and identified the main
impacts during construction and operation. In addition, participatory and awareness raising
techniques have been employed duringthe processof preparing the EIAs andRAPs.

The Borrower and implementing agencies have agreed to implement environment management
plans (EMPs), acceptable to the Bank, for each subproject, which include mitigation action
plans, supervision plans and monitoring plans. The sponsors appear both capable and committed
to implementing andmonitoring the plans.

The EM and RAP for Inner Mongolia and the EIA and RAP framework for Zhejiang have been
disclosed as follows:

Potential impacts for each of the potential sub projects are described below.

Huitengxile Wind Farm
Potential local environment impacts during construction will be primarily loss of grassland.
Potential impacts associatedwith the transmission line routing are expected to be minor and will
be evaluated in detail at appraisal. To mitigate the grassland loss, the following mitigation
measuresare proposed:

 0  Soil androcks will be removed manually;

 0  Machinery and equipment will be confined to designatedplaces;

 0  Vehicles will runon specified roads andnot on grassland;

 0  About half of the soil removed during construction will be backfilled into the wind turbine
    foundation and the remainingspoil will be removed to a designated site;


                                                  105

   After completion of the construction, bothsides of the roadswill be afforested.

Duringoperation, potential impacts will benoise, visual impacts, birdstrike, andelectromagnetic
radiation. Impacts andmitigation are as follows:

0  The noise level of wind turbines is projected to be about 90 dBa at the machines. The nearest
    residential area i s 3 km away, and the operators will primarily work in the control room,
    limiting noise impact.

0   The site is not a route for migrant birds. Based on the experience with the existing wind
    farms, operation of the wind farm i s not expected to have impacts on indigenous species.

0   Local residents believe that wind farm operation adds to the landscape. The local authorities
    plan to use the wind farm as a tourist attraction, as are the existing ones.

0   The intensity of the electromagnetic radiation during wind farm operation i s expected to be
    much lower than the standard, resulting inno negative impacts on human health. The survey
    with local residents showed that existing wind farm operations do not interfere with local
    radio andtelevision.

Permanent land acquisition includes landfor wind machines, roads and substations totaling 23.7
hectares, 0.4 hectares i s required for the 110 kV line, and a further 15.3 hectares i s required for
temporary purposesduringconstruction. All these landareas are grasslandowned by Huitengxile
State Farm, which has 130 staff. No individual farmer will be affected, nor are there indigenous
people living in the state farm. All compensation will be paidto the state farm, at adequate rates
determined by local regulations, and a grievance procedure i s inplace. Since the wind farm will
occupy less than 1percent of the land areas of the State Farm, it will have little impact on its
economic operations.

Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute prepared the EIA and RAP, which
have been reviewed and revised to meet Bank's standards. Wulanchabu Environment Research
Institutewill beresponsible for monitoring environment impacts.

The important stakeholders for the wind farm are the national, Inner Mongolia (provincial) and
Wulanchabu (county) government, the project sponsors, the provincial power company (which
will purchase the power), and local communities. The project sponsors and county government
solicited opinions from people in the affected areas and the state farm. Duringpreparation of the
EIA and RAP there have been extensive local consultations, including meetings and surveys in
the surrounding villages. The results demonstrated that local communities are quite supportive of
the wind farm, which they believe will create local employment opportunities and tourist
attractions. The villagers, however, emphasized the need to protect grassland. Their concerns
have been taken into account inproject design andimplementation.

Zhejiung Small Hydro
The Zhejiang small hydro subcomponent consists of thirty newly built and sixteen rehabilitation
small hydro subprojects. The Bank and the provincial government have reached an agreement on
a framework approach that sets up the criteria and procedures for meeting the safeguards and
fiduciary requirements for the small hydro projects. The PPO, staffed by Zhejiang Hydro Power
Development Management Center (ZHPDMC) has prepared a framework EIA and RAP, which
have been reviewed and revised to meet Bank's satisfaction.

                                                  106

EIA Framework. Each subproject should prepare its EL4 in accordance with the agreed upon
framework, which defines the contents, procedures, and implementation responsibilities. The
purpose i s to ensure that the EL4 of each subproject will be in compliance with both the Chinese
laws and regulations and the procedures required for Category B projects in the World Bank's
OP/ BP4.01.

Project Screening. The subproject company i s responsible for preparing initial EIA. Based on
GoC's regulation, EIA is required for all newly constructed subprojects. EMPs will be basedon
the draft EIAs.The framework has defined the project screeningcriteria.

Subproject EZAs. The EIA of each subproject should comply with the Chinese regulations on
"Code for Environmental Impact Assessment of Water Conservancy and Hydropower Project"
HJ/T88-2003.The framework outlined an EMPformat on environmental mitigation, supervision,
and monitoringplans for bothnewly built andrehabilitation projects.

For newly built small hydro projects (under 25 MW), potential localenvironment impacts during
construction may be waste water, solid wastes, noise, dust, and soil erosion. Potential impacts
during operation include land occupation and losses from reservoir inundation, noise, sewage,
low temperature water irrigation, and decreased water flow downstream. Sponsors will be
required to prepare an EIA andEMF.

For rehabilitation projects, potential local environmental impacts during construction will be
impacts on the consumers with lower water supply during reconstruction, waste water, solid
wastes, noise, dust, and soil erosion. Potential impacts during operation include noise, and land
losses from increased reservoir inundation. Sponsors will be required to prepare an EIA and
EMP.

EIA Review, Approval, and Disclosure. The PPO will be responsible for approving the EMPs.
After being revised incorporating recommendations from the public consultation process, the
EMPs will be submitted to the PPO for approval. The county, city, or district project office is
responsible for disclosing the approved EMP in the affected residential areas of the project or in
the nearby villages.

RAP Framework
Each subproject will prepare its RAP in accordance with this framework, which defines
resettlement principles, implementing institutions and resettlement standards. The purpose i s to
ensure RAP of each subproject consistent with the Chinese laws and regulations as well as the
requirements set inOP/BP 4.12.

Project screening. The resettlement survey will be organized jointly by the, city, or district
project office and the design unit. The project company, the county department for resettlement
and other relevant functional departments, township (town) people's government, representatives
of villages and groups, resettlers, and property owners all should participate andjointly develop
the project resettlement investigation materials.

The PPO decides whether an RAP is required based on the resettlement survey results and
agreeduponcriteria. If there are more than 10people subject to resettlement under the subproject
an RAP must be prepared. For newly constructed projects, if there are no relocations, or fewer


                                                107

than 10people need relocation, a simplifiedRAP i s required. For rehabilitation projects, if there
are no relocations (including laid-off employees) and land acquisition, there i s no needto prepare
RAP.The framework gives an RAPformat for eachsubproject to follow.

According to preliminary surveys, all the subprojects of this project involve no households being
moved, but only landacquisition.

Resettlement standards and compensation criteria. The design and construction of each
subproject should be consistent with the Chinese legislation for land acquisition compensation
and resettlement. The compensation criteria and calculation method for affected areas and people
(including land and property) are set out in the legal framework, which i s demonstrated in the
framework.

Public Consultation. Both EIA and RAP frameworks outlined the requirements for public
consultation and disclosure. The environment divisions and resettlement team of the county, city,
or district project office are responsible for notifying, organizing, carrying out, and recording
public consultations, inaccordancewith the criteria and procedure outlinedinthe frameworks.

Dam Safety
For both new and rehabilitated projects, the Dam Safety safeguard policy (OPBP 4.37) may be
triggered. The framework requires that the measures set out inOPBP 4.37 (safety inspections by
an independent panel) should be met when appropriate. Chinese Reservoir Dam Safety
Inspection Guidelines establish procedures for dam safety, which i s overseen by the provincial
water resources committee, which acts as a regulator. These procedures have been compared
with those set out in OPBP 4.37, and it has been determined that they comply with the
requirements of OPBP 4.37 with the exception of the need for a single safety committee to act
throughout the lifetime of the dam; this requirement has been includedinthe agreedPIP.

A. CONTEXT      AND BROAD      DEVELOPMENT          GOALS

Context

Reducing the dominance of coal i s a major objective of the GoC's main planning instruments for
the energy sector: the lothand llth         Five-Year Plans (FYPs), covering 2001-2005 and through
energy conservation and substitution by gas and renewable energy. This results from recognition
of the negative effects of emissions from the coal combustion neededto fuel economic growth-
the damages to human health from air pollution and the damages to agricultural crops andnatural
resources causedby acid rain. Inaddition to severe impacts on the national environment, China's
growing consumption of fossil fuels i s projected to make it, by 2015, the leading producer inthe
world of GHG emissions. Most of the increase in carbon emissions to 1.8 billion tons in 2020
will come mostly as a result of a rapid increase of fossil energy consumption.* Electricity
production alone i s projected to generate a significant share of these emissions, as shown in
Table A15.1below.

Inaddition to environmental benefits, development of renewable energy creates economic gains.
In many remote areas, renewable energy is the least cost source of electricity for local
populations or to supplement,grid supplies, as shown by China's successful small hydropower
program.' Renewable energy facilities in rural areas contribute to local employment and the tax
base. In addition, development of internationally competitive renewable energy industries would
generate export opportunities. China already exports small hydropower equipment. China i s also
beginning to export photovoltaic equipment stimulated in part by the WB-GEF REDP (Loan
4488-CHA), which has helped address quality issues: several manufacturers now produce low-
cost modules meeting international standards, which have found a ready export market.
Experience also suggests that the Chinese small hydropower, wind and biomass sectors are
highly responsive inmeetingchanging patterns of demandboth quantitative and qualitative.

The technical potential for renewableelectricity inChina includes about 160GW of wind power;
more than 75 GW of commercially exploitable small hydropower; approximately 125 GW (300

    studieshave consistentlyunderestimatedthe actual energy consumption growth inChina inrecent years.

Mtce) biomass energy; about 6.7 GW of known geothermal energy resources; and an abundance
of solar insolation. It i s difficult to estimate the economic market potential of the resources for
electricit     generation, because detailed data on resources throughout the country are very
limited.1B

Recognizing the potential contribution of renewable energy and to utilize abundant renewable
energy resources, the NDRC has prepared a medium and long-term plan for renewable energy
development, which has been incorporated into the national economic development plan. Its
targets are set out in Table A15.2. There is now general consensus in China to implement a
market-based policy, mandating that a share of electricity consumption comes from renewable
sources along lines introduced in Australia, the Netherlands, UK and states in the US (the so-
called Renewable Portfolio Standard or RPS) or imposing an obligation on electricity suppliers
to buy renewable energy based electricity at a government determined price (the so-called Feed-
inTariff)introduced mainly inSpain andGermany. The term mandatedmarket policy (MMP)is
usedhere to refer to bothsystems.

An analysis of the economic optimum for renewable energy was performed for CRESP." The
analysis looked at the amount of renewable electricity that i s economically viable based on the
avoided cost of conventional electricity, first without consideration of externalities, then with
inclusion of local and global externalities.I2The avoided costs of conventional generation, with
and without externalities, and the market potential for renewable electricity were estimated
separately for Eastern and Western China.

The CRESP analysis arrived at an estimate of four levels of potential renewable energy based
generation by 2010. First, with business as usual (BAU), which refers to the quantity of
renewable energy that i s likely to be built even in absence of any policy, case would be 35
TWh/yr. The second analysis shows that 79 TWh/yr of renewable electricity i s economically
viable at the avoided cost of conventional generation, without consideration of environmental


    I t i s proposedto improve data on market potential and resourcecost curves through resourcemeasurementand
    assessment activities duringPhase 1.
    See Economic and Financial Analysis of the China Renewable Energy Scale-up Program (CRESP)-Vol. I:The
    economically optimum quantity of grid-connected renewable energy, September 2003 (Report to the World
    Bank and GoC) on file
    Local externality damage estimates include the effects of air emissions from coal combustion of NO,, SO,, and
    TSP on human health and the effects of acid rain. National average damage costs were estimated in 2010 as
    US$1,095/ton of NO,, US$835/ton of SO, and US$3,540 per ton of TSP. Damage costs were estimated by
    province and were considerably higher ineasternprovinces than in westernprovinces.

externalities. This estimate rises to 89 TWh/yr with consideration of local externalities for air
emissions. This 89 TWh/yr i s considered the economic optimum from an environmental
perspective. It rises further to 101 TWh/yr with consideration of both local and global
externalities, as shown in Table A15.3 below. It i s important to note that, since these results are
based on partial data, estimates are tentative and likely to be conservative, especially for wind
power.

                                                                                    Externalities




The GoC decision to go beyond what the CRESP analysis suggests i s the economic optimum i s
based on the recognition that future contributions from renewables will be conditional on their
cost in relation to the alternative. China also sees a considerable industrial potential in years to
come and recognizes the need to invest in capacity now. Inshort, GoC believes that the benefits
from investing in renewable energy now are higher, or the costs are lower, or both, than those
suggestedby the CRESP economic analysis.

Under any case with effective MMP, the potential to replace coal i s considerable, in the medium
to long term. Further investigation of resources for renewable electricity i s likely to reveal that
the potential i s even greater.

BroadDevelopment Goals

China recognizes that large-scale exploitation of renewable energy will require reduction incosts
and efficiency gains through technological advancements, economies of scale, indigenous
manufacturing and lower transaction costs. It recognizes that the government needs to play an
important role in developing policies that remove market barriers, attract investment by the
public and private sector, and develop internationally competitive domestic manufacturing
capabilities in renewable energy technologies. This objective was first articulated in the 10th
FYPandhasbeencarried through into the 1lthFYP(2006-10).

The higher goals of the program seek to address global environment and air quality issues.
Increased renewable energy production provides a positive contribution to global environment
and improved air quality while reducing the economic cost associatedwith harmfuleffects of the
use of coal and GHG emissions. The program will also contribute to the GoC objective of
economic development inthe laggingregions, since much of the renewable energy resource i s in
those areas.


                                                121

The GOC considers an MMP as an essential tool to catalyze large-scale renewable energy
development. The MMP i s required to address the failure of the market price for thermal
electricity to reflect the costs of damage borne by society, resulting from pollution caused by
burning fossil fuels (externalities). The GoC stated its intention to implement an MMP to
accelerate renewable electricity in the Energy Sub-Plan of the 10th FYP and has taken the first
step in implementing it by introducing the REL. The law was enacted by Chinese National
People's Congress on February 28, 2005; implementing regulations are required as the law is due
to take effect on January 1,2006.

CRESP i s designedto facilitate the effective implementation of an MMP and gradually create the
conditions for sustainable scale-up of renewable energy. It would support introduction and
implementation of the REL and regulations, as well as a range of other measures to strengthen
commercial capacity to scale up renewable energy markets. In later phases, CRESP would also
support development of trading mechanisms to allow the development of the renewable
resources located inChina's less developed regions, to meet cost effectively the electricity needs
of developed regions with large power markets and financing capabilities. Development of
trading schemes would minimize MMP cost and linkthe MMP to carbon trading mechanisms.

B. BARRIERS

The main barriers that have been identified duringproject preparation by Chinese experts are set
out inthe following paragraphs.

Lack of policies to address thefailure of the market to reflect extemality costs.Inmost countries
with large-scale renewable electricity generation, suppliers have been required by law or
regulation to purchase renewable electricity. In China, there i s not yet such a legal requirement,
and effective implementation of environmental laws cannot .be taken for granted. It has been
difficult to develop a national renewable electricity policy inChinafor several reasons:

0   Responsibilities are fragmented among many agencies including the NDRC, Ministries of
    ScienceandTechnology (MOST), Agriculture (MOA) andWater Resources (MOWR);

0   There i s inadequate information on resources, especially to derive the resource cost curves
    required to develop national policies, estimate value of renewable resources to the grid,
    calculate incremental costs, and set targets;

0   The economy and power sector in China are in transition from being centrally planned to
    beingmarket-oriented andderegulated;

High costs.High costs and limited prospect of their reduction are also limiting the market size.
Each i s explained in more detail below:

0   Financial cost per kWh from renewables i s relatively high when compared with electricity
    from coal. The higher financial cost i s one of the main factors limiting the market size. The
    cost gap betweenthermal andrenewable electricity is the result of three factors:
    (a) Relatively immature renewable technologies face barriers to their deployment, or have
    yet to benefit from market growth and transformation in China or from international
    technology and market development, or a combination of all three;
    (b) The externalities of fossil fuel arenot includedinthe financial price of electricity;

                                                 122

    (c) The lack of highquality localrenewable energy equipment and support services increases
    the cost andperception of risk inprojects.

0   Unlikely cost reduction prospectsunder "business as usual" deter early movers:
    (a) There is insufficient competition because projects have been developed at the county or
    prefecture level for small hydro projects (favoring local manufacturing) and there are limited
    arrangements for competition inwind projects;
    (b) Price regulation based on the debt repayment formula is cost plus (which does not
    encourage price reduction) and front loads electricity prices for technologies with high
    capital and low operation costs.
Weak manufacturing and service industry. Though it has been effective in some respects, most
notably small hydro, the renewable energy industry is not geared to commercial or competitive
requirements. Equipment i s often of low quality and performs poorly, whereas the service
industry i s inadequate to design, engineer, operate, maintain or service installations. PPAs are
inadequate and not enforced. Resourcedata are piecemeal, inaccurate inmost instances and often
not public. Commercial banks are not familiar with renewable energy projects, except small
hydropower for community use. Project approval processes are complex and not transparent. In
sum, the "market infrastructure" needed to support commercial project development is not in
place.

Poor operating record and reputation. Many of China's existing wind farms and small
hydropower plants and grids have been poorly maintained and are operated inefficiently. Poor
plant performance has contributed to the view that renewables are not a viable option for
adequatelymeeting significant amounts of demand.

Mismatched distribution of renewable resources and ability to pay. Much of the resource is
located in poor western provinces with limited electricity markets and capacity to pay for
renewable electricity development. For example, wind resources inInner Mongolia could supply
the large North China power grid through existing interconnections, but there i s no mechanism
available to spread the cost of development of these resources to consumers outside the small
InnerMongoliagrid(compartmentalized grids).

Little experience with some promising renewable electricity technologies. There has been little
experience in China with some promising technologies, including small hydro rehabilitation,
biomass generation for sale to the grid, and large wind farms using "third generation" wind
technology.

C. GLOBAL     OBJECTIVE

The program objective is to enable commercial renewable electricity suppliers to provide energy
to the electricity market efficiently, cost-effectively and on a large scale.

The core of the program is GEF-financed support for institution and capacity building for the
scale-up of renewable energy basedelectricity generation capacity.




                                                  123

Phase 1
The first phase will contribute to the program's global objective through development and
implementationof the legal and regulatory framework to create and gradually increase the share
of renewable energy based electricity generation, and support its effective implementation in
four provinces. Now that the RELhas been enacted, associated regulations will be prepared and
promulgated during this phase. Effective implementation and enforcement, which have always
been problematic and uneven for environmental laws, will be piloted in four provinces, namely
Fujian, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang and supported by well targeted and sustainedTA.
Technology transfer at the national level will be supported through capacity building and TA,
focusing particularly on wind and biomass. Investments in important technologies will be
undertaken in the four pilot provinces to demonstrate the viability of large-scale renewable
energy based electricity generation. Expected duration i s 3-4 years. GEF will provide a
US$40.22 million grant to support the institutional development and capacity building
component during the first phase, with cost-sharing from participants expected to contribute a
further US$48.6 millionfor atotal cost of about US$88.82 mi1li0n.l~

Triggers to move from GEF phase 1to 2 will be basedon indicators of institutional progress and
scale-up of renewable energy development and are expected to include: (a) issuing of required
regulations to implement the REL; (b) measures of progress in implementing the law and
regulations and the investments inthe pilot provinces; and (c) full commitment and disbursement
of at least half of the GEF grant for the first phase.

Phase 2
Phase 2 will continue to support the program's global objectives through institutional
development and capacity building to decrease further cost, and improve the financing
framework and provide assistance for implementation in about 10 provinces. TA will be
providedfor the implementation of the REL and regulations in an increased number of provinces
as required. Continued support for technology transfer, quality improvement and cost reduction
will be providedfor wind and other selectedtechnologies, buildingon Phase 1results and market
needs. Further lending to support investment (additional loans and repeater projects mainly to
reduce processing time and, exceptionally, SILs) will be discussed, on a needbasis, with GoC to
bridge the gap for financing needs to sustain scale-up inphase 2. Expected duration i s 3-4 years.
Total cost for TA i s expected to be about US$120 million (of which about US$50 million GEF
 grant).

 Phase 2 to phase 3 triggers will be determined during appraisal of phase 2, but are likely to
 include measures of progress in the implementation of the law and achievement of the program
 performance indicators, measures of investment (Bank- and non-Bank-financed) in renewable
 energy inthe phase 1and 2 provinces, and measuresof progress incost reduction.

Phase 3
 The third phase will contribute to the full achievement of the program's global objective through
 support to the remaining (less developed) provinces in their implementation of the REL and

 l3  The cost-sharing i s based only on the direct costs borne by the participants in the GEF supported activities,
     using a ratio of 1:3, which is based on experience gained during implementation of Renewable Energy
     Development Project. Indirect and other contributing programs' costs are a lot more important, but very
     difficult to estimate.

regulations. TA would continue to be provided for institutional strengthening and capacity
building to meet international and best practice standards in constructing and operating
renewable energy based electricity production facilities in the country. Continued support for
localization, quality improvement and cost reduction will be provided to bring selected
technologies to competitiveness with fossil fuel based electricity generation. Further lending to
support investment (additional loans and repeater projects mainly to reduce processing time and,
exceptionally, SILs) will be discussed, on a need basis, with GoC. Expected duration i s 3-4
years. Total cost for TA i s expected to be about US$l50 to 200 million (of which about US$50
million GEFgrant).

Bank Investment Support
Bank investment support in each phase will be on an "as required" basis determined during
phase preparation and processed as SILs. Their impacts in terms of investment and scale-up of
renewable energy will be assessed for their contribution toward achievement of the objectives of
the program according to GEFprogram triggers to move from one phase to the next.

D. BASELINECASE

Under the baseline case, NDRC and different ministries and agencies would continue to support
renewable electricity development, focusing mainly on the supply side. These activities would
not be well coordinated, as no single national policy framework for renewable electricity would
be adopted. The REL might be in place, but would at best be only partially implemented.
Barriers related to lack of market would remain unaddressed. Many projects that are
economically viable without considering externalities would not be developed.

The NDRC would continue to support wind power development, through its concession program
and some supply oriented measures. Limited attention would be given to the market for power
producedfrom the concessions, andhow the incremental wind power costs would be met.
                                                                                            , .

Small hydropower development would also slow, as the MWR has stopped state support to
installation of small hydropower. There would be little small hydropower rehabilitation, as the
county and township governments would not be aware of opportunities, nor have the technical
support and access to financing required to make investments. Significant development of
biomass generation would not take place because of lack of technical support, locally available
equipment, financing and PPAs.

Fragmented TA activities on various aspects of the law would be carried out with international
support from UNDP, ADB, bilateral donors Energy Foundation and others, but no implementing
framework would be adopted or provisions put in place to ensure its effectiveness. Locally
manufactured equipment would remain of poor quality and outdated technology as there i s
insufficientmarket tojustify investmentintechnology improvement (development and transfer).

Barrier RemovalActivities inBaseline

Barrier removal activities would take place, as summarized in Table A15.4. These include
activities by GoC agencies, as well as internationally assisted activities (for example, the
UNDP/GEF Capacity Building for Rapid Commercialization of Renewable Energy, the World
BanWGEF REDP, the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ's) wind


                                               125

energy support program, support of about US$0.5 milliordyear from the Energy Foundation for
renewable electricity policy development, and many other activities).

The concession program-which            targets 3,000 Mw of new wind capacity over 10
years-provides     a mechanism for developers to propose projects and be connected to the grid
under a PPA. The program is still in its early stages and so its effect on removal of barriers,
especially to newer technologies, i s difficult to assess.

                                               barriers remain, even for projects that are
                                               economically viable today.
IncrementalInvestments inRenewable Electricity Projects

The total result expected in the business as usual case would be 35 TWh/yr of new renewable
electricity, from 7.0 GW capacity by 2010. Capacity installed would be mainly of new small
hydropower, in those provinces where the government takes a strong role in encouraging this
development for social and economic reasons. It i s possible that significant wind capacity may
be added, but the prospectsremainuncertain.

Emission Reduction BenefitsinBaseline

Under the above estimates, during the 20-year lifetime of the investments emission reductions
from renewable electricity generation installed 2001-2010 will amount to about 300 million tons
of carbon; 2.2 million tons of NO,; 11million tons of SO,, and 300,000 tons of total suspended
particulates (TSP).

E. GEFALTERNATIVE--PHASE           1

Under the GEF Alternative, Phase 1, legal and regulatory framework will be prepared for the
MMP along with support for its implementation in the pilot provinces to initiate actions to
achieve program objectives countrywide. Phase 1barrier removal activities would aim to result
in a high proportion of those investments that are economically viable at the avoided cost, not
including environmental externalities. This represents a conservative approach, but assumes the
MMP will not be fully introduceduntilthe endof phase 1.

IncrementalBarrier Removal Activities under Phase 1

Phase 1 components and barrier removal activities will be completed as described below and
summarized inTable A15.5.

National Level InstitutionalStrengtheningand Capacity Building: US$20.82million GEF,
US$33 million counterpartfunds
National level institutional strengthening and capacity building consists of six subcomponents as
follows:

    MMP research (US$1 million GEF). Studies on further development of the MMP and its
    implementation will include (a) distributing national targets between provinces; (b) setting
    the tariff level for renewables; (c) transforming the policy from price-based to quantity-based
    (based on early versions of the law the price-based mechanism has been chosen at least as an
    interim measure); (d) sharing incremental costs between provinces; (e) developing trading
    schemes to minimize MMF cost; (f) linkingthe MMP to carbon trading mechanisms; and (g)
    further preparing the medium- to long-term plan for renewable energy development.
    Financing will support consultants to undertake the studies;
    Support to MMP implementation (US$1.25 million GEF). Studies, capacity building and
    training to support implementation of the RELwill include (a) preparation of regulations that
    outline detailed implementation mechanisms; and (b) capacity building and training for
    implementing agencies, regulators and others affected by the law. Financing will support
    consultants and training activities to implement this subcomponent
    Technology improvement for wind (US$16.17 million GEF, expected counterpart funds
    US$27 million). There will be four activities under this subcomponent as follows:
     (a) Technology development by selected manufacturers. This activity will provide grants to
    companies to share the costs of projects to accelerate the transfer of variable speed; pitch
    controlled and related wind technology to China using licensing, joint ventures, technology
    development using international consultants or other means. Grants will be provided to share
    up to 50 percent of the cost of projects. Beneficiaries will be selectedcompetitively basedon
    proposals submitted by manufacturers that will be encouraged to collaborate with design

                                                 127

institutes or other sources of know-how. Beneficiaries will be selected competitively based
on proposals that will be evaluated and ranked by disinterested national and international
experts. Selection will be guided by the market-driven and results-oriented nature of the
proposals, and their ability to yield results inthe Chinesemarket within five years;
(b) Standard setting. Current Chinese standards for wind turbines are limited in scope and
requirements and are not equivalent to international standards set by the International
Standards Organization (ISO) or the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This
activity will support the development and adoption of standards by Standardization
Administration of China. Financing will be provided for consultant support and the formation
of a technical standards committee;
(c) Wind testing center. The project will provide assistanceto a testing organization selected
by the government to establish a wind testing facility through capacity building of staff,
support to develop procedures and to become accredited as a test center by an internationally
recognized standards body such as I S 0 (IS0 25) or IEC (IEC 17025). Financing will be
provided for consultant support, training andthe purchaseof testing equipment;
(d) Certification. A certification body will be supported through capacity building, training
and consultant support with a "twinning" agency to bring it up to the standards that will
permit it to certify wind turbine design and performance. Consultant support will also be
provided to the CNCAA to assist it in deciding whether to opt for mandatory or voluntary
certification of turbines inChina;
(e) Establishment of a National Wind ResourceAssessment Center. The project will support
development of resource assessment methodologies, national wind resource assessment
standards and a national wind resource database. It will also support overlay of wind
mapping with GIS data to convert resource measurementsto identifiable projects. It will also
facilitate knowledge transfer and best practices on international status of wind resource
 assessment, and support the pilot provinces in planning and implementing wind resource
 assessment activities. A focal point for the Center will be identifiedduringproject start-up;
 (f) Long-termcapacity building.Efforts to increasethe supply of skilled and knowledgeable
 designers, engineers, manufacturing specialists and wind farm developers and operators will
 be supported. Two universities will be supported to set up master's level and renewable
 energy engineering courses, primarily focused on wind and biomass. Universities will be
 selected based on their track record and reputation for quality, the relevance of the courses
 they propose, the courses' ability to meet market needs and cost-sharing. There will also be a
 fellowship program to allow more senior engineers to study abroad at existing centers of
 excellence;
 (g) Studies on interconnection to the grid and turbine micrositing. The project will support
 studies on connection of wind farms to the grid and their impacts on grid stability. It will
 raise awarenessof power grid operators and wind developers of interconnection requirements
 and transfer international best practice and knowledge. It will conduct studies on the impact
 of wind farms on grid stability in one province. Training on turbine micrositing, which has
 for some time been a weak point in wind farm design, will be provided to complement
 existing activities.
 Technology improvement for biomass (US$2.4 million GEF, expected counterpart funds
 US$6 million). This subcomponent will provide grants to companies to share the cost of
 projects to improve the quality and reduce the cost of biomass technologies, particularly

                                               128

   those related to boilers and equipment handling. Grants will be provided to share up to 50
   percent of the cost of projects. Beneficiaries will be selected competitively based on
   proposals that will be evaluated and ranked by disinterested national and international
   experts. Selection will be guided by the market-driven and results-oriented nature of the
   proposals, and their ability to yield results in the Chinese market within five years.
   Supporting studies will also be undertakeninthis area;

Province-levelTA (US$lO.6 million GEF, expected counterpartfunds US$9.0million)
The province-level institutional strengthening and capacity building consists of five
subcomponentsas set out below. It will take place inthe pilot provinces (Fujian, InnerMongolia,
Jiangsu, and Zhejiang).

   MMP implementation (US$2.4 million GEF).Although RELwill be passedat national level,
   implementation will be delegatedto the participating pilot provinces. They will be required
   to prepare regulations and decrees, promulgate them and ensure their compliance. Inaddition
   they will also need to prepareprovincial renewable energy development strategies, plans and
   financial incentive policies; testing renewable energy promotion models and creating
   awareness among stakeholders. This subcomponent will finance consulting services and
   trainingfor provincial counterpartsandrenewable energy market participants;

   Resource assessments (US$4.2 million GEF). The purpose of this subcomponent i s to
   provide detailed information to the public on the renewable energy resources in each of the
   provinces. For each province, a cost-resource curve for the main renewable resources and a
   database with resource information will be prepared and published. Measurement standards
   will also be prepared, to permit like-for-like comparisons. In Fujian, high-resolution wind
   resource measurements and wind farm siting data will be prepared. In Inner Mongolia,
   assessments on the wind, solar energy, biomass and municipal solid waste resource and wind
   farm siting in 12 counties will be undertaken and published. In Jiangsu, wind and biomass
   resources will be assessed and published. In Zhejiang, small hydro resources capable of
   producing electricity below 3,000 hourdyear will be evaluated (above 3,000 hourdyear i s
    already known). Areas of biomass concentration and wind resource will also be assessed.
    Cost-shared support for scaling up renewable energy (US$3 million GEF, expected
    counterpart funds US$9 million). This subcomponent will help provinces carry out studies
    and pilot or demonstration projects in renewable energy technologies other than the one in
    which the investment subproject will take place. Grants will be provided for cost-shared
    activities, awarded on a competitive basis across the four pilot provinces. Fujian will carry
    out studies to identify pilot tidal and geothermal projects. Inner Mongolia will prepare
    biomass projects and study the potential for grid connected PV. Jiangsu will demonstrate
    building-integrated PV systems and strengthen its existing renewable energy development
    center. Zhejiang will develop standards for integrating solar water heaters into buildings and
    prepare biogas projects. This component will also support preparation for a pilot offshore
    wind farmexpected to be implemented duringphase 2.
    Capacity buildingfor market participants (US$l million GEF). Capacity buildingfor market
    participants not directly involved in projects in the pilot provinces will be carried out under
    this component. It will include training for developers, banks, technology and service
    providers covering the project cycle. Financing will also be provided under this
    subcomponent for studies on improvements to procedures for project approval, and

                                                129

   integration of renewable energy into electricity grids and identifying and removing
   bottlenecks inrenewable project development.

SupportingInvestment Scale-up (US$2.2 million GEF, expected counterpartfunds US$6.6
million)
Based on the lessons of previous renewable energy projects, this subcomponent aims to make
resources available to build a strong pipeline of bankable renewable energy projects. The
companies implementing the investment projects will be provided resources to carry out
feasibility studies, resource assessments and other preinvestment activities on a cost-shared
basis. Training and capacity building, and access to international experience and best practice
will also be eligible activities. In Zhejiang, the Zhejiang Hydro Power Development
Management Center (ZHPDMC) will implement this subcomponent in coordination with the
small hydro companies. In Inner Mongolia, GEF funds will be provided to Long Yuan and not
the company implementing the wind farm, to avoid risk of commingling GEF and PCF funds in
the Huitengxile wind farm subproject described below;

Program Management and Coordination (US$3.38million GEF)
Program management will include day-to-day procurement, financial and contract management
for all tasks carried out under the TA program. It will include representation of the PMO in the
pilot provinces. Additional tasks expected to be carried out by the PMO at least initially include
coordination with other GoC renewable energy initiatives, monitoring and evaluation of the
impact of REL and CRESP, preparation of annual reports and plans on behalf of NDRC,
providing liaison between the InstitutionalDevelopment and Capacity Building Component and
other stakeholders, including the World Bank, and preparation of phase 2 of CRESP. Also
included under this component are national-level studies, to be initiated by the PMO, to address
further policy development issues as they arise including, for example, development of a long-
term biomass strategy.

Unallocated (US$3.22 million GEF)
An unallocated amount of US$3.22 million is retained. US$3 million of the funds are earmarked
for the companies undertaking Bank-financed investment subprojects in Inner Mongolia and
Zhejiang. The balance will be put toward activities where the budget proves inadequate or in
responseto unforeseenrequirements.

Incremental Investments inElectricity Projects as a Result of Phase 1

It is expected that Phase 1would remove barriers to a substantial proportion of investments that
are economically viable without consideration of environmental externalities. Most of the
incremental investments would focus on biomass and small hydro rehab. The result would be to
scale up renewable electricity development from business as usual (BAU) generation of about 35
TWh/yr (7.0 GW) by 2010 inthe baseline to an estimated 60 TWh/yr (111.9 GW) by 2010. This
would increase incremental renewable electricity generation over the baselineby 71percent.

Incremental EmissionReductionBenefits as a Result of Phase 1

Under the estimates of incremental investments outlined above, reductions of carbon emissions
from renewable electricity generation added between 2001 and 2010 will increase from 300
million tons under the baseline to 455 million tons in the GEF Alternative-Phase 1. In addition,
there will be an incremental reduction over the baseline of 1.2 million tons of NO,; 5.9 million
tons of SO, and 162,000 tons of TSP. All emission reductions are measured over the 20-year
lifetime of the investments.

F. GEFALTERNATIVE-PHASES 2AND 3

GOC plans to install 116 GW of additional renewable energy capacity (small hydro wind,
biomass and PV systems) by 2020 that will displace approximately 221 million tons of coal per
year and contribute around 404 TWh per year of electrical generation. CRESP Phases 2 and 3
would contribute to that target but, given the differing time span and uncertainties surrounding it,
it i s difficult to make an estimateof its contribution.

Incremental Barrier Removal Activities inPhases 2 and 3

Activities to be carried out in Phases 2 and 3 and their timings will be defined in Phase 1.
Currently foreseen activities under CRESP Phases 2 and 3 are summarized in Table 6 below.
These phases focus on implementing the policy framework more widely and technology
development support and are assumed to take place by 2015. Both aim at major long-term
barriers highcosts and the mismatch of locationof resources and ability to pay. Support for other
activities continues, but the focus shifts to implementation of the MMP policy framework.

Incremental Investments inElectricity Projects as a Result of Phases 2 and 3

A conservative assumption would be that incremental investment inelectricity projects inphase
2 would be that suggested by the CRESP economic analysis. This would imply that, with the
MMP in place, the economic optimum of renewables, including local externalities, would be
achieved since the external costs of coal would be reflected in the price paid for renewables. On
that basis, there would be a scaling up from 60 TWh to 89 TWh/yr (based on installed capacity
in 2010 of 17.5 GW) during Phase 2. An estimated 150 TWh/yr from 29.6GW of installed
renewable electricity capacity i s taken as the tentative end of Phase 3 target, though this will be
further refined during phase preparation. This assumption i s conservative given the GoC's own
target of 404 TWh in 2020. Most of the investments would be shared between new and
rehabilitated small hydropower, biomass and wind.

Incremental Emission Reduction Benefits as a Result of Phases 2 and 3

reductions of carbon emissions from renewable electricity generation between phase 1and 2 of

165 million tons and a further 486 million tons between phase 2 and 3, incremental increases
over the baseline of 320 million tons and 806 million tons, respectively. In addition, phase 2
would yield an incremental reduction over Phase 1of 1.3 million tons of NO,; 6.9 million tons of
SO, and 160,000 tons of TSP. Phase 3 would yield further incremental reductions of 3.6 million
tons of NOx, 19 million tons of SO, and 580,000 tons of TSP. All emission reductions are
measuredover the lifetime of the investments.

GlobalBenefits

According to the illustrative results above, during CRESP's lifetime, there would be an
incremental reduction of carbon emissions above the Baseline of about 800 million tons. At a
GEF cost for the Program of US$140 million, carbon cost would be about US$0.17 per ton
during the 20 years lifetime of facilities. Inaddition, the CRESP Phase 2 and 3 activities would
lay a solid basis for continued installation of renewable electricity facilities after the Program
terminates. These indirect benefits have not been calculated, but would reduce the incremental
costs of carbon further.

A sensitivity analysis has been performed on emission reduction on different targets. The
business as usual case with 35 TWh target i s taken as a low case, but would result in zero
incremental emissions (and presumably no GEF program could be justified). The CRESP case
for economically optimum target (79 TWh) without environmental externalities i s selected as a
"minimum likely" on the basis that phases 2 and 3 will not go ahead without the framework in
place to achieve that level. As an upper bound, the GoC target of 404TWWyear by 2020 i s
selected as the high case (see Table 8). The analysis indicates a range of GEF cost US$0.07 to
US$0.64 per ton of carbon for 2015.

H. SUSTAINABILITY

After implementation of the CRESP, a policy framework i s inplace to address the failure of the
market to incorporate renewable electricity. If the financial market price of conventional
electricity i s still below the financial price of renewable electricity at the end of the Program, the
MMP framework and target would still be in place, encouraging further renewable electricity
growth. Therefore, sustainability i s ensured. At the point where renewable electricity i s
financially competitive, the MMP tool i s no longer required and renewable electricity growth
would be sustained by market forces. If a market develops for international trading in global
environmental benefits and China chooses to participate, this would further ensure the
sustainability of the results from the program.

                                INDEPENDENT    TECHNICAL    REVIEW
                                        By Dr.Jan Hamrin
                       Executive Director, Center for ResourceSolutions

In general, this project is a well thought out, comprehensive approach to the development of
cost-effective, grid-connected renewable electricity technologiesin China. Most of the suggested
modifications mentioned below arefocused on making explicit what is implied in the program
plan. There are also some small additions that might sharpen the potential effectiveness of the
planned actions.

Important Issues

Scientific and technical soundness of the project

Has the most appropriate and effective approach been used to remove the barriers? Generally,
the approach to reducing the barriers i s sound. Iwould recommend, however, the Bank look at
one of the main barriers that i s not addressed-development of a local industry, both equipment
manufacturers and project developers (such as resource assessors, business plan developers,
financial experts). Work on clarifying regulations and enforcing PPAs should go a long way
toward creating an independent power producer (PP) industry, but TA should probably be
provided to help train market entrants on important issues-calculating good resource
assessments (especially for wind energy), business plan development, financing, and so forth. A
separate but related component of this can be to preselect a group of interested and willing
financial institutions that can receive training on financing for renewable energy projects. This i s
important because the Bank aims to catalyze commercial investments in renewable energy, and
this will require financing from China's bankingsector andor international banks andinvestors.

Discussion: The section that discusses the barriers to further renewable energy development in
China-although      a good summary-is     missingone barrier that is reflected throughout the entire
document-the      lack of any renewable energy industry in China-either domestic manufacturing
or joint ventures with foreign companies. The reasons for the lack of a renewable energy (RE)
manufacturing base are all of the barriers listed in this section. Yet if all of these barriers are
changed overnight, there would still a significant lack of capacity to: fully assess renewable
resources (particularly wind), design and conduct detailed feasibility studies, develop a complete
business plan, obtain financing and, most importantly, procure equipment at the lowest possible
cost without relying on imports.

The lack of a well-developed indigenous industry includes not just renewable energy
manufacturers, but PPs that can operate facilities. The STAP report correctly points out that



                                                  139

PPAs are poorly developed and not enforced, but again, if this changed overnight, the lack of
IPPs inthe market would still constrain the development of the projects. Inthis sense, the Bank
has a role in catalyzing the entrance of IPPs in the market-a    role not clearly spelled out in the
STAPreport.

Has the most appropriate and egective approach been used to reduce the costs of the
technologies? Again, the focus on changing market conditions-through         an MMP-is     critical,
but a component that is not made explicit (though implied) is the creation of an indigenous
manufacturing base. The reliance on importedtechnologies raises the costs of renewable energy,
and a way to reduce those costs is domestic manufacturing. If the Bank encouraged the GoC to
adopt investment incentives, such as tax holidays and concessional loans on manufacturing
equipment (combined with a strong effort to ensure this equipment meets international
standards), this would be quite helpful. This TA will be relatively small over the course of the
entire project. Although local equipment will lower the cost of the technologies, other financial
incentives will lower the cost of the electricity generation itself. In addition to the VAT on
equipment being reduced to 6 percent (as it i s for small hydro), a modest effort could help ensure
that the custom duties of importing parts of a wind turbine are made less than the duties on an
entire turbines (as it the case now), For example, a recent report by Tsinghua University
illustrates the potential cost reductions of smart incentive policies. Iam not suggesting that the
Bank try and change all of what i s listed below-it        i s just to demonstrate the potential. I
understandthat the Bank is uncomfortable with subsidies as they can distort marketinvestments;
however incentives inrenewable energy (particularly inthe U.S. andEurope) are often passedon
the basis that these subsidies do not approach the level of direct and indirect public support for
fossil fuels. This i s particularly true for China. Listed below are some examples for wind
generation:

                1. Income Tax: If the current income tax rate of percent were reduced to 15
                    percent and 0, the cost of wind generation per kWh would be reduced by 4.3
                    percent and 8 percent, respectively.

                2. VAT: If the current 17 percent value added tax on electricity sales were
                    reduced to 6 percent and 0, the cost of wind generation would decreaseby 9.6
                    percent and 14.6 percent, respectively (this incentive is tied to generation
                    because the exemption only comes when a kWhi s sold);

                3. VAT ZZ: If the current 17 percent VAT on wind-generation equipment sold to
                    developers were reduced to 6 percent and 0, the cost of wind power would
                    decline by 8 percent and 12.4 percent, respectively.

                4. Low-ZnterestLoans: If the interest rate of a long-termloan were reduced from
                    15 percent to 7 percent, the overall cost of wind power would be reduced by
                    21.7 percent.

3.2 Strategic Choices: This section compares the range of options for promoting renewable
energy development and talks specifically of financial incentives. The second to last paragraph,
incorrectly talks about the failures of subsidies. Yes, all of the problems discussed can happen
with renewable energy incentives, but our experience has shown that subsidies can be effective


                                                 140

in spurring RE development without being indiscriminate and open to abuse. The U.S.
production tax credit-in         combination with other market policies-has                     accelerated the
installation of thousandsof megawattsof wind energy.

In addition, when combined with a mandated market, such as the RPS, one can calculate the
costs of the subsidy with a fair degree of accuracy. In addition, one can calculate the benefits in
terms of jobs created and costs of renewable electricity reduced (not just through subsidies, but
through economies of scale encouraged by the subsidy).l4Ibelieve that intelligently designed
incentives are important in bringing projects to fruition, particularly incentives related to the
previous point above-the       development of a local REmanufacturingbase.

Was the potential market determined on the basis of renewable energy technology data and
databases?Yes, a good analysis of the economic potential under different time frames and cost
assumptions was performed and contrasted with the resource potential that i s much higher. A
range of policy targets was also tested againstthe base case and various policy scenarios.

Has an evaluation of the demand-side mechanisms to support after-sales service been
undertaken?I'm not sure what this means, but my comment would be that CRESP aims to create
the demand for renewable energy, so right now, there i s not very much after-sales service to
evaluate.

An exception is the solar hot water industry, a well-developed technology in China. In 1990-
 1998, the total heat collection area used for solar water heaters increased by ten times. Today,
about 1,000 enterprises are engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing and
installation of solar water heaters. The industry, with an annual growth rate of 20-30 percent, i s
also exporting to Southeast Asia and Europe. In terms of after-sales service, this i s a major
problem. Many of the manufacturers pay little attention to after-sales service and have no system
to service consumer problems. For example, the U.S. had 40 solar water heater manufacturers
and 116 technical service firms in 1997. That 1:3 ratio i s completely reversed in China and
approaches 4: 1. Consumers are rightfully concerned that there will be no place to turn if they
have trouble with their systems. Many Chinese companies are small businesses with loose
distributionnetworks andfew quality guarantees.

To expand the market, the industry needs to provide more technical support, perhaps through an
expansion of their service business network. And this is with a mature, commercial technology.
With CRESP overall, this is an issue that the Bank will have to address and gets to the point
 above about creating a market infrastructure. Even if the policy signals are there-through                        an
M M S , for example-the      Bank will needto develop the market infrastructure.

Adequacy of the introducedfinancial incentives? The Bank's work on policy reform (MMS) is
 the most important component. Financing incentives, however, must follow. Isuggest the Bank
 consider using its loadgrant money to guarantee a loan from a local financial institution to help


 l4 Inaddition, the Bank must not forget any of its fossil fuel projects inChina are subject to subsidization, inthis
    case from the GoC. Although a coal plant might be built on a market basis-with     sales of its electricity sold at
    market levels-the fuel for that plant comes from state-owned and highly subsidized mines, thus artificially
    lowering the costs of coal generation. Ifthese subsidies were taken into account, the price of renewable energy
    might look much more attractive.


                                                       141

catalyze financing. This might be a good use of World Bank resources to catalyze involvement
of the Chinese financial sector in renewable energy. Aid has a similar guarantee program in
easternEurope and it has helpedget energy efficiency projects off the ground there.

In addition, as mentioned earlier, the Bank should be looking at renewable energy industry
development in China. This couldtake the form of financial incentives for domestidjoint venture
firms to buildmanufacturing facilities for renewable energy generating equipment (for example,
tax holidays and low-interest loans)

Comments on the design of demonstration project? Istrongly support the pilot approach
although a good deal of thinking will be needed in the selection process. The APL approach i s
important to help ensure strong Chineseparticipation at all levels.

On pages 11-12, the Bank outlines its plans for Phase 1 of CRESP-selecting                         three pilot
provinces and developing the legal and institutional capacity to implement a provincewide
MMS. What appears to be missing and what Ibelieve to be critically important i s renewable
energy credit trading. The Bank correctly points out that credit trading i s a way to lower the cost
of an M M S and provide additional flexibility to support renewable energy where the resources
are strongest. However, experience in the U.S. has shown that there are many technical and legal
issues surrounding credit trading, and we believe the Bank will need to work on this issue from
the very start.15

On page 34, in the key indicators section, the Bank mentions a renewable certificate database
developed and a system for issuing credits tested. This is critically important, and Isuggest
carrying out some "mock" trades in the pilot province just to get the M M S administrators ready
for this task. Of course, this will depend on the Bank's 1) selecting and training the RPS or
trading program administrator on the provincial level and 2) developing the software to record
and monitor trades and similar transactions. Modifying existing software from the Dutch or
Texas programs might be the best way to proceed. Finally, the Bank should consider trying as
quickly as possible to develop credit trading outside the province, so the company/utility facing
the M M S burden can, if it i s cost-effective, finance the construction of renewable energy
facilities in other regions of the country (particularly the Western regions). This might be tried in
Phase 1.

As the pilot program expands to 10 provinces and then beyond, it will be critical to sort out the
conflicting roles of various state agencies, specifically SDPC, SETC and MOST. Although the
Bank i s working on setting up Phase 1, it also needs to sort out these longer-term issues that
mightnot get resolved untilPhases 2-3. What the Bank should be striving for is an independent,
professional regulatory authority with responsibility over the important aspects of the power


    Iincludedthisinourlastcomments,butwillreiteratehereincasethereisadifferentaudience.Wewouldmake
    as clear as possible the criteria for selecting the pilot provinces. Maybe start with a matrix to score each
    potential pilot site with desired criteria. The Bank might want think ahead of time what kinds of specific
    commitment they might seek to help ensure success in the pilots. If only two provinces seem really interested,
    maybe drop the third and focus on the first two. The criteria include the level of environmental pollution,
    relative wealth, renewable resources, level of free market orientation (makes REC trading easier), and most
    importantly-demonstrable    commitment from provincial planning commissions, people's congresses, local
    mayors.This could come inthe formof a letter, promise of in-kindcontributions, or the like.

sector, including the administration of the M M S policies. However, Idon't believe this should be
left to Phases 2-3; it should be going on concurrently with Phase 1, given the length of time it
may be required to clarify who will have authority over the energy sector.

A second, related comment is that the CRESP program should work completely in tandem with
the Bank's broader power sector reform efforts in China. It seems to me (although Iam on the
outside) that CRESP and the Bank's power sector reform team are working somewhat
independently of each other. Experience in the U.S. and elsewhere shows that 1) M M S policies
come within the context of broader utility restructuring and 2) that political opposition to M M S
policies tend to be reduced when utilities feel they are getting more of what they want duringthe
broader reformprocess.

This is important because Idon't believe the power sector reform team is taking into account
environmental or public benefit programs at all. The team i s working very closely with SPC and
its supporters in the government. If the power sector reform team and CRESP could have a
unified message that within the context of utility restructuring, the GoC needs to take into
account issues other issuesI6 that would be very helpful to both Bank initiatives. This i s
particularly important because the M M S policy-the          cornerstone of the CRESP approach-is
fundamentally a political process that can be stopped if more powerful forces in SPC (in
particular) and the GoC (ingeneral) believe it i s counter to their interests.

Will a process be put in place to monitor the project? Isuggest that the Bank rely on outside
experts that are already working in China, such as the Energy Foundation, CRS, UNDP and
Chinese institutions, such as Tsinghua University, to help refine and improve the program. This
might take the form of a working group that meets once or twice a year in China to review the
status of the program.

Identificationof global environmental benefits
Given the pivotal role of China inGHGemissions and the projections for China's GHGemission
trajectory in the future, a program that could significantly impact the direction and magnitude of
these emissions in the China's power sector i s critically important. The global environmental
benefit of this project-299     million tons-is   a 63 percent increase from the baseline. In addition,
 if the project is a technical and economic success and contributes to the longer term cost
reduction of renewable generating plants so that they are cost competitive, could result in
 significant replicationin other regions of the world.

 How the projectfits within the context of the goals of the GEF
 This project has a good fit with the GEFOperational Program#6.

 Regional Context
 This project also has an excellent fit within the regional context.

 Replicability of the project
 To the extent that this program i s successful, it has tremendously positive replication potential
 throughout the world. The policy framework and approach being tested here i s applicable

 l6  These issues being reducing costs as much as possible and designing as market-oriented a power sector as
     possible.

anywhere in the world. Since China i s an emerging economy, it can serve as a role model for
both developed and developing countries. Though the form of China's government i s very
different from many other countries, the program can be easily tailored to other political systems.

Sustainability of the project
As stated in the project description, "if the financial market price of conventional electricity is
still below the financial price of renewable electricity at the end of the program, the M M S target
would still be in place, encouraging further renewable electricity growth. Therefore,
sustainability i s ensured. At the point where renewable electricity i s financially competitive, the
M M S tool is no longer required and renewable electricity growth would be sustained by market
forces.''

The greatest threat to the success of the project i s a failure in electricity sector reform that
undermines the ability to implementthe policies recommended.

Other Issues
Page 9, The last line in the last paragraph i s an overstatement. Moreover, there i s not a real
distinction between mandated markets and mandated market share. Iwould delete the mandated
markets discussion inthat both the NFFO and PURPA could fall under this heading as described
though they are discussedinthe next section.

Page 10: It i s important to point out that the difference between a feed-in law and an RPS i s that
with the former, one will know the price of renewable electricity-but         not how much will be
produced. With an RPS, one will know how much will be produced, but not what the price will
be. The RPS i s infavor today because more than the feed-in law, it aims to stimulate competition
and minimize cost. Experience has shown, however, that feed-in laws have done a better job of
creating local manufacturing and development infrastructure. In the end, the Bank will need to
help China develop an M M S policy that works in the Chinese context. That might mean some
combination of M M S policies from Europe and the U.S. (see Table 1 a further comparison
between feed-in laws and RPS policies-an        expanded version of this analysis i s available from
CRS).

Secondary Issues

Linkages to other focal areas
Nocomment.

Linkages to other programs
This project potentiallyhas linkages to projects throughout the world. The comprehensive nature        ,
of the approach, ifsuccessful, could form a model for both emerging economies and developing
countries throughout the region.

 Other beneficial or damaging environmental effects
 All of the major environmental effects have been noted in the STAP document. However, the
beneficial effects of the project related to NO,, SO,, particulates and mercury have not yet been
 quantified. When they are, Ibelieve these will be very significant for China. The SO, benefits
 will be significant for the whole region, whereas the other air pollution benefits will be local with
 their significance depending upon the locationof the generation they displace.

 Degree of involvement of stakeholdersinthe project
 It appears that this has been significant involvement of stakeholders in the project, though
 participation alone i s not enough. The project will benefit when it can be less dogmatic and more
 supportive of input and program design evolution by the stakeholders who are involved. It will
 be virtually impossible for outsiders, including officials from Beijing, to really understand the
 local dynamic that i s critical to program implementation andultimately to the program's success.

 Capacity buildingaspects
 The central focus of this project i s on capacity building.

Innovativeness of the project
The focus on capacity building and a comprehensive policy framework make this program
innovative within the Bank itself. If successful, it should set a new and beneficial standard for
programdesign.

Conclusions
This program proposal is well thought out. Successful execution will be challenging though the
potential rewards make it well worth the effort.

                        SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SOUNDNESS
 Iwould recommend, however, that theBank look at one of the main barriers that is
 not addressed-development of a local industry, both equipment manufacturers and
 project developers (resource assessors, business plan developers,financial experts,
 etc.)....A separate but related component of this can be to pre-select a group of
 interested and willingfinancial institutions that can receive training onfinancing for
 renewable energy projects.
 CRESP aims to create a market, the most important element needed to foster an          Section B4
 industry.When CRESP succeeds increatinga market, these investments will follow.
 Two CRESP components would also help the development of an industry to serve
 this market. One, Technology Cost Reduction and Quality Improvement, is targeted
 mainly at assisting local equipment manufacturers to improve the quality and reduce
 the cost of their products, through cost-sharing early technology development
 investments. Principal beneficiaries will be manufacturers, equipment suppliers, and
 standards, testing and certification institutes. The other component, Development of
 Market Infrastructure, is designed to help the "software" (service industry) develop.
 It will support the development of enterprises so that they can offer the full range of
 services from resource assessment, through design, engineering, construction,
 commissioning,       acceptance, to operations,      maintenance, rehabilitation and
 decommissioning. This component i s also targeted at the financial services sector, in
 particular the commercial banks, and would offer financing to undertake studies,
 product development and TA for: risk management instruments, (for example
 guarantees and insurance); project financing structures; contract arrangements;
 project bundling; fund formation; and evaluating and appraising renewable energy
 investments. Assistance would be provided to build up the network of supporting
  information, including a public resource database, consulting skills and access to
  financing that local and international PPs must have to develop projects efficiently
  The Program Brief has been amended to bring out the role of these components in
  supportingthe development of a local industry.

  The section that discusses the barriers tofirther renewable energy development in
  China-although      a good summary-is        missing one barrier that is reflected
  throughout the entire document-the        lack of any renewable energy industry in
  China-either domesticmanufacturing orjoint-ventures withforeign companies.

  We-and      those Chinese experts who participated in the November 1999-believe
  that the barriers listed underlie the lack of the renewable energy industry. The main  SectionB3.1
  barrier i s the lack of policies to create a market and pay the incremental costs. As  SectionB4
  shown by the small hydropower industry inChina, if the market exists, the industry
l will grow. The small hydro industry in China i s well developed, with more than
  20GW of small hydro installed, mostly based on locally designed and implemented
  projects using locally manufactured equipment. The wind industry i s less advanced,

technologies, including those relating to landfill gas, are less well developed. In
parallel with market creation through the MMS policy, the Technology Cost
Reduction and Quality Improvement and Development of Market Infrastructure
Components would encourage new entrants as well as improve the capacity of the
existing industry.

Power purchase agreementsarepoorly developedand not enforced, but again, if this
changed overnight, the lack of ZPPs in the market would still constrain the
development of the projects. In this sense, the Bank has a role in catalyzing the
entrance of IPPs in the market-a role not clearly spelled out in the ... report.

The Policy Development and Market Infrastructure Components will explicitly
address the issues of how to ensure that the market created by the M M S i s open to    iection B4 (discussion

If the Bank encouragedthe GoCto adopt investment incentives,such as tax holidays
and concessional loans on manufacturing equipment (combined with a strong effort
to ensure this equipmentmeets international standards).  ..local  equipment will lower
the cost of the technologies, other financial incentives will lower the cost of the
electricity generation itsev In addition to the VAT on equipment being reduced to 6
percent (as it is for small hydro), a modest effort could help ensure that the custom
duties of importing parts of a wind turbine are made less than the duties on an entire
turbines (as it the case now).

The GoC and some provincial govemments have adopted a number of investment
incentives and are contemplating others, in parallel with the introduction of a         Section A1
Mandated Market Share (MMS). Examples of existing or planned incentives for             SectionB4 (discussion

ensure that the combined package of financial incentives, price to be paid by the
utility, and contracting terms are attractive to investors. Financial incentives are an
integral part of CRESP and ensuring that they are harmonized with the M M S i s an
important part of the Program. The Brief has been amended to bring this out more
clearly

Section B3.2 Strategic Choices: This section...incorrectly talks about thefailures q
subsidies...our experience has shown that subsidies can be eflective in spurring RL
development without being indiscriminate, open to abuse, etc. The U.S. productior
 tax credit-in     combination with other market policies-has          accelerated tht
 installation of thousands of megawatts of wind energy...I believe that intelligently
designed incentives are important in bringing projects to fruition, particularlj
 incentives related to the previous point above-the       development of a local RL
 manufacturing base

 The section makes the point that subsidies have drawbacks. The main point of tht
 discussion on financial incentives, however, i s the conclusion that on their own the!
 have not tended to be successful in developing the market for renewables. Thc          Section B3.2

 section goes on to 'make the case that incentives combined with an M M S appear to bc
 the most successful approach. The Brief has been amended to express more clearly tc

the intention of the CRESP, to use the M M S policy together with a package of
financial incentives to create an attractive environment for investors.

Section B3.2 Strategic Choices: The last line in the last paragraph [of page 91 is an
overstatement...Moreover, there is not a real distinction between mandated markets
and mandated market share. I would delete the mandated markets discussion in that
both the NFFO and PURPA couldfall under this heading as described though they
are discussed in the next section.

Section B3.2 Strategic Choices: It is important to point out that the difference
between afeed in law and an RPS is that with theformer, one will know the price of
renewable electricity-but    not how much will be produced. With an RPS, one will
know how much will beproduced, but not what theprice will be. TheRPS is infavor
today because more than the feed-in law, it aims to stimulate competition and
minimize cost. Experience has shown, however, thatfeed-in laws have done a better
job of creating local manufacturing and development infrastructure. In the end, the
Bank will need to help China develop an MMS policy that works in the Chinese
context.

The Program Brief has been amended to take the first comment into account, and to
bring out more clearly the ideas expressed in the second comment, which the task      Section B3.2
team shares and intends to realize.

CRESP aims to create the demandfor renewable energy, so right now, there is not
very much afer-sales service to evaluate       ...Anexception is the solar hot water
industry, a well-developed technology in China..     .With  CRESP overall, this is an
issue that the Bank will have to address and gets to thepoint above about creating a
market infrastructure. Even if the policy signals are there-through an MMS,for
example-the Bank will need to developthe market infrastructure.

The Task Team made an early strategic decision to exclude heat-producing
renewables applications from the Program.                                             SectionD1


Note the comments above about the Market Infrastructure Component, which i s          Section B4
aimed directly at creating the neededmarket infrastructure.

Onpages 11-12, the Bank outlines its plansfor Phase I of CRESP-selecting three
pilot provinces and developing the legal and institutional capacity to implement a
province-wide MMS. What appears to be missing and what I believe to be critically
important is renewable energy credit trading. The Bank correctly points out thal
credit trading is a way to lower the cost of an MMS andprovide additionalflexibility
to support renewable energy where the resources are strongest...Isuggest carrying
out some "mock" trades in the pilot province just to get the MMS administrators
readyfor this task.

Renewable energy credit trading i s only applicable to one generic type of MMS,        SectionB 4
namely the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Other approaches use different
means of ensuring the M M S i s met at least cost and so puttingin place and testing a
trading mechanism may not be appropriate. The current plan, subject to confinnation
of feasibility at appraisal and early implementation, i s to introduce an RPS-type

LlMS with certificate trading. Issuing of certificates for verification, and possibly
rading, and trading itself are included as activities in the provincial pilots during
Phase 1. The Program Brief has been amended to reflect the comment and to bring
Dut more clearly the intentionas expressedinthis response.

It will be critical to sort out the conjlicting roles of various state agencies,
vpec@cally SDPC, SETC and MOST. Although the Bank is working on setting up
Phase 1, it also needs to sort out these longer-term issues that might not get resolved
until Phases 2-3.     What the Bank should be striving for is an independent,
vrofessional regulatory authority with responsibility over the key aspects of the
vower sector, including the administration of the MMS policies...A second, related
romment is that the CRESP program should work completely in tandem with the
Bank's broader power-sector reform efforts in China. It seems to me (although I am
vn the outside) that CRESP and the Bank's power sector reform team are working
yomewhat independentlyof eachother.

Fragmentation of responsibilities i s recognized as an issue. Program oversight and
policy guidance i s furnished by a steering committee co-chaired by the MOF and         Section B3.1 (Lack of
State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) with members representing State            Policies)

committee. The PMO, will be responsible to this committee for the implementation
of the project, and will work closely with a smaller working group of key officials
from different agencies on policy development.

During Phase 1, the institutional arrangements for implementation of the M M S
policy at national and provincial level will be outlined. The GoC strategy i s to set upSection B2 (GoC
formal power sector regulatory mechanisms at the Central and Provincial level. It       Strategy)
may be necessary initially to designate an independent regulatory body for the M M S    Section C2
and certification, ifrestructuringi s slow.

The task team agrees on the close relationship of the MMS to power sector reform,
and the need for collaboration with power sector reform. The PMO has already
begun to work with the Working Party on the Electricity Law of the Legislative
Committee of the National People's Congress. It i s likely that the vehicle for the
M M S will be through revision of the Electricity Law, which will also introduce the
broader power sector reform.

SDPC i s responsible for power sector reformand the CRESP (together with MOF, in
the case of CRESP). Within the Bank, the Task Team Leader for CRESP is also
involved inpower sector reform activities and the Task Team Leaders for the major
reform activities are also team members for CRESP. The Program Brief will be
amended to stress the close connection.

I suggest that the Bank rely on outside experts that are already working in China,
such as the Energy Foundation, CRS, UNDP and Chinese institutions, such as
Tsinghua University, to help refine and improve the program. This might take the
form of a working group that meets once or twice a year in China to review the
status of theprogram.

The CRESP will make every effort to involve outside experts in preparation and

implementation of the CRESP, both through direct participation and parallel Section C4
activities. Also, in addition to the steering committee, there i s a regular meeting of
donors, including the Bank, ADB, UNDP, bilaterals, and others every six months,
