Summary of the Project 
1.1 Geographic location 
Huitengxile wind farm is located in Huitengxile grassland, which is in the 
north border of Baiyinchanghan town and Hardatusumu, Zhuozishan county 
and in the south of Desheng town, chayouzhongqi, Wulanchabu city of Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region,
 People’s Republic of China. The  height above 
sea level of the wind farm varies from 2,000m to 2,131m and its central 
coordination is between the north latitude of 41°05’ and the east longitude of 
112°41’ . The wind farm is 120km west to Huhhot, the capital city of Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region and 60km east to Jining, where the municipal 
government of Wulanchabu city is located. 
Huitengxile wind farm is in Huitengliang area, which is in the east part of 
Daqingshan Mountains. It belongs to continental monsoon climate. The main 
weather affection of this area is the cyclone from the bend of the Yellow River 
and the cold high pressure from Siberia and Mongolia Plateau. Affected by the 
strong cold pressure, this area becomes the main path when the cold air flows 
down from north to south. The natural characteristics of this area such as the 
high altitude, open terrain, low vegetation, fewer buildings, and the affection 
when air flows through the raised tableland from north to south, etc., make it 
possible that the wind energy resource is very rich here, it is one of the richest 
wind energy resource areas in China. 
1.2 Brief introduction of the project 
Huitengxile wind farm with total planned capacity of 200MW was primarily 
built in 1996. By the end of 2003, the total installed capacity in this wind farm 
is 42.7 MW, among which 5.4MW(9 sets with 600kW each) wind turbines are 
financially supported by Danish government; 19.8MW(33 sets with 600kW 
each) wind turbines are under the project of “double Promotion” sponsored by 
Chinese government; 5.4MW(9 sets with 600kW each) wind turbines are under 
the financial assistant by Dutch government, 5.5MW(10 sets with 550 kW 
each) wind turbines are supported by the US import & export Bank loan, 
5.4MW(9 sets with 600kW each) wind turbines are supported by Germany 
government; and 2 test sets with 600kW each erected by Micon A/S and 
Page  5
2
Beijing Wandian Company. At present, there is one substation (110kV, 
Caoduoshan substation) in the wind farm, with the capacity of 
76
MVA(1×16+1×20+1×40), and the voltage is 110/35/10kV. The generation 
of the wind turbines feed in the west main electricity network of Inner 
Mongolia by the 110kV transmission line to the 110kV bus of Gaoshun 220kV 
Substation.  
This project is a technical reformation project as well as the 
commercialization promotion project of China renewable energy program 
supported by GEF and the World Bank. The scale of this phase is 100MW 
(with the wind turbines of 750kW-1500kW each). Referring to the existing 
experiences of designing and building, the row space is 7 D and the column is 5 
D, meanwhile, an auxiliary transmission line to Desheng 220kV substation and 
one 110kV substation (2×630MVA) will be built. 
1.3 Features of the region 
1.3.1 The terrain  
 Huitengxile wind farm region is tableland grassland with an area of about 
300km
2
.
The occupied area of Huitengxile wind farm is about 100km
2
.
The 
terrain of the wind farm is flat with few buildings and low vegetation, and it 
has more than ten lakes with different sizes. The altitude varies from 2,000m to 
2,130m. 
Most part of the wind farm is meadow, grazing or open land with few trees. 
The geological structure of the wind farm belongs to intermountain lava 
tableland with no structure affection, it has fine stability and no rift passes 
through. 
Location of this project is in the southeast of the existing wind farm, which is 
along with the ke-zhuo road at the site of 18.5km-21.5km. The total size of this 
phase will be 22km
2
of flat and open land with no buildings. 
Huitengliang area is typical mountainous grassland. The soil is chernozem; 
the vegetation are mainly gamineous grass with little linear-leaf 
chrysanthemum, garden burnet, artemisia, wind-weed and Chinese thorowax 
etc.; the birds are mainly rock partridge, quail, partridge with spotted wings, 
turtledove, lark and tree sparrow.  
1.3.2 Wind energy resources 
Page  6
3
Huitengxile region belongs to temperate zone continental monsoon climate; 
the main affecting systems of climate in this area are cyclone from the bend of 
the Yellow River and the cold high pressure from Siberia and Mongolia 
Plateau. The cyclone from the bend of the Yellow River mainly affects the 
precipitation of the middle and west Inner Mongolia, the precipitation in this 
region generally concentrates in summer, little rain and large variability are the 
main features. The most serious influence to the area is the high cold pressure 
from Mongolia plateau, especially in December and January. It has long cold 
winter and short cool summer, and the wind speed is high in winter and spring, 
the mean annual wind speed at the height of 10 meters is 7.2m/s, about 70~80 
days the instantaneous wind speed is more than 17m/s. 
Controlled by the strong Mongolia cold high pressure, Huitengxile area has 
become the main path for the cold air. The altitude of the site is relatively high, 
so it has increasing effect as the air stream passes through this area from north 
down to the south. Furthermore, the area is open and flat with low vegetation 
and few buildings and trees and small frictional resistance, it is windy all the 
year round, especially higher in winter and spring, so the wind energy resource 
is very rich. 
(1) Measurement method 
In order to develop and utilize wind energy resource, the former Inner 
Mongolia Electricity Company had erected 10 measuring towers (40m high) in 
the middle area of 100km
2
in December 1993 and had performed measurement 
from March 1994 to February 1995. After that, the work was suspended due to 
some reasons. In October 1997, Inner Mongolia Longyuan Wind Energy 
Developing Cooperation restarted the measuring work in Huitengxile wind 
farm. 4 measurement towers (40m high) were erected and 8 sets of EL 
anemometers were installed. In addition, a basic meteorological station was 
built. Since then, the measuring work has been performed continuously for 6 
years. 
Based on the analysis of wind data collected from anemometers, the average 
wind speed at the height of 40m is 8.4 m/s in the past 6 years, and the average 
wind power density is 500W/m
2
.
The yearly average wind speed is steady and 
the variation range is 8.0~8.9m/s, but the average wind speed in every month of 
one year varies, the wind speed in January, February and March is relatively 
Page  7
4
high, and the variation range is 9.9~11.3m/s; the wind speed during June to 
September is relatively low and the variation range is 5.9~6.6m/s. 
(2) Distribution of wind speed and wind energy  
The 40m high distribution statistics of wind speed and wind energy frequency 
of the wind farm show that the wind speed multi-values appear at the range of 
4~10m/s, accounting for about 71% of annual wind speed distribution; the 
wind energy multi-values appear at the range of 10~16m/s , accounting for 
69% of total wind energy distribution. 
The 10m high distribution statistics of wind speed and wind energy frequency 
show that the wind speed multi-values appear at the range of 4~8m/s, 
accounting for about 71% of the annual wind speed; the wind energy frequency 
multi-values appear at the range of 8~12m/s, accounting for 64% of total wind 
energy distribution. 
(3) Wind energy direction 
From the statistics and analysis of the wind energy frequency data measured 
by the 40m high anemometers during 1998~2003 , the wind energy is mainly 
concentrated at 225~335
°. According to the statistics of a typical year (2001), 
the wind energy concentrated at 225~335°accounts for 70% of the total wind 
energy. 
The statistics and analysis of wind direction and wind energy frequency at the 
height of 10m in 2001 show that the wind energy is mainly concentrated at 
225°
 335°
,
accounting for 72% of the total wind energy and it is almost 
identical with the wind energy frequency distribution at 40m high.  
From the above analysis we can see that the wind direction of the area is stable 
and the wind energy is concentrative. 
1.3.3 Transportation 
Huitengxile wind-farm is 120km east to Huhhot, the capital city of Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region, 60km west to Jining, and 36km south to 
Zhuozishan railway station. The Ke -Zhuo road goes through the middle part of 
the wind farm and connects to the110 national highway in the south. So the 
large wind turbines can be directly transported to the wind farm. 
The ground of the wind farm is flat, and the existing natural road can be used 
for transportation during the installation period and the maintenance work after 
Page  8
5
the wind turbines put into operation. Equipments can be directly transported to 
their locations without second transportation or manual carrying. 
1.4 Social and economic situation 
1.4.1 Social and economic situation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region 
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is located in the north border of the 
People’s Republic of China. It is long and narrow from the northeast to 
southwest. The terrain is mainly plateau so it is normally called Inner Mongolia 
plateau. The area of the region is 1.18 million km
2
with the population of about 
20 million, as it is an autonomous region with multi-nationalities, Mongolia 
nationality is the main part. 
Inner Mongolia has a vast territory and rich resources, and it is commonly 
known as “Forest in the east and iron in the west, agriculture in the south and 
animal husbandry in the north, coal are everywhere”. The total grassland in the 
region reaches 0.88 million km
2
and it is an important animal husbandry base 
in China. Hetao and Tumochuan plains are famous grain producing bases in 
China. The industry enterprises in Inner Mongolia are mainly engaged in iron 
steel, coal, electric power, metallurgy, textile, chemistry, leather and brewery 
etc. By the end of 2002, the GDP of the region reached 173.248 billion yuan 
RMB, compared with the last year, 12.1% was increased; the grain production 
reached 1.41million tons and 13.5% was increased compared with the last year; 
the raw coal production reached 114.9763 million tons and 40% was increased 
compared with the last year; the electricity power generation reached 54.726 
billion kWh and 17.6% was increased compared with the last year. 
1.4.2 Social and economic situation of Wulanchabu city  
Wulanchabu city is located in the middle of Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region with an area of 84000km
2
.
The total population is 3.16 million, 
including more than 20 nationalities. 
Wulanchabu city belongs to northern dry land crops area, the total cultivated 
area is 13400 km
2
.
Crops here are mainly wheat, naked oats and potato. The 
grass resources for animal husbandry in the area are relatively rich. It is a 
famous natural pastureland in Inner Mongolia and the total area of the 
Page  9
6
grassland is 58000 km
2
.
It is also an important meat production base in Inner 
Mongolia. 
Industrial enterprises in Wulanchabu city have expended to a certain scale. 
Enterprises of electricity, metallurgy, machinery, coal, construction materials, 
fertilizer, fresh processing, sugaring and brewing have already been founded, 
and mineral resources are also rich, more than 70 minerals have been 
discovered and 25 minerals have been utilized by now. 
Referring to the transportation, the railway from Beijing to Baotou city goes 
through the middle part of the area; the Ji-Er railroad is start from Jining, the 
location of the administrative offices of Wulanchabu city, to Erlianhot, an 
important land port city in north China and connects to the railway of Republic 
of Mongolia; in addition, Ji-Tong railroad is associated with five more railroads 
in Tongliao. The road network has been formed, which is centered in Jining, 
and the 110 national road is the main vehicular truck line, reaching various 
counties and towns attached to Wulanchabu city and the adjoin areas. 
1.4.3 Social and economic situation of Huitengxile wind farm area 
The wind farm is located in the middle of Chayouzhongqi, with an area of 300 
km
2
.
Chayouzhongqi belongs to half agriculture and half animal husbandry 
area. The main corps is wheat and potatoes, and the total corps production in 
2000 was about 154 million kg. Animal husbandry is mainly sheep, horses and 
cattle. The total amount of livestock on hand in 2000 was 708 thousand. The 
average income in this area in 2000 was 3,385 yuan and 1,828 yuan was the net 
income of farmers and herdsmen. 
1.5 Land used 
The 100 MW technical reformation phase in Huitengxile wind farm will be 
carried out on the grassland of Huitengliang farm, neither the land of other 
villages nor the farmland will be occupied. 
Huitengliang farm was founded in 1953. It is a state-owned stud and the land 
is also state-owned. Its function is mainly keeping stud horses and breeding and 
developing Inner Mongolia fine-wool sheep. The total area of the farm is 
4800hm
2
,
and the area of grassland is 4300hm
2
,
among which the high quality 
meadow is more than 670hm
2
,
the forage grass land is 170hm
2
,
the area of 
covered pen is 6,615 m
2
,
the area of living quarters for staff and workers is 
Page  10
7
3,554 m
2
and the area of other infrastructure is 3,911 m
2
.
There are 332 
employees in the farm, including 120 workers, 5 administrative management 
personnel, 6 studhorse feeding and managing stuffs, 6 technical staffs, 74 fine-
wool sheep feeding and managing stuffs, 30 teachers and service stuffs and 16 
retired persons. The current management mode is that the farm contract 
studhorses, fine-wool sheep and fodder land to staffs, but excluding the 
meadow, the meadow is used by all. There are also infrastructures in the farm 
such as administrative office, livestock veterinary station, guesthouse, canteen, 
living quarters, covered pen, ammonia ion stove and grass storage yard. Based 
on the animal husbandry production, the annual total income is about 0.6 
million yuan and the average income per capita is more than 3,000 yuan. 
Currently, the meadow area in Huitengliang farm is about 4300hm
2
,
the 
permanent occupied land of this project is about 23.65hm
2
,
accounting for 
0.55% of the meadow area. Very small impact on animal husbandry production 
will be produced. At the construction time, some temporary land will be 
occupied for one or two years, plus the recovering time, 3 years will be enough, 
and the land will be returned to Huitengliang farm after construction. 
Moreover, during construction period, the region and meadow will be occupied 
as planned strictly, so it will have few impacts on the production and living 
conditions of local villagers.

Summary of Environmental Impact
2.1 Ecology status 
The Huitengxile wind farm is located on Huitengliang ridge in the middle part 
of Wulanchabu city, Inner Mongolia. This area is typical mountainous meadow 
grassland, the soil is chernozem, the vegetation is mainly graminence pasture 
with less chrysonthemum, artemisia, rhizoma anemarrheae and radix bupleuri 
etc. and there are some kinds of bird like rock partridge, quail, partridge, 
turtledove, lark and tree sparrow etc. 
2.1.1 Potential impact on birds during construction period 
Construction period mainly refers to the time of foundations construction, 
wind turbines installation, meteorological observation tower setting up, roads 
repairing inside the wind-farm and other facilities. The typical potential 
Page  11
8
impacts that will disturb the original living environment of birds should be the 
noise, dust and transportation vehicles etc., and the birds inside the wind-farm 
will not be able to seek food, build their nest and breed here. Since the 
construction period is short, comparing with the whole area, the occupied land 
is small. In addition, the birds have the ability to avoid danger and they can 
migrate to other places where the conditions is the same, therefore, the 
construction will neither produce serious impact nor cause the reduction of 
birds. 
2.1.2 Potential impact on migratory birds 
According to the collected bird ring-mark information, Huitengxile wind-farm 
area is neither the main habitat for migrant nor the main path passed by migrant 
birds, so the construction of the wind-farm has almost no impact on migrant 
birds. From available information, the flying height of most birds is around 300 
meters, but the hub height of the chosen wind turbine in this phase will be no 
more than 100 meters. The average flying height for migrant birds is much 
higher than 100 meters, so it is impossible for migratory birds to collide wind 
turbine when they fly through this area. For this reason, there is no impact on 
migratory birds after the wind turbines put into operation. 
2.1.3 Potential impact on 
Birds’ colliding with wind turbines 
Flying birds within the wind farm may collide with the blades of wind 
turbines, electric transmission line and meteorological measuring towers. Some 
big size or heavy birds, water birds, some birds of prey catching other birds and 
the birds flying in low level in night are apt to collide with wind turbines. The 
birds’ data of Huitengliang area show that most birds mentioned above are not 
seen often, so the chance for birds colliding with wind turbines is few, which 
means that the wind turbines will have little impact on these birds. Other 
common birds are small in size and fly agilely. In addition, wind turbines are so 
obvious that the birds can see it clearly and avoid it.  It has little chance for 
these birds to collide with the wind turbines. Therefore, the construction of the 
wind farm will have little impact on birds in the area. So far there haven’t been 
any studies on the impact of the existing wind farm on the birds.  According to 
a
ten-year investigation on this wind farm, there hasn’t been any crash 
accidents occurred.     
Page  12
9
2.2 Impact on natural landscape 
In this project, some wind turbines (from 750kW to1500 kW each) will be 
erected in the southeast side of the existing wind-farm. The local residents 
believe that so many wind turbines standing upright on the grassland will not 
destroy the local natural landscape. However, it will form beautiful and 
attractive scenery. In the vast grassland, a lot of white wind turbines stand in 
order and rotate in the blue sky, the white cloud and green grassland. In fact, 
since the primary construction was completed, the tourism site had been built 
by the relevant department. The local tourism resource is developed and 
considerable tourism revenue is gained. As the expanding of the wind farm, the 
number of wind turbines will grow and the scenery will be surely more 
beautiful. For this reason, this phase of Huitengxile wind farm will have no 
impact on the local scenery; on the contrary, it will raise the local scenery value 
and increase tourism revenue. 
2.3 Potential impact on electromagnetic radiation  
2.3.1 Impact on electromagnetic radiation to the health of local 
residents 
A
special study shows that when electromagnetic radiation with or beyond the 
intensity of 4kv/m acts on a healthy people for a long time, he will be damaged. 
Electromagnetic radiation with certain energy will be produced during 
operation of the wind farm, but its intensity is relatively low. Although there 
hasn
’t been a practical value for relatively low intensity electromagnetic 
radiation, it is can be deduced from the available test data of 220kv.  The 
maximum intensity of 110kv/m is 0.287kv/m, which occupies 7.2 percent of 
the standard intensity 4kv/m. In addition, the wind farm is far from residential 
area, so it is believed that the electromagnetic radiation produced by 
Huitengxile wind farm will not create hazard to the health of residents nearby. 
2.3.2 Disturbance of electromagnetic radiation to radio and television 
We learnt from the investigation of residents who live near the wind farm that 
the wind farm operation currently has no influence on local radio and television 
etc; therefore, it is believed that this phase will not produce disturbance to local 
radio and television. 
Page  13
10
2.4 Impact on Noise  
2.4.1 Noise impact on the surrounding environment 
Since the specialty that the wind farm must be built in the place with rich 
wind energy resource and wind turbines must operate in some higher wind 
speed, the noise of the site is relatively large. When wind speed is high, the 
natural noise covers up the noise of wind turbines, and the noise impact 
produced by wind turbines on the surrounding environment is far less than the 
noise produced by natural wind; when wind speed is relatively low, noise 
produced by the wind turbines will attenuate rapidly. According to practical 
measuring results in Zhangbei wind farm, the environment noise in the place of 
250m far from wind turbines is 39.5 dB (A) which is lower than the limit of 
class one urban environment noise standard (55 dB (A) in daytime and 45 dB 
(A) in the night). Therefore, the operation of wind turbines almost cannot 
produce noise impact on surrounding environment.
 
This may be true for one 
unit, or maybe for all of the units currently in place. However, the proposed 
phase will have 750kW to 1500kW wind turbines which are larger than the 
existing wind turbines (72 sets and the largest is 600kW). So it is not 
immediately obvious that noise will not be a problem. Since the 1500kW wind 
turbines haven
’t been put into operation, it is not available to predict and 
analogize the results.   
2.4.2 Noise impact on the staff 
According to the data provided by wind turbines manufacturers, the largest 
noise level is about 90 dB (A). Since the operation work in the wind farm is 
totally finished by computers, normally the operation staffs will work in the 
control room. It is no need for them to work near the wind turbines. In addition, 
the control room is quite far from wind turbines, the noise of wind turbines 
cannot affect the health of operators. As for those who must do repairing and 
maintenance job, normally the wind turbines must be shut down, and the 
working period is short, so it is believed that the noise of wind farm have no 
impact on the health of operation staffs. 
Page  14
11
2.5 Reasonable arrangement of the transmission line  
Huitengxile wind farm is far from residential area and the power transmission 
lines are not in residential area either, they go through the desolate and 
uninhabited tableland. The existing substation (110kV, Caoduoshan substation) 
with the capacity of
 76MVA(1×16+1×20+1×40) is 110/35/10kV. A 15km 
110kV transmission line to the 110kV bus of 220kV Gaoshun Substation will 
be erected so that the power generation of the wind turbines will feed in the 
west main electricity network of Inner Mongolia. It will go 1.5km over to the 
west of the existing 110kV line from the wind farm, and then parallel to the 
existing Gaoshun-Desheng 220kV line to the Desheng substation in the north 
(see the drawing for detail). The distance between the two lines will be 30m. 
The rated voltage grade of the new line will be 110kV, the type of the cable 
will take LGJ-400/35. There will erect 49 towers for the line, the foundations 
of the line towers will occupy 250m
2
,which is neither cultivated land nor 
residential area, and the height of the towers will be 27-30m. The arrangement 
of the power transmission lines is reasonable and in accordance with the 
design, it will have no impact on the producing and living condition of the 
residents. 
The design of power transmission line follows the design criterion for 
substation, the distance to the ground will meet the design specifications, so it 
will be safe as pedestrian or sheep pass by under the transmission lines. 
2.6 Impact during construction period 
(1) In order to protect meadow, the soil from foundation will be moved away 
manually; stones will be loosened by explosion first and then moved away 
manually, the residents nearby will be announced two days before the 
explosion. 
(2) At wind turbines assembling site, all the facilities will be put in place as 
designed so as to control the occupied area and protect the meadow effectively. 
(3) It has been issued that all vehicles must run on the specified roads and 
mustn’t run in grassland randomly in order to protect meadow during the 
construction period.  
(4) 50% of spoil produced during construction will be backfilled into the 
foundations and the other 50% will be backfilled into adjacent gully. 
Page  15
12
(5) After the construction, both sides of the road especially for repairing and 
maintenance in the wind farm will be made green in order to reduce the 
desertification of the area. 
Detailed regulations during the construction and operation see table 5.1-1

Benefit Analysis 
4.1 Social and environmental benefit 
A
100MW coal-fired power plant runs 2,440 hours per year will produce 826 
tons of smoke, 1,900 tons of SO
2
and 11000 tons of rejects. It also needs a 
large quantity of water, and about 60~80 dB (A) noise will be produced due to 
factors like exhaustion, mechanical rotating friction and electromagnetic. The 
power generation process of wind turbines is to transform the local wind 
energy into mechanical energy, then to electricity energy. This will not produce 
pollution of air, liquid, solid contaminants or produce serious sound pollution 
during the whole process.  
The wind farm will be one of the best replacements of coal-fired power plant, 
for it utilizes natural renewable resources, and it will greatly reduce pollution 
to the surrounding environment, save normal fossil energy, protect ecological 
environment. 
4.2 Coal saving and electric power increasing 
A
100MW coal-fired power plant consumes 115 thousand tons of standard 
coal. This big number can be saved by utilizing wind energy resource, 
Page  16
13
meanwhile 405,408MWh green power generation will be increased in the 
power network and good economic returns will be gained.

During the investigation, most investigated people expressed that the project 
will promote the development of local economy, ensure the sustained 
development for the economy. All of the investigated people think that the 
meadow should be protected and the environmental sanitation should be taken 
care of during construction period, the local residents should be temporarily 
employed if necessary. 
In general, most residents here are careful about and support the project. They 
also expressed their own opinions on the potential environment impacts that 
Page  25
22
maybe occur during the construction of the project. We have paid attention to 
them, and effective measures will be taken in the design of the project.

Conclusions  
The project will select advanced equipments, so the pollutants such as air, 
liquid or solid wastes will not be produced during the wind power generation, 
serious electromagnetic interference and sound pollution will not be produced 
too, so there will be little negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, the 
wind farm can produce clean and green energy which can replace coal-fired 
power, greatly reduce pollution of the environment, utilize natural re-generable 
resources and save non-recoverable fossil fuel resources. Great environment 
and social results can be achieved from the project, so it is practicable in the 
view of environmental protection.
