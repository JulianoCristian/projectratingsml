Preface
Rudong Straw-fired Power Project is a new energy project financed by the World Bank
with total installation capacity of 25MW, annual power output 180 x 106 kWh (including 162
x 106 kWh to the network). It can offer clean and revived energy for economic development
of Rudong area, as beneficial supplement for large power grid, to supply power to coastal and
reclamation area that locates at the end of power grid, the power load scattered and the
development is rapid.
In 2004, the project was located at Mabei Village in Matang Town of Rudong County,
totally 104mu land was requisitioned(including paddy field 76mu, mulberry garden 27mu,
construction land lmu). Entrusted by Rudong County New Energy Project Office, East
China Investigation and Design Institute (ECIDI) compiled the "Resettlement Acting Plan"
(RAP). In Dec. 2004, ECIDI completed the RAP and passed the assessment of the
WB. Hereon, Jiangsu Provincial Guoxin Investment Management Group ltd. was
the project owner, and set Jiangsu Guoxin New Energy Development Company ltd.
(GXNE) to undertake specific work of this project.
Because the national land protective policy is compelled for implementation, and more
land is occupied by the original scheme,. if submit original Mabei site scheme, the project
may not be approved and the project progress will certainly be affected. As the project can
hardly be progressed forward on the orignial site, the project owner, with the support of the
Rudong County Government, seeked new site which is suitable for project construction away
from the cultivated land. At the same time, Juegang Town People's Government invited the
project owner and offered the idle land in Mingxing Construction Material Company Ltd.
for the construction land. In view of the reasons above (See the follows for details), the final
location is changed inside the plant area of Mingxing Construction Material Company Ltd.,
there is 92mu land inside the plant area, and rent tentatively 20mu from No.42 Team in
Yinxing village as the straw procurement station.
In order to report in detail the site change to the WB, the GXNE entrusted ECIDI to
compile the "Special Report for Site Change" to explain the reason, and relevant matter of
land acquisition and relocation. After the external survey and internal preparation, ECIDI
completed this report and express the wholehearted thanks to local government at different
levels and related function department as well as the resettlement expert Mr. Zhu Youxuan
from the WB that offered us a lot of valuable opinion and suggestion.

1 General
1.1 Project briefing
Rudong Straw-fired Power Project is at Yinxing village in Juegang Town of Rudong
County. The project site is inside the idle land of Mingxing Construction Material Company
Ltd., which was stopped for the operation.  The project has a total installed capacity of
25MW, annual power yield of 174x 106 kWh (including 157 x 106 kWh to the network).
Development of straw-fired power is in compliance to the national target of
development and utilization of renewable energies. By absorbing matured techniques of
foreign companies in straw-fired power generation and importing equipment through
international cooperation, the aim is to make the straw-fired power generation
commercialized and in scale development. For this project, the pre-stage work in the past 4
years covered the technical study, site selection, introduction of technologies and
investment, etc. This project is also one of the candidate projects for key scientific and
technical research in the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan" of Jiangsu Province.
1.2 Project service scope
Upon completion of Rudong Straw-fired power project, it will provide clean and
reliable energy to Rudong power system, which will play a remarkable role in increasing
power supply capability and reliability of the system, and will be, as a supplementary
power source, beneficial to Jiangsu power grid.
1.3 Project construction progress
The ground leveling for main structure (inside the plant area of Mingxing Construction
Material Company Ltd.) was started in March 2005, up to present, the ground levelling is
basically ended. In Jan. 2006, the construction of straw procurement station near the main
structure was started and the surface building is under construction. This straw procurement
station is the center station of power plant; in addition, there are 4 straw collection stations
under planning. The whole project is planned to put into operation in October 2007.
2 Site Selection
2.1 Site change condition
The original site is located at Mabei village of Juegang town, the most land is of
farmland and garden  (mulberry garden), and few of construction land.
At present, due to different reasons (See the follows for details), the final location is
changed inside the plant area of Mingxing Construction Material Company Ltd. The
project site is at Yinxing village of Juegang town, about 200m apart to No.223 provincial
road, occupying land of 92mu. In addition, rent tentatively 20mu from No.42 Team in
Yinxing village as the straw procurement station.
The ground attachment abandoned was cleared away by the town government.
2



2.2 Reason of site change
The originally selected project site was at Mabei Village, Matong Township, Rudong
County; now, it is shifted to the area of Mingxing Construction Material Co. Ltd. that was
stopped for operation. The major reasons are as follows:
(I) To keep away from the agricultural land, especially farmland as far as possible,
and not affect the project construction progress;
(1) After Jiangsu "Tieben-iron mill" event, the state stopped the approval of
construction land for Jiangsu province, if submit original Mabei site scheme, it will
certainly affected.
(2) Because the Mingxing Construction Material Co. Ltd. is a clay brick mill, by the
relative rules of document (No.2002-42) of Jiangsu Province People's Government, it
stipulates that simple kiln under 18 portals for illegally earth excavation existing safety risk
with lagged technology shall be closed. Juegang Town People's Government closed the
mill in Nov. 2004, so that 92mu land inside the mill become as idle land. At the same time,
Juegang Town People's Government invited the project owner - Jiangsu Provincial Guoxin
Asset Management Group ltd. to submit to Jiangsu Province National Land Recourse
Department to transfer 92mu land for the project use.
(3) During the period of the national land protective policy, the land policy is
compelled for implementation, and more land be occupied by the original scheme, it is
hard to get the approval from the state. But the new site is on the idle land in Mingxing
brick mill, not use farmland and easy for land use application.
(II) To reduce resettlement impact
There is no resident living in the idle land, therefore there is no house relocation
problem; At the same time, the project uses idle land without land acquisition for farmland,
so that it will not be concerned with resettlement problem.
(III) Other favorable factors
(1) Located near No.223 provincial road, the new site has convenient transportation;
(2) It is surrounded by waters on three sides. This can guarantee the water supply for
the power station operation;
(3) The project site is close to the fire department, only 3km away, so that the safe
operation of the power station can be rather highly guaranteed;
(4) The project constructed in the new site could save the costs of house rehabitation,
resetllement and compensation, therefore to reduce the project investment.
As the reason above, the site is changed to the existing Mingxing Construction
Material Co. Ltd.
3



3. Land acquisition and resettlement condition
3.1 Project Impact Scope
The land acquisition area includes main project structures (storehouse, boiler room
and steam turbine room, etc.), straw purchase station, ash deposit area, access to station,
transformation/ transmission facilities, etc., in which:
(1) Main project structures (including storehouse, boiler room and steam turbine room,
etc.) is planned on 92mu reserved state-owned land of the closed Mingxing Construction
Material Ltd.;
(2) Access roads to station: By the existing road connecting No.233 provincial
highway. No additional land acquisition is required.
(3) Ash deposit area is arranged within the scope of land requisitioned for main
project structures.
(4) The straw purchase stations: There is one central straw purchase station and four
other straw purchase stations, the central straw purchase station near the main building,
which uses 20mu leased from Yinxing village by GXNE. Four other straw purchase
stations are sheduled to be located in the following towns: Bencha, Xindian, Yangkou and
Chahe. Each station has an area of about 16 mu, totally 64 mu for four stations. GXNE
propose to select the sites which invlove no rehabitation and less farmland. Once the site is
settled down, GXNE will perform the land acquisition procedures according to relevant
national laws and local regulations.(5) Transformation/transmission facilities: The power
station is planned to connect with Chengnan substation at Juegang town, about 5 km away
from the station. Now, the preliminary design of transformation/transmission facilities is
completed, total line length 4.4km, 16 new tower bases, and partial line be set on existing
tower, and the land for new tower base about 230m2.
3.2 Inventory index for land acquisition and relocation
At present, the construction of main structure and central straw purchase station is
started, 92mu state-owned land for main structure and 20mu land rent tentatively from
No.42 Team in Yinxing village for central straw procurement station, in which 19.74mu is
farmland and rest is water pond. There is no resident living in the project area, therefore
there is no house relocation problem.
3.3 Land acquisition compensation standard
3.3.1 Use right of state-owned land
Based on the land acquisition agreement signed by GXNE and Rudong People's
Government and Juegang Town People's Government, GXNE allocated 70000 Yuan/mu
to special bank account of National Land Resource Burea of Rudong County. According
to relative rules in Document No. [2002]83 of Rudong People's Government and
Document No. [2002]52 of State Land Resource Bureau in Rudong County, charges for
negotiated land use right assignment for the project construction is 105 yuan/m2 , totaling
70000 X 92 = 6440000 Yuan.
4



3.3.2 Standard for tentative rent land
At present, the concrete land rent rates are not available for the rural collective-owned
land. The rent price of land is usually determined through negotiation between the lessor
and the lessee, and the land renting agreement will be signed after the rent rate and time
length of land renting are agreed by the two sides. Based on consultation with Yinxing
Village Comitte,the rent price of 1100 Yuan/mu is determined. According to the land
renting agreement signed by GXNE and Juegang Town People's Government, GXNE pays
1100 Yuan/mu for land rent each year to Yinxing village.
By the survey, in order to protect the benefit of peasant and considering the policy
balance for land acquisition by other projects, Yinxing Villagers Commission will pay the
compensation for land acquisition standard to members in No.42 Team for land rent for
straw purchase station, the cost gap will be filled by the village. This land compensation
cost is formed by land compensation, resettlement subsidy, young crops compensation and
other compensation cost as following:
(1) Land compensation fee
Based on relative rules of "Regulation on Land Administration for Jiangsu Province",
Document No. [2003]131 of Jiangsu Provincial People's Government and Document No.
[2004]15 of Rudong County People's Government, land compensation is taken 1500
Yuan/mu for annual output, 10 times of annual output, i.e. 1500 X 10=15000 Yuan/mu.
The land compensation is computed by the land affected area, totally: 15000X 19.74=
296100 Yuan
. The land compensation fee is determined in accordance with the calculation basis
and standard stated in the original RAP.
(2) Resettlement subsidy
Based on relative rules of "Regulation on Land Administration for Jiangsu Province",
Document No. [2003]131 of Jiangsu Provincial People's Government and Document No.
[2004]15 of Rudong County People's Government, the resettlement subsidy is computed by
the population affected for resettlement, the population affected for resettlement is
calculated by mean land per capita before the land acquisition, i.e. the resettlement subsidy
is 13000Yuan/person. The resettlement compensation fee is determined in accordance with
the calculation basis and standard stated in the original RAP.
No.42 Team has 98 persons with farmland area 68.6mu, 0.7mu per capita, the
resettlement subsidy per mu is: 13000 . 0.7= 18571Yuan/mu. The resettlement subsidy is
computed by the farmland affected, totally: 18571 X 19.74=366600Yuan
(3) Young crops compensation
Based on relative rules of "Regulation on Land Administration for Jiangsu Province",
Document No. [2003]131 of Jiangsu Provincial People's Government and Document No.
[2004]15 of Rudong County People's Government, young crops compensation is taken
1050 Yuan/mu for output of one season, the young crops compensation is computed by the
land affected area, totally: 1050 X 19.74=20727 Yua n.The young crop compenstaion fee is
5



beyond the standard (750 Yuan/mu as the season output) specificed in the original RAP.
(4) Other compensation
Totally, 15369 Yuan is for other compensation.
The total land compensation of Yinxing village is: 296100+366600+20727+15369=
698796 Yuan
3.4 Payment of land acquisition fee
GXNE paid 6440000 Yuan to the special bank account of National Land Resource
Burea of Rudong County and prepaid 66000 Yuan for land rent for 3 years to Yinxing
village based on the agreement for renting the land for straw purchase station.
Yinxing village completed the distribution of land compensation. Based on the
relative rules of "Regulation on Land Administration for Jiangsu Province", not less than
70% of land compensation fee shall be paid to peasant, so that 70% of land compensation
fee had been paid to villagers of No.42 Team, other type of compensation was fully
distributed to villagers of No.42 Team. Total land compensation fee to villagers of No.42
Team is 609966Yuan, and Yinxing village commission paid 610000 Yuan in total.
After the land renting for straw purchase station, No.42 Team adjusted the land for
whole team, the land per capita is about 0.5mu after the land adjustment. The land
compensation fee was distributed meanly, 6122 Yuan per person, 599956 Yuan in total, the
rest 10044 Yuan was given to family members that someone pass away in recent two years
to express solicitude.
All compensation fee has been paid to the villiagers in No.42 Team.
3.5 Survey of satisfaction for resettlement
3.5.1  About the land for main project structures
For the land for main building, the land of Mingxing Construction Material Co. Ltd.
Is state-owned land and the ground structures and attachment were cleared away by
Juegang Town People's Government, so that no resettlement will be done by the project
owner. To explain that there will be no remained problem after closing of Mingxing
Construction Material Co. Ltd. and no bad influence for the construction of project, the
further information is collected as the following:
The Mingxing Construction Material Co. Ltd. mainly produced bricks made from clay.
According to the Notice on Re-structuring Trade Relating Kilns and Speeding up
Development of New Wall Materials issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Government
Administrative Office (document numbered Su Zheng Ban Fa [2002] No. 42), all the
simple kilns which have gates less than 18 in number, take the soil/clay illegally, adopt
obsolete techniques and have serious hidden trouble against safety, should be closed.
Therefore, the Juegang Town People's Government issued the order to the company in
Nov. 2004 requesting the brick production to be stopped. According to the agreement
between Mingxing Construction Material Co. Ltd. and Juegang Town People's
Government, the mechanical equipment, stock-in-trade, low value fugitive resources are
6



owned by Brick Mill and handled it independently, other ground buildings, water and
power facilities are owned by Juegang Town People's Government. Juegang Town
People's Government paid once 2980000 Yuan to the Brick Mill, original staff of company
shall be settled by the company. Original debt and creditor's rights shall be solved
independently by the company and not concerned with Juegang Town People's
Government.
After the company closed its brick mill, the Juegang Town Government invited the
project owner to arrange the project site at Juegang Town within the 92 mu land of the
company. In Jan. 2005, invited by the town government, the project owner came and signed
agreement with the Rudong County and Juegang Town governments. It was agreed that the
Rudong County and Juegang Town govermments should go through all legal formalities for
transfer of the use right of the land according to the state laws, the project owner should pay
to the special state land use account for the land transferred at the rate of 70000 Yuan/mu.
The company should be responsible for removal of buildings and structures and clearing of
the 92 mu land, and complete all legal formalities before the end of February 2005.  After
that the Rudong County government submitted application for land transfer to the relevant
government departments; approved by Jiangsu Provincial State Land Administration in Jun.
2005, the 92mu land was officially taken as the state-owned land (by document numbered
Su Guo Tu Zi Di Han K 2005 ] No.27). The project owner also paid 6.44 million Yuan to the
special state land use account for land transfer. By then, the land acquisition for project
main structures was completed.
In addition, according to the agreement signed between the company and Juegang
Town government, the company was responsible for the resettlement of its staff. ECIDI
survey team tried to understand the process and conditions of the resettlement through
interview with the staff and with the responsible cadre of the town. As the company's
responsible person for resettlement was not available, it was difficult to have better
understanding of the resettlement.
According to interview with Gao Guolan and other 7 original employees of the
company, the employees of the company, except few managerial staff, earned their wages
based on the quantity of products they produced. And most of the employees were the local
farmers in the nearby villages and there were some labors from Anhui Province. The
company had no employment contract with the employees, therefore, only those few
managerial staff was stable with the company, and most of the employees were running in
and running out of the company.
Gao Guolan had her wage generally varying between 400- 1000 Yuan per month, and
most of the employees of the company had the similar wage range. After the company was
closed, the company paid the employees 1200-1800 Yuan for transition. The amount of
transition fee for resettlement was based on the position and monthly income of each
employee, and no further contract was signed between the company and the employees. For
Gao Guolan and other 7 employees, it seemed that they were satisfied at the amount of the
transition fee for resettlement, because they thought this amount of the fee was much more
than what they could expected. They also mentioned that other employees were
comparatively satisfied. They are now working for other factories, and most of the
employees have found their new job. The detail information obtained about the employees

3.5.2 Land Acquired for Center Purchase Station
As constrained by the county's land use plan and land-use index, the procedures for
land requisition for the Center Purchase Station could not be performed at present.Since
straw collection is the precondition of the power plant's operation, in order to create an
atmosphere of straw purchase in local area, it is necessary to build the center straw
purchase station closed to the plant first.Since the piece of land belongs to collective land
which is under the administration of Juegang Town. After consultation with the
government of Juegang Town and relevant village , GXNE obtained the land for the
center station by the method of renting for the time being.See Attachment 1: Certificate
issued by the People's Government of Juegang Town and Attachment 23: Cerficate issued
by Rudong Land Source Beareau. The Red Line Drawing (confining the station area) and
the Proposal for Station Site Selection ( See Attachment 34) have been approved by the
Construction Bureau and the application materials have been submitted to the state land
8



administration. Rudong County has planned to list this piece of land into the scope of the
construction land for 2007 in March 2007. It is expected that it can be approved in July
2007 by the land administrative authorities of Natong City and Jiangsu Province. In Jul. -
Aug. 2007, the project owner can file to the county land administration and county
development and reform committee for the pre-approval. It is expected that the land use
index will be issued in Nov. 2007. After issuing the index, the project owner will set out the
boundary of the land to be used and go through the formality for land requisition and land
supply scheme, and submit to the provincial and city land administrations for approval. It is
expected that the approval procedures can be completed in March 2008. After that, the
project owner plans to complete the formality for application of the land use certificate and
land compensation in March - April. By then the land requisition formality is finished, and
before the time, the land used for the center purchase station is by renting agreement.
The expenses of land requisition includes two parts, i.e., (A) the expenses of land
requisition paid by the project owner to the Yinxing Village and (B) the land transfer
expense paid by the project owner to the special account of state land of the county financial
department.
For Part (A), the official document issued by the Rudong County People's Government
[Dong Zheng Fa [2004] No.15] should be followed, and it is composed of the land
compensation, resettlement subsidy and standing crop compensation. The details are as
follows, (and the actual criteria are same as that the Yinxing Village has paid to the
villagers)..
(1) Land compensation
According to the official document issued by the Rudong County People's
Government [Dong Zheng Fa [2004] No.15] , the land compensation is based on ten times
of the yearly output of land 1500 Yuan/mu, i.e., 1 500x 10= 15000 Yuan/mu. The cultivated
land to be affected is 19.74 mu, the compensation to the affected cultivated land is
15000X19.74 =296100 Yuan; the other farmland is 0.26 mu, the compensation is
15000x0.26=3900 Yuan. Therefore, the total land compensation is 296100+3900=300000
Yuan.
(2) Resettlement subside
According to the official document issued by the Rudong County People's
Government [ Dong Zheng Fa [2004] No.15 ], the resettlement subside should be calculated
based on the number of farmers affected by land requisition, and the number of farmers
affected by land requisition should be computed by the quantity of cultivated land to be
requisitioned divided by the per capita cultivated land holding of the rural collective
economic unit before land requisition, and the resettlement subsidy criteria is 13000 Yuan
per capita.
There are totally 98 persons in No.42 Village Group of Yinxing Village; the total
cultivated land is 68.6 mu, i.e., 0.7 mu per capita. Therefore, the resettlement subside
criteria, converted by mu, is 13000  0.7=18571 Yuan/mu; and based on the area of
affected land, the total resettlement subsidy is 18571 X 19.74=366600 Yuan.
(3) Compensation to standing crops
According to the official document issued by the Rudong County People's
Government [ Dong Zheng Fa [2004] No.15] , the compensation is generally based on the

crop output of one season, and the compensation criteria of standing crops is same as
adopted at Yinxing Village, i.e., 1050 Yuan/mu; and based on the area of affected cultivated
land, the total compensation to standing crops is 1050X 19.74=20727 Yuan.
The total compensation of Part A is 300000+366600+20727= 687327 Yuan.
For Part B, the official document issued by Rudong County People's Government
[Dong Zheng Fa [2002] No.83] and the official document issued by Rudong State Land
Administration [ Dong Guo Tu Zi [2002] No.52 ] should be followed, in which the minimum
standard is specified for the transfer price of state-owned land, and at present, the final price
of the transferred land is usually determined through land assessment. Considering the
strong support of the county government to the project and the uncertainty in assessment,
this report tentatively takes the minimum land transfer price of 105 Yuan/m2 that is
specified in the above two official documents for the other state-owned land in Juegang
Township. The total land transfer cost is 70000 X 20 = 1400000 Yuan. In paying this part of
the expenses, a total of 687327 Yuan of land compensation calculated according to the
official document issued by the Rudong County People's Government [Dong Zheng Fa
[2002] No.15] should be deducted, i.e., the project owner only need to pay the land transfer
cost of 712673 Yuan now.
ECIDI survey team visited No.42 Village Group of Yinxing Village to get
understanding about the opinions of local PAPs. The team interviewed with Bao Zhiqing of
the village group. What he talked about indicated that not only he himself but also many
other villagers as well as the village cadres were satisfied with the compensation criteria and
the way of the paying the compensation. Bao's family has six members. Previously, his
family contracted 3.5 mu land, which is now all within the scope of the requisitioned land
for purchase station. The village group has re-allocated the land for contracting, and now,
his family has contracted a piece of land about 2.5 mu, and has received land compensation
of 30000 Yuan.
