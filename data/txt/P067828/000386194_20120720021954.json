"Final", "loan_no": "4792;4816", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Renewable Energy\n            Scale-up Program Project for China were as follows: outcomes\n            were highly satisfactory; Global Environmental Objective\n            (GEO) outcomes were highly satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was low; risk to GEO outcome was low; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: long-term\n            engagement with the government through the partnership\n            program has paid off: the China Renewable Energy Scale-up\n            Program (CRESP) program is the only window in the\n            Bank's China energy portfolio that engages long-term RE\n            policy dialogues and partnership with the National Energy\n            Administration (NEA). A programmatic approach, which blends\n            policy dialogue, technical assistance, and investments\n            through International Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development/ Global Environment Facility (IBRD/GEF) funding,\n            is the best conduit for scaling up RE in client countries.\n            Combining policy support and technical assistance through a\n            GEF grant with large-scale long-term financing for RE\n            investments through IBRD loans in one package is the most\n            effective and powerful tool to enable transformational\n            changes to scale up renewable energy. Flexible approach to\n            adapt to government's priorities and changing\n            environment is required: This is because RE policies require\n            frequent adjustments as Renewable energy (RE) technologies\n            evolve and make progress towards competitiveness. Improving\n            manufacturing quality is essential for the transition to a\n            world-class manufacturing industry: the key to the success\n            of the wind technology improvement component was to\n            simultaneously address wind turbine standards, testing, and\n            certification, and to support wind manufacturers in\n            developing megawatt-scale wind turbines. The piecemeal\n            approach and fragmentation of policy study contracts\n            resulted in lengthy delays and weakened policy impacts:\n            during project implementation, the Project Management Office\n            (PMO) issued a large number of small contracts. Programmatic\n            approach needs intensive supervision from the Bank team:\n            CRESP required intensive supervision to provide guidance and\n            advice to the PMO in implementing the large number of\n            activities under CRESP."}, "docdt": "2012-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
