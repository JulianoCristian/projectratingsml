It will\n            increase a sustainable water supply for multiple uses, and\n            improve the efficiency of the state of Ceara's\n            integrated water resources management system, thus\n            decreasing the vulnerability of poor populations to cyclical\n            drought. It will further promote soil and vegetation\n            management in tributary watersheds, to enhance water\n            conservation, in turn, minimizing erosion. Natural water\n            storage mechanisms will be maximized, through adequate\n            management of critical micro-basins, and groundwater\n            resources. Moreover, it will promote the improvement of land\n            use through the appropriate management of micro-basins. The\n            project is apt to undergo some negative environmental\n            impacts, but there are also several measures to mitigate\n            them. The most severe of these impacts are: 1) loss of\n            natural habitats; 2) ecological impact of reservoir water\n            releases on fresh water stream flows over coastal estuaries\n            and their vegetation, fishes, and other species; 3)\n            increasing salinity of the reservoirs; 4) inter-basin\n            infestation of unwanted and harmful fish species; and 5)\n            water-borne diseases."}, "docdt": "2008-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
