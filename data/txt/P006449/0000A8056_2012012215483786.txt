                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         (a) Increase the sustainable water supply for multiple uses, improve the efficiency of Ceará's integrated water resources management system and decrease
                         vulnerability of poor populations to cyclical drought through: (i) improvements in the institutional, legal and administrative managerial frameworks with
                         emphasis on participatory management mechanisms; (ii) the rehabilitation and new construction of the hydraulic infrastructure aimed at the integrated
                         management of river basins; (iii) the development and consolidation of sustainable cost recovery, management, operation and maintenance systems for the
                         hydraulic infrastructure; and (iv) the integration of environmental policies with water management policies. The main performance indicators are: (i) the
                         percentage increase in the volume of bulk water supplied by COGERH, the states water resources management company; (ii) the increased reliability of water
                         supply and resistance against droughts; (iii) the implementation of new and/or improved water resources management, operation and maintenance tools; (iv)
                         increase in the number of users with enhanced reliable access to quality water; and (v) the percentage of recovery for fixed and variable costs of providing
                         water. b. Stimulate multiple use, efficient and shared management of Ceará's water resources. The project would support the following actions: (i) organization
                         and strengthening of river basin committees and water user associations; (ii) implementation and propagation of more effective water use and management
                         technologies; and (iii) education, information and training of the general public and water users aimed at efficient water use, demand management and the
                         reduction of waste. The main performance indicators are: (i) the increase in the number of river basin committees and water user associations, including the
                         number of people participating in these entities; (ii) the decrease of the physical waste of water and the increased productivity in the economic sectors which
                         use water as a production input; (iii) the percentage of billed water services v/s collections of bills. c. Promote the improved management of soil and vegetation
                         in tributary watersheds to enhance water conservation, minimize erosion and maximize natural water storage mechanisms, through the adequate management
                         of critical micro-basins and groundwater resources. The project would foster the hydro-environmental recovery of selected micro-basins in the state by

                         increasing the vegetated area, controlling run-off, minimizing erosion, increasing water retention times, increasing groundwater recharge, developing aquifer
                         management plans and recharge zone protection plans, improving the local infrastructure and production methods; and by evaluating new technologies. The
                         main performance indicators are: (i) hectares of rehabilitated watershed vegetation, (ii) number of micro-basins stabilized, (iii) measured runoff hydrographs as
                         a function of time and volume for specific microbasins, (iv) measurement of volumetric erosion in key microbasins and sedimentation change in key
                         catchments, (v) number of recharge protection zones established, (vi) number of aquifer and groundwater management plans developed.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final Implementation Status and Results Report before the Additional Financing Loan closing date. Some Project activities will not be completed by the closing date. The
                         Bank agreed with the State Government that these activities will be finalized with counterpart funds during 2012 and that their results will be captured in the Implementation
                         Completion Report. The Bank team will continue to supervise the works until completion.

                         The PROGERIRH Loan 4531-BR, in the amount of US$ 136 million, was signed on February 10, 2000. It became effective on May 24, 2000 and its original Closing Date was June
                         30, 2006. The Closing Date was postponed to December 2008, to enable the completion of ongoing works and activities and provide a bridge to the proposed additional financing.
                         Later, it was further postponed to April 30, 2009 to allow for fully loan disbursement. The original Project's objectives were met by its closing date. Overall implementation was
                         satisfactory, the projected results were achieved and the Loan amount was fully disbursed. The Additional Financing Loan 7630-BR, in the amount of US$ 103 million, was approved
                         by the Board on December 18, 2008. However, it was only signed on September 22, 2009 and became effective on November 24, 2009. These delays have led to further delays in
                         the implementation schedule. The Additional Financing was used to scale up the activities financed under the original Project.
