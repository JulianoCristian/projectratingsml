   Ceará Integrated Water Resources Management Project ­ PROGERIRH
                                     Additional Financing

Executive Summary of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Compliance
                                            Evaluation

1. Introduction

This document presents a summary of the environmental and social safeguards compliance
evaluations conducted as part of the preparation of the Additional Financing of PROGERIRH.
An independent consultant was hired to conduct a critical review and evaluation of the
experience with the implementation of environmental and social policies during implementation
of PROGERIRH and activities to strengthen the framework to better address the environmental
and social aspects of the Additional Financing.

2. PROGERIRH ­ First Phase

To mitigate the potential adverse environmental impacts and further improve environmental
conditions, PROGERIRH includes a comprehensive Regional Environmental Management
Program (REMP). The following activities were included as part of the REMP:

    Protected Areas Strengthening. Support specific investments by IBAMA (Brazil's Federal
    environmental agency) to strengthen the on-the-ground protection and management of the
    39,000 ha Araripe National Forest. PROGERIRH also supported the efforts of Ceara's State
    Environmental Agency (SEMACE) to improve the protection and management of three
    existing State Environmental Protection Areas (APAs): Serra de Baturite (32,690 ha), Serra
    de Aratanha (6,448 ha), and Serra de Maranguape (6,000 ha). During implementation, the
    Bank and the State agreed to replace the support to Serra de Maranguape with support to the
    APA do Rio Cocó.

    Estuary and Floodplain Monitoring. Support environmental (physical, ecological, and
    socioeconomic) monitoring of the estuaries of four rivers likely to be affected by
    PROGERIRH dams. SEMACE started the Estuary and Floodplain Monitoring in July 2008,
    which also includes Coreau and Mundau Rivers (besides Malcozinhado, Catu, Timonha and
    Jaguaribe). The additional financing will continue providing support to SEMACE through
    data collection, quality control and dissemination. This will be part of the EMP.

    Reservoir Operation and Protection and Water Quality Monitoring Programs. Help to ensure
    that water quality information is used in various kinds of decision-making. It supported the
    improvement of water quality monitoring and data dissemination; contributed to coordinate
    actions aimed at reducing pollution and improving land use practices; reevaluated operation
    of reservoirs in light of environmental needs.

    Schistosomiasis Control. The National Health Foundation (FNS) in the Federal Ministry of
    Health has a substantial program of schistosomiasis prevention and control in Ceará. To
    offset any possibility that some PROGERIRH works could facilitate the water-borne spread
    of schistosomiasis, the REMP included a component to strengthen FNS's existing program,
    executed through the State Health and Environment Secretariats.



                                                 1

    Cultural Property Salvage. Support the identification, classification, and salvage of items of
    high archaeological or paleontological interest that could be discovered in reservoir
    inundation areas, quarries, borrow pits, or other PROGERIRH subproject sites.

The REMP includes, also, Environmental Manuals (criteria and procedures for water resources
projects),   Environmental     Training   (for SRH,   SEMACE,      and    other  key   water-related
organizations), and Environmental Rules for Contractors (applicable to both new construction
and rehabilitation works).

In general, the activities listed under the REMP were adequately implemented and complied with
the Bank Safeguard Policies: OP 4.01 ­ Environmental Assessment; OP 4.04 ­ Natural Habitats;
OP 4.10 ­ Indigenous People; OP 4.12 ­ Involuntary Resettlement; and, OP 4.37 ­ Dam Safety.

Despite the satisfactory performance of SRH in implementing the REMP, activities related to OP
4.11- Physical Cultural Resources were not adequately implemented. The main reason being that
the original EIA/RIMAs prepared between 1998 and 2001 did not include specific procedures
regarding physical and cultural resources and neither the SEMACE's environmental licenses nor
the Project's Operational Manual included specific procedures on this issue. In addition, it was
recognized that this issue, differently from others in the REMP, escaped more detailed
monitoring by the Bank Supervision.

The current situation is very different. All EIA/RIMAs of PROGERIRH ­ AF project already
include assessment of cultural resources and include specific programs that have to be
implemented during implementation of each subproject. Furthermore, the licenses by SEMACE
now also include chance finding identification and recovery procedures.

In terms of Involuntary Resettlement, the main result of the first phase was the improvement on
the quality of life and wellbeing of the population resettled in the rural Agrovilas attained mostly
through access to potable water, sanitation, health and education. The percentage of literate adult
population increased 50% when benefiting from literacy programs held at local schools. Access
to potable water and sanitation improved the children's health, and local health centers also
helped to improve vaccination rates among children. On the other hand, income generating
activities from the Agrovilas were not fully attained by all the affected population due mainly to
the lack of access to credit and improved technology.

2.1. Lessons Learned

During the implementation of PROGERIRH a number of issues were raised and the following
lessons were learned:

a) Compliance with the safeguard policies is only possible if project teams have a good
    understanding of the policies and are able to identify and adequately prevent or mitigate
    potential environmental and social impacts that trigger these policies. The additional
    financing need to continue to disseminate knowledge and information regarding the Bank's
    Safeguards and relevant national and state legislation to all staff and technical people
    involved in project implementation.




                                                  2

b) The environmental management and social development activities need to be better integrated
    into the planning and implementation process, to ensure that these activities become an
    integral part of the project cycle.

c) The bidding documents and contracts need to make for explicit reference to environmental
    manuals and action plans with costs and clear definition of roles and responsibilities, so that
    the contractor is obliged to execute the activities and environmental supervision of works is
    more effective.

d) Need to develop comprehensive Environmental Management System and develop more
    continual cycle of planning, implementing, reviewing and improving the processes to address
    environmental issues of sub projects. The system should at least contemplate the creation of a
    Sector Coordination for Socio-Environmental Management and Supervision of Works Unit.

e) The State environmental team responsible for implementing the environmental activities of
    the project needs to include well trained and an adequate number of technical staff to ensure
    all activities are properly implemented and instruments are availably to ensure compliance
    with the REMP.

f) The World Bank's supervision should more frequently review the compliance with the REMP
    and Bank's environmental and social safeguards. An annual independent environmental and
    social audit should also be considered.

g) Monitoring and evaluation of resettlement activities could include independent external
    evaluations.

h) Better coordination among State's public institutions could avoid delays on land titling. The
    Institute for Agro-development in Ceará (IDAC) and the SRH need to work collaboratively to
    ensure budget availability and complement actions for land titling.

i)  Prompt reestablishment of productive activities would render timely income improvement for
    resettled population.

j)  SRH's involuntary resettlement performance could benefit from improving staff training on
    cadastre related procedures.


3. PROGERIRH ­ Additional Financing

The infrastructure investments of the Additional Financing will continue to finance the
implementation of the Integration Canal ("Canal de Integração") and the construction of six
reservoirs (Gameleira, Umari, Jatobá, Jenipapeiro, Mamoeiro e Trairi) and related water pipelines
and infrastructure.

The construction of new reservoirs is considered essential to provide adequate water supplies to
rural communities and populations in some of the areas of deepest poverty in the State. Some of
the water stored by these reservoirs that is not needed for urban uses would be utilized for
irrigation, mostly by small farmers living downstream of the reservoirs.

The selection of projects was the result of a continuous planning process in the State. The latest
revisions of the State's Water Resource Management Plan was revised in 2005 and resulted in the
list of projects that will be financed by the PROGERIRH Additional Financing: (i) Gameleira,



                                                 3

(ii) Umari, (iii) Jenipapeiro, (iv) Mamoeiro1, (v) Trairi, and (vi) Jatobá. Alternatives were
considered and the sub-projects were subject to rigorous screening and analysis criteria
(including environmental, social, technical, economic and financial). The studies and alternatives
selection took into account not only the individual effects of each subproject but also the
cumulative and regional impacts.

(*) 25-year project horizon


3.1. World Bank's Safeguard Policies

OP 4.01 ­ Environmental Assessment

The preparation of the Additional Financing included an overall environmental assessment of
PROGERIRH implementation, a new Environmental Management Framework (EMF) for the
implementation of the Additional Financing Project, and an overall Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) as well as EMPs for each first year sub-project.

About 4-5 years ago, the PROGERIRH project financed the elaboration of EIA/RIMAs for all six
reservoirs to be financed by the PROGERIRH Additional Financing. As part of preparation of the
additional financing, a detailed and independent environmental review was undertaken for the
first year interventions of the Umari and Gameleira reservoirs and associated pipelines and water
treatment plants. The environmental review also included the review of Dam Safety provisions
and procedures, the environmental licenses and its provisions, and visit to both sub-project sites.
The compliance with applicable Brazilian legislation and Bank Safeguard policies were also
evaluated.

The main environmental issues related to the implementation of the reservoirs and related
pipelines and infrastructure are presented below:

Reservoirs




1The original subproject of Mamoeiro, analyzed during the preparation of PROGERIRH, was rejected partly as a
result of the potential environmental impacts, as explained in the PAD and in the Regional Environmental
Assessment (REA). A totally revised subproject was prepared for Mamoeiro, and compared to the original
subproject, this new sub-project will only have 10% of the total volume and 18% of the area inundated. As a result,
the subproject was considered again and prioritized under the strategic plan of 2005.
                                                         4

The Reservoirs of Gameleira and Umari were projected to address multiple uses, most
importantly public water supply for the town of Barrento in Itapipoca Municipality, and towns of
Macaoca e Lagoa do Mato in Madalena Municipality.

Both reservoirs are vulnerable to eutrophication, due to nutrient pollution as a result of the release
of sewage effluent and run-off from fertilizers into natural waters. The risk of salinization is low.
The water quality monitoring program, together with the reservoir protection and operation
program should guarantee the quality of the water for the different uses.

In addition, a number of mitigation measures, described in the EMP of each reservoir (e.g. Social
Mobilization and Environmental Education Programs, Recovery of Quarry and Borrow Pit Areas
and Construction Sites, and Rational Deforestation of the Inundated Area), will be implemented
as part of infrastructure works.

Pipelines

The main pipeline systems include the implementation of raw water pipelines, the construction of
a water treatment plan, as well as main pipelines for the water supply network. The pipelines are
being installed along secondary roads and highways, not affecting natural environments, habitats
or population. The WTPs include waste water and sludge treatment facilities

Agrovilas and Agricultural Lots

In the resettlement plans for the population affected by the construction of the reservoir
(inundated area and Permanent Protection Areas ­ APPs), one of the options is the relocation to
the agrovilas and/or agricultural lots to be demarcated specifically for the population in the
reservoir's area of influence.

In the definition of such areas, the analyses of alternative locations took into consideration
environmental criteria as well as soil characteristics for agriculture and the preferences of the
population. The selected areas have already been altered by anthropogenic activities.

The EMPs prepared for the Additional Financing Project and for the first year investments of the
Additional Financing are summarized in section 4 of this evaluation.

Public Consultations

In addition to the public consultations held during the preparation of the EIA/RIMAs and
respective environmental licenses; the sub-projects, the EMF, and the EMPs were submitted to
new consultations during the months of July and August of 2008. In general, the works are
perceived to have positive impacts since they will provide proper water supply to communities
and access to water resources throughout the year. The main expressed concerns are related to the
proper implementation of the resettlement activities.     Detailed minutes and results of these
consultations are available in the project documentation.

OP 4.04 ­ Natural Habitats

The selected subprojects will not affect Environmental Conservation Areas or Critical or
significant natural habitats. The list of priority areas for Environmental Conservation and

                                                 5

Biodiversity were reviewed and the areas affected by the reservoirs, including the Agrovilas, are
already largely occupied and altered by anthropogenic activities.

The project's main adverse impact upon terrestrial natural habitats would be the inundation of
natural vegetation by the new reservoirs. The six reservoirs would inundate roughly 4,228 ha and
the Agrovilas will occupy an additional 1,101 ha (see Table 3.2 below). The additional financing
includes the creation of APPs of at least 100m around the reservoirs with specific re-vegetation
program. The next table presents a summary of the impacts and APPs to be created at each
reservoir.

In addition, an agreement was reached with SEMACE to support Mata Branca Project (part of the
World Bank GEF Caatinga Project) and develop a strategy to implement Conservation Units
within the Conservation and Biodiversity Priority Area close to the Umari Reservoir (known as
Ca 154), as well as support fire prevention programs within conservation units in the Caatinga.

OP 4.09 ­ Pest Management

This policy is triggered due to activities aimed at (i) controlling ant infestation in newly
reforested areas, and (ii) controlling and eliminating the presence of ant hills or animal burrows
in or in the immediate vicinity of dam walls. The EMF/EMP include procedures to ensure that
any pesticides used in such activities comply with the requirements of the safeguard policy,
including a definition of the types of pesticides that can be used, the procedures for their
application, the safety of those applying it, and potential contamination of the surrounding
environment.

The additional financing investments are located in areas of archaeological and paleontological
interest, especially around the Reservoirs of Gameleira and Umari. Therefore, a chance finding
identification and recovery program was prepared as part of EMP, including the following
measures:

    A prior research of the project area, investigation and recovery procedures of historic,
    archeological and paleontological remains. Any activity related to this program has to be
    approved by IPHAN - Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional (historic and
    archeological remains) and by DNPM - Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral
    (paleontology).
    Public awareness programs.
    Destination of remains encountered to research centers.
    Chance finding identification and recovery program.

OP 4.12 ­ Involuntary Resettlement

The preparation of the resettlement action plans were concluded together with the basic and
detailed designs of the reservoirs. Since some time has passed since the conclusion of these plans
and designs (between 2002 and 2004), the following measures were taken as part of the
Additional Financing preparation:

    Review and update of the resettlement action plans for the first year investments: Gameleira
    e Umari reservoirs;
    Update of the Resettlement Framework to be applied to the remaining reservoirs.
    New consultations with the affected population.

These studies are included in separate documents. The Table 3.3 below provides a summary of
the affected people and those benefiting from the resettlement program.

SRH will continue to use the Resettlement Unit, which relies on a specialized technical team, to
prepare and conduct the resettlement process. This team is currently composed of six people
dealing with all aspects related to resettlement activities and will continue to provide support for
the implementation and monitoring of the AF Resettlement plans and will be trained, as needed,
to address the lessons learned with the implementation of PROGERIRH. In addition, NUREA

                                                    7

team will be strengthened with permanent staff to be hired during the implementation of the AF.
Moreover, the AF project will implement a system to deal with claims, queries and grievances of
the resettled population as a mechanism that will alert the project of any fault in compliance with
the safeguards during implementation.

The updating of the Umari and Gameleira Resettlement Plans was carried out by SRH and its
Resettlement Unit based on the experiences of PROGERIRH. For the Additional Financing, SRH
will continue to implement and update the remaining Plans. The Resettlements Plans for Umari
and Gameleira reservoirs complied with the Bank policies.

The objective of the State Resettlement Policies as reflected in the Umari and Gameleira
Resettlement Plans and Jatobá, Jenipapeiro, Mamoeiro and Trairi Resettlement Frameworks is to
improve the quality of life of the resettled population, ensuring the reestablishment of their
livelihoods and social networks, while providing sound governmental support to promote
sustainable development of the affected population.

The applied Resettlement Policy included the following process framework: to minimize the
number of resettlements; to observe cultural appropriateness and social diversity; to ensure the
population affected, based on the eligibility criteria, are offered free options for resettlement as
well as compensation and indemnities; to assure all the community members participation along
the project cycle; to the appropriate legal instruments to carry out expropriation measures; to
improve housing for all the affected population; to assign the rural housing (Agrovilas) and the
agricultural land in accordance to sound environmental norms; to ensure all affected families
whether with legal or illegal tenure are properly resettled; to ensure gender inclusion and
participation of family members in the endorsement for cash compensation and indemnities; to
ensure the appropriate consideration for payment of all infrastructure, property improvements and
possessions affected; to provide resettlement solutions before starting reservoir construction
works; to provide transitional accommodation only in exceptional cases; to elaborate a timetable
for the resettlement activities and have an information and communication strategy. In addition,
learning from the lessons of the implementation of PROGERIRH, arrangements for participatory
monitoring and an external ex-post evaluation are programmed.

The updated Resettlements Plans included the following: characterization of the population,
affected areas, description of indemnity types, options for the affected population and types of
benefits; expropriation plan, selection of the resettlement area, cadastre of assets, reference values
to be paid as compensations and indemnities; implementation stages of the resettlement plans
infrastructure projects, sustainable development programs, and systems for claims, queries and
grievances. During the updating of the plans, the affected families were consulted and informed.
The resettlement costs have been updated in the cases of Umari and Gameleira. For the updating
of Jatobá, Jenipapeiro, Mamoeiro and Trairi Plans, the resettlement costs will be revised in
accordance with Bank policies.

The Resettlement Plans also included measures to ensure better timing on the reestablishment of
productive activities to the resettled populations. SRH will coordinate with other institutions to
accelerate the establishment of activities that are better suitable to the conditions of the land and
the resettled vocation and go beyond irrigated agriculture options.

OP 4.36 ­ Forests


                                                  8

The policy is triggered due to activities involving reforestation of APP areas using native tree
species. For this project, the requirements of OP 4.36 overlap with those of OP 4.04 (Natural
Habitats) and, therefore, the requirements have been addressed under OP 4.04.

OP 4.37 ­ Dam Safety

The basic and detailed project designs of the Gameleira, Umari, Jatobá, Jenipapeiro, Mamoeiro e
Trairi Reservoirs were prepared under the supervision of an Independent Dam Safety Inspection
Panel that was created for the State of Ceara according to World Bank's requirements. The Panel
provides assistance to SRH and monitors all major and complex reservoirs in the state.

The Umari and Gameleira Projects were approved by the Panel during the 40th meeting in August
of 2002 and the 45th meeting in July of 2003, respectively.
3.2. Compliance with National Legislation

The main legal issues involving the implementation of the project, are related to the: (i)
environmental licensing; (ii) water usage authorization; (iii) environmental compensation; (iv)
conservation units; and, (v) cultural and natural heritage.

a) Environmental licensing

For components of the PROGERIRH Additional Financing, the environmental licensing process
is following regular environmental requirements. All sub-projects have already received initial
licenses (LPs) and some have also received implementation licenses (LIs), which is the case of
Umari Reservoir.

b) Granting of Water Rights

The procedures for obtaining the corresponding Licenses for the civil water works are underway.
The request for granting water rights will only be made after conclusion of the civil works and
should also be issued by SRH in view of the planned water uses.

c) Environmental Compensation

According to the SNUC Law number 9.985/2000, 0.5% of the cost of reservoirs and pipeline
systems should be used to strengthen Conservation Units (UCs) selected by SEMACE. In a
meeting between SRH and SEMACE in February 2008, it was established that 0.5% of the
physical interventions ­ reservoirs and pipeline systems, corresponding to US$467,450 will be
used by the State Conservation Units, including areas within the Caatinga biome.

d) Historical, Cultural and Archaeological Heritage

The EMP includes a specific program for the identification, evaluation and salvage of the
historical, archaeological or paleontological heritage.

3.3. Overall Environmental Impacts

The potential environmental impacts of the interventions to be supported by the Additional
Financing were assessed (both positive and negative).

                                                  9

In general, the positive impacts are highly significant. When the reservoirs and the water supply
systems are operational, the interventions are expected to have highly positive, permanent results,
which will ensure the population's access to good quality water supply on a permanent basis,
both for human consumption and for other uses. This will promote a significant improvement in
the quality of life of the beneficiary population.

There are two types of negative impacts:

(i)   Localized, reversible and temporary impacts mainly resulting from activities inherent to the
      civil works execution, which can be minimized by preventative measures, including the
      adequate planning of interventions and the use of suitable procedures during its execution,
      and mitigating measures specifically related to degraded areas recovery, etc. These
      measures are foreseen in the Environmental Management Plan ­ EMP and include an
      Environmental Manual for Civil Works, including detailed procedures to minimize the
      negative impacts during the construction works.

(ii)  Impacts related to resettlement and cultural heritage. These impacts will be minimized by
      the use of resettlement plans and programs for identification and salvage of cultural
      heritage.

In order to reinforce and ensure the beneficial effects of the interventions, the Project foresees the
development of environmental education actions and community participation.

Additionally, further improvement in SRH's environmental management capacity is expected as
a result of the institutional strengthening and other activities included in the Water Resources
Management Component. Noteworthy is the water quality program, which will provide SRH and
COGERH with information for an adequate operation of the State reservoirs.

4. Environmental Management Plan

The EMP of PROGERIRH Additional Financing foresees a set of actions and interventions to
prevent, minimize or compensate the environmental and social impacts resulting from the civil works
and/or Project activities.

The EMP is organized into policies and programs of environmental and social nature. Table 3.4
below presents a summary of the EMP together with a final version of the estimated costs and
institutional responsibility for the execution.

Specific EMP were established for the first-year subprojects of Umari and Gameleira and EMPs
for the subsequent subprojects ­ reservoir, pipeline and water treatment plant will be prepared
and submitted for Bank review and approval, including details of environmental actions,
responsibilities, costs and civil works timeframe. Tables 3.5 and 3.6 present the environmental
datasheet and the EMP for Umari subproject, respectively, while Tables 3.7 and 3.8 present the
environmental datasheet and EMP for Gameleira subproject, respectively. The EMPs programs
and activities for the works and operation phases.

Main Aspects

Current situation of the beneficiary population: The population in the municipality of Madalena (4,489 inhabitants) and the
districts of Lagoa do Mato (2.821 inhabitants) and Macaoca (971 inhabitants) are served mainly by water supplies taken
from small reservoirs and wells, with unsafe quality and unreliable quantity.

Characteristics of the proposed subproject: Earthfill dam in Barrigas stream (7 km upstream of the municipality of
Madalena), with 21.8m height and 600m extension. It will be used for multiple purposes, the priority one being the public
water supply of Madalena, Lagoa do Mato and Macaoca. Other expected water uses include: water supply to population
along the river, animal consumption and fishery activities. The subproject also includes the water intake structure for
34.4l/s, the water treatment plant and two 150mm diameter pipelines, one of 6km to Madalena; another of 37km to Lagoa
do Mato and Macaoca.

Benefitted population: 15,241 people (2033)

Main Aspects

Current situation of the beneficiary population: The population in the municipality of Itapipoca and community of
Barrento are served mainly by water supplies taken from small reservoirs and wells, with unsafe quality and unreliable
quantity.

Characteristics of the proposed subproject: Earthfill dam in Mundaú river, with 16.5m height and 1,721m extension. It will
be used for multiple purposes, the priority one being the public water supply of Itapipoca and Barrento. Other expected
water uses include: water supply to population along the river, animal consumption and fishery activities. The subproject
also includes the water intake structure, the water treatment plant in Barrento and a bulk water pipeline of 22km and
500mm diameter to Itapipoca, and a derivation of 7km and 100mm diameter to Barrento.

Benefited population: 34,369 people (2033)

5. Resettlement Plans

The updating of Umari and Gameleira Resettlement Plans were prepared as part of the
preparation of the Additional Financing and subject to new consultations during the months of
July and August 2008. Summaries of the activities included in the plans and their respective costs
are presented in the Tables 3.9 and 3.10.

During a latest consultation process with the affected population concerns were raised about a
new SRH's general norm requiring "judicial" process for the expropriations. Previously, the
expropriation for the regular titled holders involved strictly administrative procedures, whereas
cases of informal ownership or unsolved legal inheritance were resolved through judicial
processes. The main concern raised by the affected owners and holders of legal titles is related to
the hiding costs of the new norm. According to some testimonies the legal representation for the
judiciary process will increase the transaction cost which will be absorbed by the affected
owners.

Following these consultations and discussions with the Bank, the State has agreed to go back to
the previous expropriation process and the State Assembly has approved a law that allows SRH
to follow mainly administrative procedures.
