                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         (a) Increase the sustainable water supply for multiple uses, improve the efficiency of Cears integrated water resources management system and decrease
                         vulnerability of poor populations to cyclical drought through: (i) improvements in the institutional, legal and administrative managerial frameworks with
                         emphasis on participatory management mechanisms; (ii) the rehabilitation and new construction of the hydraulic infrastructure aimed at the integrated
                         management of river basins; (iii) the development and consolidation of sustainable cost recovery, management, operation and maintenance systems for the
                         hydraulic infrastructure; and (iv) the integration of environmental policies with water management policies. The main performance indicators are: (i) the
                         percentage increase in the volume of bulk water supplied by COGERH, the states water resources management company; (ii) the increased reliability of water
                         supply and resistance against droughts; (iii) the implementation of new and/or improved water resources management, operation and maintenance tools; (iv)
                         increase in the number of users with enhanced reliable access to quality water; and (v) the percentage of recovery for fixed and variable costs of providing
                         water. b. Stimulate multiple use, efficient and shared management of Cears water resources. The project would support the following actions: (i) organization
                         and strengthening of river basin committees and water user associations; (ii) implementation and propagation of more effective water use and management
                         technologies; and (iii) education, information and training of the general public and water users aimed at efficient water use, demand management and the
                         reduction of waste. The main performance indicators are: (i) the increase in the number of river basin committees and water user associations, including the
                         number of people participating in these entities; (ii) the decrease of the physical waste of water and the increased productivity in the economic sectors which
                         use water as a production input; (iii) the percentage of billed water services v/s collections of bills. c. Promote the improved management of soil and vegetation

                         in tributary watersheds to enhance water conservation, minimize erosion and maximize natural water storage mechanisms, through the adequate management
                         of critical micro-basins and groundwater resources. The project would foster the hydro-environmental recovery of selected micro-basins in the state by
                         increasing the vegetated area, controlling run-off, minimizing erosion, increasing water retention times, increasing groundwater recharge, developing aquifer
                         management plans and recharge zone protection plans, improving the local infrastructure and production methods; and by evaluating new technologies. The
                         main performance indicators are: (i) hectares of rehabilitated watershed vegetation, (ii) number of micro-basins stabilized, (iii) measured runoff hydrographs as
                         a function of time and volume for specific microbasins, (iv) measurement of volumetric erosion in key microbasins and sedimentation change in key
                         catchments, (v) number of recharge protection zones established, (vi) number of aquifer and groundwater management plans developed.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Water Management activities are progressing well and the project has been instrumental in consolidating COGERH ( State Water Management Agency) of Ceara responsible for
                         most of water management activities and the bulk water supply to industry and CAGECE ( State water supply and sanitation company). Monitoring of water quality and groundwater
                         activities have been supported by the project and have provided valuable information to improve water quality and prevent overuse of the aquifers to the State. This component
                         represents 10% of the total cost of the project and will be fully disbursed in December. The civil works component of the project represents 90% of the total cost. The five major civil
                         works are under construction. The Bank has provided the No Objection Letter to the remaining civil works and the construction of aqueducts to supply water from existing reservoirs
                         to the rural communities served by the project. Umari dam was inaugurated by the Government. The construction of Gameleira dam has re-started after a delayed caused by financial
                         problems of the construction firm following recommendations of the dam safety panel on the spillway. Jenipapeiro resettlement issues have been resolved. The government has
                         provided a revised project disbursement estimate at the closing date. The estimated disbursement will reach 70% of the total cost of the project. A supervision mission discussed
                         progress with the Government of Ceara and agreed on the actions needed to complete the project. It is clear that some of the civil works will be under construction after the closing
                         date of the project. The TTL has informed repetitively to the client that we will not be able to disburse loan funds after the closing date of the project. Several projects will demand
                         State resources to complete these works. The Government confirmed their interest to finalize all the civil works. For this reasons and progress obtained the TTL has upgraded the
                         ratings of the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank is closely following the implementation of the project and progress in the execution of the resettlement plans for the five dams supported by the additional financing and the
                         actions needed to finalize the water aqueducts included in the project. Construction of Genipapeiro dam has restarted and a tight schedule has to be implemented to be able to
                         finalize the civil works. Construction of several aqueducts ( Ipueras, Antonina do Norte, Itapipoca, Madalena, Ipaumirin, Amontada and Alto Santo) have just started and need
                         supervision to guarantee its timely execution. SRH and SOHIDRA need to follow up closely with the construction firms to finalize the works. The Government informed that they could
                         include the improvement works of the Section III of the Canal de Integracion included in the Bank original loan and other additional works supported by the PROAGUA project to used
                         most of the Bank funding.
                         The water management component of the project has made substantial progress and future actions to include payment for environmental services will be analyzed by COGERH and
                         the State in the future to improve water quality in the 130 reservoirs managed by the State.
