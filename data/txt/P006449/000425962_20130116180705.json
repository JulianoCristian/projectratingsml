Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, while\n            borrower's was moderately unsatisfactory. The Project\n            included four key shortcomings: (i) unrealistic estimates;\n            (ii) lack of baseline and target data; (iii) a few\n            irrelevant indicators; and (iv) inadequate risk analysis\n            regarding availability of counterpart funds. The Original\n            Project achieved most of its objectives, but with delays.\n            The Additional Financing (AF) extended the Project scope by\n            including additional reservoirs and conveyance systems;\n            however, it faced serious difficulties in executing planned\n            activities within its three-year implementation period. The\n            Original Project suffered from two serious delays: first,\n            the difficulties in concluding works on one of the six\n            reservoirs, including the resettlement activities; second,\n            the late start of the construction of sections II and III of\n            the Integration Canal. Changes in state government in 2007\n            interrupted the flow of implementation, especially during\n            the last six months of tenure of the old Administration, and\n            again during the first six months of the new government. The\n            Additional Financing phase also suffered important delays\n            that led to the noncompletion of some Project activities\n            before the closing date. A strong political will is needed\n            to integrate institutions around water resources management.\n            Participatory, decentralized Water Resource Management (WRM)\n            at the river basin level is key for achievement of improved\n            management of resources. More attention needs to be given\n            early on to water quality issues. Intensive Bank involvement\n            in supervision of resettlement and environmental safeguards\n            is indispensable. Innovation processes like the ones\n            achieved in Ceara's water sector, require long term\n            vision and political commitment, financial stability and\n            institutional strength."}, "docdt": "2012-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
