1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

Regional Context The six member countries of the Central African Economic and Monetary
Union, CAEMU (Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic (CAR), the Republic of Congo,
Equatorial Guinea (EG) and Gabon) share a common currency (the CFA franc -Coopération
Financière en Afrique Centrale) a common central bank (Banque des Etats de l'Afrique
Centrale, BEAC), a common bank supervisor (Commission Bancaire de l'Afrique Centrale
COBAC), a common money market, a common external tariff, and a common set of business
laws under the OHADA initiative (Organisation pour I'Harmonisation du Droit des Affaires).
In the 1980s, poor macroeconomic management and mismanagement of banks, many in the
public sector, led to economic decline and a financial sector crisis in most countries. The
devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 supported by economic reform programs
restored export-led growth. Most countries also implemented financial sector reform
programs: banks were restructured or privatized and banking supervision strengthened with
the creation of the regional banking commission.

At appraisal participants viewed the payments system of the sub-region as a constraint to
economic and financial sector development. This was raised in the Financial Sector
Assessments of the two largest economies of the region, Cameroon (2000) and Gabon (2001).
At the time of appraisal, there were 32 banks, many with common ownership, and 12 non-bank
financial institutions in the sub-region. They had a total of 144 branches. The weakness of the
payments system contributed to the use of cash for most retail transactions; the ratio of
currency to M1 was a high 48.5 percent compared to 13.5 in the Euro zone. Non cash payment
instruments were based on paper with checks accounting for 92 percent of the value of non-
cash transactions. Less than 3 percent of the 16.5 million economically-active population in the
sub-region had a bank account

Rationale for Bank Assistance At the time of appraisal, Country Assistance Strategies for
individual countries called for regional cooperation, and a Bank assistance strategy for
the sub-region which gave priority to financial system integration and payment system
reform was under preparation. Country Assistance Strategies for individual countries called
for a regional approach in a number of areas: forestry conservation and transport development
were being dealt with on a regional basis, and the Bank supported a single approach to bank
restructuring and regional regulations for microfinance institutions. The Regional Integration
Strategy for the sub-region was approved in January 2003 (Report No.25328). The strategy
aimed at strengthening the ongoing integration in the Community, and was based on the
premise that regional integration/cooperation can reduce poverty by strengthening the links
among the poorer landlocked countries and their more prosperous coastal neighbors, and
generally by helping to establish the basis for faster economic growth. A priority area in
regional integration was financial sector integration. A Regional Integration Strategy (RIAS)
for Sub-Saharan Africa which confirms the key premises of the 2003 document for Central
Africa was submitted to the Executive Directors in March 2008 (Report No. 43022). The



                                               5
second pillar of the Regional Strategy aims to strengthen institutional cooperation for
economic integration, focusing, among others, on developing regional financial markets.

The credit was made to BEAC, the regional Bank, which operated the existing payments
system and would be largely responsible for project implementation and operations.
Under its articles of agreement, IDA can provide financing to public international or regional
organizations for the benefit of IDA members.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project aims at improving the efficiency and security of the payment system in the
Central African Economic and Monetary Union. This will be achieved by establishing and
installing appropriate regional payment mechanisms to satisfy the evolving needs of all market
sectors - consumer, retail, industrial, commercial, financial and Government, - for making
payments in a safe, sound, secure and timely manner with certainty at an acceptable cost.

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) noted the specific objectives of the reform of the
payments system, as follows.

       (i) Strengthen the financial sector and its support to the economic development of the
           region; at the time of appraisal it could take over two months to clear a check
           drawn on a bank in Northern Cameroon and deposited in the South of the country.
           By reducing such delays, the reform should contribute to the development of
           banking activities. The reform will provide the opportunity to increase retail
           banking activity through the introduction of new fee-based products and services
           built on a widespread and convenient electronic access to the banks.

       (ii)   Facilitate economic and trade relations in the sub-region with a view to
              strengthening regional integration by avoiding risky and costly transportation of
              cash and providing fast, secure and low-cost payment instruments.

       (iii) Develop the supply of basic banking services (payments, remittances and small
             credits) to a significant share of the population and in particular in the low income
             segments. Emphasis was placed on satisfying the needs of the low income
             population in conjunction with the development of micro-finance institutions and
             of electronic money (value stored on smart cards for instance). In this context the
             project would facilitate the provision of prepaid services for the purchase of water
             and electricity for low income people as the extension of service to this category
             of the population by utility companies is hampered by the high cost of billing and
             collection.

       (iv) Increase the efficiency and safety of payment mechanisms available to
            governments, businesses and the general population by promoting electronic
            payment instruments and electronic exchange of transactions. In particular, the
            costly and manual process of using cash for the payment of salaries, pensions, and
            utilities services will be transformed into electronic processes.

            (v)     Facilitate the implementation of monetary policy. Thanks to the centralization of
                    the liquidities of financial institutions in a single account in BEAC's books and
                    the real time processing and accounting of large value transactions, BEAC will
                    have an instant view of the situation and a better capability to implement an
                    effective monetary policy in the sub-region.

Project indicators in Annex 1 to the PAD (Project Design Summary) are given in their entirety
in the matrix at the beginning of this report. The key performance indicators given in Section
A.2 of the PAD are given below. They are essentially the same as those that appear in
Schedule 6 of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).

          (i)     Total number of deposit-taking institutions' costumers has increased from 3 to 8
                  percent of the population
          (ii)    Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) is operational (90% of transactions are
                  made in less than 30 minutes).1
          (iii)   Transactions exchanged among financial institutions and clearing systems are fully
                  computerized.
          (iv)    Delays in payment clearing and settlement have been significantly reduced to a
                  maximum of three (3) days for bank-to-bank transactions and a maximum of seven
                  (7) days for client to client transactions
          (v)     The Inter-Bank Card System (IBCS) is operational
          (vi)    Two inter-bank card centers operational after second year of the program; thereafter
                  the volume of card transactions increases by 10% each year commencing on June
                  30, 2004
          (vii)   The implemented payment system is conform to the principles established by the

and reasons/justification

The project objectives and indicators were not revised.

1.4             Main Beneficiaries

Project beneficiaries included a wide range of stakeholders. The PAD noted that well
designed and implemented national and regional payments systems would result in tangible
benefits to governments, financial institutions, enterprises and the rapidly increasing number of
people using bank services including the poor, through a pilot e-money scheme. The project
would improve the quality of payments services reducing costly float for enterprises and bank
clients, by speeding up the circulation of funds, and increasing the efficiency of funds transfers.

    This indicator does not appear in section A.2 of the PAD but does appear in the DCA (Schedule 6) and in the PAD Project Design
Summary.



                                                                      7
It would provide tools to financial institutions to enhance the monitoring of their treasury and
cash management and mitigate credit and liquidity risks and reduce transaction.

Specifically, benefits would accrue to: (a) governments, by reducing potential fraud, tax
evasion, the cost of payments of salaries and pensions, and of maintaining excess liquidity; (b)
financial institutions, by improving the quality of their services, which would widen their
customer base; reducing processing and liquidity costs, and lowering risks; (c) firms, by
improving and accelerating financial flows which would reduce risks and costs of operations;
(d) bank clients, by providing them with better banking services (e) non-bank clients by
providing them with a practical method for payments thus facilitating their access to vital
services, such as electricity and water, that require prompt payment.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

The original project components are summarized in the PAD (Part C1). The project has eight
main components to be developed and installed either at the regional or national level:

      (i)     a Global Project Management (GPM) component that will coordinate and
              implement the reform process. The GPM is also responsible for providing
              stakeholders with all necessary information, communication and training
              programs;

      (ii)    an Electronic Bulk Payment Clearing Systems (EBPCS) managing the
              exchange and clearing process of bulk payment transactions, including the
              transformation of paper instruments into electronic data. Identical electronic
              clearing systems will be installed in each country;

      (iii)   a Real Time Gross Settlement mechanism (RTGS) enabling instant and final
              irrevocable settlement of individual large value and other time critical
              transactions,(cross-border and monetary policy operations for instance), the
              settlement of the payment leg of securities transactions, and the settlement of the
              multilateral balances of the clearing systems for bulk transactions (EBPCS);

      (iv)    an Inter-Bank Card System (IBCS) served by a dedicated network
              infrastructure; it will also include a prepaid system for the poor for the payment of
              their consumption of water and electricity.

      (v)     a Payment Risk Management System (PRMS) collecting all information
              regarding payment incidents for individuals and companies, enabling a better
              control over unreliable customers' operations, and providing access to critical
              information to credit institutions and banks;

      (vi)    a Telecommunication infrastructure (TELECOM) in particular at the sub-
              regional level, in order to ensure high-quality, low-cost transfers of data and
              payment transactions among BEAC offices and all financial institutions' locations



                                                 8
              (branches and head offices), and implement standards and norms to facilitate the
              interoperability of all payment systems.

      (vii)   a Legal framework (LEGAL) component, to provide a robust legal basis for
              payments processing, clearing and settlement covering the rights and obligations
              of counterparts and intermediaries at all steps in the transaction flow including the
              methods for resolving disputes and claims;

      (viii) a Training Program (TRAIN) will be aimed at BEAC and commercial bank
             operators. Some training will be specific to the use of the RT GS, EBPCS and
             IBCS. Other will be focused on the more general issue of cash and liquidity
             management, etc.

1.6     Revised Components

The project components were not revised. Much of the training which was to be carried out
on the systems was done as part of the contract for the installation of the systems which turned
out to be more efficient. Therefore the expenditures under the training component were lower
than estimated at appraisal. The Risk Management System Component turned out to be more
complex and costly than estimated at appraisal and is being implemented under the ongoing
CEMAC Regional Institutions Support Project.

1.7     Other significant changes

There were no other significant changes to the project. The project took longer to
implement than estimated at appraisal, and the Closing Date of the credit was extended twice
for a total of two and one half years, from December 2006 to June 2009.


2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The background analysis was sound. The project was generally well prepared and the
appraisal team included staff with the required skills. The project benefitted from experience in
the preparation of a payments system project for the West Africa Monetary Union (Credit 3424
of September 2000). A number of studies were carried out in preparation of the project in
conjunction with an extensive consultation process. BEAC associated all stakeholders in the
design and implementation of the new system's architecture (BEAC officials, representatives of
the six Ministries of Finance, staff of Telecommunications Regulatory Authorities, CEOs and
managers of all commercial banks, and bankers associations) which resulted in buy-in. The
PAD notes that the discussions during preparation involved 500 representatives and experts
from all stakeholders concerned in the sub-region and included senior experts from the Central
Bank of Tunisia and BCEAO. World Bank staff was involved in the process, as was IMF staff.
The project team included a senior financial sector specialist from the region and a payments
specialist from the Financial Sector Network Anchor. The reviewers were senior financial

                                                 9
sector staff. The project design was validated in 2002 by a Regional Steering Committee,
chaired by BEAC's Governor, and a document outlining the reforms was prepared and
distributed to key stakeholders.

The project design addressed needs and the design was on the whole appropriate and
complete. The regional approach was the appropriate design for the development of the
payment systems in the CAEMU member countries, which were part of a monetary union, and
the alternative of developing individual systems more costly and suboptimal in terms of
promoting regional integration. The project included eight components, but in fact three
(telecommunications, training and legal) were part of the three main systems and could have
been incorporated into those components as was done in the case of the West Africa project,
mentioned above. The comprehensive approach was appropriate for the six countries that
would benefit from the project and would result in significant economies associated with
integration; the comprehensive nature was unavoidable as the three systems at the core of the
project were necessary for the payments system to meet international standards. The project
content was similar to that of the West African project. The design of the EBPCS and RGTS
and card systems was detailed, but work on the CIP was preliminary. The implementation
period was optimistic; it did not take into account the project complexity and that this was the
first World Bank project to be carried out by BEAC. The project includes outcome indicators
which were on the whole appropriate as discussed in Section 2.3 below, although the
macroeconomic and sectoral indicators are not easily linked to the project in the short term.
Arrangements were made at appraisal for the baseline data to be gathered early during
implementation, and this was done, but with some delays.

Implementation arrangements were in line with those of similar projects and were
satisfactory, but they were not fully in place at the time of Board presentation. The
arrangements included a Regional Consultative Committee as well as National Committees of
stakeholders, which were in operation during preparation and thus in place at project startup. It
also included a Project Management Unit located in BEAC to manage the day to day aspects of
the project. Establishment of the Project Management Unit was a condition of effectiveness.
The setting up of the Project Management Unit., delayed credit effectiveness by four months.

CAEMU member governments, through BEAC, and key stakeholders were committed to
the project. The lesson that a complex project such as this linking the banking systems of six
countries required involvement from all stakeholders was incorporated in project design and in
the implementation arrangements. As mentioned above, the BEAC led extensive discussions
during preparation which resulted in widespread support among stakeholders; National
Committees and a Regional Committee to help design and follow up the project contributed to
the buy-in.

Important risks were identified but some risks were not raised. The PAD identified
inadequate commitment by BEAC and the risk that member Governments or institutions would
feel underrepresented. Risks from components to outputs were also identified, such as
difficulties with the new technology and the implicit requirement that banks make important
investments in order to adopt the new technology. However, the fact that the project had
complex procurement requiring customized bidding documents, and that BEAC had never

                                               10
implemented a World Bank project was not raised as an issue. BEAC was the only counterpart
to the Bank for the project. This was an exceptional situation because unlike a national
institution, BEAC could not draw on the experience of other institutions in the country in
dealing with the Bank. The formal and centralized nature of the decision making process at
BEAC, which made decision-making slow, was not identified as a potential problem. Delays
resulting from political changes at the regional level, such as a change in the Governor of
BEAC, which were not related to commitment to the project and which resulted in some delays
were unusual and would have been difficult to anticipate.

Lessons Learned were taken into account in project design. These included the need (i) for
consultation and stakeholder involvement given the complexity of developing and
implementing a payments system, discussed above; (ii) for coordination in the implementation
of components which was achieved by instituting a strong project management organization;
(iii) for an adequate legal framework which was addressed by including a legal component in
the project and (iv) for participating financial institutions to upgrade their systems;
participating institutions created payments systems committees to manage and put in place the
needed upgrades.

The Quality Assurance Group rated quality at entry satisfactory (Sixth Quality at Entry
Assessment (QEA6) dated June 2003). The operation responded to clients' demand and was
consistent with the regional strategy; the participatory aspect of project preparation was rated
highly satisfactory. The group noted that preparation of financial management aspects prior to
Board presentation was inadequate, and fiduciary aspects were rated as marginal.

2.2    Implementation

The support by BEAC, the strongest regional institution, helped ensure the program's
success. The management of BEAC, including the Governor and Deputy Governor, gave the
program its full support, and followed the progress, intervening when required. This probably
avoided potential problems with participating banks and other stakeholders. BEAC appointed
a strong project management team although there were staffing issues, particularly in the area
of financial management. The Project Director was appointed early on but the recruitment of
the technical team , delayed credit effectiveness by four months. Also, changes in senior
management at BEAC (in July 2007 and January 2010) related to the membership of CEMAC
impacted the project progress and the preparation of this ICR.

Project implementation took longer than expected and the closing date had to be
extended for two and one half years. Implementation delays were related principally to the
lack of familiarity of BEAC with information technology procurement and inherent
difficulties of dealing with six banking systems. The procurement process took longer than
estimated and the installation and launching of the systems which more difficult than
anticipated. It should be noted that there had been limited experience with projects entailing
linking banking systems of different countries elsewhere. Also affecting project
implementation was the four month delay in effectiveness discussed in the preceding
paragraph.



                                              11
Extensive consultation during preparation facilitated implementation. As discussed
above, the project was prepared with considerable input from stakeholders. During
implementation the consultative structures developed during preparation were maintained
which permitted stakeholders to raise and resolve issues.

Staff continuity in BEAC and the Bank helped ensure follow up. On BEAC's side, the
project was managed by the same manager, and all key technical staff remained in place until
all systems were operational, which facilitated implementation and allowed BEAC to develop
in-house expertise. The project was appraised by one task manager who supervised the project
until 2004. It was supervised by a second task manager until completion who was able to
expand the dialogue with BEAC and which led to the preparation and approval of a broader
project to support CEMAC institutions. IMF staff followed up progress in the installation of
the payments system and coordinated with Bank staff throughout project implementation.

Key problems were addressed by BEAC as they arose. BEAC adopted the principle of
financing all additional costs associated with the program and promptly provided the resources
as they became necessary. BEAC's direct contribution to the project more than doubled, from
US$4.1 million estimated at appraisal to US$10.4 million at project completion. This figure
underestimates BEAC's contribution as BEAC financed a major upgrade of its
telecommunication system to meet all BEAC needs including that of the payments system. As
the portion associated with the payment system could not be distinguished, these investments
are not included in the US$10.4 million.     The project was never at risk

Delays in implementation made difficult the evaluation of results. BEAC requested a
postponement of the ICR date to June 2011 to allow time to show the results of the project
through ongoing surveys and for the card system financed under the project to be developed
further. The Bank authorized an extension of the ICR deadline to June 2010, expecting that
preliminary results of the surveys would be available. The results of these surveys are
expected to be available in late August 2010. The Bank decided to proceed with the ICR
preparation as it determined that there was enough data without the surveys to do an evaluation
which meets the standards and fiduciary obligations of the Bank. The surveys will give better
information on the assessment of beneficiaries, the number of bank accounts in the region and
on the time required for payments clearance from one customer to another

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation

Key performance indicators for the three systems were measurable. The framework also
included macroeconomic and sector indicators that cannot be readily linked to the project in
the short term (M2/GDP) and a sector indicator (growth in the number of customers of deposit-
taking institutions) which is also difficult to link to the project outputs in the short term. A
beneficiary survey envisaged at appraisal was carried out in 2005; the selection process for
this study was initiated after credit effectiveness resulting in delays in startup of the study
which produced base line data for 2005. A follow up survey is being carried out now, as
discussed above. Information on the Electronic Bulk Payment System and the Real Time Gross
Settlement Mechanism is on the whole available at BEAC, and on the Inter-Bank Card System
at the Inter-Bank card system operator (SMAC - Société Monétique d'Afrique Centrale)..

                                              12
Interim targets suggested by QAG were not introduced in part because task teams believed that
it would be difficult to measure progress before the systems were running. Follow up for the
card component was transferred to the Societe Monetique d'Afrique Centrale (SMAC) in 2008.
SMAC did not report regularly to BEAC or the Bank.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management was moderately satisfactory. During the early phases of
implementation, project accounting was inadequate, which reflected the lack of familiarity of
BEAC with bank practices, and of accounting practices of the person in charge. Another
problem was linked with BEAC contributions to the project which for some years were not
deposited in the project account but disbursed directly by BEAC. Bookkeeping and counterpart
recording errors resulted in project audits being qualified. In 2006 a qualified financial
management specialist was appointed to the project who has resolved most of the bookkeeping
and accounting problems resulting from the errors of the previous years. The final project
audit, for calendar year 2009, is underway.

Procurement is rated satisfactory. The project required the procurement of three large
information technology systems, and the bulk of project procurement was through the
international competitive bidding method. BEAC had never managed Bank procurement, and
although the process was initially slow, BEAC carried out the procurement of the systems
without difficulties. BEAC has acquired considerable knowledge of procurement processes and
is managing the procurement for all regional institutions in the ongoing CEMAC Regional
Institutions Development Project.

Disbursements were slow with respect to appraisal estimates. The disbursement delays
were directly related to delays in the project startup and in procurement. Supervision reports do
not note any particular issue with respect to disbursements. The available documentation does
not record disbursement problems other than those associated with procurement. One hundred
percent of credit funds were disbursed.

There have been no issues in safeguard compliance. These were not applicable.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

In August 2008, BEAC established the Payments Directorate under the General Directorate of
Operations as part of a reorganization of the institution. The Directorate includes qualified
staff, including many from the Project Management Unit, which runs and ensures maintenance
of the EBPCS and RTGS systems. The directorate has a work program for expansion of
existing systems and has begun the process of selection of consultants for the implementation
of a Risk Management System. BEAC has maintenance contracts with the suppliers of the
equipment and software for the Electronic Bulk Payment and the Real Time Gross Settlement
Systems. As mentioned above, SMAC, the central operator for the inter-bank card system, and
the regulator OMAC have been in operation since 2008.




                                               13
The implementation of the project helped establish a good working relationship between
BEAC and the Bank and served as a vehicle for discussion of policy and institutional reforms
in the financial sector and more broadly for regional institutional reforms. In 2009, IDA
approved financing for a CEMAC Regional Institutions Support Project (SDR 31.5 million) to
BEAC. The project includes financing to implement the Risk Management System.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of objectives is high. The project design reflected an appropriate diagnosis of
the priorities for financial sector integration and modernization. The project objectives were at
the time of appraisal and are still aligned with the World Bank strategy for the sub-region,
spelled out most recently in 2008. The second pillar of the Regional Integration Strategy for
Sub- Saharan Africa aims to strengthen institutional cooperation to promote economic
integration, focusing, among others, on developing regional financial markets. Ease of
payments throughout the CAEMU facilitates trade and thus economic integration.

The design is relevant. The project design reflects considerable preparatory work and is the
appropriate approach in a region with a common Central Bank and currency. The
comprehensive nature of the design was also appropriate. Internal difficulties in member
countries during project implementation (e.g., Cameroon, Chad) did not affect implementation
of the project and confirms the soundness of design.

Implementation support was relevant. Bank's implementation assistance focused on
support on technical aspects and procurement, and a payment system specialist participated in
many of the supervision missions. Delays in procurement suggest that more could have been
done to build BEAC's capacity particularly in the early phases of implementation. The project
served as an important vehicle for dialogue on regional integration issues.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project has already achieved part of its development objective of improving the
efficiency and security of the payment system in the Central African Economic and
Monetary Union. Of the three key systems to be put in place, the two largest, the electronic
payments system and the large value system are functioning well and key performance
indicators have been met: the speed of clearing checks and other instruments has fallen from
three to four weeks within a country or more before the project to less than 2 days bank-to-
bank. New instruments such as cash cards have been introduced which are facilitating doing
business in the region. Banks have consolidated their accounts in BEAC into a single account,
which has improved BEAC's              knowledge of the liquidity position of banks. These
developments, along with other key reforms, have contributed to improvements in the
formulation and implementation of monetary policy. The card system began operations in
2009, and eight banks have joined the system. Two performance indicators (the establishment
of the system and of two card centers) have been met, but it is not possible to measure
growth, the third indicator, as the system was only put in place in 2009. The systems supported

                                               14
under the project are increasing the speed and security of monetary transactions in the region
and will in the medium term contribute to increased trade and thus integration. The legal
framework to enable the system operate has been put in place as has the telecommunications
infrastructure planned under the project. The systems were designed to meet the guidelines of
the Bank for International Settlements (CPSS-Core Principles for Systemically Important
Payment Systems). There has been an increase in the use of non cash instruments in the region
with the share of currency in M1 declining from 45 percent in 2000 to 34 percent in October
2009, the last month for which information is available. The outcomes and rating of the key
components are summarized in the paragraphs that follow.

The results of the Electronic Bulk Payment Clearing System (EPBS) are rated
satisfactoryrated satisfactory. KPIs relating to the speed for clearing of transactions between
banks and the electronic system linking of banks and the compensation centers were met. The
system was put in place in May 2009 later than initially estimated in part because of
installation took longer than expected. The system has operated without interruptions since its
startup. Transactions between banks and the compensation system are done electronically.
Bank to bank transactions are generally cleared the day they are submitted for clearing. The
system regulation requires that check clearance between customers be done in a maximum of
three days, and most transactions meet the regulation. Additional information on customer to
customer transactions will become available in the surveys.

The EBPS was introduced in phases, with the first national system installed in Cameroon
in 2007 and the regional system beginning operations in May 2009. Some 378 thousand
transactions for a total of FCFA 3.8 billion were made between the start of operations of the
regional system in May 2009 and the end of the year. At the end of 2009, 58 institutions
participated: 45 banks; three government treasuries; three postal savings institutions, and a
microfinance institution. Other microfinance institutions are using the system through
participating commercial banks. The regional program began in 2009, but the compensation
system of Cameroon, the largest economy in the region began operations in November 2007
with the other country systems' entering in operation in 2008 (Gabon, Republic of Congo and
CAR) and 2009 (EG and Chad). The use of non-cash instruments in the region increased by 28
percent in the almost two years between the end of 2007 when the Cameroon system began
operations and October 2009, the last month for which data is available, compared to the
indicator objective of 30 percent three years after the startup of the regional program.

BEAC consultations with the users indicate that they are generally satisfied with the
EBPS. This is not surprising given the results; banks are paying for the services. The
information with respect to the consumers will be provided by the ongoing beneficiary surveys.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that while most customers are satisfied with the system, small
clients in isolated areas may be paying high fees for regional transfers; these problems are
likely to be reduced as the large number of financial institutions with transfer capabilities
becomes known. Banks and other system participants have requested periodic training of their
staff and BEAC is looking into the design of a permanent training program. The significant
decline in the time to clear payments is doubtlessly facilitating trade and should be particularly
helpful in stimulating activities in the region of small enterprises which had to conduct
business in cash. The payments system has expedited government payment for services in

                                               15
Cameroon, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo whose treasuries participate in the
compensation system.

The expected outcomes of the Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) component
have been met. The component is rated satisfactory. The RTGS system started operations in
September 2007; all transactions are done in real time, exceeding the KPI objective that 90
percent of transactions be settled within 30 minutes. The bulk of large volume transactions in
the region pass through the RTGS. The volume of operations increased ten-fold in the first year
of operation, from FCFA 16.5 trillion between the start of operations in November 2007 to the
end of 2007 to FCFA 146.5 trillion in 2008 and FCFA 160 trillion in 2009,a 10 percent
increase in the second year of operations (a project indicator). The liquidity of commercial
banks was centralized in 2006, and BEAC has real time visibility of the liquidity position of
banks. The system operates every business day, and there have been no disruptions related to
the system since startup. Short interruptions have been linked to the telecommunications and
electricity systems; the RTGS remained operational during the March 2008 riots in Yaoundé
when the Government, BEAC and business closed. The system has 61 participants including
45 commercial banks, three national treasuries; three postal savings institutions; the Douala
Stock exchange, the Central Africa Stock Exchange (Libreville) and the Office of Government
Debt. The treasuries of three other countries participate through intermediaries.

Inter Bank Card System component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Two key
indicators (start of operations and location of two offices) were met, but the system still has
limited participation. No major problem is expected with participation of banks in the region,
but as the system was just began operations in 2009, it is not possible to measure growth and
the component is thus rated moderately unsatisfactory. Inter-bank card centers in Libreville
and Douala have been established (a KPI) and eight banks are participating with other large
banks expected to join this year. The institutional structure for the inter-bank card system was
put in place and consideration is being given to streamline the structures to increase their
efficiency. The central operator SMAC with headquarters in Libreville and the
regulatorOMAC in Yaoundé, Cameroon began operations in 2008. The card system began
operations in 2009Banks are issuing cash cards which have facilitated business for small
businessmen and enterprises and are studying the development of water and electricity cards
which was a project indicator.

Payment Risk Management System was not put in place. A small component of the
project, it was to develop a system to collect all information regarding payment incidents for
individuals (US$0.5 million was assigned to it), and no performance indicators were included
in the PAD or the DCA. The system turned out to be more complex and costly than initially
estimated; costs increases were partly due to the revaluation of the EURO during the project
period but it also reflected the information obtained when the detailed design of the system was
done after appraisal. The process of selection of consultants for the system is underway now.

3.3    Efficiency

It is difficult to estimate an economic rate of return for a project of this nature, and there is no
data that would allow a valid comparison between payment systems. However, the appraisal

                                                16
premise that putting in place a single system for the whole region is the least cost solution for
the development of the regional payments system remains valid. The total cost of the project
was 30 percent higher than appraisal estimates in US dollar terms. As mentioned earlier,
BEAC financed the increased costs. The cost of the two main components was three times
higher in US dollar terms (twice in FCFA) than estimated at appraisal while the cost of the card
component is below appraisal estimates. The cost of project management was below appraisal
estimates.

The increased cost of the RTGS and electronic payment systems reflects the devaluation of the
US dollar against the FCFA which is pegged to the Euro in the period of implementation and
an underestimation of costs at the outset as there was no precedent for estimating costs for a
payment system linking six countries; the West African payments system project had similar
problems. Financial arrangements are in place for cost recovery in all systems. BEAC charges
an annual fee as well as a transaction fee for the RTGS and the Electronic clearing system. The
ICR team estimates that the annual payment by participating institutions for the RTGS system,
which has been in operation over a year, was some FCFA 410 million in 2009.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: moderately satisfactory

The project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The project continues to be relevant
and a priority in achieving the regional integration objectives. Also, the project has already
achieved part of its development objective of improving the efficiency and security of the
payment system in the Central African Economic and Monetary Union, which is a large region
with dispersed population centers. Of the three key systems to be put in place, the two largest,
the electronic payments system and the large value system are functioning well and key
performance indicators have been met: the speed of clearing checks and other instruments has
fallen from a manual system where transactions could take three to four weeks to settle to
settlement of many transactions the day they are presented for clearing. New instruments such
as cash cards have been introduced which are facilitating doing business in the region.
Commercial banks have a single account with the central bank and BEAC has better
knowledge of the liquidity positions in the banks. The centralization of accounts along with
other reforms, has contributed to the application of monetary policy. The card system began
operations in 2009, and eight banks are participating in the system. The growth of the system,
an outcome indicator, cannot be measured yet In addition, to provide the necessary support
for the new payments system, the legal framework was revised and the telecommunications
infrastructure upgraded. While difficult to measure, investments likely represent the least cost
solution for a six country monetary union, and user charges are being paid by system
participants. The systems were designed to meet the standards for payments systems of the
Bank of International Settlements. The project accomplishments justify at least a moderately
satisfactory rating. The project has not been rated fully satisfactory because we are not yet able
to measure the results of the card system and the beneficiary survey findings are not yet
available.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

                                               17
(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project is not primarily focused on poverty issues although faster transactions and
increased intra-regional trade will indirectly help the poor in the longer term. The poor will be
directly affected by the introduction of prepaid cards for water and electricity being considered
and by the prepaid cards (electronic wallets) which are already issued and which facilitate the
transfer of funds particularly by low-income persons who do not have bank accounts. Also,
savings and loan institutions whose clients are mostly the poor are participating in the clearing
system directly or indirectly through other institutions while three postal savings institutions
which are often the sole access to financial services in the rural areas are also participating in
the system. The new systems expedite payments to the members of these institutions which are
small enterprises and low income individuals who are often suppliers of services, and make the
transfer of money more secure. Participation by the Treasury Departments of Cameroon,
Gabon and the Republic of Congo results in expedited payments by these governments for
services, often provided by small enterprises.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project has had a positive impact on integration by creating an institutional
framework to manage payments across the region which is working well. The project
contributed to creating and developing the capacity of the institutions that manage the systems.
BEAC established a Payments Directorate to manage the payment systems and a Regional
Monitoring Committee has remained in place. Payments systems generally contribute to
institutional strengthening of all banks although it is particularly helpful in the case of smaller
banks and financial institutions which do not have ready access to information systems. The
introduction of the payment system required that all banks and financial institutions update
their information technology to be able to participate in the system.

The project also helped introduce an inter-bank card system with international standards which
did not exist in the participating countries before. Banks as well as microfinance institutions
are exploring ways to issue cards adapted to their customers' requirements including credit,
debit and prepaid cards.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project required extensive consultations at startup and the structures developed during
preparation led to the establishment of a Regional Monitoring Committee and active follow up
by key stakeholders. The implementation of the payments system project allowed for the
development of closer relations between BEAC, the strongest institution in the region, and
other regional institutions, and contributed to the identification of a broader program covering
regional institutions where BEAC remains the borrower and executing agency.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

In general, telecommunications and financial sector infrastructure system development is
largely irreversible and once in place, is likely to remain. With regard to the EBPCS and the
RTGS specifically, the risk that there will be detrimental changes to the systems is small. The
main technical challenges have been overcome, and the advantages are clear to BEAC and
other stakeholders resulting in strong ownership. Structures are in place to manage and monitor
the systems. With respect to the inter-bank card system, eight banks have already joined the
system, and others, including large international banks, have indicated a willingness to
participate; the system should be sustainable, but it is too early to make this judgment.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: satisfactory

As mentioned earlier, the project was technically solid and remains strategically relevant
although there were some limitations resulting from the lack of experience in designing this
type of project. The project was designed and reviewed by staff with the technical expertise
in financial and payment systems from the Africa Region and the Financial Sector Network
Anchor. Project preparation entailed a long consultation process which helped ensure that the
solutions took into account the local requirements. The main shortcoming were the
underestimation of total costs and of the time required to procure and implement the systems.
This did not affect implementation as BEAC was able to cover the overrun, and it has not
affected the project justification which likely remains the least cost solution for the
development of the regional payment system. Another shortcoming was in the area of
implementation arrangements; theProject Management Unit and management systems were
conditions of effectiveness, which delayed effectiveness by four months.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: moderately satisfactory

The project was supervised by two task managers; the first task manager worked from the
Country Office in Cameroon for part of the period he supervised the project. Payments
specialists were involved in project supervision throughout the period. The second Task
Manager visited the project every six months and findings were recorded in the
Implementation Status Reports and in Aide Memoires. Supervision of the financial
management and procurement aspects of the project was done by staff from the Resident
Mission in Cameroon; the project entailed procurement of three large systems and required
considerable follow-up by the Task Manager and procurement staff. The financial management
officer commented on audits, but there are no records of financial management supervision. A
follow-up operation was developed as part of the supervision of the ongoing project. The

                                              19
project was technically complex and the focus of supervision was in putting systems in place.
The interim indicators suggested by QAG were not developed; in discussions for this report,
task teams indicated that the only meaningful measures of outcomes were those that could be
obtained at project completion. Task teams worked to ensure that two planned surveys were
carried out, the first was conducted at the beginning of the project (2005 data) and the second
is being conducted now. The January 2007 mission was a midterm review and this could have
been an occasion to review and revise indicators, but the team believed the indicators were
appropriate even if only available at the end of the project. The rating is moderately
satisfactory because it is likely that more support on procurement and financial management
was needed given that BEAC was a new bank client. Also, although recognizing that outcomes
can only be measured at the end of the project, current practice calls for formalizing indicator
monitoring during project implementation.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: satisfactory

Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. A strategically important and technically
complex project was implemented without major difficulties by a Borrower that had no
experience with the Bank, and this speaks to the competencies of the Borrower but also to the
nature of Bank preparation and follow-up. The cost estimate problems of the appraisal report
and the monitoring issues during supervision do not justify lowering the Bank rating.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    BEAC Performance

Rating: satisfactory

Senior BEAC management strongly advocated for the project providing leadership in
advancing the project and ensuring buy-in by all stakeholders. It also provided the resources
required to ensure completion of the main components of the project. BEAC management took
time to understand the difficulties with project accounting (which did not involve fiduciary
issues) but when it understood the problem, it appointed a very qualified accountant. Also,
changes in BEAC's senior management (the Governor and key senior staff have been changed
twice) have had an impact on the project.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory

The Project Unit was headed by a committed BEAC director who remained in charge until the
end of project implementation and managed a complex operation successfully. Staff was
qualified except for the accounting problem mentioned above. The staff of the Unit has now
been transferred to the Directorate of Payments, except for the credit card specialist who has
moved to the Inter-Bank Card management body. There were no substantive procurement

                                              20
problems despite the complexity of the processes, and the bookkeeping errors which were
corrected did not entail substantive fiduciary issues. However, the initial project accounting
problems, problems of continuity and the lack of staff and information at the end of the project
make it difficult to rate the project unit management satisfactory.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: satisfactory

Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. This rating is justified because of BEAC's
leadership and support of the project, and the performance of the Project Management Unit in
ensuring that the complex procurement of the project (which made the project possible) be
carried out.

6.     Lessons Learned

Payment systems are technically complex and can take a long time to implement. The
projects require Bank and Government teams with specialized skills both in designing the
project and throughout supervision. Because of their technical elements these projects can take
time to implement and the Bank norm of four years for project disbursements may be too short.

Projects covering all countries of a regional monetary union are the most efficient
approach to putting in place a payment system. There may also be some advantages to the
regional approach in upgrading payments systems for economic groupings that do not have a
single central bank.

Leadership from a strong regional institution, where feasible as in this case, and
stakeholder involvement are critical to the success of regional projects in general and of
this project in particular. The reputation and leadership of BEAC in the region facilitated the
preparation and follow up of the project and reduced potential conflicts with stakeholders. The
extensive consultation process also ensured buy in by stakeholders.

Payment system projects need to be developed in collaboration with the IMF. The IMF
was involved throughout the design and implementation phase as mentioned in Sections 2.1
and 2.1 above.

The capacity in financial management and procurement should be in place before the
startup of the project. This applies to all projects, but it is particularly important for
technically complex ones and those to be implemented by institutions which have no prior
experience in Bank projects. The delays in putting in place the team at BEAC delayed the
startup of the project.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The summary below provides information on outputs by component and includes the
assessment of outcomes of the three payments systems components.

Project Component 1: Global Project Management

This component output is rated satisfactory. The component aimed to coordinate and
implement the reform process. The GPM was also responsible for providing stakeholders with
all necessary information, communication and training programs. The consultative process
which was established during preparation and which involved national committees and a
regional committee chaired by the Governor of BEAC was maintained during implementation.
This facilitated the sharing of information and ideas and decision- making. Project
management was the responsibility of a project unit at BEAC which subsequently became the
Payments Directorate. The project unit itself had difficulties as discussed in the body of this
report, but the overall project management arrangement calling for extensive consultations
worked well.

Project Component 2: Electronic Bulk Payment System

The results of the EPBS are rated satisfactory. The component comprised the installation
at the regional level and in each country of an electronic bulk payments clearing system to
process bulk transactions generated by all payment instruments (e.g., checks, card, credit
orders). This required that paper instruments be transformed by commercial banks into
electronic data and images before the clearing process. The KPI's for this component listed in
the DCA were:

       (i)    Delays in payment clearing and settlement have been significantly reduced to a
              maximum of three days for bank-to-bank transactions and a maximum of seven
              days for client-to-client transactions and
       (ii)   Transactions among financial institutions and clearing systems are fully
              computerized.

Other indicators in the Project Design Matrix were:
       (iii) use of non-cash instruments increases by 30% after third year of the program)
       (iv) Beneficiaries are satisfied with the new system; use of non-cash instruments
              increases by 30 percent after the third year of the program
       (v)     Improvement in value for money in payment services as perceived by the
              beneficiaries (banks, households firms).

KPIs relating to the speed for clearing of transactions and the electronic linking of banks
and the compensation centers were met. The system began operations in May 2009 later
than initially estimated in part because the installation took longer than expected. The system
has operated without interruptions since its startup. Transactions between banks and the

                                              25
compensation system are done electronically. Most bank-to-bank transactions are cleared the
day they are submitted for clearing but in any case no more than two days after submission.
Regulations call for customer to customer clearance within three days, and most transactions
comply with this regulation (surveys will confirm results). The information on delays has been
provided by the Payments System Unit of BEAC.

The EBPS was introduced in phases, with the first system installed in Cameroon in 2007
and the regional system beginning operations in May 2009 (time of startup by country
given in the table below). Some 378 thousand transactions for a total of FCFA 3.81billion
were made between the start of operations of the regional system in May 2009 and the end of
the year. At the end of 2009, 58 institutions participated: 45 banks; three government
treasuries; three postal savings institutions, and a microfinance institution. Other microfinance
institutions are using the system through participating commercial banks The regional program
began in 2009, bjt, t tYhe compensation system of Cameroon, the largest economy in the
region began operations in November 2007 and non-cash instruments increased by 25 percent
from December 2007 to October 2009 the last month for which data is available (less than two
years), compared to the indicator objective of 30 percent three years after the startup of the
regional program.

BEAC consultations with the users indicate that these are satisfied with the EBPS. This is
not surprising given the results, users have willingly paid for the services; a regional survey is
underway to obtain data on beneficiary satisfaction with the system. Users have requested
periodic training of their staff and BEAC is looking into the design of permanent training
program. The significant decline in the time to clear payments is doubtlessly facilitating trade
and should be particularly helpful in stimulating activities in the region of small enterprises
which had to conduct business in cash. The payments system has expedited payments of
government salaries and of other services in Cameroon, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo
whose treasuries participate in the compensation system. The ongoing surveys should provide
additional information on the impact of the reduction of costs and time for clearing payments.

The introduction of the system required the standardization of financial documentation such as
checks and transfers as well as the introduction of a legal framework (component 5).

Project Component 3: Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)

The expected outcomes of the Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) component
have been met. The component is rated satisfactory. KPIs for this component were. (i) RGTS
system is operational and 90 percent of transactions are settled within 30 minutes. Other
indicators were (ii) transactions volume increases by 10 percent annually after third year of the
program (ii) BEAC has real time visibility of liquidity position of banks and (iii) liquidity of
commercial banks has been centralized.

The RTGS system started operations in September 2007; all transactions are done in real time,
exceeding its objective that 90 percent of transactions be settled within 30 minutes. Virtually
all large volume transactions in the region pass through the RTGS. The volume of operations
increased ten-fold in the first year of operation, from FCFA 16.5 trillion between the start of
operations in November 2007 to the end of 2007 to FCFA 146.5 trillion in 2008 and FCFA 160
trillion in2009 (10 percent increase). BEAC has real time visibility as BEAC has real time
visibility of liquidity position of banks and the liquidity of commercial banks was centralized
in 2006. The system operates every business day, and here have been no disruptions related to
the system since startup. BEAC has set up a backup system which uses SWIFT, the system
used for foreign exchange transactions. Small interruptions have been linked to the
telecommunications and electricity systems, and the RTGS remained operational during March
2008 riots in Yaoundé when Government, BEAC and business closed. The system has 61
participants including 45 commercial banks three national treasuries; the financial services of
three postal services; the Douala Stock exchange, the Central Africa Stock Exchange
(Libreville) and the Office of Government Debt. The treasury of three other countries
participates through intermediaries.

The system has 61 participants including 45 commercial banks three national treasuries
(Cameroon, Gabon and Congo) and the financial services of three postal savings institutions;
the Douala Stock exchange, the Central Africa Stock Exchange (Libreville) and the Office of
Government Debt. The treasury of three other countries participates through intermediaries.
The national treasuries of Chad, Equatorial Guinea and RCA participated through other
intermediaries.
BEAC bills all members who pay a onetime membership fee when they join the system; an
annual quota paid once a year and a user fee every three months which vary according to use.

Component 4: Inter Bank Card System

Inter Bank Card System component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The system began
operations in 2009 and the KPI that the Inter-Bank Card System be operational was met, as
was the indicator that two inter-bank card centers be established. In addition, the institutional
structure for the inter-bank card system was put in place. The central operator (Société
Monétique d'Afrique Centrale) with headquarters in Libreville and the regulator (Office de
Monétique de l'Afrique Centrale) in Yaoundé, Cameroon began operations 2008. The system

                                               27
is at an early phase and the volume of card operations criteria cannot be measured.. Eight
banks are participating in the system. Banks are issuing cash cards which have facilitated
business for small businessmen and enterprises. The prepaid card schemes for water or
electricity are being discussed now.

Component 5: Payment Risk Management System

Payment Risk Management System was not put in place. A small component of the
project, it was to develop a system to collect all information regarding payment incidents for
individuals (US$0.5 million was assigned to it), and no performance indicators were included
in the PAD or the DCA. The system turned out to be more complex and costly than initially
estimated; costs increases were partly due to the revaluation of the EURO during the project
period but it also reflected that the detailed design of the system had not been done before
appraisal. It is being put in place now

Component 6: Telecommunication infrastructure: The component comprised of the
introduction of the telecommunications infrastructure in particular at the sub-regional level, in
order to ensure high-quality, low-cost transfers of data and payment transactions among BEAC
offices and all financial institutions' locations (branches and head offices), and implement
standards and norms to facilitate the interoperability of all payment systems. The investments
and activities planned under this component were inputs into the main systems being
developed under components 2-4. All activities envisaged under the project were carried out
including the strengthening of the VSAT network linking BEAC's national and local offices;
communication links in the six capital cities to connect commercial bank head offices and
BEAC national Directorates using existing landlines. The activities under this component were
financed in their entirety by BEAC.

Component 7: Legal framework. The component would help develop the legal basis for
payments processing, clearing and settlement covering the rights and obligations of
counterparts and intermediaries at all steps in the transaction flow including the methods for
resolving disputes and claims. As in the case of the telecommunication infrastructure
component, legal activities were an input to other activities, performance indicators were not
linked to this component.

The legal basis for the payments system has been set up as expected. The regional Legal
framework approved by the council of Ministers in March 2003 (Règlement
02/03/CEMAC/UMAC/CM) became effective on July 1, 2004. The legal framework
harmonizes national legislation which deals with the payments system and appoints BEAC as
the supervisor of the system. The activities under this component were financed in their
entirety by BEAC.

The 2003 legal framework includes legislation with respect to:

        - harmonization of the regulations on checks
        - establishing a common legal framework for payment instruments such as electronic
          transfers, automatic debits and pre-paid payment cards

                                               28
       - definition of payment systems and particularly of safeguards to reduce their
         systemic risk
       - a regional system to prevent, manage and deter payment incidents

In addition, the Regional Committee on Banking Normalization established in 2003 (Comite
Régional de Normalisation Bancaire), issued regulations on such matters as information
exchange formats, checks, transfers, account numbering systems and CMC7 line formats.

Component 8: Training Program

The training component aimed at strengthening BEAC and commercial bank operators. Most
training was included in the contracts for the systems and was carried out satisfactorily.




                                           29
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

It is difficult to estimate an economic rate of return for a project of this nature, and data that
allows valid comparisons between systems is not readily available. However, the appraisal
premise that putting in place a single system for the whole region is the least cost solution for
the development of the regional payments system remains valid.

Benefits from a modern payments system that cannot be readily quantified include (i) increased
competition among financial institutions which reduces costs, better service to clients and
reduced transaction costs to consumers; (ii) improved efficiency in cash management: a
decrease in payment delays for participating banks and their clients which were involved in a
lengthy clearing process will enable them to use funds that were tied up for productive uses
and (iii) the reduction of risk exposure of the banking community because of the real time
gross settlement system.

The total cost of the two main components was two times higher in FCFA than estimated at
appraisal three times higher in US dollars than estimated at appraisal. This reflects the
devaluation of the US$ against the Euro in the period of implementation and an
underestimation of costs at the outset as there was no precedent for estimating costs for a
payment system linking six countries. The increase in costs resulted in increased BEAC and
private financing for the two main systems. The costs of the card system were lower than
anticipated at appraisal. The financial arrangements call for cost recovery in all systems.
BEAC charges an annual fee as well as a transaction fee for the RTGS and the Electronic
clearing system. The ICR team estimates that the annual payment by participating institutions
for the RTGS system, which has been in operation for more than one year is at present some
FCFA 410 million
