Project\n            for Central Africa aims at improving the efficiency and\n            security of the payment system in the Central African\n            Economic and Monetary Union. The project has eight main\n            components. The Global Project Management component\n            coordinates and implements the reform process, providing\n            stakeholders with all needed information, communication, and\n            training programs. The Electronic Bulk Payment Clearing\n            Systems component manages the exchange and clearing process\n            of bulk payments transactions, including the transformation\n            of paper instruments into elctronic data. Identical\n            electronic clearing systems will be installed in each\n            country. A Real Time Gross Settlement mechansim (RTGS)\n            enables instant and final irrevocable settlement of\n            individual large value and other time criticial\n            transactions, among other activities. The Inter Bank Card\n            System served by a dedicated network infrastructure includes\n            a pre-paid system for the poor in payment for their\n            consumption of water and electricity. A Payment Risk\n            Management System collects all informaton regarding payment\n            incidents for individuals and companies, enabling a better\n            control over unreliable customers' operations, and\n            providing access to critical information to credit\n            institutions and banks. Telecommunications infrastructure\n            ensures high-quality, low-cost transfers of data and payment\n            transactions among all locations. The project also has legal\n            framework and training program components."}, "docdt": "2002-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
