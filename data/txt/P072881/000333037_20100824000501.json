           satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: payment systems are technically complex and can\n            take a long time to implement. The projects require Bank and\n            Government teams with specialized skills both in designing\n            the project and throughout supervision. Because of their\n            technical elements these projects can take time to implement\n            and the Bank norm of four years for project disbursements\n            may be too short. Projects covering all countries of a\n            regional monetary union are the most efficient approach to\n            putting in place a payment system. There may also be some\n            advantages to the regional approach in upgrading payments\n            systems for economic groupings that do not have a single\n            central bank. The capacity in financial management and\n            procurement should be in place before the startup of the\n            project. This applies to all projects, but it is\n            particularly important for technically complex ones and\n            those to be implemented by institutions which have no prior\n            experience in Bank projects. The delays in putting in place\n            the team at BEAC delayed the startup of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
