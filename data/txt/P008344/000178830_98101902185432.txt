REPORT AND RECOiMMNDATION OF THE PRESDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY OF CYPRUS
FOR A FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Electricity Authority of Cyprus with the guarantee of the Republic of Cyprus for
the equivalenI of US$9 million to help finance a project for the expansion of the
Moni generating station by the installation of a sixth 30 MW steam turbo-generator
and associated transmission and distribution facilities. The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including  j years of grace, with interest at 7¼r percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.     A report entitled "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of Cyprus"
(Report No. EMA-41a, dated December 9, 1971) was circulated to the Executive
Directors on December 17, 1971. Basic data on the economy of Cyprus are given
in Annex II.
3.     The population of Cyprus is predominantly of Greek extraction (81 percent)
with the remainder largely of Turkish origin. The relations between the two com-
munities deteriorated in the late 1950's and early 1960's and serious intercommunal
disturbances occurred in 1963. Many Turkish Cypriots resettled in locations with
predominantly Turkish population. These areas have their own administration and
puiblic services and are to a large extent self-governing. Since June 1963, there
seems, however, to be general agreement that the political differences should be
solved through negotiations, and representatives of both communities have met
intermittently to discuss outstanding differences. The continued presence of
United Nations troops helps to provide a safeguard against arny accidental outbreak
of violence, which neither community desires. Recently, differences between the
Cypriot and the Greek Governments have introduced an additional element of uncer-
tainty in the political situation.
The Second Five Year Plan 1967-71
4.     The major objectives of Government economic policy are to achieve rapid
economic growth and improvements in social services, while maintaining internal price
stability and a viable balance of payments. These objectives were the basis of the
Second Five Year Plan (1967-71), which has just been completed, and of the Third
Plan (1972-76) which is in the final stages of preparation. During the past five
years considerable progress towards these objectives has been made.



-2-
5.    The rate of economic growth averaged about 8 percent per year in real terms
during 1967-71, compared to just under 6 percent per year in the preceeding five
years. Sectoral output growth rates attained or exceeded the targets of the Second
Plan, except in manufacturing which, because of delays in some important projects,
increased at about 9 percent per year as against the plan target of 10 percent.
Economic growth has been accompanied by structural change, with employment in
agriculture declining in absolute as well as relative terms, and employment in
industry and services increasing. The rapid growth reflected a high and rising rate
of investment, a rapid increase in agricultural and industrial exports and a
flexible fiscal and monetary policy which stimulated growth but also maintained a
fair degree of domestic price stability.
6.    To attain a viable balance of payments the Government strategy has been to
reduce the dependence on exchange earnings from foreign military expenditures, by
developing commodity exports and tourism. Exports of goods and services increased
at an average annual rate of 12.5 percent during 1967-71 and foreign exchange
receipts from tourism increased by 26 percent per year during the same period.
Consequently, foreign military expenditures contributed only 27 percent of the
total exchange receipts from goods and services in 1971 as compared to over 37 percent
in 1966. However, because imports have increased more rapidly than exports, the
trade gap has doubled during the Second Plan and there has been a deficit on the
current account since 1968. However, foreign exchange reserves have been rising
because capital inflows, mainly private capital, have been increasing.
7.    The labor force has increased at an annual rate of about 1.5 percent during
1967-71, and unemployment has averaged only about one percent of the labor force.
Shortages of labor have been felt largely in higher and middle grade technical
nersonnel and particularly in the construction and hotel industries. W4ith the tight
labor market there have recently appeared stronger demands for significantly higher
wages which could have inflationary consequences. A policy of keeping wage increases
in line with productivity growth, while accepted in principle by all parties, has
proved difficult to carry out.
8.    There has been a significant improvement in social services. Health services
have been strengthened and the number of schools and teachers have increased. Ele-
mentary education up to age 12 years is compulsory and free, and as of this year, the
first three years of secondary schooling will also be free. An increasing proportion
of those completing elementary education go on to secondary education (70 percent in
1966-67 and 84 percent in 1970-71) and participation in technical or scientific
courses is rising.
Development Strategy in the Third Five Year Plan 1972-76
9.    The draft Third Plan (1972-76) proposes to continue the strategy of the
Second Plan. Rapid growth of agricultural and manufacturing production, with
increased orientation to exports, and the expansion of tourism are to be the means of
maintaining a sound balance of payments. The Plan envisages a GDP growth of about
7 percent per year with manufacturing output increasing at an average annual rate of
about 11 percent and agriculture at about 7 percent. To reach these targets Cyprus'
needs for external capital are expected to increase from about $18 million in 1972
to about $55 million in 1976. However, as during the Second Plan, gross domestic



-3-
savings are expected to finance about three-fourths of total fixed investment.
10.   Although future progress could be influenced by the political uncertainties,
a continuation of the present political situation would not preclude further rapid
economic growth, as demonstrated by the record of the last few years.  Shortages of
capital, labor and water are major constraints on growth, and success in increasing
the supplies of these factors and their efficient utilization will be an important
determinant of economic growth in the long run. In the next five years, during the
period of transition under the arrangements for the United Kingdom's joining the
EEC, exports of Cyprus to the United Kingdom are unlikely to be seriously affected,
but in the long run, the terms of association which Cyprus is able to negotiate
with the EEC will have a profound influence on future growth.
Major Sectors
11.   Agriculture is still the largest sector, accounting for about a fifth of GDP,
over a third of employment, and more than half of commodity exports. Agricultural
production, despite year-to-year fluctuations, has increased at about 8.5 percent
per annum during 1966-71, reflecting gains in both crop and livestock production. The
main factors underlying the rapid growth of production were increased exploitation
of the water resources and the diversion of production to citrus fruit, potatoes,
meat, milk and eggs. Government policy has been to maintain a balance between farm
incomes and incomes in other occupations through investment, financial incentives
and subsidies for the diversification of production. Government development expen-
diture on agriculture amounted to 35 percent of total Government development expen-
diture during 1967-71.
12.   The two major constraints for future agricultural expansion are the scarcity
of water and the fragmentation of holdings. The latter hinders the adoption of
modern systems of farming and livestock production, and a law was passed in 1969
to encourage the consolidation of holdings. Land consolidation has begun in a
number of villages but progress has been slow. Scarcity of wfater has become an
increasing problem.  Only about 11% of the cultivated area is irrigated but it
produces about 60% of total agricultural production. Mlost of the irrigated area is
supplied from ground water and the expansion of irrigation in the 1950's and 1960's
has resulted in serious over-exploitation of the main aquifers through illegal
drilling and extraction. Government policy is to develop surface water, conserve
water resources, and replenish overpumped aquifers. The formulation of a master
plan for the control, rational utilization and development of water resources has
been undertaken and feasibility studies for specific projects are nearing completion.
13.   Industrial output has increased rapidly and in 1971 accounted for about
12% of GDP and employment, and about 20% of exports. Industry in Cyprus is largely
private. Government policy has limited itself to creating a favorable climate by
providing incentives and direction through protection, tax allowances, and low rent
in government-owned industrial estates. Food processing industries provide the
major part of manufactured exports. Other light industries manufacturing consumer
goods have been producing import substitutes (e.g. clothing and footwear) but are
gradually looking to export markets as the small domestic market offers limited scope.
The industrial sector is characterized by a large number of small, family-owned,
and at times inefficient units.  Productivity per worker has, however, increased by
about 3-4% per year.



-I4 -
14. Manufacturing industry is regarded as a cornerstone of the policy of re-
structuring the economy and reducing its dependence on foreign military bases and
similar expenditure. Industrial development is expected to improve the balance of
payments, to create employment, and to make possible the utilization of local raw
materials and agricultural products. Fixed investment in manufacturing is expected
to total about $160 million during the Third Plan. The growth of industrial output
is expected to average about 11 percent per year during the next five years as
compared to about 9 percent during 1967-71.
15.   Government policy aims to modernize and rationalize small enterprises by
encouraging the establishment of larger and more efficient units, capable of facing
foreign competition at home and abroad. Greater export orientation of industry is
stressed to overcome the limitation of the small domestic market. A system of
export credits is being considered by the Government. Cooperation with foreign
firms is also being encouraged. Two major constraints on the continued expansion
of manufacturing are labor, particularly skilled labor, and finance.  The domestic
oapital market is little developed, and few 6nterprises are in a pQsition to raise
capzital abroad.
16.   During 1967-71 the number of tourists increased rapidly and tourism receipts
increased from C£3.6 million in 1966 to over C£11 million in 1971. The growth of
the sector is sensitive to political developments in Cyprus and in neighboring
areas. The number of touristswas much reduced in 1963-64 and in 1967, and the
growth rate declined sharply in 1970 when there were local disturbances. In 1971
the growth of tourism was again very high. The Government regards the country's
tourism potential as a major resource and is promoting its development by publicity
abroad and by encouraging the construction of hotels, and the training of personnel.
There is scope for regional diversification of tourist traffic, about half of which
now comes from the United Kingdom.
External Assistance
17.   In the past few years private long-term capital, mainly direct investment,
has accounted for nearly three-fourths of the capital inflow into Cyprus, with
short-term commercial and suppliers credits constituting the bulk of the rest.
Most of the private capital inflow has come from the United Kingdom. In addition
to the Bank, which has provided the largest part of the public capital inflow,
Cyprus has received loans from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Private long term capital inflows are expected to continue to be the main source
of external capital, with loans from international organizations and bilateral
donorsplayingan important, though subsidiary, role.
18.   The structure of the capital inflow is reflected in the relatively small
external public debt which, at the end of December 1971, amounted to about $39
million (excluding undisbursed). Just over half of the debt was owed to the IBRD,
about 24 percent to the United Kingdom and 14 percent to Germany. The debt service
burden is low, the debt service ratio being about 2 percent; including private
debt, this ratio would be in the order of 5 to 6 percent. In the light of its
economic performance and low external debt burden, Cyprus is creditworthy for con-
tinued Bank lending.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS INT CYPRUS
19.   The present total of Bank lending to Cyprus is $39.5 million equivalent
(net of cancellations), of which $35.4 million was outstanding on April 30, 1972.
Three loans totalling $22.6 million (net of calcellations) for power development
were made to the Electricity Authority of Cyprus, one in each of the years 1963,
1967, and 1969. A loan of $11.5 million for a ports project was made in 1969.
Two loans totalling $5.4 million were made in 1971 for sewerage projects in
Nicosia and Famagusta. Performance under all these loans has been satisfactory,
and there are no outstanding problems. Annex I contains a summary statement of
Bank loans as of April 30, 1972, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.   In concentrating its lending on the provision of infrastructure, the Bank
has sought structural and institutional reform to relieve the constraints on
further economic development. Through the power loans the Bank has assisted in
the consolidation and expansion of the Electricity Authority. Improvement of port
administration and operation through the creation of a National Ports Authority,
now underway, is the objective of Bank lending in this sector, and the recent
creation of sewerage boards was an important element of the two sewerage projects.
21.   The Bank's major objective in Cyprus continues to be to support structural
reform. Given the sectors covered by previous Bank operations and the size of
the economy, the following are likely to be the remaining areas in which the Bank
can expect to encourage reforms:
(a) to provide assistance to improve agriculture, in particular through
more effective development and utilization of the limited water resources. This
assistance might include projects such as the Paphos Irrigation Project, which is
under preliminary consideration, and would be one of the largest irrigation
projects in Cyprus;
(b) to help improve the availability of long-term finance for tourism and
industry, through the expansion and strengthening of financial institutions; and
(c) to provide infrastructure upon which future economic development will
depend, including the development of a balanced highway investment program in
connection with a proposed loan for roads in FY 1973.
22.   The Bank has one other loan under consideration for Cyprus in FY 1972. This
is a proposed loan to the Cyprus Development Bank, Ltd. which has already been
negotiated, and is expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors simultan-
eously with the loan proposed in this report. These two loans would bring the
total of Bank lending to Cyprus this year to the relatively high level of US$ 12
million. However, only one loan of about US$ 4 million is envisaged for FY 1973
and the average annual lending over the next few years is not expected to exceed
US$ 5 million. This is not an insignificant amount considering the small size of
the econory and taking into account the difficulty Cyprus has in raising long-
term finance for development from other sources.



- 6 -
23.   As yet IFC has made no investments in Cyprus, although it has had project
identification missions in December 1971 and March 1972. IFC is currently
reviewing an expansion project by the Cyprus Cement Company (Limassol). Several
hotel projects have been brought to IFC's attention, and these are being studied
with the assistance of the Cyprus Development Banlc.
PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
24.   Consumption of electric power has been increasing rapidly with the growth of
industry and tourism, and with the improvement of the standard of living. Con-
sumption increased at an average rate of 6.2 percent per year during 1961-1966.
The Second Plan projected demand to increase at about 9.2 percent per year in
1967-71, but the actual growth has been about 14 percent per year. A successful
rural electrification program has been carried out and the number of villages
with electricity has increased from 96 in 1960 to 316 in 1966 and 512 in 1971.
Because power consumption has increased more rapidly than expected, investment in
generation and transmission during the Second Plan has been nearly G£10 million as
compared to the Plan target of C£6 million.  During the Third Plan, three addit-
ional generators of 30 MW are expected to be installed (including one which will
go into operation this year), the transmission and distribution networks are to be
strengthened, the program of electrification of rural areas continued and the
quality of service rendered to the consumers improved. Total investment is
planned to be C£15 million during 1972-1976.
25.   Cyprus has no known deposits of fossil fuels and, being semi-arid, has no
prospects of hydroelectric power production on a commercial scale. Only pumped-
storage peaking plants can be envisaged for the future, in connection with some of
the dams under construction or planned to relieve the island's pressing water
needs. Nuclear power generation is not a practical alternative, on account of the
small size of the system.
26. The expansion of the power sector will continue to be based on thermal
generation using imported fuel for the foreseeable future. Until now the
Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) has been free to buy fuel oil in the open
market, but a domestic oil refinery will soon start operating near Larnaca, with
a fuel oil production capacity of 220-230,000 tons per year. The Authority will
use about 210,000 tons of fuel oil in 1972, increasing to about 295,000 tons in
1976. The rest of the country now consumes about 50,000 tons. Hence, the
refinery will not have sufficient capacity to supply all the country's needs.
Starting in 1973 the Authority will be required to buy from the refinery all the
fuel oil it can supply. The price expected to be paid to the refinery in 1973-76
averages only 7 percent above that for 1972 and does not significantly affect the
Authority's operating results. It is expected the Authority will buy the balance
of its fuel oil requirements in the open market.



- 7 -
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.   For almost a decade the Bank has been assisting in the consolidation and
expansion of the Cyprus power system in order to provide the infrastructure upon
which future economic development will depend. In September 1970, EAC requested
that the Bank assist in financing its 1972-1976 investment program. An appraisal
mission visited Cyprus in January 1972 and negotiations were held in Washington in
May. The Borrower's delegation was led by Mr. S. Anastasiades, Chief Engineer
and General Manager; the Guarantor was represented by Mr. T. Theophilou of the
Ministry of Finance.
The Borrower
28.   EAC was created by 'Law in 1952 "for the purpose of generating, supplying,
promoting and encouraging tne use of electricity". It is governed by a Board
consisting of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman and five members, all of whom are
appointed by the Council of Ministers to five-year terms. The Board appoints the
chief executive officer of the Authority or general manager. The management of
the Authority is competent and experienced.
The Bank Project
29.   The project proposed for Bank financing is part of EAC's development program
for 1972-76 and consists of:
(a) Expansion of the Moni generating station with the installation of a
sixth 30 MW steam turbo-generator similar to the existing units fin-
anced with previous Bank loans; and
(b) About 45 percent of the Authority's transmission system and about one-
fourth of its distribution investment through 1976.
30.   A report entitled "Appraisal of the Fourth Power Project - Electricity
Autbority of Cyprus - Cyprus" (PU-93a, dated May 11, 1972) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as
Annex III.
31.   The total estimated cost of the project, including contingencies, is $11.9
million equivalent, of which $9.0 million represents the foreign exchange component.
The proposed loan would cover the foreign exchange costs which account for 76 per-
cent of the cost of the project. Of the Authority's total investment requirements
during 1972-76, estimated at C£40 million, the Bank would finance 26 percent by
means of the proposed Bank loan (21 percent) and the balance of Loan 649-CY (5 per-
cent). The remainder would come from internal cash generation (65 percent), and
customers' contributions (9 percent).



-8-
32.   The Authority invited tenders in 1971 in accordance with the Bank's Procure-
ment Guidelines, for a 30 MW unit to be financed entirely by the Authority and
installed at Moni as unit No. 5 and, at the same time, for an option on a second
30 MI unit (Moni No. 6) to be exercised within six months of the contract award
for the first unit. Since the Authority intends to exercise this option, part of
the proceeds of the proposed Banlc loan would be applied to the foreign exchange
component of unit No. 6, including civil works, boiler, and turbo-generator.
33.   The remaining works of the project will also be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. EAC is
exempt from customs duties, and bids are evaluated on a c.i.f. basis. Except
for the engagement of consultants, no contracts will be awarded nor will options
be exercised for the components of the project before the loan is signed.
34.   Disbursements will be for the foreign currency costs of imported equipment,
materials, and services only. No retroactive financing is proposed. Disburse-
ments are expected to be completed by mid-1976.
Financial Aspects
35.   The Government has made five loans to EAC totalling CF7.9 million, which
vwere provided from the proceeds of public bond issues. Subsequently the Govern-
ment decided to consider the proceeds of these issues as a form of equity con-
tribution to EAC and while it pays full debt eervice on them, it charges only the
interest to EAC. Under the first twro Bank loans, the Government agreed not to ask
for repayment during the life of the Bank loans. This provision will be repeated
under the proposed loan and is a condition of effectiveness. EAC's financial
situation has improved in the last few years and the Bank informed the Government
and EAC at the time of the third loan that it would be prepared in principle to
approve a schedule for repayment of the Government loans which would be consistent
with the maintenance of a sound financial position by EAC.
36.   The balance of EAC's equity (C£6.7 million) consists of retained earnings.
Long-term debt, other than the three Bank loans, consists of loans from the
Government and Barclays Bank, and the outstanding balances of which, as of December
31, 1971 were C£7,000. These loans wiere talcen over from local authorities at the
time their plants were transferred to EAC.
37.   The Authority's financial position is satisfactory.  Its major problem is
its inability to gain access to the Turkish-Cypriot areas for the purpose of meter-
reading. Therefore such consumption has not been billed nor have any collections
been made since 1964. The annual revenue lost is estimated to be running currently
at about CO350,o00, or 6.5 percent of annual billings. In spite of this, project-
ions show that during the period 1972-76 earnings produce a return of over 9 percent
on net fixed assets in operation, and internal cash generation would cover debt
service more than twice.



-9-
38.   The only significant difference between the past loans to the Authority and
the proposed loan lies in the tariff covenant, which, under past loans, required
that the operating ratio be no more than 68 percent on a three-year moving average.
Although the Authority will not meet the terms of this covenant from 1972 onwards,
its forecast financial performance is acceptable both in terms of its ability to
finance the proposed expansion program and the return it will earn on its assets.
Since a tariff increase is not required from the viewpoint of cash generation, the
tariff covenant for EAC will be changed to conform to the standard covenant for
electric power projects by expressing it in the form of a rate of return on net
fixed assets in operation. EAC should have no difficulty in meeting the proposed
rate of 9 percent.
39.   The installation of a sixth 30 I'W unit at Moni is the most economic way to
meet the projected increase in power demand. The extensions to the transmission
and distribution systems are required to supply new loans, to maintain adequate
voltage levels after the expected load growth, and to provide a reasonable
reliability of supply. That part of the Authorityts 1972-76 investment program
related to the installation of Moni units 5 and 6 and associated transmission and
distribution system expansions will have an economic return of slightly over 10
percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.   The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Electricity Authority of
Cyprus, the draft Guarantee Agreement betwieen the Republic of Cyprus and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for power projects.
h1.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMWEIDATION
42.   I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Performance under all Bank loans to Cyprus has been satisfactory.
Disbursements have been delayed in only one instance (the Ports Project), and
this was due to a dispute between the contractor and the Government involving the
contractor's claim to foreign currency payments in accord with his bid estimates
without submission of evidence of actual foreign currency payments. We have been
assured by the Government that this matter will be settled within the first half of
1972. Construction, however, has remained largely on schedule.
