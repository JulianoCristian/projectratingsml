The Bank's performance was responsive,\n            flexible, and, pragmatic, supporting a critical phase of the\n            transition reform program. However, had the implementation\n            schedule been more realistic, the program might have\n            achieved better results. Furthermore, the project design was\n            flawed by including too many areas of reform for a single\n            operation. On the other hand, the borrower made sustained\n            and committed efforts to implement the program, but\n            inadequacies in staffing and organization, and, weak\n            ineffective laws and regulations, hindered success.\n            Nevertheless, the program was instrumental in supporting the\n            creation of a capital market, in close collaboration with\n            other donors, and legal regulations were promulgated to\n            strengthen the National Bank of Romania (NBR). The key\n            lessons show, that although the Financial and Enterprise\n            Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL) properly focused on financial\n            and economic fundamentals, particularly trade\n            liberalization, privatization development, and fiscal\n            balance restoration, the design of the project was overly\n            ambitious, suggesting future operations to focus on limited\n            reform areas. A high level counterpart group should design\n            and monitor implementation, build up country ownership, and\n            ensure a realistic implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
