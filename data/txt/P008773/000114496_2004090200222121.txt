Re:  The Export Import Bank of Japan Untied Loan:
                  Amendments to World Bank Loan Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to discussions among Romania (the Borrower), the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and The Export Import Bank of Japan.
The Bank is pleased to inform you that the Loan Agreement for the Financial and 
Enterprise Sector Loan between the Borrower and the Bank dated January 19, 1996 
(3975-0, 1, 2-RO), is amended as set forth below.
Section 4.01 is amended to read as follows:
“Section 4.01.  Pursuant to Section 6.02(1) of the General 
Conditions, the following additional events are specified: (a) 
a 
situation has 
arisen which shall make it improbable that the Program, or 
a significant part 
thereof, will be carried out;
(b)
subject to subparagraph (c) of this paragraph: (i)  the 
right 
of the Borrower to withdraw the proceeds of any loan made to the 
Borrower by The 
Export Import Bank of Japan for the financing of the  Project shall have been 
suspended, cancelled or terminated in whole or 
in part, pursuant to the terms of 
any such loan agreement, or (ii)  any 
such loan shall have been declared due and 
payable by The Export Import 
Bank of Japan prior to the agreed maturity thereof; 
and
(c)
subparagraph (b) of this paragraph shall not apply if the 
Borrower establishes to the satisfaction of the Bank that:  (i) such 
suspension, 
cancellation, termination or declaration is not caused by 
the failure of the 
Borrower to perform any of its obligations under such 
agreement; and (ii) 
adequate funds for the Project are available to the 
Borrower from other sources on 
terms and conditions consistent with the 
obligations of the Borrower under this 
Agreement.”
A new Section 4.02 is added as follows:
“Section 4.02.  For the purposes of Section 7.01 of the General 
Conditions, the following event is specified pursuant to paragraph (h) 
thereof, 
namely, that the event specified in paragraph (b) (ii) of 
Section 4.01 of this 
Agreement shall occur, subject to the proviso of 
paragraph (c) of that Section.”
Please confirm the Borrower’s agreement to such amendments by signing, dating 
and returning to us a copy of this letter.
Sincerely yours,
/s/ Kenneth G. Lay
    Director
    Team for Romania
