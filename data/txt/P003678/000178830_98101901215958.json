main features of the project are:\n            (i) the expansion of capacity of the local telephone service\n            by the installation of automatic switching equipment to\n            provide 5,400 additional subscribers' lines together\n            with cable network and associated facilities; (ii) the\n            extension of the long distance service by installing radio\n            systems and carrier equipment to improve interconnections\n            between the main population centers and to provide services\n            to remote islands and rural areas not being served\n            presently; (iii) the expansion of telex exchanges by\n            installing about 90 teleprinters, and of international\n            services; (iv) construction of buildings and provision of\n            miscellaneous facilities; and (v) consultants' services\n            for procurement."}, "docdt": "1975-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
