There\n            are four key lessons learned from this Youth Development\n            Project (YDP): the first has to do with the relevance of\n            continuing to work with youth as decision-makers in fragile\n            contexts; the second has the importance of conducting\n            targeted analytical work (possible even in a relatively\n            short period of time) to inform design.
