                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although there are still some shortcomings, both implementation progress and the likelihood of achieving the project#s development objectives continue to improve. Training and
                         capacity building have enhanced the performance of government agencies and selected youth centers, and helped increase the participation of youth in local development initiatives.
                         To date the project has supported 274 small-scale community sub-projects identified and implemented by youth groups, to provide life skills trainings, rehabilitate youth centers,
                         construct small infrastructure, and promote livelihood activities and opportunities.
