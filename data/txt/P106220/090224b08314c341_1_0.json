In the absence of a concerted\n            effort to provide opportunities for youth to engage\n            meaningfully with communities and government in national\n            recovery and development efforts, the risk of youth\n            marginalization from development and civic life would\n            persist. The Youth Development Project financed by World\n            Bank supported the government\u2019s efforts to address the\n            social, economic and political factors that led to the\n            social instability. The project operationalized the National\n            Youth Policy, implemented by the secretariat of state for\n            youth and sports to work with youth groups, organizations\n            and youth centers, and support youth initiatives. Youth for\n            Local Development was implemented by Ministry of State and\n            Administration and Territorial Management facilitating the\n            participation of rural youth in community development\n            activities and local development processes and to distribute\n            small grants to youth in rural areas."}, "docdt": "2010-03-28T05:06:02Z"}
