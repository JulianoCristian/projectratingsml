The project will finance: (i)\n            upgrading of squatter settlements; (ii) provision of\n            affordable serviced residential plots; (iii) credit for\n            self-help housing improvement; (iv) construction of\n            community facilities; (v) development of serviced land for\n            business activities; (vi) provision of facilities, equipment\n            and technical assistance to improve municipal services in\n            the project cities; and (vii) studies for the preparation of\n            new urban development projects. About 66,000 persons in the\n            urban poverty group, representing 39 percent and 57 percent\n            of the urban poor in Meknes and Kenitra, will benefit\n            directly from the project. Improved municipal services will\n            benefit about 70 percent of the urban poor in the project\n            cities. The primary risks relate to the need for adequate\n            staffing of the project implementing agencies in order to\n            monitor, supervise and coordinate project implementation,\n            particularly in view of the relatively limited experience in\n            Morocco with beneficiary selection and cost recovery for\n            this kind of project."}, "docdt": "1980-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
