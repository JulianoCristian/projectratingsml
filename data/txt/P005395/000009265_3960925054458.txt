SECOND pRlND   I~NE PROJCT (OA  1944-r)
PROJECT COMAPIETION RPR
1.       The Second Urban Development Project achieved the objective of
improving the housing conditions of 160,000 slum inhabitants in Kenitra and
Meknes. It also brought broader housing issues to the forefront and helped the
- Kingdom of Morocco develop a new housing policy. After reviewing the project
objectives, this report describea the implementation process, whereby special
attent,on is given to In8titutional, as well as cost-recovery aspects. It'also
-draws lessons on project.sustainability and GON's housing policy.
2.        Project objectives (paras. 3.1-3.24 were (a) the improvement of the
housing conditions of a total population of 160,00 low-income people in Neknes
and Kenitra through the uigrading and, the construction of sites and services;
(b) the\deve1opment of small-scale e onomic activities to offer job opportunitieo
to local dwellers; and (c) the impi ovement of Kenitra's and Neknes! municipal
management, aiming at enabling the municipalities to deal with th. new project-
born districts.
3.       The assessment of the overall project performance indicates that: (a)
the physical objectives of rebabilitating 130 ha tf slum ares and producing
6,400 servZced plots were essentially met; (b) 289 sites for small and medium
enterprises have \been developed and commercialized; (c) housing construction was
carried out only'., with the beneficiaries' own resources rather than with the
-project provided credit facilities; (d) fhe implementation of cost recov y
mechanisms Was behind schedule; and (a) the development of municipal services
has not yet been completed. Moreover, as a result of the incomplete municipal
component, non use of\ credit facilities and shortage of counterpart funds,
project cost was 25X less than initially envisaged.   This, combined with
depreciation of the US dollar and pobr management of Bank withdrawals, retulted
in the use of only one thir4 or $9.8 million of the original loan amount (US$36
million)\(paras. 4.6-4.8). \
4.        During the implementation, the organizational arrangements defined
during project preparation were successful.' However,-whereas the local teams
of the Ministry of Housing efficiently managed the physical and social aspects,
other factors, such as 'the Municipalities and the local Credit Unions (hAnAui
-ftalaire, or BP) were only marginally iuvolved (paras. 4.2-4.5). This situation
had a negative impact on infrastructure maintenance and cost recovery. Moreover,
the Sank reorganization and other chang4s in task management considerably
undercut the supervision effort.

5.       While cost recovery (paras. 4.9-4.14 of the 81um upgrading, and sites
and services componnts have been successful insofar as the 10X dovn payments
from beneficiaries are concerned, monthly dnstalments hare not started yet in
Kenitra and repayments are poor in Neknes.  This is due to dhe low colmitment
of BPs and their collection practices, which failed to take into acount the
particular behavioi of slum inhabitants.   By the same 'token, BPs have not
suceeded in proviing construction material loans (para. 4.6) to slum dwellers;
and, he beneficiaries of serviced plots, because of their inability to reach out
to such an unconventional clientele, as well as\ their rigid mortgage regulations.
It is worth noting that, although these financing facilities have not been used,
bhquslng construction is progressing rather fast on allocated plots, Iwhich shows
the' creditworthin4ss of beneficiaries.
6.        Project sus\tainability (paras. 4.26-4.28) is being jeopardized in two
ways:                      -
a. infrastructure--ias been dam4ged by the high, level of
construction' activity  and 'needs  rehabilitation  and
maintenange from the municipal services, which will require
enforcement of local taxation.
b. Through  the, preject,  what, were  once poorly  serviced 
A  districts have become new cit;ies,\ but still city-level
k security, education and health facilities, which fall ;\iner
the purview of the Centrtl Government, are lagging behind
schedule.                            .
7.       Ti  housing policy of GON benefitted from the ptL_iect and new slum
upgrading projects are underway in various cities (paras. 4.24-4.25).   The
implementing teams were trained, either through the first urbaei development
project or-through this one. The costs are to be recovered from beneficiaries, \
who lack access to long-term credit.  Even though slum households have proved
their creditworthin"ss by the construction activity on their plots, they are
still'considered uncreditworthy by banks.  Lending to them contitues to be an
issue.                                 X

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART Is PROJECT REVIEW FROM TEE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.        Project Identity
Project Name:       Second Urban Development Project
Loan No.:           1944-MOR
RVP Unit:           EMA
Country:            Morocco
Sector:             Urban Development
2.1       When the project was launched in 1980, 25X of the Moroccan urban
population lived in squatter sottlements and the most affordable government-
funded housing units were beyond reach of 50X of the urban population. Urban
policy objectives in Morocco were:
i)      to rehabilitate the squatter sqttlements, and provide
the sites and services for low-income housing;
li)     to mobilize the saving capacities of t~ie households to
be relocated and promote an efficient intervention of
the municipal agencies concerned in the provision of
urban serv*ces to newly developed areas.
This  strategy had already been successfully  applied in the Rabat Urbahn
Development Project (Loan 1528-NOR).
2.2       To implement its urban policy, the Government of Morocco relied on \the
regional de3lgations  of the ffinistry bf Housing  (MOB).    Seven regiotaal
development and construction agencies (ERACs), established in 1974, assisted KOH
in this task. More recently, the Government has entrusted the Ministry of
Interior with the responsibility for urban planning, and has created a new
agency, Agence Nationale de Lutte Cont*e l'Habitat Insalubre (ANLHI), to improve
services in slum areas and develop low-cost housing for slum dwellers. Financing
of low-income housing is provided by aue  X2Maare (BP) and Credit Inmiobilier-
et Hgtalier (CIH) through a low- and moderate-cost housing program referred to
as .,1itabtion Bon-Magh6 JHBM)-. 
2.3       At project start up, the macroeconomic  context of Morocco was
gharacterized by:
rapid dvmographic growth (exceeding 3X p.a.) and urban
growth (4.6X p.a.);
A~~~

c \ ii)  a heavy country indebtedness resulting from ambitiowus
lnvestme t program, which started in 1975 and were
followed by' a declint of Moroccan export prices, in
particular phosphate in 1977, and a quick increase of
oil iEport price in 1979; and
iii)    an adjustment program launched in 1978,  thich
contributed to reducing Inflation from 12.52 p.a.
in 1977 to 8.31 in 1979, the balance-of-payments
deficit from 222 of GNP in 1977 to 141 ii)l978, and
the public defici$'from 17X to 11  of GNP.
The above m,acroeconomic context constantly affected project implementation. D"
to fiscal etisis and contraction of social sector public expenditures, the
program suffered from lack of adequate counterpart funds..
2.4       The project was supposed to contribite to macroeconomic policy by
enhancing the mobilization 4f low-income households' savings for housing and by
creating jobs through providing serviced land for business activities. II
addition, the municipal service component was aimed at improving the.sffici.nci
of public expenditures.
2.5      The project was designed as a larger-scale replication of the Rabat
UrUan Project and took.into account its implementation troubles.  The concept
of sluSI upgrading and sites a-nd services had beetr successfully used during the
first project and was repeated in the project.  Because poor management had
hampered the implementation of the first project, project appraisal focussed
heavily  upon  adequate  local  management,  which  became  a  condition  of
disbursement.
3.      -Ptiect Objectives and Ds fiution
3.1       The project objectives were to:
i)     upgrade housing, Improve basic services, and create
employment opportunities for the low-income population
living in.the slums of Bordj Koula* Omar, Ain Chebik,
and Sidi Baba in Meknes, Saknia, Bouchtyne, asid Path in
Kenitra; and
ii)     improve municipal services of )eknes and Kenitra.
The five project compononts were the:
i)      Slum Upgrading Program. This component included provision of
secure  land  tenure  an4  of  basic  off-  and  on-site
infrastructure lto the 81,500 slum residents of Meknes and
Kenitra;

- iii)    Empgoymuent Generation Program.  Egch project city was to be
provided 'with' serviced  ,led  for  small-scale  business
'activitils supporting 2,270 jobs;'
iv)    Itprovement of Municipal Services.  This component included
provision of equipment -and tecbnieal assistance to develop
ounicipal services in the cities of' Meknes and Kenitra; and
v)      Studies for the' preparation of new urban development projects.

4,l       Although physical implementation was qulte successful,' cst recovery
and Jtnfrastructure maintenance started slowly and must now be stren&thpned. In
these areas, useful lessons are to be) drawn for ihe fut6rb of this project as
Wall-as- for urban policy. After a general review of project management, this
section deals with tho slum upgradLng and sites and services programs, focussing
on cost recovery and housing construction flnancing.   It also reviews the
employment generation, and municipal services components and co cludes w,ith the
rellicability and sustainability of this project. " -
Project manae8ment
4.2       Although the institutional set-up, as defined in the Loan Agreement,
was successful, finAncial management was too weak. This resuited in slow loan
disbursement.   The Project Technica4 Units and the Housing Buteaus of the
Provinci4 Housing Delegations (DRHs) of Kenitra and Meknes efficiently managed
the sites and services and the'slum upgrading worls, as well as plot assignment
and self-help constructLon follow-up. -The Runictjlity of Kenitra haschad the
municipal technical center built and has been operating it since 1986. This
:municipality is curreutly preparing its Sewerage Master Plan, and i8 taking over
the sewerage networks of Saknla and Bouchtyna,.  The Municipality of Mek,nes is
currently building its municlpal technical center and i's taking over the
sewerage ne vorks of Sidi Baba and Bordj Moulay Omar; this municipality has
taken a large part in plot assignment in slum-upgrading areas.
4.3       The Provincial Project Steering Committees of Kenitra and Meknes were
successful *n their effo*ts to coordinate the impleme a ng agencies.  These,
committees were supposed to be assisted by permaneng project coordination units.
However, they considered that the work of the. 4p:  ent units would overlap with
that of the DRHs; onsequently, these units     aie never put into servLce. The

aggravated by external factors,-such as budgetary difficulties of GON, as well
as a rapid appreciation of US currency (+1502 between 1980 and 1984).
4.4      The'appraisal report had established that the municipalities would
participate in the developmei,t of the infrastructute for sites and services and
slum-upgraditig areas, Althou h the Project Technical Units were the executing
agencies.  Their participation has been marginal and hap not prepared them for
taking over the infrastructure. The resultant delay in Infrastructure transfer
has adversely affected the periodic maintenance.
4.5       BCP did not fulfill its role either.' Acting as a cashier, it cashed
the down payments that were calculated by the Housing Bureaus for the sale of
serviced plots but did not lend to householdsJfor the acquisition of building
materials as provided in the Loan Agreement. BCP has started receiving monthly
installments "from Meknes beneficiartes but does not 'manage the beneficiary
accounts and does not get the Xupporting docum,ents required for the
redisbursementv oi these funds to the Treasury. A clearer definition of BCP's
role at the beginning of the project, including a better remuneration,for its
services and possible san,tions for non-collection of dues,  would have
contributed to a more effident operation,

Loan disbursement
4.6      Although  ,most  compontnts  were, completed  'during  the  projfect
implementation perio#, final loan'"disbutsement represgnts only 27X of the
initial loan .emount. This results mainly from the rapid appreciation of,the USW,-<-
dollar versus tb&"dirbam during project inplementatton.   The a-,erage exchange -
ate for disbqrsement was 2.3 times as high as the' appraisal exchange rate;
i.e., DH 8.78 instead of DH 3.8 for USO  l.lBecause the entire disbursement was
made against local expenses, its dollar amount was accordingly, reduced.C  Loan
amount,was reduced by #11 millio-a in 1985, by $5 million in 1986, and by $5
-million in 1987. Finally by *he loan account closing date (Februaryt10, 1989),
65.5 million remained u*disbursed.    i'
4.7      Also contributing to cost- underruns were cancellation of some
components.  For instance, the building materials component was Rot implewented
nor was funding for the preparation of new projects made from this loan. This
reduced the amoynt to be disbursed in dirhams by 17%.
4.8      D*ring implementation, difficulties,related mainly to the scarcity of
budgetary resources led to,a reduction of the originally prpjected disbursement
by,,another 20X in dirhams.  Because the project was inadequately funded by GNM,
the project management delayed its payments to contractors and reduced component
scope.  In 1985, the project became eligible'forlthe Special Action Proam and
sthe -i-bursement 'perentage was raised from 15% , to 75- for civil works;
'mreo-'er, the closing date was postponed to July 31, 1987, then to July'-3i,
1988.' Although these measures alleviated the project's financial difficulties,

by the Bank loan re1ative to'local costs otherwise eligible for disbursement.
Cost recovery
4.9   '; The cost recovery system for the sites and services and for the
upgrading operations aims at recovering the total cost of land acquisition and
on-site equipment. Its implementation indicates a high rate of unpaid debts,
which is caused more by an inappropriate organization than by the lack of
beneficiary' creditworthiness.
4.10   V In Kenitra and Meknes, the sale price for plots and core units
(cel1ules enbryonnaireI) corresponds to the actual expenditures.,  In the
calculation of this price, the'off-site infrastructure costs (financed with the
municipal buidgets), program managpment costs for the Housing Delegation, and the
financial cost, have been omitted, even though there i\ a margin that could
cover a large portion ~f these costs. The total cost for land acquisition and
development is estim#ted at DU 89 million for \Kenitra and DH'159 milliotk for
Meknes '(including operating costs for the Housing Delegation, estiiRated at,51
of the infrastructure 'costs and the financial cost, estimated at two yearv
Interest on thk total expenditure). The total sales price is DH 87 million in
Kenitra and DH 162 million in Neknes.
4.11      The recovery should ,have been done by BPs within a framework,
including a 10% down .ayment iat plot assignment and the payment of the
outstanding balance on the standard HBM conditions, (i.e. interest at 7X p,a.  \\
including a 1X spread for BP, maturity of 20 years).  In Kenitr&, down payments
of 10 have been',requested, 161 of which concern recently allodated plots and
have set to be received.  The down payments requested in Meknes amount  to DH
1,500 (reprea\enting 121 of the sales price)\in thie slum upgrading program and
DH 6,009 (representing 251 of the sales price) for the core units in the sites
n"d services progra^.  These have been regularly collected.
4.12.    The collection of the monthly installments\has been less successful.
In' Meknes, BCP starts" co-lectingn monthly installments when the plot is
allocated; the management of the b4neficiaries' accounti is handled'by the DRH.
Because the delegation has been unable to follow-,up closely on these operations,
for which it does not have the means, the rate\of unpaid debts is relatively.
high.  The collectidn of monthly installments has not oven started in Kenitra, \
'lthough the first plots were allocated in 1984. In both cases it is necessary'
tb straighten ott the situation before tb size of the u  aid amounts will male
any recovery imp~ossible. - '
4.13     'The beneficiaries' repayment capacity is puat in a conspicuous position
by thip importance of. new conatruption that has iaken place\during the past two,
years o' the sites, e      ven though the loans for the acquisition 'of building'
materials have not been implemented. Numerous.two-storeykhouseb have appeared,
which represent an investment of several thousand dirhams per square' miter.
Beneficiaries' income from renting or selling part of 'the houses or plots
enhance this repayment capacity. \  ,    .

4.14      While off-site infrastructure has been financed from the municipal
budget, the exemption of the nremier 4tablissement tax prevents municipalities
from recovering the expenditure from the beneficiaries. The maintenance ofi the
street networks and sewerage systems and the garbage collection are the
municipalities' responsibility. -Their costs are usuall3 recovered ithrough\
resideits' taxes, which have yet to be implemented because lUnd titles have not
been issued to the beneficiaries.
4.15 " Concerning business activities,  plots buyers  have  had  to pay,
installments while infrastqucture works were going on. Even though buyers did
not benefit from loans beeause BPs have not implemented them as originally
planned (801 of the purchase price at 101 interest for a 10-year period), plot
allocations and their payments to DRH are being made under normal conditions.
Construction financin  '     '
4.16      The constructLon material loans that have been fo\,eseen in the Loan
Agreement have not been implemented by BCP. The arguments put forward are:
a)      land securities and mortgage guarantees do. not exist;
k b)      househoxlds are uncreditworthy, because they have no regular
income; \and
c)      the age, of some \beneficiaries does not conform with HBN
regulatizns (i.e.  the reinbursepent of a loan has to be
completed upon reaching the age of'61).
Even though such loans do not exist, the construction on the plots advances at
a fast pace\ This leads to believe that in addition to the shove reIssons, BCP
has been reluct'Snt to lend because of the' high cost of 'reaching to and
collecting fiom the envisaged beneficiaries.  This was likely caused by the
iimni d remuneration for its services agreed upon with the Government.   -
Employment Genekation program                 I
4.17      In Kenitra, 261 plots (with an average area of 320 a@) were developea
and sold to small-scale enterprises.\ One-third of them are being cons   ctd
ind entail such activiti4s as tapestry-making, boiler-making, and the productiOn
of concrett blocks.  In Meknes, 28 plots (with~ an average area of 1000 n') have
beep developed. Although it was initially plsained, ODI, *hich was supposed to
promote industrial development in the project areas, did not take a part in thii
prograuR. However, this has not had any negative effects on t~he iwlementation
of this\component.
\4.19      Services have, sti)l to be made available for the urban\comimunity of
Saknia, whose population ranges from 60,000 to 80,000 inhabitants. It has been
agreed to reserve plots alotig the main streets. Due\to the unavailabili#y of
land in Bordj Noulay Omar, the same procedure could not be used.

\%.19   InVrastructure works and plot development activities have contributed
to creating job opportunitites.  The transformation of slums into well-serviced
urban  districts  vith  good-quality  houses  is  now  contributing  to  the
establishment of -business"t and ser\#ice activities.
X xunicipal Nanagement
4.20      The municipal \technical'center of Kenitra has bee,n operating since
1986.  Its establishient\\apd the acquisition of material for garbage collection
and the maintenance of the sewerage systems have improved the organizat.on of
the municipal technical services and helped them'make a more efficient  ase of
the rolling stock.  In keknes, the construction of the municipal technical
center, which should have been financed  by the Bank loan, could not been
completed due to procurement delays.  Completion of the remaining work with
f1pancing from the Municipality is planned.
4.21      The street networks and sewerage systems of Saknia, S4di Saba, and
Bordj Moulay Omar have been seriously daaged by the' construction works-- and
Several years  lack of maintenance, caused by their late transfer from the
municipalities. Although. the, Municipality of Kenitra is'inadequately equipped
to manage the sewerage network and especiafily. the electromechanical equipment
of the pump-house, the transfer of the dtainage system  to RAK, which was
\envisaged in 1980, has noli-yet been performed.
4.:2      The Sewerage Master Plan for'Kenitra, whtch bad been postponed for a
level of the last four years, finally started in 1987, and is almost couplete.
Due \to the high level of the water table, it proposes a unitary watertight
network with supple joints. \To carry out this option, it will be necessary to
rehabilitate the Saknia-Bouch\tne'sewerage network.      .              .     \
*     4.23       In Mekries, a study on the organization of the accounting procedures
anJ the improvement of collections has been carried out -but fts recommendations
,have not yet been applied. The computerization of the Municipality's accounting
svstem is under way.    .                                   ' \
Replicability of the Project
4\.4      Following up on thp First, Ui*an Development Project (Rabtt), this
project has greatly striength#   'thfMoroccan approgah to adre4sing the shortage,
of housing for the low-income populaticn.  Through both projects. teams were
created and are operational.  Informal housing development is now recognized as
a \proper ans*er to the housing needs of iow-income population.   Adjusted
standards for the rehai4litation of these neighborhoods have been designed and
are implemented.. The use of householdsI savings for housing construction has
produce# dramatic results as soon as the street networks and sewerage ,.ystemn
were upgraded and land tenure legally establis4ed.
4.25      On these bases, two pto'jects. in Kenibra, Souk es Sebt and Ouled
Oujie)h, are under preparation with ANLMI.  They\include 3,400 plots (2,200'ar~d
1,200) and will allow for the gradual reduction of these two slum areas and of
N '
i  N 



some smaller disseminated slum areas. Siilar projects are being prepared in
Meknes. These projects d4o not ptovide for loans to buyers. However, such loans
will b6eomz more. and more necessary as lower-income ho4seholds, as additional
resources, such as the sale .or the renting of part of a dwelling, become more
difficult to mobilize.
Project Sustainabl3ity
4.26 \   The smooth development of the slum upgrading and sites and.services
areas requires:
i)      an efficient management of the maintenance of the street
networks and the sewerage systems and
ii)\   the provision of urban services adjusted to the population of
the districts (60,000.\to 80,000 in Saknia and Bordj Moulay
Omar).
4.27      The services, which have been built up under the proJect, have been
'mpaired by the housing construction works and inadequate miaintenance.  Their
behabilitation is necessary; this reha6tUitationas well as routine maintenance
should be financed through the municipal taxes that are not being collected.
4.28      Not all ihe public services and corresponding infrastructure foreseen
at project appraisal have been provided. Schools in Kenitra and police stations
it both cities have yet to be planned.
5i     sOns &aU from the oroiect
v.l      Although the project is not yet completed and project benefits may not
have fully,surfaced, lessins can already be drawn~ fromn the differences between
the definiiion of the project at appraisal and its actual implementation. These
relate to: (a) the unased building material loans; (l the role of the core
units; and- () the 'difficulty in coordinating project components.
5.2      Uustd building material loans. Lending to low-income househalds is
costly and requires' specific skills and arrangements.  Although low-income
households have demonstrated their cred4tworthiness through an impressive
construction activity on their plots, they generally do not meet the criteria
set by mortgage lender,. Moreover, because loan amountp are small, the cost of
administering them is very high; this makes this type of lending not attractive
to financlal institutions. The above considerations hin;r using banks for this
type of Lending.   Alternative solutions to promote family and community
financial assistance should be sought. However, it is noteworthy that, although
the building material loan c mponent has not yet been implemented, construction
activity1is already impressive; consequentl)  a'project concentrating only on
land tenure security and plot servicing is fully justifiable. \

5.3      Role of te core nit. The conept                   sevced plots wLth
a core uiLt, including.a basic room with toilet facilities, was developed to
yensure sminimum habitable space to the poorest plot benificiaries
-and lot them-build theirwboue at whatever pace  hey could affrd financially.
The core units, tomver, have been less w eful than expected at. appraisl.
Whil'8 Saknia's bineficiaries took advantage of them for furthe* housing
cotrucflono, in Meknes nothing but foundatiin was kept from core units at the
start of construction.   Thi8 suggeitt  that simple  foundations provide an
adequate start for housing construction. Moreover, dq~e to construction patterns
and standards widely spread among contractors, housing construction homogeneity
is quite sufficient.    \
5.4      Dtfficulty In coordinating project  _omponents.  Coordination among
DRHs, the municipalities and the technical ministri)s proved difficlt during
project implementation. This did not produce negative effects so far as schools
an. health facilities were conceTned, although some facilities are yet to be
buitt.. However, because the municipalities will ultimately be in cbarge of
infrastructure maintenance, better coordination is ndeded.
6.  .
6.1       For the successful completion of  hc projett and the achievemenpt of
its objectlves, the COX should:
i?     accelerate completion of the land acquisition by GOI;
Li)    establish a task force within BCP to recove; the artears inm
monthly installments and set up an appropriate remuneration;
iii)    review the procedures for the provision of construction
material loans to thie plot beneficiaries who. still have to
i        ,  construct their houses;

now housing districts (school in Saknia, in particula*);

v)      finance the completion of the civil works (municipal technical
center of Meknes, street networks and sewerage systems in
Meknes); and
vi)    introduce a taxation polict geared to financing infrastructure
\maintenance in the new disitricts.

\  Erolect C96iition Report
Being aware qf the deficiencies in the low-cost housing program, the
public authorities adoted a new integrated housing strategy at the end of, the
1970s. This strategy atms at upgrading the slum and integrating it into the
urban structure in order to enable the target population to access basic pu41ic
services, benefit from the social services, and improve its income.
The 1rban Development Project of Meknes, which is a part of this new
strategy, has not yet been completed, therefore an evaluation of its impact is
premature. However,  it is appropriate to examine and report on the extent to
which th  Project orientatLon and impetus in its present magnitude satisfy the
defined objectives.
According to 1979 statistics, which were used as the basis for the
preparatory work of the Project,, 20X of the city's 360,000 inhabitants live in
the slum area.
In 1981, the delegapion )conducted a household iurvey in Bordj Moulay
Omar (BMO) and Sidl Baba, tlhe two areas targeted by the Project.  Table 1
indicates the demographic results of, \he survey.

Located in the nqrther  part of the city, BN0 in the northeast ani
Sidi Baba 'in the northwest, the sld areas' surface amounts to 58 ha. - Sixty
percent of the population, or 48,186 inhabitants livi in the inner uxban
perimeter of the city (see map)\   \
The slums' location offers several advantages in that they have access
to maln rvadi and are in the icinity of primary ihfrastructure. The sheds with
a suface of'20 to 120 sqm-are either built in straight blocks, such as Douar
Jdid in Bordj Moulay 0a, Douar Jdid in Sidi Baba, or irregularly, suoh as Ain
Chebik in Bordj-.Moulay Omar, and Douar lakdim in Sidi Baba. The roads Are narrow _
and ln most cases, their\ width dois not exceed 2m1  Rocks in the BMO area
represent an important prodlem for the area.

Within the framework of this slum structure, the Urban  )evelopment
Project was designed to solve the probleus created by BMO and Sidi Babs.
I.        Project &ontet
The Project was destgned to Include four princ.pal elements:
- a rehabilitation program,
- a sites and services program,
- th: improvement of the municipal services,
- the job creation and job\ improvement. N
A.        Rehabilitation *ogram              -
-This plement constitutes the provision of basic on-site and off-site
infrastructure for thb residents of the two slum areas to pnhance the residents'
opportunity to construct their own houses within their financial means.
The improvements made by this project element can be described as
follows:                            -
(1)   . lo -  \
When the prein     pro ect study decided on the definition of the
plots according to the existar layout of the reas with minor modificatiois of
the present structure, it was possible to modify the plots with a surface of, less
than 40 sqm. The physical and social constraints have led the technical unit
of the Delegation to revise the rehabilitation plan as follows:
- widen the lxisting narrow streets by 4m,
- provide a dorrect alignment to the surface to be rebabilitated,
- decrease the quarters'-density in the spatial iield to
have a miniwm plot size of 50 sqa,
- modify the existing structures.
Thus, the 'mwbez of serviced plots falling u-ner the rehabilitation
element of the project is indicated in Table II.

(2)      I,suance of Land Tite
-   ile the Project foresees the implementation of iadividual plot
ownership and the issuance of land titles, the effort can only be partially
accomplished. As a matter of fact, the' project's land base has not yet been
totally acquited and the technical cadastral files can only be established
according to t4oe advancement stage of the eelf-coustruction, which is difficult,
'in view of -the development of a concrete, gheral' plan 'for the 'rehabilitation.
Thus, the transferable and saleable land,- which  re*ults from the
demarcation of each plot, can only be. specified, once the self-constru4tion has
been completed and cadastral files have been established.

(5)      Grantig of Cgo_GructiLn Loans
The  Project  envisioned  the ,granting of construction  loans  to
beneficiaries to improve their housixi, the pedestrian streets or the
rehabilitation of covmercial facilities.
The average loan value amounts to DU 3,500.00 and is based upon the
construction work cost for a toilet and a 12 sqm room.
The delegation has initiated several meetings with the implicated
organizations in order to define the required procedures so that the
\benafictaries can take advantage 'of this loan. The documents for the loan file
Are
-  an administrative certificate signed by the bous.ng delegate
and the provincial services,
a a photocopy of the beneficiary's indLvidual file,\
-  a declaration of the benoficlary rogarding the monthly
\payments lequired for the plot acquLsition (the declaration
is draftqd by the housing office),
- a siEsrid and ;Xegalized doclaration of the financial
-cesi6irces of the beneficiaries working  tho informat
sector.                  .7-                   e
A selection committee was formed that is responsible to review the
loan files -submitted by the beneficiaries.  It met once to examine about ten
files, among which only one file was accepted that f64filled the construction
loan requireients and the monthly payments related to the acquisition.
Since then, the bank has not followed up on the filt that was accepted
by the committee.



The preliminary study found that, with the exception of the enlargement
of the primary school, additional commmnity facilities in BMO and Sidi Baba were
not required.  As a matter of fact, the enlargement of the school wax completed
at the end of 1934. However, the committee took the initiative to develop
certain plots and had the following community facilities built:
a cultural center in BO, whose construction has been completed;
-  a cultural center in Sidi   a, whoo s construction has been completed;
*   *  a house for women in BMO, whse construction has not yet "een started;
-  a mosque in Sidi Baba, whose construction has not yet bXen started.
(7)      Afm1Ltrative Buildi&ngs
In BMO an administrative building has been constructed for the Projoct
management and others, who provide assiatance to the beneficiaries whose living
areas are to be renovated. Within the rehabilitation element, other buildings
for administrative use were completed in MO, i.e.:
-  the Cgadat' headquarters In 8MO,
-  the National Promotion headquarters in BMO,
an agency of the BCP,
.  a post office (planned).
B.       Sites and services  pam
The sites and services program entails two roles, namely
t the relocation of households affected by.,the demolition or
the eff*rt to lower the area's populatiottdensity,
-  the relocation of households living in small- or medium-
0 sized slums tbat will be eliminated.
The Urban Development -Pr6ject plannd -for the sites and services
program to cover a aurface of 46ha in Sidi Baba and Ain-Chebik.
The locati i of the sites isnd services, which are in the vicinity of
the  slums  concerned,  were  chosen  because  of  the  available  off-site
infrastructure and easy access to roads and urban transport facilit*ps.    V

The execution of this project element was modified as indicated hereafter.
Sidi_ ..b'
t\ur zones of 27,309 m2 for commercial activities were developed so
that servicid plots of 600 to 3,000 m2 for 22 industrial units could be
developed.                      N
A business zone covering a surface of 7,151 m2 was created.  S x
industrial units ire planned for the service4 plots, which range from 600 to
2,800 m2.
According to the specifications submitted by the beneficiaries of the
industrial units, about 150 Jobs per unit will be created.
Thus, 28 enterprises locate4 in the business zones will offer 4,200
jobi in the short run.
This teLd was allocated to investors who committed themselves to
implementing the specifications" program.
D.        (unicipal service Improvement program

It canl   noted that three stems, namely:
\   -    the rehabilitation of BMO;
-  . the sites and services in Ain Chebtik; and
-    the sites and services in Sidi Baba
exceeded the estimated cost for the following reasons:
-    the cost for land acquisition was higher than initially
estimated;
the  amount  of work  incteaaed  (extension  of main
-    collectors, design. study incomplete);andt
the work was not -comploted on time due to. social
probletne *which,arose on the site (delay in clearing the

B.   P.uanc.ng
The Project was financed by the Moroccan Government and the World Bank.
The World Bank loan represents 501 kof the total cost with an interest rati,of
9.25X payable in 17.years.
'The funds of the Moroccan Government were. added ti the Woild Bank loan
and allocated to-the following executing age.cies of the Project:
in the fo6m of budget allocation to the
Ministry of Housing;
Ministry of National Education;
Ministry of Public Health; and
\   Ministry of *outh and Sport..
in the form of fund \transfers to the Banque Centrale Pipulaire for the
granting of construction loans to the beneficiaries;
-    in the form of a loan to the Municipalities for the financing of off-sit
infrastrtcture works, the construction\of a municipal technical center,\
and the acquisition of vehicles and equWpment, and consultant services.
C.   Implementation schedule
\The Project's construction w rks were planned\for.a 4 1/2 year-perLofi.
Annex 1 shows that \the different project elements were not implemented on tiM.
As a matter of fact, certain basic public equipment work have not yet been
completed in areas where self-construction is not available. Other additional
infrastructure work have- to be done in areas where self-construction is
possible.

-24-    ,
The delay is\caused by:."
-        the goeration method.  The Project planned an operation adjusted to
exigting structures which did not require modificstions; technical constraints
(nar,ow streets),\ as well as social constraints (inhabitants requested regular,
relatively large plots) forced the technical setvice of the Delegation to revike
the rehabilitation plans that caused additional work.
-         the infrastructure dslgn stdies.\\ The studies were incvmplete as far
athe kn E edge about the sewerage system and the required work were concerned.

A.        Cost recovery
ThWe Staff Appraisol Rep9rt envisaged that 751 of the total Project
cost would be direOtly recov~ered b3 the beneficiaries' payments in form of ppot
utilities; 91 would be recovered by the Municipality, and 161 would be recovered
by the Government.
The recovered cost. would be used for the development and servicing of
housing and industrial plots and would comprise the following: \
-  land acquisIFion       -
-  on-site infrastructure,
office'construction for.the housing offices..
-  project planning and supervision,
-   interest during construction,
minor off-site infrastructure works for drink water supply.
Nu-nicip4l  expenditures  cannot  be  directly  recovered  by  bth
beneficiaries.  They relate ito off-site infrastructure costs and costs for the
improvement of municipal services. National budget expenditures are charged to
the state and are designed for municipal equffipment.

However, when ithe-demolition for the clearing 1of the infrastrdcture

'rhe alloation comission epnsequ.ntly revised the fi a   L str cture
for the cost recovery (Table XII) to solve that problem, which hampered the
infrastructure works.                                            -
The Staff Appraisal Report envisagad a cross-subsidy between the sites
and services program and the rehabilitation elmuent.  The reduption in the
implementation of plots/sites and services and the relocation of the househoAds
affected by the demolition and thet effort to reduce the population density has,
however, conpiderably decreased thS number of sites and services plots that were
planned to be commercialized according to Whe market price. Only some plots in
Sidi Baba were sold to ERAC C/S.
-                       . e Rehabilitati    me-beneficiaries of the rehabilitation element make
a down payment amounting to 1,500 DX. Their monthly paynent is based on the
plot size and in madi over a period of 20 years with a 7X interest' rate (see
Table XIII).         l                               -

EVALUATIONA EPORT a  IEUN MMDEVRMETPJECfT OH ERaA            M
Within the political framework to giadually reduce the slum areas, an
urban development prograw was launched in Saknia-Rouchtyne, which is located in
the eastern part of the 'ity. The program aims at creating a decent housing
situation for the low-income population living in the city's most populated aeea
of the city.
Concurrently, and  cq<rding to the diretives of His N4jesty, the
King, a comprehensive and ambitious commercial 4evlopmeut, prgram was lannched,.,
to create a maximum numbet' of job opportuntties.
The Urban Development Project concerns a large part of the southeast
extension of Kenitra, whose borders are in the East with flooding areas, in the
West with the Ain Seb4 route, and in the North with low cost plots.
The prQgr4'8 sgoals are to solve the housing crisis in thii. part of
the city an& to fight against the progression of the Saknia slum. The Project
is composed of three principal elements.
I     i  (a) Rehabilitation,.
(b) Sites and Services, and
(c) Development of Business Property.
A.        Rebabill  tion
This element refers to the slum of Saknia wiLti a popula tion of 40,000
people.  The project consists of providing the slum with a road network and
other systems, transferring land to the inhabitants, and constructing municipal
facilities, sucwh as mosques, hammams, and ovens.  A total of 6,129 plots fall
under this project element.                     .
B.        Sites and Services
The sites and. services element refers to the relocation of the
Inhabitants of Saknia, as vell,,as those of other slum areas of the city. "the

The area should be provided with third category commerci~l land. The
operation's goal is to move harmful activities away from the cty's center, and
\ to create employment opportunities in the Saknia region for the sites and
services' and slums' population.\ The commercial property is located at the Ain
Sebaa route and easy to access.' Two hundred sixty-one plots of 100 to 2,00Q

With DH 36,727,921.97, or 701 of the total cost, the World Bank has
financed the VRD equipment.
Various  organizations  have  participated  in  the  operation's
ImplementatIon. The local authorila was responsible for the population transfer
and the upholding of order throughout the different stages of implementation
stages.
The Municinal Council was responsible for the management of the road
network, sewerage system, And the household garbage disposal.  The arsbitects'
association des4ned and supervised construction plans until project completion.
Also various training sessions were organized to ensure reliable and strong
self-help copstruction.
The srvice des domal    supeivised the resolution of legal problems
regarding the acquisition of plots.   And,  last but not least,  the' main
organization in this operation was the technical housing service, the program's
pillar, which directed the project implementation.
All infrastructure works have been completed.
There \s a-\ slight delay in housing construction, caused by the
ben;ficiaries'  limited  financial means.    Horever,  some of this housing
construction has already been co6pleted.
With the  rof job opportunities, this Project has caused a
change in the economic' field. The Urban Developpent Project hbs created a major
construction site, where the building process advances steadily\,
Thus, the Urban Development Project has assured the economic rise of
the ~ector, which had once been con,idered a marginal dormitory zone.

Socially, the low-income population has moved towards a more st&ble
situation and h4s concentrated all of Its efforts on escaping from a dead-end
situation.
This Project has enabled the creation of, ihat was previously almost
non4existent, soclo-cultural facilities and commercial centers, thereby Changing
the area's image.
Upgraded housing has allowed inhabitants access to a better quality
of housing and commercial development has created long-term jobs for the
inhabitants, especially for the slum inhabitants.
As concerns the industrial areas, according to the Governor's.
instructions and decisions of the Project Commlttee, it has been decided to vary
the plot size ranging\from'100 to k,000 sqm, so that different activities are
possible. T14e development of this area has been realized within the framework
of the SGMA, prefinanced by the beneficiaries.
The Urban Developm nt Project has enabled savings acc¶unt holders to
fiund'small enterprises in keepLng with to4ay' s requirements. A high p percentage
of beneficiaries belong to the working class with low and inconstant icomes.
Since this class represents a large share of the population, the revenue per
capita is one of the lowest in the city.
The city has tR provide the sector's nektessary eans to'ensure its
harmony and well-being; if it does not do so,' social tasiop will appear ln the
most populated areas.,     \
As for the drawbacks of the project, the following elements should\\be
considered for the deslgn of a similar project:  one household per plot,
whatever the family relationship; a tecent survey;, the plot distribution and
configuration,' as well as the various necessary plot equipments have to be
reexamine4, whatever the population living t)ere. It has to be done according
to the texts,and laws in fo*ce and the plot area should be uniform for all the-
beneficiaries.
As for the systems, it\bas to be mentioned that the streets are not
paved and during the ralny season, sand clogs up the sewerage system.
If the experience is repeated, a better coord.nation between the
authorities and the population has to ts~e place\to decidL on the outline and
direction of such an ambitious pr,oject. Some pitfalls could have been "o4ded
if the p6pulation's desires had been taken into account.
However,  the project i8 'a s WcCess,  slnce  it has definitively
eliminated an insalubrious housing a ea and 'reated better living conditions for
a very important part of the   pulation.

The present cost recovery amounts to 102 of the total amount before
the beneficiary starts the coiatruttion.  -The remarinder is staggered over a
poriod of up to 25 years, Wihich is determined by the benefLeiary.
According to the procedure, the monthly 'ecovery of the remainder is
mado by the Banque PopulaLre vitin a 20-year period.  One of the convention's
conditions is that the age limit' for the recovery of the last monthly payment
is 61 years, whereas ihe majority of the teneficiaries is older than 55 years.
This, they cannot take advantage of this recovery solution.
The sales plot price amounts to DH 120 per sqm for slum upgrading and
sites and services areas and is equal to the land acquisition and development
cost. Compared with State development programs, this price is very lo*. T4is
results  from:  the housing high  density,  the  fact\ that  only  necessary
infrastructure has been implemented, and the fact that 80X of the land was
either in provincial, ot municipal ownership.
The works were performed under very satisfactory conditions due to the
fact that in most of the cases the study respected the existing development.

This calculation concerns only the sites and services and the slum upgrading
components. They represent 912 of the proj ect cost. The difference between
appraisal and final estimates comes from:.
- higher costs (+ 132 alnly land acquisition in Meknes) and
- a smaller number of plots (-172) due to physical and social tonstraints
reveale4 by detailed design studies.
