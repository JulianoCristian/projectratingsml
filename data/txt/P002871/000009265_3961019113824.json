     to the Republic of Togo. SAL IV objectives were to increase\n            economic growth to more than 4 percent per annum by 1992,\n            limit inflation to 3 percent or less, reduce the current\n            account deficit to 7.7 percent of Gross Domestic Products\n            (GDP) by 1992, improve the Government's financial\n            situation, and improve the delivery of social services.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were\n            as follows: a) signs of commitment to reforms ; b) limits of\n            SALs as an instrument of reform; c) need for a comprehensive\n            approach to public resource management reforms; d)\n            supervision of SALs; and e) relations between Togo and the Bank."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
