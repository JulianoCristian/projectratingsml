to: increase\n            real GDP growth to more than 4 percent per year by 1992;\n            maintain inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, at around\n            3 percent per year; reduce the current account balance\n            relative to GDP; develop social services with an emphasis on\n            access by the least favored groups. To achieve these\n            objectives, the government will implement an integrated\n            program of macroeconomic and structural reforms. At the\n            macroeconomic level it will reduce the fiscal deficit\n            relative to GDP. Specific structural reforms include: (a)\n            improvements in public sector management through a detailed\n            program of organizational reform of the three key economic\n            ministries and the development of a civil service employment\n            strategy over the medium term; (b) integration of social\n            considerations in policy formulation through the development\n            of new institutional mechanisms and technical instruments;\n            (c) reform of the public enterprise sector through\n            divestitures and the enactment and implementation of a legal\n            framework giving greater autonomy to public enterprises; and\n            (d) promotion of human resource development by rationalizing\n            delivery systems and budgetary allocations. The foreign\n            exchange provided under the credit will be used to finance\n            essential imports."}, "docdt": "1990-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
