The project will result\n            in three broad categories of social and economic impacts\n            which require mitigation: loss of assets; loss of livelihood\n            or income opportunities; and collective impacts on groups,\n            e.g., loss of common property resources. The people likely\n            to be affected in the first two categories will be surveyed\n            and registered, and project monitoring and evaluation will\n            compare longer term impact against baseline socio-economic\n            data. For the third category, mitigation and support\n            mechanisms will be collectively oriented, and the monitoring\n            will focus on the impact on such groups."}, "docdt": "1999-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
