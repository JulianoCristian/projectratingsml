Of Bhutan’s rural population, 42 percent live more than one-hour by foot from the nearest all-
season road–and half of those live between a half-day to a three-day walk from such roads.
These isolated communities depend on animals and people to carry loads and have poor access
to medical care and post-primary schools. Transportation costs in remote areas are between 50
and 70 times higher than in areas with motorized transport access. The high transportation costs
keep farmers from diversifying crops or growing marketable crops, cause damage to perishable
crops taken to the market, and limit availability of extension services, thus impeding farming
output and income.




- Construction of eight new priority feeder roads (total length of 129 km) in five of Bhutan’s 20
districts, where isolated rural communities had to walk one to three days to reach all-season
roads or markets, schools, health clinics, hospitals, district headquarters.
- Technical assistance to support the introduction and implementation of environmentally friendly
road construction (EFRC) practices in rural road construction and maintenance.
- Institutional capacity building of both public and private sector.




3,771 households have been provided easier access (about half-a-day walk) to all-season
roads and important socio-economic places in five districts. Travel time to important
socio-economic places and transport costs have both declined by around 75 percent.


Highlights:
- 28 percent of the total 13,500 households (40 villages) that are in need of all-season road
access in these five districts were connected by the new feeder roads.
- Most beneficiaries now use motorized transport services, rather than portering or animal
transport for taking goods to and from markets. Transport costs have been reduced by 75
percent.
- Economic activity has improved: many shops have opened in the project areas and residents
do not need to travel as far to purchase essential commodities. Representatives of the rural
credit agency now make monthly visits to connected villages to collect and process credit
requests.
- Residents of connected villages pay only 4-14 percent more for locally-traded goods than at
the town market, while residents of control villages (not connected by roads) pay 14-30 percent
more than at the town market.
- Farmers have started purchasing new tools and new seeds to diversify their agricultural
produce from mostly cereal and rice to high-valued vegetables, cash crops and fruit trees which
are in higher demand than cereals at the neighboring markets. On average, income from the sale
of agricultural produce has increased by 64 percent.
- School enrollment has increased in villages now connected to non-community schools by
roads.
- Medical supplies and food rations are now delivered on time right to the door of the basic
health units and schools. Ambulances and cars are now able to transport sick patients to district
hospitals.
- Villagers can now use motorized transport to carry heavy construction materials, which mules
and porters are not able to. Many houses, school and health unit buildings are under renovation.
For example, banana leaf roofs are being replaced with corrugated galvanized iron sheets, water
standpipes and latrines are being installed.




- Total project cost was US$14.78 million. IDA contributed US$11.33 million, the Royal
government of Bhutan US$2.45 million, and the Netherlands US$1 million.
- IDA enabled the introduction and implementation of environment-friendly approaches in road
construction and maintenance. EFRC has now been adopted as a national policy, including in
the forest and agriculture sectors.




A follow-up Second Rural Access Project will continue this work. In addition, it will support scaling
up of community-based maintenance contracting in other districts. A socioeconomic impact
monitoring study will be conducted to monitor the progress and outcomes of the project.
