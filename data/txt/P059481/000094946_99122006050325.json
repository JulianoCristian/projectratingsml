The project will also\n            help strengthen institutional capacity for implementing\n            environmentally friendly approaches to improve rural access,\n            community involvement in rural roads selection and\n            management, an improved infrastructure maintenance. There\n            are three project components. The first builds new priority\n            feeder roads and includes site preparation, earthworks,\n            drainage construction, and road monitoring. The second\n            component provides the Division of Roads (DOR) with\n            necessary equipment, computers and accessories, survey\n            equipment, and vehicles for immediate project implementation\n            and supervision support, and in the long run to strengthen\n            the technical and institutional capacity of DOR. The third\n            component comprises six sub-components: Project management\n            assistance and training; environmental and social assessment\n            studies, which are required for all road constructed under\n            this project; the introduction of a LACI-(Loan\n            Administration Change Initiative) type format, and the\n            funding of experts and related hardware and software; feeder\n            road maintenance planning; the socio-economic evaluation of\n            completed roads; and pre-investment studies for a follow-up project."}, "docdt": "1999-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
