 Synopsis

     In the past, Colombia faced urban transport problems that significantly lowered the quality of life of
     urban Colombians. Starting in the late 1990s, the Programa Nacional de Transporte Urbano helped
     transform Colombia’s urban transport system. The approaches under this program are now considered
     international best practice and have been replicated by cities around the world to address their
     transportation challenges.
