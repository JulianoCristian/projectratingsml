Public transportation in Colombia was\n            traditionally perceived as inefficient, unsafe, and\n            polluting. The streets of Colombian cities were crowded with\n            obsolete buses which operated with disregard for public\n            safety and in near chaos, without organized bus stops. In\n            1996, the government decided to create the Programa Nacional\n            de Transporte Urbano supported by International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) financing. The program\n            centered its strategy on the development of Bus Rapid\n            Transit (BRT), which achieves urban mobility at a fraction\n            of the cost of rail systems. The most famous BRT system is\n            Bogot\u00e1\u2019s Transmilenio, conceptualized in 1998. Each day\n            close to 1.4 million passengers, approximately 27 percent of\n            the city\u2019s public transport demand, benefitted from the\n            Transmilenio in Bogot\u00e1. Riders of the two other complete BRT\n            systems, Megabus, Pereira and Mio-Cali, have significantly\n            improved their daily lives, benefiting from an organized,\n            regulated, modern, and reliable public transportation system\n            that utilizes a modern fleet and less polluting fuels. Since\n            its inception, delegations from more than 20 countries have\n            visited Colombia to learn about the program. Similarly,\n            multi-city transport programs were being developed in other\n            countries such as Mexico and Argentina with direct IBRD\n            involvement and there had been a significant collaboration\n            and sharing of knowledge between Colombia and other\n            developing countries."}, "docdt": "2010-02-24T09:00:03Z"}
