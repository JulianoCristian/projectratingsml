It\n            will also assist the Government to define policies relating\n            to population and family planning and nutrition. Moreover,\n            in support of the sectoral reform program, the project will\n            improve the efficiency of priority health programs: (i)\n            maternal and child health care including family planning,\n            control of malaria, diarrhea and other communicable\n            diseases, (ii) health education and community initiatives in\n            health and nutrition, and (iii) training of health personnel."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
