The objective\n            of the project was to assist the Borrower to improve the\n            performance of its public health sector through: (a)\n            adoption of appropriate mechanisms for investment planning\n            and recovery of costs; (b) design and implementation of\n            policies in the fields of population, nutrition, maternal\n            and child health care, and control of communicable diseases\n            including, inter alia, malaria and diarrhea; and (c)\n            implementation of training programs for health personnel.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were\n            as follows: (a) the need to decentralize sector management\n            and administration and integrate more fully programs and\n            services through the creation and support of health\n            districts; (b) the need to strengthen capacity in strategic\n            management and management of resources; and (c) the need to\n            identify and utilize more fully the existing potential of\n            the various stakeholders and contributors to health sector\n            performance. Project achievements in capacity building and\n            in the mobilization of resources will contribute to ensuring\n            the sustainability of this and future interventions."}, "docdt": "1996-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
