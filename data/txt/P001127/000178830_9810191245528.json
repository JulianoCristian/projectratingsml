It would consist of three\n            agricultural production components aimed at both increasing\n            marketable foodcrop production and testing new farming\n            systems; a large applied research and field trials\n            component; and an infrastructure component (improvement of\n            rural roads and water supply). The project would also\n            include a component at the national level aimed at\n            strengthening the Government's planning capacity in the\n            agricultural sector. There are technical risks that the\n            research would not yield acceptable results, socioeconomic\n            risks that the population would not be responsive to\n            changes, and commercial risks due to the remoteness of the\n            area. The research, training, and rural roads components\n            included under the project are designed to alleviate these risks."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
