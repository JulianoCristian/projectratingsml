The project achieved its objectives,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, for a project of an\n            experimental nature, flexibility in implementation and very\n            effective monitoring and evaluation systems are essential to\n            adapt to changing circumstances and capitalize on unforeseen\n            opportunities. Second, farmers' adoption of riskier\n            technologies requiring the use of modern inputs depends on\n            the quality of the proposed technical package and\n            availability of reliable, remunerative marketing outlets for\n            their increased production. Third, public agencies cannot\n            compete with private operators in the marketing of\n            agricultural produce and should not attempt to do so.\n            Fourth, modernization of agriculture through investments\n            requiring credit can only be undertaken if cash crops\n            provide the necessary income and there is an adequate\n            mechanism for credit recovery. Fifth, sociological surveys\n            are essential for assessing farmers' attitudes and\n            constraints. Finally, the proper maintenance of rural\n            infrastructure requires full collaboration from beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "1992-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
