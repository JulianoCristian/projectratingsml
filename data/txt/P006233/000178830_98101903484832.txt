APPRAISAL OF THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Ca4PANHIA FORCA E UJZ DE MINAS GERAIS (CFIMG) 1"
SUMKARY
i.        Companhia Forca e Luz de Minas Gerais (CFIMG) has applied to
the Bank for a loan of U 5$6.3 million equivalent to help finance the
rehabilitation and expansion of its transmission and distribution systems,
excluding interest during construction. The project is estimated to cost
US$11.7 million equivalent.
II.       The project consists of the rehabilitation and expansion of the
transmission and distribution system for the tlhree-year period 1966-68 2/
Rehabilitation of the present system represents about 20 percent of the
total cost. The remaining costs are allocated to the construction of
35 km of 138 kv transmission lines, installation of a new 138/132 primary
substation of 40 MVA capacity and expanslon of the distribution system
11i       CFIMG is one of ten companies acquired from the American &
Foreign Power Company (AMFORP) in 1964 by Centrals Eletricas Brasileiras
(Eletrobras), an autonomous agency of the Brazilian Government. Eletrobras
has retained the same management arrangements that were in effect under
AMFORP' s ownershLp.  CFIMGt s operations are satisfactorily managed and
it should be capable of supervising construction of the project
iv.       The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance the cost of
equipment, materials and supplies procured under international competitive
bidding, and the foreign currency cost of engineering services. Awrards
would be made after internatlonal competitive bidding with participation
by qualified domestic suppliers who would be granted a 15 percent prefer-
ence. Satisfactory arrangements have been made for Eletrobras to provide
the balance of funds required to finance OFIMG's program.
v         New decrees issued late in 1964 allowed for the first time the
periodic revaluation of assets for tariff-making purposes. Tariffs were
increased in 1965, and in June and November 1966 following the revaluation
of assets. Arrangements have been made in connection with the proposed
loan to ensure that satisfactory tariffs will be obtained in the future
by CFIMG.
VI        The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$6.3 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years including a grace period of five years.

BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
COMPANHIA FORQA E LUZ DE MINAS GERAIS (CFLMG)
I. INTRCDUCTION
* 1.        Centrals Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras) an autonomous
agency of the Federal Government, purchased ten electric utility companies
in Brazil from the American & Foreign Power Campany (AWORP) in November
1964. The systems were then in urgent need of rehabilitation and expansion
and a five-year program covering the period 1966-70 was prepared in order
to supply existing and prospective demand. In response to the request of
Eletrobras the Bank has agreed to consider loans aggregating the equiva-
lent of approximately US$60 mllion to assist financing of the expansion
program over a period constituting three years of the five-year expansion
program. In accordance with the Bank's preference to lend directly to
the operating entity carrying out the project it is proposed to make
separate loans to four of the largest of the campanies, located in the
south central region where Bank-financed power generation projects are
concentrated.
2.        This appraisal report covers the proposed loan of the equivalent
of US$6.3 mlllion to one of the four companies, Cia. For9a e Luz de Minas
Gerais (CFLMG), which operates in the State of Minas Gerais. The proposed
loan would provide funds for about 54 percent of the estimated cost of
US$11.7 million equivalent of the expansion program of the company for the
three-year period 1966-68 and would represent about 45 percent of the
estimated cost of the five-year program. About 85 percent of the
proposed loan would be expended on the distribution system and the
remainder on the high voltage system. Interest during construction
would not be included in the loan since the project consists predominantly

covering proposed Bank loans to four distribution companies in
Brazil, The companies are under comon ownership and as a result
a considerable amount of the text is common to each report.

of distribution facilities which would become revenue bearing shortly
after Lnstallation. CFLMO and the other three companies to which
proposed loans would be made have not been the recipients of previous
loans from the Bank.
* 3.        This report is based on the findings of the mission to Brazil
in November-December 1965, composed of Messrs. D. King and F. Rydell of
the Bank. A long delay was experienced subsequently in negotiat3ng
several issues with the Government of Brazil and the loan is only now
submitted to the Executive Directors for this reason. The long interval
which has elapsed has to some extent outdated the report, which is based
on the expansion program for the three year period 1966-68. The complete
recasting of the program at this stage would result in considerable
further delay in presenting the loan and to avoid this the appraisal is
presented substantia3ly as prepared on the basis of the mission's original
findings. It is considered that this is justified by the circumstances.
* 4.        The project, as described hereafter, consists predominantly of
a distribution system expansion, the implementation of which is somewhat
flexible in that retardation of the program over a period can, up to a
point, be compensated by a subsequent acceleration. As noted in paragraph
29 a review must be made each year of the program proposed for the next
year as a condition of disbursement and proper application of the loan
funds will be assured in any event. The fminancial statements are outdated
for similar reasons but there has been no adverse change in the financial
condition of CFLMG and the statements are therefore considered to be a
fair representation of the present and future financial position of the
company.
II. HCLDING COMPANY ORGANIZATION
* 5.        Centrals Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras), the owner
of CFLMGI, is an autonomous agency established by the Federal Government
in 1961 to carry out studies and to finance, construct and operate
electric power works. It is a holding company which controls the
operation of the federal utilities. It administers public funds to
expand the federal power systems, assist with the expansion of other
electric utilities in need of financing, and finance power facillties
in underdeveloped areas, Eletrobras commenced operations in June 1962
and has become the most important single force in the development of
the electric utility industry. Additional information concernimng
Eletrobras is given in Annex 1.
* 6.        On November 12, 1964 an agreement was concluded between
Eletrobras and A1.FORP whereby the Brazilian properties of the latter
were acquired by Eletrobras.  In summary, for US$135 mliion Eletrobras



eurchased from T4FORP the controlling stock and the short-term notes,
amounting to US$64 million, of the ten companies, becoming the majority
shareholder of each company. Payment is to be made over a period of
45 years.
* 7.        Prior to the acquisition of the companies by Eletrobras their
operating control in Brazil had been exercised by Companhia Auxillar de
Empresas Eletricas Brasileiras (CAEEB), a management campany established
in 1957 by AMFORP. Eletrobras, which acquired control of CAEEB when it
purchased the companies, has retained this arrangement.  CAEEB maintains
its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro where it employs a staff of 250. The
administration department supervises the operations of the associated
companies, provides procurement services for foreign purchases and sets
labor and wage policy. The engineering department supervises planning
and the capital budgets of the companies, prepares specifications, sets
technical standards and orients other phases of the operations from a
technical standpoint. The finance department supervises the accounting
activities of the companies, negotiates loans, makes rate studies and
prepares rate applications and supervises the operating budgets.
* 8.        The organizational structure of CAEEB, instituted by AMFORP,
has remained intact. However, it is understaffed as a result of the
conditions described in paragraph 13. With the planned increase in
staff to meet normal requirements, the organization should be fully
campetent to provide effective management supervision of the companies.
It would find it difficult, however, to coordimate and direct the proposed
expansion program in addition to supervising the operation of the
companies, and it therefore plans to make extensive use of the services
of consultants in this connection, as noted in paragraph 31.
III. THE BORROWER
9.        CFLMG supplies the City of Belo Horizonte, with a population
of 750,000 in the State of Minas Gerais. In 1965 the demand was
100,000 kw and energy sales were 391 million kwh. The company purchases
the bulk of its power requirements from Centrais Eletricas de Minas
Gerais (CEMIG), a state-owned company, and also owns generating stations
with an aggregate capacity of 22 MW, of which 20 FM is hydroelectric.
It operates a 66 kv and 44 kv transmission system which links Belo
Horizonte with these generating stations, which are 60 km distant.
10.       At present CFLMG has approximately 450 km of primary distribution
circuit, 800 km of secondary distribution circuit and 75 MVA of
distribution transformer capacity. Power is stepped down to the primary
distribution voltage of 13.8 kv at three substations in Belo Horizonte
and then distributed over a 127/220 volt secondary network. There are
at present a number of pramary distribution feeders operating at 2.3 kv
which are to be converted to 13.8 kv. The distribution system is of the
overhead type.



11.       CFLMG was established in 1929. Approximately 65 percent of the
common stock is owned by Eletrobras, with the remaining 35 percent held by
the public. It is administered by a five-man Board of Directors elected
for a term of three years. The present Board took office in March 1965
and al. of the members have had long service with the company or CAEEB.
The President of CAEEB serves as President of CFLMG, the operating company,
which is managed by an Executive Director, who is a member of the Board.
Major policies are set by CAEEB but the management of the company is responsi-
ble for the day-to-day adminimstration.
12.       CFLMG employs a total staff of 800 including 450 in the operating
division, 190 in the accounting division, 17 in the purchasing division and
8 engineers in the engimneering division.  The CFLMG organizational structure,
instituted by AMFORP, is satisfactory.
* 13.       Prior to their acquisition by Eletrobras, the AIUFRP companies
were in difficult financial straits due to the Government policy toward
investor-owned utilities. This resulted in the companies' inability to
obtain rate increases during the recent period of rapid inflation. The
maintenance and expansion programs of the companies were severely limIted
by the shortage of funds. In addition, a considerable number of the staff
left their employ and there is now a shortage, particularly engineering
and supervisory, in the companies. During the next two years CFLMG plans
to increase its staff by about a total of 200, including engineers and
technicians. In view of the scale of utility expansion in Brazil, however,
some difficulty may be experienced in obtaining a sufficient number of
engineers.
* 14.       In the past, major substation and transmission engineering was
carried out by CAEEB. Distribution planning was carried out by the CFLMG
engineering staff according to standards established by CAEEB. These
arrangements will continue although due to staff shortages it will be
necessary to employ consulting engineers to assist with much of the design
work during the expansion program (paragraph 31). The policy of the company
is to employ contractors for construction work.
* 15.       Due to lack of funds, expansion of the power system facilities
necessary to satisfactorily supply the increasing load has not been possible
in recent years and the reserve capacity which normally would be maintained
in accordance with sound utility practice has been utilized to meet the in-
creasing load. When the reserve capacity was fully employed, equipment was
then overloaded in order to meet further growth. This has resulted in un-
satisfactory operating conditLons including low voltage and service inter-
ruptions.
* 16.       The shortage of funds also forced the company to limit main-
tenance. As the result of this and the abnormal operating conditions
the useful life of some distribution equipment, particularly transformers,
may have been shortened. Replacement of a considerable number of trans-
formers which have become overloaded or obsolete would be necessary as
part of the expansion program.



IV. THE POWER 1i4ARKET
17.       Adequate records have been kept by CFLIG concerning power sales
which in 1965 amounted to 391 million kwh, with a peak demand of loo mg.
Residential service accounted for 53 percent, commercial 27 percent, in-
dustrial 8 percent and miscellaneous 12 percent of total sales. The
company's industrmal load is a small proportion of the total because the
large industrial installations in the area surrounding the city are supplied
by CEMIG. The rate of growth hasb-en about7percent annually during the
past ten years.
18.       The City of Belo Horizonte and environs, is the cormercial,
marketing and industrial center of the State of Minas Gerais, one of the
richer states in Brazil and one of the most important centers of mineral
production. At the end of 1964 CFLMG supplied about 145,000 customers
with an average annual consumption of 2,600 kwh per customer.
19.       The power market has been studied by the company's consultants
Cia. Internacional de Engenharia e Construcoes (CIECO), a Brazilian af-
filiate of the International Engineering Company of San Francisco   It
is estimated that by 1970 the number of customers would increase to 200,000
with an average annual consumption per customer of about 2,900 kwh, and
total annual sales of 580 million kwh, representing an average growth of a-
bout 7.5 percent per annum. The forecast of demand is considered reason-
able.
20.       The company purchases the bulk of its power requirements from
CEMIG.  A five year power contract is under negotiation whereby CMIG
would make available up to 145 MW to CFLMO at a price, estimated in
accordance with Government regulatory provisions of Cr$21 per kwh (about
9 mills). This should meet both the forecast power and energy require-
ments of the system through 1970. Annex 2 tabulates the past record and
the forecast of generation, purchases and sales for the periods 1961-65
and 1966-70 respectively.
21.       Power system losses, expressed as a percent of total generation
plus purchased power, which can be attributed predominantly to losses
in the distribution system, have increased for several years reflecting
the overloading of distribution facilities. The estimate of future losses
(Annex 2) envisages their gradual reduction as the expansion program is
carried out and the system progresses toward a normal standard of efficiency.
For the purpose of estimating expenses on a conservative basis, it has been
assumed that losses would still approximate 15 percent by 1970. However,
as set forth in the consultants' report, it is expected that substantially
lower losses would be achieved by that time if the expansion program is
carried out as planned.



-6-
V. THI2 PROJECT
22.       The project comprises the rehabilitation and expansion of the
transmission and distrLbution system for the three-year period 1966-68.
About 20 percent of the expenditure would be required to rehabilitate the
existing system and increase its capacLty to satisfactorily supply the
present load. The remainder would provide for expansion of the system
commensurate with the increase in load forecast for the three-year period.
The high voltage portion would involve the construction of a 35 km 138 kv
transmission line to purchase power from ChMIG (paragraph 20) and the
installation of a new 138/13.2 kv primary substation of 40 I1VA capacity.
23.       At the primary distribution level of 13.8 kv the work would
comprise the installation of additional primary feeders, the conversion
of existing 2.3 kv feeders to 13.8 kv operation and the installation of
new underground cable feeders to supply part of the center of the city.
For the secondary network operating at 127/220 volts the program would
provide for the supply and connection of approxLmately 25,000 new customers,
the installation of additional distribution transformer capacity and the
reinforcement of the network feeders to relieve overload on existing
facilities. The program would involve the installation of about 42,000
kva of distribution transformers, associated switchgear and ancillary
equipment, including the installation of about 81,000 meters.
24.       The estimated cost of the project is given below.  A more
detailed estimate is given in Annex 3.

PERCENT OF TOTAL          54%            46%
* 25.       The proposed loan amount would be used to finance equipment,
materials and supplies procured under international competitive bidding,
including domestic suppliers, and the foreign currency cost of engineering
services. It would not be used to finance the cost of labor, of wood and
concrete supports, of a large amount of hardware and of such materials as
cement, which would not reasonably be obtained outside Brazil, and which,
therefore, would|not be procured under international bidding.



* 26.       Brazil produces most of the items of equipment and naterials to
be financed by the proposed loan. It is difficult to assess the competitive
position of Brazilian industry and to estimate the proportion of the Bank
financed goods which might be purchased in Brazil. However, from the
information which is available 50 percent of the loan might be used for
local purchases.
* 27.       The cost estimates were prepared by CIECO and CFLMG assisted by
an experienced Brazilian engineering firm. CIECO, with the assistance of
the International Engineering Company assigned prices on the basis of
information available concerning international pricing of the equipment
and materials. These same prices were used in computing the cost of the
programs of the other three companies to which it is proposed to make loans,
thus assuring uniformity. A contingency allowance of approximately 12 per-
cent has been included for the Bank financed component of the project.
This is to provide for some increase in the cost of equipment and materials
which would be subject to increase as the result of changes, particularly
copper. In addition, it is intended to make allowance for increases in
costs which in some cases may result to the borrower from the purchase
of Brazilian goods under the 15 percent preference formula described in
paragraph 32.
* 28.       The local currency cost estimate was prepared in US$ equivalent,
as is customary in Brazil, where the rate of inflation has been high, to
provide a reasonably firm basis for comparison with actual costs as they
are incurred. Increased local costs due to inflation are expected to be
offset by periodic tariff adjustments permitted by law.
* 29.       The total estimated cost was prepared by extending to all the
areas covered by this program the detailed cost estimates made for typical
installations and areas. In view of the method it would be necessary for
the company to make detaLled studies of the system expansion and prepare
detailed cost estimates each year as the program progresses. It ban been
agreed that these studies and estimates in respect of the program for a
particular year would be submitted in a form satisf2ctory to the. Bank as
a condi'bion of furthier distursemerit in respect to goods purchased during
that year.
30.       The expansion of the distribution system would be continued
after 1968. Provision has been made in the Estimated Source and Applica-
tion of Funds, 1966-70 (Annex 5), for this and for other capital improve-
ments, including buildimngs and transportation equipment.
VI. STATUS OF ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION
* 31.       As noted in paragraph 27, CIECO supervised the preparation of
the cost estimates and would generally supervise and coordinate the project.
Detailed planming, and design of the transmission and large substation work
would be undertaken by CIECO and CAEEB. Distribution planning and design



would be undertaken by CFIMG and by a local experienced Brazilian engi-
neering firm. Supervision of construction would be provided by CFIMG.
Virtually all construction, both transmission and distribution, will be
carried out by experienced Brazilian construction firms. Assurances
have been received that CAEEB and CFIMG would continue to employ con-
sulting engineering firms satisfactory to the Bank.
VII.   PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
32.       As noted previously, the equipment and materials which would
be financed by the proposed Bank loan (paragraph 25) would be purchased
under international competitive bidding, including Brazilian suppllers.
The method of comparing foreign and domestic bids, which follows that
agreed between the Government and Bank in connection with prevLous power
loans, is quoted in part as follows:
"The Borrower intends to invite firms producing goods in Brazil to
participate in the international competitive bidding. In the case
of goods produced in Brazil the Borrower may award the order to the
lowest Brazilian bidder offerimng satisfactory terms and conditions,
provided that his offered price does not exceed the offered price
of the lowest acceptable foreign bidder by more than 15 percent.
Comparison of bids will be made without taking into account customs
or other similar duties.  For firms in Brazil, the delivery price
will comprise the F.O.B. plant cost plus freight, insurance and
other delivery costs to Belo Horizonte. For non-Brazilian firms,
the delivery price will be based on the C.I.F. landed cost, port
of entry, before customs duties, plus inland freight, insurance
and other delivery costs to Belo Horizonte. For reasons of economy,
orders may be placed jointly on behalf of the Borrower and any of
the other three companies which are the recipient of Bank loans.
In such cases comparison of bids will take into account the fact
that part of the order will be delivered at Belo Horizonte and the
other part or parts at the delivery place provided for each df the
other companies. As the 15 percent preference allowed firms in
Brazil is in lieu of customs duties, the 15 percent will be added
to the C.I.F. landed cost (excluding customs duties) of the non-
Brazilian goods, before imland freight, insurance and other costs.
In the case of bids composed of both cruzeiros and foreign currency
the cruzeiro portion thereof will be dealt with as a Brazilian bid
and the foreign exchange portion as a non-Brazilian bid.
"For comparison purposes all bids after evaluation will be conveited
into cruzeiros at the Bid Comparison Rate of Exchange. The Bid
Comparison Rate of Exchange is understood to be the dollar selling
rate of the Banco Central da Republica do Brasil plus the exchazige
surtax (but not to exceed 30 percent), if arny, prevallihg at the
date on which bids are closed. It is further understood that the
Bank will, on its own initiative, or at the reqyest of the Bdokrofei
or Guarantor, reconsider and, if necessary, revise the Bid Coi-
parlson Rate of Exchange, whenever there should be a substantlai
change in the Brazilian exchange system which would, in the jud&awmt
of the Bank, render such rate unsuitable for bid compakison purposes



"The Guarantor will take all such measures as shall be necessary in
order to facilitate the importation, free from all legal and admini-
strative limitations or restrictions, of goods purchased outside
Brazil in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the Loan
Agreement."
In the latter part of 1965 the Government eliminated the exchange surtax
and established a new Banco Central buying rate of Cr$2220 = USI1. At
the present time, therefore, local and foreign bids would be compared
as described in detail above using a bid comparison rate of exchange of
approximately Cr$2220 = US$1 and allowing a 15 percent preference for
local bidders.
* 33.       CIECO would prepare specifications and evaluate bids and would
provide overall coordination of procurement services for both foreign
and locally purchased goods to assure that the timing and quantities of
goods purchased would be in accordance with construction progress. CIfEMB
would provide purchasing services for the procurement of goods obtained
with Bank funds. CFIMG wiould be responsible for procurement of local
goods.
* 34.       Under this arrangement CFLMG's Bank financed goods would be
grouped lith those of the other three companies which are the recipLents
of proposed Bank loans, so that in most instances a single order would
be placed to obtain the price advantage of larger orders. However,
invoicing and delivery would be made directly to the respective companies
in accordance with the allotments specified

VIII   FINAICIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
* 35        The regulations governing power operations and tariffs are con-
tained in the Water Code of 1934 and subsequent arendments and decrees,
including in particular a decree dated February 26, 1957, and three
decrees dated November 4, 1964   Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the
use of historic values of investment and became increasingly unrealistic
as inflation developed, causing many utilities to incur operating losses
for several consecutive years   The 1964 decrees reflected a major change
in Government policies by allowing utilities to revalue their investrent,
and thus making it possible for utilities to apply for tariffs which would
yield adequate returns
* 36        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed ar1d approved
by the Waters Division every three years or at shorter intervals, at the
initiative of the Waters Division or the utility   Utilities are permitted
to apply for tariffs which would yield revenues covering (a) operating costs,
(b) straight-line depreciation of gross fixed assets in operation, exclud-
ing land and land rights, at annual rates of uD to 8 percent for thermal
plants and up to 5 percent for all other facilities including hydro plants,
but with no minimum in either case, (e) a reversion provision of up to 3
percent, or an amortization provision of up to 5 percent, on the total
gross fixed assets in operation, also without minima, and (d) a return of
10 percent on the remunerable investment   Remunerable investment is
defined as gross plant in service (excluding assets acnuired through con-
tributions in aid of construction) less depreciation and reversion or
amortization reserves, plus reversion or amortIzation funds and an allowance
for 'iorking capital consisting of operating inventories, the equivalent of
two months billing, and cash (up to the value of the reserve for denreciation
balance) excluding cash representing contributions in aid of construction
Shortfalls in achieving the return of 10 percent in the three-year tar_ff
period may be recovered, in principle, in the subsequent three-year period
Another provision in the regulations, however, perrits tariff adjustments
for recovering shortfalls to be made at more frequent intervals
* 37        Between tariff revisions, the following surcharges may be added
by the utilities on their current tariffs without permission of the Waters
Division   (a' monthly, for compulsory increases in wages, social benefits,
cost of fuel and purchased power and (b) semi-annually, for increases in
foreign debt service due to changes in the foreign excnarge rate
i 38        Tariff adjustments for the revaluation of the balance sheets
accounts can be made as often as economic correction factors (coefficients),
showing the variations in the purchasing power of the currency, are pub-
lished by the National Economic Council    The coefficients are issued
annually about two months after tIe end of each year for the use of industry
in general   They are applied by utilities to up-date the values of plant
in service, depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves, and certain



- 1. -
local currency loans from the National Development Bank and/or Eletrobras
Foreign currency components of the book value of fixed assets are converted
into local currency at the rate of exchange in effect at the time the assets
are acquired   Foreign debts are revalued on the basis of the current rate
of exchange   The amount by which the revaluation of fixed assets exceeds
the revaluation of reserves and loans is set aside as a revaluation reserve
which is subject to a 5 percent tax
* 39        In addition to the tariffs, two surcharges are being levied on the
consumer's electric bill by the Federal Government to help finance power
expansion in the country   In the case of the distribution companies
reviewed in connection with appraisals for Bank loans, the combination of
these surcharges have anounted to between 40 percent and 50 percent of the
average tariff in 1965   The proceeds of one of these surcharges, the "sole"
tax which was created in 1954, are allocated among the Federal, State and
Mlunicipal authorities  This tax, the rate of which varies according to classes
of consumers, is presently based on an average price per kwh computed per±-
odically by the National Council of Water and Electric Energy   Another
surcharge, similarly computed and assessed, is the "compulsory loan , intro-
duced in November 1962 and which is to terminate in 1968   The proceeds go
to Eletrobras which in turn invests such funds in various power projects in
the form of loans or share capital   Eletrobras issues to the consumers, for
the amount of the "compulsory loans" paid, debt certificates carrying an
interest rate of 12 percent and redeemable in 10 years   A third surcharge,
which is a social security tax, is 8 percent of the tariff
* 40        The implementation of the revaluation provision was not entirely
satisfactory during the initial year, 1965, due not only to the understand-
able complexities involved with the transition, but also to the permissive
character of several important provisions of the new regulations   Revalu-
ation was not then compulsory, the legislation provided for maximum rates of
depreciation and amortization but no minimum rates were prescribed and
recovery of shortfalls in earnings at intervals and for periods shorter than
three years was only optional   In addition, there was uncertainty among
utilities in regard to interpretation of certain provisions of the regula-
tions and long delays were experienced in a number of instances before
tariffs were actually adjusted to reflect revaluation of assets
* 41        The Bank was particularly concerned with two possible consequences
of the permissive character of the regulations   Different tariff policies
could be followed which in the case of interconnected utilities) riglt well
lead to conflicting principles being used in calculating the apparent cost
of important blocks of power and could result in important economic decisions
being based on erroneous assumptions   While efforts were being made by
Government to implement sound and, in certain instances, relatively high
tariffs, there existed the possibility that, in compliance with the same
regulations, utilities might be allowed to revert in the future to inadequate
tariff levels
* 42        These questions were brought to the attention of the Covernment
early in 1966   It was suggested that regulations should be tightened to
ensure that a minimum and uniform level of tariff performance oe required



- 12 -
from all utilities in the future. The Government indicated that it was
aware of this problem and was planning to continue improving the implementa-
tion of the regulations. It was not prepared at the time to propose correct-
ing legislation to Congress. Pending such legislation, however, it was
suggested that the Bank should define in a more detailed and speciftc rate
covenant than those in the agreements for earlier power loans, the minimum
level of fimancial performance it expected utilities to achLeve, and that
the Government would support extension of this type of rate covenant to as
many other utilities as possible, through Eletrobras.
* 43.       During the negotiations for the four Distribution Loans, however,
the representatives of the Brazilian Government objected that the detailed
covenants proposed might conflict with Brazilian law. Pending clarification
of this point, negotiations were suspended. Conversations continued and
the Government informed the Bank recently that legislation had been enacted
by Congress which will: (1) make the revaluation of utilities' assets com-
pulsory, a measure which alleviates much of the Bank's concern, (2) reduce
by one half the level of electrification taxes and (3) extend the surcharge
on compulsory loans to 1973, provide for their annual revaluation, interest
at 6 percent and a 20 year term.
*-44.       Negotiations between the Government and the Bank over the question
of tariffs finally resulted in the following:
(1) The Government, CFLM4 and the other Distribution Companies agreed
to a covenant under which (a) as provided by the Brazilian legis-
lation, tariffs will be set so as to produce revenues at a level
consistent with sound financial and public utility practices,
using straight-line depreciation which shall be not less than that
based on the useful lives of depreciable assets in operation, and
(b) as permitted by the Brazilian legislation, assets will be re-
valued and tariffs will be correspondingly adjusted at least once
every calendar year.
(2) A change in legislation which shall adversely affect the setting
of tariffs at the level stated above, shall be an event of default.
(3)  In a letter to CFLMG and the other Distribution Companies the Bank
will define the standard which it would use to analyse a change in
legislation for the purpose of (2) above. This standard shall be
whether revenues from the sale of electricity are sufficient to:
(a) cover all of the Borrower's operating expenses, including
straight-line depreciation of gross revalued fixed assets in opera-
tion, at rates based on the useful lives of assets and (b) produce
a reasonable annual rate of return on the revalued average net
fixed assets im operation (which under presently foreseeable con-
ditions would be of the order of 10%).
* 45.       In the course of 1966, the assets of CFIMG have been revalued
twice, to reflect the official cost indices at December 31, 1964 and 1965.
Corresponding tariff adjustments were made in June and November. The tariffs



- 13 -
introduced in June were calculated to provide inter alia for depreciation
charges at 5 percent, reversion charges at 3 percent and a 10 percent return
on the remunerable investment   Details of the november adjustment are not
yet available
Financial Position
* 46        CFLMG's financial statements for 1965 were audited by Boucinhas &
Compos, Certified Public Accountants   The accounting rethods followed and
the auditing arrangements are satisfactory    In connection with the proposed
loan, CFLM4G has agreed to continue to employ auditors satisfactory to the
Bank and to submit certified annual financial statements with the auditor's
report
* 47        The estimated financial position of CFLMG as of December 31, 1965
is presented in the following statement and in Annex 6. Two balance sheets
have been shown in the following statement to indicate the effect of the
revaluation which will be recorded in 1966   The first balance sheet reflects
the value of the assets, capital and liabilities based on the revaluation
made in April 1965, which applied the 1964 coefficient   The second balance
sheet shows the result of revaluation based on the 1965 coefficient of 1 27

48        CFLMG's revaluation of April 1065, increased net plant in service
by Cr$10,400 million   The estimated revaluation that will be recorded in
1966, based on the 1965 coefficient, will increase the net plant in opera-
tion by about Cr$6,600 million to a total value of about Cr$32,850 million
at December 31, 1965.
49        Estimated share capital outstanding at December 31, 1965 is
Cr$10,575 million   After CFLIG revalues its accounts based on the 1965
coefficient, the revaluation reserve will be increased to Cr$9,465 millilo
In accordance with current regulations this reserve must be disposed of b'
an eauivalent stock distribution   Thus in 1966 the share capital will be
increased from Cr$10,575 million to about Cr$20,040 million without taking
into account new equity investments
50        An Export/Import Bank loan amounting to US$1 6 millior was made
in 1953 to finance one 5 MI generating unit in the Peti Hydroelectric Sta-
tion and expansion of the transmission and distribution svstems    CFLMG
revalued this loan in accordance with the rates of exchange prevailing in
1963 and 1964   In April 1965, it was again revalued based on the rate of
exchange of Cr$1,850 to US$1 and this value is reflected in the first bal-
ance sheet above   In November 1965, the rate of exchange was increased to
Crt2,220 to US$1 at which rate the value of the Export/Import Bank loan
outstanding at December 31, 1965 is shown in the second statement above
The Export/Import Bank loan was originally made to CFLDG and the guarantor
was the Brazilian Electric Po'uer Company (BEPCO), a wholly owned subsidiary
of AI4FORP  On lIarch 18, 1965, an agreement was executed between the Export/
Import Bank and the Brazilian Government, whereby new notes were exchanged
for the notes issued under the original loan agreement and the guarantor
was changed from BEPCO to the Brazilian Government
* 51        At the time of the sale of the AIIFORP companies to the Brazilian
Government, Eletrobras not only acquired the capital stock of the companies
but also about US$64 million in debts owed by the companies to AXFORP
These debts were represented by 8 percent demand notes but the companies
always considered such notes as long-term indeotedness   The purchase and
sale agreement specified that service on these notes would be paid to
Eletrobras, which in turn would use the proceeds for payments on the pur-
chase price to AIIFORP  The companies therefore will revalue these notes
periodically in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange rate    At
the time of the Bank's appraisal mission in November 1965, no definite
arrangements had been made for the operating companies to reray these notes
to Eletrobras   Fixed terms have now been established for these notes as
follows (1) interest rate 13 percent, (2) amortization payments to commence
in 1968 (Fletrobras' amortization payments to AVIFORP also commence in 1968)
and, (3) amortization period of 25 years   These terms were used in con-
nection with the financial projections in this report
52        The other loans from Eletrobras, amounting to Cr$1,221 million,
represent funds advanced to cover capital expenditures and working capital
requirements since the date of acquisition of CFILMG by Eletrobras   For



- 16 -
purposes of this report it has been assumed that these funds will carry the
same terms as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph except that amorti-
zation payments will start in 1970
Past Earnings Record
53        Income Statements for the years 1961 through 1965 are shown in
Annex 4   Until early in 1965 CFLMIG's tariffs were based on historic costs
of its remunerable investment   Although tariff increases were made ln the
past, increasing the average revenue per kwh from Cr$2.82 in 1961 to
Cr$1o 43 in 1964, they did not keep pace with the rapid inflation    Durinq
the period from 1961 through 1964 operating results were exceptionall3 poor,
with increasing operating losses occurring in each year, culminating witlb
an operating loss of Cr$1,504 million in 1964
54        Operations were substantially improved in 1965   Increased tariffs
based on the revaluation applying the 1963 coefficient increased the average
revenue per kwh from Cr$lO 43 in 1964 to Cr$27 06 in 1965   Operating ircome
is estimated at about Cr$l 2 billion after deducting charges for depreciation,
reversion and exchange losses   Excluding income and revaluation taxes this
would represent a 6 1 percent raty of return on the net fixed assets in
operation at the end of the year, assuming the assets were valued on the basis
of the 1964 coefficient   However, if the assets had been valued in accordance
with the 1965 coefficient, if depreciation had been recorded at 4 percent and
if no charges had been made for reversion and exchange losses, the rate of
return would have been only 2 6 percent   This low rate of return reflects
the facts that tariffs were computed on 1963 values and that they had not
become effective until about mid-1965
Proposed Financing Plan
55        A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the period
1966-1970 is shown in Annex 5 and summarized in the table below    During the
first three years of this period, CFLM4G would carry out the IBRD transmis-
sion and distribution project as described in paragraphs 22 and 23, 'Which
is estimated to cost Cr$25,970 million excluding interest during consltruction
After the completion of the Bank's project CFLMG intends to carry out a con-
tinuous expansion program to meet the estimated annual increase in demand
for power   The forecast for this program for 1969 and 1970 indicates a cost
of Cr$5,500 million for the two-year period   Capital expenditures in addi-
tion to the programs described above and totalling about Cr$6,000 million,
are expected to be incurred throughout the 1966-1970 period (see paragraph 30)
56        CFLMG's fund requirements for the five-year period are expected to
total about Cr$42,700 million   Capital expenditure requirements would total
about Cr$38,000 million, including Cr$543 million for interest during con-
struction   About Cr$4,700 million would be required for additional working
capital bRsed on the assumption that CFLMG would attain a current ratio of
1 to 1 by the end of 1969 and maintain this ratio through 1970

58        During this period the estimated net internal cash generation
would total Cr$12,280 million after payment of debt service and dividends,
or about 29 percent of the fund requirements
59        Under the present financial plan, share capital will be issued
during the period 1966 through 1970 for a total amount equal to that of the
proposed Bank loan of Cr$13,990 million (US$6 3 million) plus whatever
additional amounts are required in order to meet the proposed dividend
schedule (see paragraph 66)   The Cruzeiro amount of the share capital con-
tributions will be increased to match any increase in the Cruzeiro amount
of the Bank loan due to devaluation of the currency   During negotiations
Eletrobras agreed that it will subscribe to the new shares in relation to
its holdings (at present 65 percent), and will also purchase all new shares
not taken up by the minority shareholders   The financial plan indicates a
total of about Cr$15.5 billion will be required as new share canital, or
about 36 percent of the total fund requirements
60        The proposed Bank loan of US$6 3 million is assumed to have a term
of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period with an interest rate of 6
percent. Interest during construction has not been included in the loan
61        Other resources amounting to Cr$1,445 million, consisting prima-
rily of contributions in aid of construction, represents about 3 percent of
the total requirements
62.       Under the proposed financial plan, it is estimated that by the
end of 1970, the total available funds would exceed fund requirements by
about Cr$466 million or about 1 percent   During negotiations it was agreed
that in the event of a shortage of funds cash dividends would not be paid,
and furthermore, that Eletrobras would contribute all additional funds
necessary for completing the 1966-1970 expansion program

1970, is based on the assumption that the Borrower achieves the required
earnings as specified in the tariff covenant included in the proposed Loan
and Guarantee Agreements, i e., a 10 percent return on the revalued average
net fixed assets in operation (see paragraph 44)   Foreign exchange
expenditures and sources of funds have been cast in terms of the official
exchange rate as of December 31, 1965, of Cr$2,220 to US$1   As far as local
currency is concerned, normal increases in operating costs due to expanded
operations have been considered but no provision has been made for the loss
of value of the Cruzeiro after 1965 as most of the effects will have been
provided for under the tariff arrangements and adjustments for inflation
mentioned in paragraph 37. Depreciation has been computed at a 4 percent
rate and no charges have been shown for reversion   Kwh sales have been
projected in accordance with the load forecast as shown in paragraph 19 and
Annex 2



- 19 -
64        The forecast income statements, Annex 4, show that operating
revenues would increase from about Cr$10,600 million in 1965 to about
Cr$26,200 million in 1970, or an increase of about 147 percent   Operating
income is expected to increase from about Cr$1,200 million in 1965 to about
Cr$5,200 million in 1970   Because of revaluations based on the 1964 and
1965 coefficients it is expected that the average price per kwh would in-
crease substantially, from Cr$27 06 in 1965 to Cr$40 30 in 1966   Thereafter,
through 1970, in order to attain the minimum 10 percent rate of return on
the revalued average net fixed assets in operation, moderate annual increases
in the average price per kwh would be necessary
65        Operating income would cover interest charges, including car tal-
ized interest, 2 0 times in 1966 and increase to 2 5 times in 1970   Annual
debt service would be covered 2 4 times in 1966 as shown in the Source and
Application of Funds Statements, Annex 5   These ample coverages reflect
the large proportion of equity funds in the nroposed financing plan    Since
the proposed Bank loan has a five-year grace period, the first semi-annual
amortization payment is not due until August 1971 and the first full year's
debt service will not occur until 1972   It is estimated,, however, that
interest coverage would be 2 8 times and 3 1 times in 1971 and 1972   Debt
service coverage is expected to be 3 0 in both 1971 and 1972
* 66        On the basis of the proposed tariff increases and estimated load
growth, all the former AMFORP companies expect to realize substantial oper-
ating profits and should be in a position to resume rayment of dividends
Eletrobras and CAEEB have therefore proposed a schedule of dividend pay-
ments foi the future   The proposal includes dividend payments as shown in
the following schedule
Proposed Schedule of Dividends
Year             Dividend Rate
1966                   3%
1967                   6%
1968                   8%
1969                  10%
1970                  10%
67        Based on the forecast of operating results as shown in Annex 4, it
is expected that CFLMG will produce sufficient operating income to declare
annual cash dividends through 1969 corresponding to the rates proposed in
the above schedule through 1969   The forecast shows, however, that because
of the available earned surplus balance, dividends must be limited to 9
percent in 1970
Future Financial Position
68        Annex 6 shows forecast balance sheets as of December 31, 1965
through 1970   During the period under review, CFLIIG's net fixed assets in
operation are expected to increase from about Cr$32,500 million in 1965 to



- 20 -
about Cr$58,500 million, or by about 80 percent   Its fully revalued long-
term debt of Cr$12,195 million at December 31, 1965 is expected to reach
its maximum level of Cr$24,612 million by 1969 and decrease to Cr$24,060
million in 1970
* 69        In order to maintain a satisfactory financial position throughout
the future it was agreed during negotiations to include a debt limitation
covenant in the Loan documents   This covenant requires that CFLMIG's long-
term debt outstanding at the end of any given year be limited to a maximum
of two-thirds of the total fixed assets   Such debt includes actual aebt
drawdowns rather than the amount of the loan contracts, the current 12-morth
portion of such debt carried in the books as current liabilities and any
short-term loans not incurred in the ordinary course of business
70        Annex 6 shows that CFLMG could keep well within this limitation
as the percentage of its fully revalued long-term debt to net revalued fixed
assets including work in progress is about 37 percent in 1966, increasing
to about 43 percent in 1968, and decreasing to 40 percent by 1970    This
assumes that CFLMG will continue to revalue its investment to reflect the
true value of both its fixed assets and long-term loans
IX   CONCLUSIONS
* 71        The project, consisting of transmission and distribution expan-
sion, is technically and economically sound
* 72        The arrangements for engineering, procurement, and construction
are satisfactory   CFLIG is capable of carrying out the project with the
assistance of CAEEB and the consultants, and of operating the facilities
thereafter
*           Funds necessary to complete the project, in addition to those made
available by the proposed Bank loan, are to be provided by Eletrobras
* 74        Under the Brazilian tariff regulations which permit power compa-
nies to earn 10% return on revalued assets, CFLMG should be able to achieve
and maintain a strong financial condition
75        The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$6.3 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period

* 1.        Centrals Eletricas Brasileiras S A  (Eletrobras) was formeo
in 1961 by tL,e Federal Government pursuant to legislation enacted b.
Congress that year and commenced operations in June 1962 fello""lng
approval of itS By-Laws by Government decree   It is administered byr a
President and Board of Directors, appointed for a term of three years
by the Government
* 2         It ie empowered to carry out power development studies, to
finance, construct and operate electric Dower generating plants and
transmisqlon lines and directly or through subsidiaries to take such
actions as are recessary to initiate the supply of electric potver in
the event of actual or prospective shortages
* 3         Eletrobras has developed along lines leading to t,wo main
functions   It is the nolding corpany owning the major interest in
electric power itilities of the Federal Government   These include the
former AX ORP companies, FUILNAS (Central Eletrica de Furnas S i )
and CflESP (Companhla 1ldro Eletrica do Sao Francisco)  It also ad-
ministers public funds for tXLe expansion of federal power systems, for
the expansion of non-federal utilities in appropriate cases and to
initiate power developrent programs in underaeveloped areas of the
country
* 4.        Eletrobras obtains funds fror several sources, the most impor-
tart of rihich are tbe Sole Tax and the Compulsory Loan levied on electric-
ity consumer accourts   The former is - direct tax and the iates per
kwh consumed sre fixed percentages of tlie 'fiscal rate" which is an aver-
age overall rate per kwh sold throughout the entire country   oince August
1966 the percentages are 5 percert for rural corsumers, 17_ percent for
residential and industrial consumers and 20 percent for all otl'er cor-
sumers
5         Commencing in July 1965 electricity consumers were required Qo
purchase obligations of Lletrobras in amounts equal to the Sole Tax
Since August 1966 the terms of such obligations are 6 percent interest
and a 20 year -aturity   These obligations will also be revalued each
year based or the annual coefficients published by the ITational Economic
Council and interest and redemption pay,"ents will be made on such values
6.        Eletrobras receives 40 percent of the proceeds of the Sole Tax
and the entire proceeds of the Compulsory Loan   Other sources of revenue
include the receints from a percentage of federal excise tax collections
and custom assessments, interest on earnings, tle proceeds of bond
issues and Giovernnent allocations
7         Eletrobras finances power Drojects bv subscribing to canital
shares and through the medium of long-term debt and short-term loans
The funds avallabie for investment in 1965 were estimated at Cr$144 000
million (USA65 million). In view of the ad valorem nature of the Sole
Tax and Corpulsory Loan, the funds available should increase eacn year
as the result of increasing sales and higher tariffs
