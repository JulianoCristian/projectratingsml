satisfactory,\n            sustainability likely, and institutional development impacts\n            were substantial, accomplished by satisfactory performances\n            by both the Bank and Borrower. Lessons convey the following.\n            Project readiness is essential, especially in the case of\n            projects with demanding reform agendas, and, it is\n            reinforced that thorough project preparation, ensuring the\n            scope of the project is within the capacity of the\n            implementing agency to manage is critical, including a\n            detailed preparation of the Project implementation plan\n            (PIP). Furthermore, stable leadership in the implementing\n            agency is required if reforms are to be implemented\n            successfully. Similarly, a district-based, community-driven\n            model for rural water supply and sanitation, and catchment\n            management is powerful and effective in scaling up and\n            ensuring sustainability. In so doing it is important to\n            provide adequate start-up time to introduce concepts, and\n            build implementation capacity at the district and community\n            levels. Finally, the establishment of efficient,\n            commercially-oriented urban water utilities requires proper\n            incentive structures, and professional independent review\n            and monitoring."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
