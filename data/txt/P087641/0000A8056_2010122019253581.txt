                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Project is progressing well. Despite initial delays in starting project implementation, there has been good progress over the last year. The good progress in
                         performance by the operator in contract year 4 is assessed as satisfactory by the independent technical auditor (final audit report issued in September 2010). To-date, the operator,
                         Yerevan Djur (YD), has signed 94 contracts of the 96 proposed contracts, out of which 76 are completed in the amount of $11.5 million, and 18 are under implementation ($5.3
                         million).

                         Disbursement as of November 25, 2010 amounted to US$15.72 million or 78% of the US$20 million IDA Credit. Disbursements have improved rapidly over the last four quarters

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank has received a formal request from the MOF, and is now considering to amend the credit development agreement, introducing the following changes:

                         (a) align the wording of the Project Development Objective (PDO) between the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Credit Development Agreement, and the performance targets
                         agreed in 2006 between the Government and the private operator. The original Project documentation articulated the PDO as providing Yerevan with safe, continuous water supply
                         while reducing environmental pollution. However, in 2006 at the start of Project implementation, the lease contract between the Government and private operator was signed based
                         on providing constant water supply measured by increased hours of daily supply for all customers. The word  continuous in the original PDO is thus proposed to be replaced by
                          constant to align project documents with the performance indicators agreed with the private operator;
                         (b) revise PDO and intermediate outcome indicators to fine-tune their relevance to the PDO, and introduce baseline and target values missing from the original results framework.
