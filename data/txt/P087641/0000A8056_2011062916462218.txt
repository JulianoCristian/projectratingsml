                         Following the Government's request, the Bank restructured the Project and amended the credit development agreement, as follows:

                         (a) aligned the wording of the Project Development Objective (PDO) between the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Credit Development Agreement, and the performance targets
                         agreed in 2006 between the Government and the private operator.
                         (b) revised PDO and intermediate outcome indicators to fine-tune their relevance to the PDO, and introduced baseline and target values missing from the original results framework.
                         (c) reallocated the credit proceeds of the Yerevan Water and Wastewater Project among three categories, particularly from consulting services to works and incremental operating
                         costs.
                         (d) extended the closing date of the Project by ten months, from February 28, 2011 to December 31, 2011.
