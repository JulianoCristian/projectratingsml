                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The Project implementation is overall satisfactory. Disbursements as of December 9, 2011 amounted to US$19.63 million or 97% of the US$20 million IDA Credit. Disbursements
                         have been on track since the last supervision mission. The remaining funds are fully committed to be disbursed before the Project closes on December 31, 2011.

                         2. The main performance indicators reveal continued progress towards meeting the Project objectives. Most of the key performance indicators have reached or exceeded the end-of
                         project target.

                         - Average duration of water supply increased from 19.6 hours/day at baseline stage to 21.3 hours/day (end-of-project target is 21 hours).

                         - Percentage of water samples in compliance with bacteriological safety requirements increased from 93% at baseline to 99% now (end-of-project target is 98%).
                         - Number of sites in Yerevan municipality with wastewater discharged into water courses upstream of existing treatment works decreased from 17 sites at baseline to 7 sites (end-of-
                         project target is 8).
                         - Water production decreased from 885 liter per capita/day to 853 (end-of-project target is 840 l/c/d).

                         - Electricity consumption decreased from 119 MwH per annum at baseline to 73 MwH now (end-of-project target is 94 MwH).

                         The progress indicates that the Project Development Objectives will be met by the closing date.

                         3. The private sector operator, Veolia, has made a good progress during the 5th year of lease contract. The independent technical auditor (audit report issued in September 2011)
                         concluded that for the third consecutive year the services provided by the Lessee under the Lease Contract to Yerevan population have improved. This is substantiated by the
                         reduction of production/abstraction of water, reduction of energy consumption, and reduction of losses, which is a very positive development of Year 5. The fact that Yerevan Djur has
                         been able to achieve these reductions provides good prospects for further improvements in the coming years. Particularly,

                         - For the second consecutive year, the Lessee has managed to reduce the abstraction of water from sources this year by about 6%, which equals approximately 20 million cubic
                         meters.
                         - In year 5, Yerevan Djur reduced leakages from the distribution system by 22 million cubic meters, which is required to sustain the hours of supply when water production is reduced.
                         - Another positive trend is that billing on the basis of meters has increased both for domestic and non-domestic subscribers.
                         - The targets for water supply duration, bacteriological safety compliance, as well as customer complaint response time are fulfilled.

                         4. The Project Monitoring Unit and the Bank team closely monitor the implementation plan of all ongoing and remaining activities to ensure timely completion before the Project's
                         closing date of December 31, 2011.
