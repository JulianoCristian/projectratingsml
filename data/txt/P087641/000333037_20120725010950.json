"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Yerevan Water and\n            Wastewater Project for Armenia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: a private professional operator now under\n            Armenian management with limited back office support from\n            its foreign professional partner is able to exceed its\n            contractual obligations is a proof that know-how has been\n            properly transferred and that contractual incentives are\n            working well. The independent technical auditor concluded\n            that for the third consecutive year the quality of the\n            service provided by Yerevan Djur has improved, as evidenced\n            by a steady reduction of volume of water produced, energy\n            consumed and physical and commercial losses, which provides\n            good prospects for further improvements in coming years.\n            Economic justification of projects that mostly focus on\n            rehabilitation of existing facilities and operations is\n            always difficult without reliable data before and at the\n            completion of the project. If energy savings are usually\n            easy to identify, time savings, reduction of coping costs,\n            health improvements and environmental improvements are much\n            more difficult to document. Future projects should consider\n            establishing good baseline information for better supporting\n            estimates of economic benefits in an environment where the\n            competition for financing is likely to remain strong."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
