Water is treated\n            as a precious commodity in Armenia. It is expensive and not\n            always plentiful or clean enough to meet the needs of the\n            capital's citizens. Neglected for decades, municipal\n            water and wastewater systems leaked, wasted and misused\n            water. As a result, most residents only had water a few\n            hours a day. When water did come out of the tap, it was\n            often unhealthy. Armenia's government has strived over\n            the past decade to improve access to reliable and safe\n            drinking water. Two projects, financed by World Bank funds,\n            have made improvements in water delivery and quality, and\n            customer service. Thanks to the projects, 332,000 households\n            in the capital have running water 21 hours a day, up from\n            six.  Water quality and customer service began to improve\n            after reforms put a private company in charge of managing\n            the utility company. Yerevan's water supply is\n            monitored in real time through a new software program. The\n            entire network of water mains and pipes can be seen on a\n            single computer screen which shows who is receiving water at\n            any given time, and where bottlenecks occur. A customer\n            service hotline answers consumers' questions and\n            responds to emergencies around the clock. People report\n            problems with water quality or meters, and water or sewage\n            main breaks. Over the last ten years, the country has\n            significantly improved the way it manages and protects its\n            water resources."}, "docdt": "2012-01-25T06:18:04Z"}
