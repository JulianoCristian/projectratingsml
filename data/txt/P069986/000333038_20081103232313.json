     outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            in such contexts, relevant capacity building and training\n            initiatives tend to get sidelined if they are not built into\n            the project works execution and therefore require special\n            attention in design, finance and implementation. The\n            addition of the telecenters component, though innovative,\n            was arguably a stretch for Palestinian Economic Council for\n            Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR) with its focus on\n            engineering. The development of the telecenters required a\n            different kind of specialize and was taxing on PECDAR's\n            staff and supervision time. Lack of donor participation in\n            funding or other collaboration should be cause for concern.\n            It is understood with the onset of the intifada (Palestinian\n            uprising), many donors retreated to emergency aid. However,\n            with a proliferation of donors, some continuing to work in\n            community development, there should be more assertive\n            efforts to drive a common framework. The role of the\n            community development consultant (CDC) should be reinforced\n            in project preparation, with buy-in from all stakeholders,\n            and the position active up-front and throughout the project."}, "docdt": "2008-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
