Development\n            Project will finance investments in infrastructure\n            rehabilitation, and reconstruction, aiming at improving its\n            operational, and maintenance systems, so as to provide basic\n            social, and economic infrastructure services in marginal\n            areas of the West Bank and Gaza. Although the project is\n            expected to improve pollution levels, and thus improve\n            public health risks, this environmental assessment looks at\n            potential adverse effects on the environment as a result of\n            project implementation. Mitigation is as follows. During\n            construction activities will be limited to a daytime\n            schedule, to reduce noise disturbances; traffic signs will\n            be installed to divert traffic as needed; and, speed will be\n            reduced to prevent excessive congestion. During the design\n            stage, proposals will be included to reduce storm water\n            runoff, and potential wastewater contamination, by\n            intercepting runoff through perforated infiltration pits\n            along the road, diverting part of the runoff to tributary\n            sandy roads. Bond evacuation, and cleaning will be performed\n            during the rainy season. During construction, special care\n            will be taken to avoid water breaks on pipes, or house\n            connections, and, a survey of existing facilities prior to\n            construction, should monitor excavation works, while\n            provisions for immediate repair should an emergency occur,\n            will be established. An appropriate water tariff structure\n            will be implemented, followed by an awareness campaign to\n            educate the population on water consumption issues, and\n            conservation aspects as well."}, "docdt": "2001-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
