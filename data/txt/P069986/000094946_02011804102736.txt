!.ICDP -----
Introduction
As stated in the Project Concept Note, 2nd Draft, the overall objective of the Integrated
Community Development Project (ICDP) is to improve the quality and availability of basic
social and economic infrastructure services in poor and marginalized areas of West Bank and
Gaza. This objective would be pursued through identification of target areas (preferably four
geographical areas such as two urban areas in Gaza and selected rural villages north of Jenin
and south of Hebron), and the development and implementation of a multi-sectoral program,
which would include technical assistance.
The project's objective would be realized through financing investments in infrastructure
rehabilitation and reconstruction that preserves and maintains capital stock in villages and
small municipalities. The ICDP would make investment in economic infrastructure that has
long been neglected, such as roads, water supply, schools, and clinics. In addition, the project
aims at community based improvements in the agriculture sector including rehabilitation of
terraces, irrigation canals, wells and access roads. The project will also pilot new initiatives
specifically providing access to information and communication technology to target
communities.
The project will mainly rehabilitate existing facilitates and provide improved and systematic
operational and maintenance systems, so no major impacts are expected. The potential
negative impacts that are localized and limited in nature will be avoided by providing
instructions in the contract document which specifically address environmental issues in a
manner acceptable to the bank, as well as following good management practices during
construction given the above justification.
The World Bank commissioned the Engineering and Management Consulting Center (EMCC)
to prepare the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the (Integrated Community
Development Project) ICDP to satisfy the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 (January
1998).
The key implementing agencies involved in the project are Ministry of Local Government
(MOLG), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Palestinian Economic Council for Development
and Reconstruction (PECDAR), the Department of Refugee Affairs (DORA), and the Local
Government Units (LGUs). MOLG will have the overall responsibility for implementation
and will be strongly supported by PECDAR.
1.    Objectives of the Proposed Study
An assessment is to be perfomled in order to assess the environmental impacts of the
proposed project's components. The assessment is based on field survey, site visits,
interviews, and group discussion with the relevant community and local administrative bodies.
The assessment consists of brief description of the project followed by a summary of different
impacts before and after the project construction. The objectives of this study are the
followings:
* Outline key environmental issues through an environmental audit of similar
community development projects.

2.     Projects Description and Audit Process
3.1 Projects Description
In close coordination with the World Bank project team, PECDAR and MOLG, four projects
in Gaza Strip and five projects in the West Bank were implemented under CDP II, were used
for the environmental audit. The list of these projects and brief description of each project is
shown in Table (1). Full details of these projects are given in annex (I). The assessed and
audited projects were selected to cover the geographical distribution in Gaza Strip and West
Bank and also to cover four different activity sectors (Road and pavement, Water Supply
Networks, Wastewater Services, and Building Construction). Significant benefits would
accrue to the population of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Women and children would benefit
in particular, Benefits would include:
* Improvement in the efficiency of water supply service delivery by further reducing
leakage and provide more reliable supply services.
* Improvement of sanitation services by expanded coverage and receiving more reliable
services.
* Improvements in public health and environmental conditions due to expansion and
rehabilitation of wastewater collection services.
* Improvement in road infrastructure by pavement of new roads.
* Improvement in educational facilities for children by pro4riding more space and
sanitation facilities.
* Opportunities for local private sector participation and development through
consulting, contracting, and manufacturing inputs throughout the project period.
Table (3. 1) below summarizes the selected projects for environmental audit.

3.2 Audit Process
The Study team collected and reviewed the studies conducted on the environmental situation
in Gaza Strip and West Bank - specifically the Environmental Profiles for Gaza Strip and
West Bank, the Environmental Strategy and Action Plan, and the Assessments of the previous
Community Development Programs.
Information on the study's area environmental attributes, infrastructure, transportation links,
and utilities are documented from available reports produced by PECDAR, MOPIC, PWA,
and MEnA.
Site visits to the projects' area to document the main features and impacts of each project
were conducted. Photos were also taken to different locations of the projects. The audit
process is also based on consultations with staff of MOLG, PECDAR, and relevant
municipalities in addition to interviews and group discussion with related communities.
The impacts of each project are described and evaluated for the construction and post-
construction stages of the project. The mitigation measures for the negative impacts for each
audited project is presented as shown in Table (3.2).

3.3 General Findings
The audited projects showed that the impacts are mainly positive environmental impacts for
most sectors. Positive impacts identified include the following:
-   Sewage and water projects: improve the public health of the local community and
ground water protection. After construction, the implemented project has no impact on
most of the physical environment factors such as noise, dust, and air pollution. "Al
Shaboura Camp Sewage Network-Phase III" is an example of sewage projects and
"Developing Interior Roads at EL Majaida Area" is an example of water network as
the project's components include the improvement the water network and installing
new house connections.
-   Road and pavement projects: reduce or prevent dust, improve drainage and road
safety, especially in the roads close to schools. Road pavement and sidewalks add
positively to the people's attitude towards preserving these assets and therefore
keeping their localities clean and safe. "Such as pavement of access road at Tafouh" in
the West Bank.
-   Rehabilitation and construction of schools and public buildings projects help in
improve the overall environment and contribute in reducing public health risks. The
projects also added positively in improving the educational and environmental cultural
atmosphere. Such as the construction of new classrooms in Tayasser Village and
construction of Public Services Building in El Mosaddar.
The risks and negative impacts of the implemented projects can be minimized by the
addressed mitigation measures during construction and operation phases. Table (3.2) below
summarizes the impacts of each project and the suggested mitigation measures. More details
about the impacts and mitigation measures of the audited projects are available in
Annex (I).

Institutional Overview of CDP-II
Based on the discussions with key staff from PECDAR and MOLG who where involved
in CDP-Il projects, the following remarks can be drafted.
- A comprehensive environmental management plan was not considered in CDP-II.
However, some environmental considerations are already included in the contract
documents (e.g. chance of findings, dumping of construction and demolition
wastes, etc.).
- No cooperation is recorded with MEnA regarding the CDP-II projects. Only a
representative from the Ministry of Labor visited selected projects to ensure that
safety procedures are observed.
- No environmental expert is appointed by either PECDAR or MOLG to monitor
CDP-II projects.
- No training seminars or workshops were conducted for the municipal engineers or
contractors.
- No environmental reporting is done.
- MEnA was not involved or consulted throughout the different phases of CDP-II.
The institution of ICDP should be tied up with commitment from the implementing
organizations "PECDAR and MOLG" to adopt the environmental management plan
proposed.

The baseline information for Gaza Strip and West Bank considering the environmental issues
listed below are described in details in Annex (II).
o Climate
o Available water resources and water quality
o Air quality
o Transportation
o Noise
o Vegetations
o Wildlife resources
o Marine life resources

ci Employment and income
o Archaeological resources
o3 Recreation and tourism
o Public health
5.    Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan
This section aims to coordinate the environmental policies, plans and programs and decisions
of various parties involved in the project, which exercise functions that affect the
environment. The aim is to minimize the duplication of procedures and provide consistency
in the protection of the environment.
Mitigation measures require a successful impact management plan implemented at the correct
time and in the correct way. This usually requires a clearly written and agreed plan of action
for managing impacts so that these are kept within the limits of acceptability. The monitoring
plan describes how and who will carry out the monitoring activities for addressing the
negative environmental issues. The Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan
contains:
Li Site Specific Environmental Screening Review and Assessment.
a3 Strengthening Environmental Expertise.
 Environmental Capacity Building and Training Program.
c Potential Environmental Impacts, Mitigation measures and Monitoring Plan.
Li EMP Cost Estimate and Schedule.
5.1   Site Specific Environmental Screening Review and Assessment
The screening and review process would be conducted in close coordination with MEnA.
Environmental review will be conducted by local experts and specific projects that have been
earmarked will be subjected to detailed site review and implementation of construction work
will be closely monitored. A standard appraisal / mitigation form will be used. The form will
basically include:
a- Current environmental problems such as soil erosion or water supply contamination at
the site, dust and air pollution.

ICDP
b- Any potential environmental impacts of the project, if any, due to the project.
c- Mitigation measures.
The project will use the "chance find" of any unrecorded archaeological sites that uncovered
during construction activities. This will be in close coordination with the Ministry of Tourism
and Antiquities.
5.2    Strengthening Environmental Expertise
Environmental expertise will be established within the implementation agency for the
coordination and supervision of the environmental activities funded through the ICDP. The
expert will work in close coordination with MENA and would basically do the following:
a- Conduct environmental reviews of sub projects and monitoring
b- Conduct site visits to review progress of and abidance with environmental measures.
c- Coordinate environmental training activities for staff, engineers and contractors
Part time environmental advisor (s) contracted from local and international firms will support
occasionally PECDAR and MEnA Staff.
5.3   Environmental Capacity Building and Training Program
Since there is limited capacity to undertake such actions within MENA, the training program
would be designed and implemented with assistance of local or international consultants. The
training would target three levels:
1- On-the-job training of a dedicated project management staff to direct activity planning,
design, and implementation with respect to environmental protection.
2- Training for staff of local authorities, municipalities, and village councils. The training
should be provided through short duration seminars and workshops. Overseas placements
and orientation visits, one-month duration, should also be provided for selected staff
members.
3- Training for contractors should be provided, including one or two days workshops for
local contractors, focusing on: preparation and use of the appraisal/mitigation form: use of
environmental guidelines, implementation of mitigation measures. Also they should be
trained on safety measures for construction workers, proper waste disposal and cleaning
measures during construction.
A complete capacity building program will need to provide a range of aids that can be used to
engender skill development and knowledge transfer. These can include:
o  Developing a library of environmental assessment reports;
o  Maintaining a database of informnation collected during the assessment;
o  Establishing a network of practitioners with experience in EIA or technical
analysis;
o  Collecting examples of good practice;
o Producing an environmental assessment newsletter;

o  Holding environmental art contests;
o  Establishing environmental awards in the workplace;
o  Inviting guest speakers on environmental issues;
o Holding an environment 'day' or 'week';
o  Producing desk aids such as a yearly calendar based on environmental themes;
o  Developing corporate policies or guidelines on the environment;
o  Designing corporate environmental posters and,
o  Developing corporate environmental programs.
5.4    Potential Environmental Impacts, Mitigation measures and Monitoring Plan
In order to implement sufficient and adequate EMP in terms of Projects monitoring, reporting
and project Supervision, the following actions are recommended:
o  Site-specific environmental screening and review process conducted at least two
times each year for a random selected projects.
o  Prepare a progress report two times a year addressing environmental issues, status
of mitigation measures taken and recommendations.
o  Progress on mitigation measures will be included in regular supervision reports
The projects and activities implemented under ICDP should be subjected to site specific
environmental assessment and review process. Environmental mitigation and monitoring
actions are presented in a simple matrix format. This includes identifying the issues,
mitigation measures, responsibility for carrying out the mitigation measures, environmental
monitoring, and responsibility for carrying out the monitoring actions. Table 5.1 handles these
issues in more details.
5.5    EMP Cost Estimate and Schedule
The estimated cost for the EMP is $ 105,000 and includes hiring an environmental expert,
capacity building and training programs and contingency budget for the chance find
archaeological survey. Table (5.2) lists the main components of EMP and the related cost.
A schedule for the implementation of the various activities of the Environmental Management
plan is prepared and shows the activities duration and timing of the proposed periodic
assessments. Table (5.3) shows the schedule of the project's major activities during the
proposed period of the project.

1.4 Beneficiaries        : Direct: 5,000 inhabitants, Indirect: 5,000 inhabitants.
1.5 Project Description
Jabalia Camp is one of the heavily populated areas in Gaza Strip. Daher Street extends from
El Sekka street in the east and connects to El Maslakh street (the main street in the eastern
Jabalia refugee camp) leading to the main local market of the camp. The street also connects
tributary roads and a lot of small passages between the houses. The road was a track road, 8
to 15m wide with a total length of 540m. The road was paved in (June 2000), 10m wide of
asphalt pavement and sidewalks 2m wide each.
The unpaved sandy road has been disturbing the features of the area, causing difficulties for
traffic movement and resulting in storm water accumulation ponds during winter seasons. Dust
generated by traffic over the unpaved road has been causing air pollution problems in the
area. In addition to that, the previous conditions of the road had caused heavy traffic
movement on other paved roads of the Camp. The above reasons made the develpoment of
this road necessary.
The development of the road was highly appreciated by local community of the area and the
surroundings where the project solved their problems. They are now requesting the
municipality for the completion of the sidewalks pavement.
The work included the following components:
* Asphalt paving covering 1 Om wide and 540m long of the street.
*  Curbstones for the two sides of the street.
No other infrastructure components were implemented due to limited fund.

3.5 Project Description
El Majaida Area is located at the center of Khan Younis city. The implemented project aimed
to develop and pave interior roads of the area. The unpaved sandy road has been disturbing
the features of the area, causing difficulties for traffic movement and resulting in storm water
accumulation ponds during winter seasons. Dust generated by traffic over the unpaved road
has been causing air pollution problems in the area. In addition to that, the previous conditions
of the road had caused heavy traffic movement on other paved roads of the Camp. The above
reasons made the development of this road necessary. . The development of the roads was
highly appreciated by the local community and surroundings where the project solved their
problems.
The project work included:

seasons.
* Natheir El Farra Street, which connects with Jamal Abd El Naser street. The street was
an unpaved sandy street causing clogging of storm water network at Jamal Abd El Naser

4.5 Project Description
The eastern areas of Rafah; (El Barasiel, El Salam, El Junaina and Kerbat El Adas) are
suffering from lake of wastewater networks. The inhabitants are using cesspits for disposing
their wastewater. Recently, Safe The Children Federation funded a project for installing a
sewage network in the eastern area to improve the health and environmental conditions in the
area. PECDAR in cooperation with the Ministry of Local Government awarded the project
(sewage network-phase IlIl -El Shaboura Camp) to the municipality. The main sewage line
connects the network of the eastern area to the existing main network of Rafah City. The
sewage line served the inhabitants and schools around the street.
Projects of the wastewater sector have the first priority for community improvement. Some
areas of Gaza Strip still depend on cesspits for wastewater disposal, which have sever
negative environmental and health impacts. The implementation of the project in Shaboura
area was highly appreciated in the community.
The project works included:
* Installation of a main sewage line, 300m long of 600mm diameter and 85m long of 200mm
diameter.
* Installation of 14 sewage manholes of 1.00 to 1.50m diameter.
* Reinstating the pavement layers of the cut trenches along the main sewage line and
resurfacing the asphalt layers.

5.5 Project Description
Rehabilitation of the main road in Tafouh (3km length and about 12m wide). The road was
paved more than 30 years ago. The pavement became deteriorated and unleveled causing
difficulties for traffic and public movement. By its location, Tafouh is located in Hebron
Governorate, it is linked to about 90% of the Governorate villages. The mentioned road is very
essential road, which links Tafouh with the surrounding villages.
The road topography is uncomfortable because the prevailing natural topography of Hebron
Governorate. So, the pavement has several impacts on the life, economy, education, health of
the people and their environmental situation and the whole aesthetic features of the area.
Many students (about 4700 students) come from Hebron city to attend schools in Tafouh. Also
schools are located on the developed road and the pavement facilitated the accessibility of
students to their schools.
Agriculture is one of the main economic activities in Tafouh, the road pavement will improve the
transportation activities of the crops from Tafouh to the neighboring villages.

6.5 Project Description
Ein Sinia village has only one school. The available classes are not able to adequately
accommodate all the students. The project comprised finishing works of three classrooms and a
corridor of an area about 200m2 by applying plastering, tiling and painting works. The work also
included installing doors, windows, gates, blackboards, security bars and electrical works in
addition to toilet units at an area of 20m2. The budget of the project was US$ 33,000.
The project will contribute to facilitating the life of students by avoiding them to travel to schools
in other cities like Ramallah or Senjel village. This will save their effort, time, and expenditures
and avoids accidents that could happen to students during their travel to farther places.
No adverse environmental impacts were noticed due to the project. The works were completed
during the summer season holiday.
All the labor force employed in the project was taken from the local residents of the village. This
contributed to some extent in dealing with the unemployment problem by creating temporary
jobs for the citizens of the village.
6.6 Project Objectives
* The project is enhancing the educational process at the village.
* The project provides additional and comfortable classes in the school.
* The project will save the transportation costs to the neighboring villages and cities.

accessibility. The agricultural villages like El Nassarieh are in urgent need for pavement
projects to develop the area, facilitate the traffic movement, pedestrian movement, and
enhance the economic activities as well as the connection the village' sides.
The project includes paving of three interior roads with total length of 1km and an average
width 3m of asphalt paving.
The project is highly appreciated by the municipality staff as well as the local community in El
Nassarieh as it will rise their willing to develop the village and implement more projects.

III.    Environmental Issues and Project Impacts
This section sunmnarizes the environmental baseline and potential impacts of the ICDP types of micro projects
considering the following environmental issues:

L   Air quality
E   Transportation
O   Noise
0   Vegetations
U   Wildlife resources
L   Marine life resources

O   Public health
111.1   Climate
Existing Condition
Gaza Strip is characterized by semi-arid climate. The average daily mean temperature ranges between 25 °C in the
summer to 13 °C in the winter. The daily average wind speed ranges between 3.9 mrs to 4.2 m/s in the sunimer and
winter respectively. The temperature in the West Bank varies according to the geographical position, altitude, and
exposure to marine influences. Generally, the average temperature in summer varies between 20 and 30 °C
reaching a maximum of 43 °C and the average temperature in winter is bout 11 °C, reaching as low as -3 °C. Wind
direction is predomninantly from the west and northwest as a speed of 10-13 knots and 10-12 knots, respectively.
Wind speeds blowing from the south range from 3-5 knots.
Impacts
The micro projects under ICDP are of a very small scale to cause any environmental impact on a global issue like
climate. Thus no impacts are anticipated.
111.2   Available Water Resources and Water Quality
Existin2 Condition
In Gaza Strip groundwater aquifer is the only source of fresh water, which is severely polluted, mainly by salt
water, nitrates and other pollutants. Gaza Strip is in critical situation that requires immediate and concerted efforts
to improve the water situation in terms of quality and quantity. Demand greatly exceeds water supply and very
limited water supplied for domestic use is potable. Chloride concentration varies from 30 to 1500 mg/l with an
average of 400 mg/I. Nitrate concentrations varies from 13 to 380 mg/l with an average of 110 mg/I. The only
major freshwater Nvaterway is the Wadi Gaza; water flows in Wadi Gaza few days a year, during heavy storms. The
rest of the year, it is mainly a conduit for sewage effluent and a dumping ground for various types of refuse.
The major resources available existing in the West Bank are the Jordan River and West Bank Aquifer system.
Rainfall is the source of all water resource in the West Bank. The mean annual rainfall as a long-term average
ranges between 500 and 600 mnmi with and average volume of about 3000 MCM/yr. Of these, approximately 600-
650 MCM/yr infiltrates into the soil and rock strata to recharge the groundwater basins. Palestinians have access to
only about 20% of these figures. The second resource in the West Bank is the Jordan River. Of 1470 MCM annual
flow; very minor quantity reaches the Palestinian riparian in the West Bank, which is of bad quality. The
deterioration of Jordan River water quality is attributed to the upstream utilization by other riparian and to saline
springs which are diverted by Israel into the Lower Jordan River.

............................................................................................................................................ ........ ma......................................................................... 
In the West bank, generally, the water quality is much better than in Gaza Strip and it is not an issue except for
some springs with regards to salinity, hardness, and fecal coliform. The average Chloride concentration is about
150 mg/I and the average nitrate concentration is about 43 mg/I.
Impacts
In general, minor pollution risk due to spillage from cesspits or breakdown of sewer and water lines were lirnited to
construction stage. In Gaza the risk was higher due to the fact that the groundwater aquifer is much shallower than
that of the West Bank. On the other hand, sewage lines projects are found to have great positive impact on water
resources as it reduces the risk of ground water contamination by eliminating cesspits and discharge to open
spaces. Road projects increase runoff quantities and reduce direct infiltration of rainwater to the aquifer due to
increasing impervious surfaces. Agricultural projects, if implemented on large scale, would improve the efficiency
of water use and in turn reduce the pressure on water resources. Thus, these projects should be directed towards
irrigation technology improvement of the existing surface irrigation.
111.3   Air Quality
Existing Condition
Compared to other environmental issues within the Gaza Strip, air quality is not considered to be a priority. With
the exception of fugitive particulate emissions, the ambient air quality appears to be acceptable. This is because
the Gaza Strip is well ventilated with ample dispersion of enissions from the primary air emission sources, namely
trucks and automobiles. Winds are either from the Mediterranean or from the Negev desert, neither of which is a
source of anthropogenic emissions. Particulate matter appears to be principally in the form of dust from disturbed
surfaces. The streets, paved and unpaved, are sources of particulates that are entrained into the air from motor
vehicle tires and the wind. This occurs because the streets are not cleaned, there is little groundcover, and street
drainage is poor, resulting in thick layers of silt deposits.
The West Bank, which houses few heavy industries, suffers from substantial air pollution especially in the main
urban areas and their vicinities. More than 90% of the pollution is a result of human activities. The increase in
population of the West Bank, the expanding of industrial activities, and the transboundary air pollutants are key
factors to the deterioration of air quality in the West Bank. The lack of preventive legislation, codes and regulation
to protect the environment leads to the heightening of the effect of the human activities on air pollution. Climate
and topography play a crucial role in transmitting air pollutants from one place to another. Among the most
common and dangerous air pollutants in the West Bank are sulfur dioxide (SO2), suspended particulate matter
(dust), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon oxides (COx) and lead Pb.
Impacts
In case of sewage, water, and building projects, the impacts on air quality were limited to construction period.
These impacts were limited to construction time and were localized within the project area. During operation no
impacts are anticipated. Road projects reduce dust generated from sandy unpaved roads generated by motor
vehicles and people. On the other hand, they have mninor negative impacts since they increase air pollution by
emitting Carbon Monoxide (CO) due to additional traffic.
III.4   Transportation
Existin2 Condition
The road network in the Gaza Strip, which totals approximately 168 linear kin, consists of a poorly developed and
largely neglected road system. Regional (north-south) transportation is limnited to Salah El-Dean Road or Road #4.
Agricultural road networks do not exist. The same conditions exist in the West Bank. Transportation is the largest
contributor to pollution that affects the air quality in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Its impacts are seen in the poor
air quality along roadsides and degradation of buildings along traveled roads. The impacts of transportation can be
fairly well estimated by knowing the number of vehicles operating in the West Bank, along with traffic and road
conditions. At least 45,385 tons of CO, 3,258 tons of SOx, 3,723 tons of NOx, 5,447 ton of hydrocarbons (HC)
volatile organic compounds and 212 tons of lead were emitted to the West Bank's atmosphere in 1996 considering
the number of registered cars only. Added to this, there are approximately 36,500 settlers' cars in the West Bank

which are estimated to emit around 11,483 tons of CO, 1,185 tons of SOx, 1,299 tons of NOx, 1,628 tons of HC
and 80 tons of lead to the West Bank's atmosphere.
Impacts
In general, the micro projects under ICDP are of a very small scale to cause any environmental impact. Minor
localized impacts were limited to traffic disturbance during construction. Improvement of roads is expected to
increase traffic flow to a certain area, which may locally increase most of the above-mentioned emissions but will
reduce air pollution associated with dust.
III.5   Noise
Sources of noise pollution in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are mainly traffic and motor vehicles, construction
of roads and buildings and industrial activities in addition to the noise pollution resulting from Israel military
aircraft and military training activities. In Palestine, the noise pollution from cars has increased since there has
been no improvement in the road systems and the number of cars rises by about 12% every year leaving the system
more crowded. Noise pollution is also increased because most of the vehicles are old and not in good working
condition. Moreover, it is the habit of the people to use their horns frequently specially in traffic jams. In many
places, vehicles noise pollution is exacerbated by the topography of the West Bank; vehicles produce greater noise
as they work to climb hills. For security reasons, there are now more checkpoints both at the entrance to Israel and
often between areas inside the Gaza Strip and West Bank. These checkpoints interrupt the flow of traffic and cause
areas of intense vehicle noise, especially when the frustration level rises and horns are used. Industries add to the
noise pollution since they are unregulated and often operating below the standard. Many of the industrial facilities
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank are located near or within residential areas, making the noise a problem for
neighbors. Road and building construction add great amounts of noise to life in the commercial centers,
neighborhoods and rural areas.
Impacts
In case of sewage, water, and building projects, the noise impacts were limnited to construction period due to
construction machineries. These impacts were limited to construction time and were localized within the project
area. During operation no impacts are anticipated. Road projects have minor negative impacts since they increase
noise due to additional traffic. The negative impacts can be minimized by mitigation measures and follow up the
environmental management plan.
III.6   Vegetation
Existing Condition
Palestine contains 114 families of flora with 2,483 species. Undisturbed vegetation hardly exists in the entire Gaza
Strip due to the fact that most of the land uses is dominated by urban and agricultural use. The overpopulation has
resulted in intense development and pollution pressures and in the over-exploitation of Gaza's natural resources.
The coastal dunes have somewhat higher species richness than other areas. The eastern plains, which receive only
150 to 300 mm of rainfall annually, are characterized by patchy dwarf shrub vegetation adapted to the loess soils
and extreme temperatures. The cultivated species of agriculture are directly contributing and supporting the mnajor
agricultural income for the Palestinian economy. The economical value of several biological uses could be; Food
Plants, Medical Plant (the West Bank is rich with plants that have different medical values, such as herbs, gums
and resin plants), Forest Plants (forests cover approximately 51.5 km2 of the area of the West Bank), Ornamnental
Planits, the beauty of wild flora in the West Bank gives a significant ornamental importance to the area.
Impacts
Indirectly, improving water and wastewater services would increase the amount of wastewater available for
treatment and thus, reuse in irrigation altering the vegetation. Construction of few structures and roads
aboveground has caused some disturbance to the vegetation within the immediate vicinity of the footprints of these
facilities. It is not anticipated that unique vegetation of special concern to be affected by these types of projects due
to the scale issues.

111.7   Wild Life Resources
Existinp_ Condition
Palestine has a wide variety of habitats and consequently a wide range of fauna. Fauna in Palestine consists of 67
families of birds of which 45 are of local breeds, 33 families of mammals, and 93 species of amphibians. The
majority of the bird species seen in the Gaza Strip are migratory, since the region is near a major migratory flyway
from Africa to the Paratactic and Eurasia. As a result, dense bird populations, representing approximately 185
species, can be found in the Gaza Strip in the spring and fall (UNDP, 1997 and PEPA, 1994). Two of the most
abundant birds are crows and house sparrows, considered a nuisance to agriculture. In the West Bank,
approximately 470 species of birds are present in the West Bank. The 470 species of birds belong to 260 Genera,
divided into more than 65 famrilies and 21 orders. The number of manmmalian species in Palestine reaches 113,
including 27 different species of bats.
Impacts
Generally, in case of small-scale construction activities, the potential to destroy the habitat of various reptiles,
manmnals, or amphibians within the footprints of the construction sites were limited to construction stages. Bird
species would be unlikely affected by operation of the assessed projects, since they have the ability to relocate
more easily to similar, potentially, mnore distant habitats.
III.8   Marine Life Resources
Existine Condition
Marine species of the Gaza Strip consist primarily of fish resources, which are characterized by low densities due
to the oligotrophic conditions of this part of the Mediterranean. More than 270 known Mediterranean fish species
inhabit this coastal part; however, only seven percent of these are indigenous species. Marine fishery resources are
of great importance to the population and contribute much to their income and sustainability. In addition to fish,
approximately 250 species of macrobenthic organisms are recorded in the Gaza Strip coastal waters, to depths of
80 m. These include members of Mollusca, Crustacea, and Polycheata.
Impacts
The assessed projects components do not have pronounable impact on the marine life as it is of smnall scale relative
to marine environment.
III.9   Population and Housing
Existing Condition
The population of the Gaza Strip is characterized by three distinct sectors: an urban population, a rural population,
and a refugee camp population. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the population of the Gaza
Strip to be approximately 1.001 million persons in 1997 (PCBS, 1997). The population density within the eight
refugee camps is nearly 38,600/square ki, placing it among the most densely populated areas in the world. Even
the urban areas have population densities of approximately 15,400/square km. The population of the West Bank is
estimated at 1.66 million people in 1996 (PCBS, 1997). The West Bank has a population density if approximately
260 individuals/km2. However, urban areas in the West Bank, which are the focal point for almost 34% of the
West Bank population suffer from higher population densities. The remaining 66% are distributed over more than
540 villages and hamlets and 18 refugee Camps.
Impacts
Generally, the assessed micro projects were found to have positive environmental impacts on the issue of
population and housing. Sewage lines projects are found to have great positive impacts regarding the overall
environmental situation. It reduces the risk of pollution and waterbome diseases and reduces the daily work of
women in cleaning and cloth washing by eliminating open space discharge of raw sewage where children are
playing. This kind of projects provides comfortable access to schools, mosques and houses without any problems.
Although road and pavement projects may increase accidents risk due to traffic, it will improve the economic value
of the land and encourage organized housing and small businesses. Construction of classrooms and sanitation
services for schools enh1ances the educational process by providing more space and cleaner environment for

111.10 Employment and Income
Existin2i conditions
The total workforce in Gaza Strip is estimated at 202,000. The unemployment rate is about 20.9% of the total work
force. The tables below show the distribution of the work force among different sectors and professions in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.

Impacts
These types of projects provide some short-term and fewer long term job opportunities for local community.
Sewage and water projects have great positive impacts on the overall environmental situation. This in turn reduces
the expenditures on medication by reducing the risk of pollution and waterbome diseases. Road and pavement
projects reduce the expenditures on vehicles maintenance. It also improves the economic value of land and creates
more investment opportunities.
III.11  Agricultural Resources
Existing Condition
Historically, agriculture functions as the main source of income in Palestinian economy. However. Israel has
imposed restrictions on the amount of fresh water that can be used by Palestinian farmers. As such, irrigated
agriculture in the West Bank becomes limited comprising only approximately 6% of the entire cultivated area. In
Gaza Strip, iirigated agriculture comprises about 60% of the cultivated land and consumes about 70 % of the water
abstraction from the over utilized polluted aquifer. Irrigated agriculture, however, is a source of environmental
pollution because of extensive use of pesticides, fertilizers and plastic sheets. Famiers have used increasing doses
of chemicals at a persistent rate particularly in irrigated farming without knowing the negative effects of such
practice. The intense use of chemicals can cause severe illness and death as well as soil and water contamination
especially in Gaza Shallow aquifer. With the increase of population, demand for agricultural land increases while
forests and grazing land gradually diminishes. This leads to further degradation of the environment.
Impact
Excavation and backfilling activities usually generate dust. The prevailing winds may carry the suspended matters
a round the construction site. This may affect the nearby crops as it reduces temporarily photosynthesis and causes
flower falling during flowvering stage. This impact is usually limited to construction stage. In the long run pavement
of roads will reduce dust generated from moving traffic over unpaved roads. Sewage and water supply projects
would increase the potential of wastewater treatment and thus, reuse in agriculture. Proposed agricultural projects

by ICDP should be directed towards water use efficiency improvement and enhancement of water conservation and
reuse to avoid imposing more pressure on available water resources.
III.12 Archaeological Resources
Existin2 Condition
The geographical location of the Gaza Strip has contributed to its notable and diverse history and heritage. The
Gaza Strip is located midway along the ancient sea highway connecting Egypt and the remainder of Africa to the
south, with the Land of Canaan and Asia to the north. This highway was referred to in Egyptian inscriptions as the
"Horus Way", in the Old Testament as "The Way to the Land of the Philistines", and during the Greek and Roman
period as "Via Maris", the seaway. The hundreds of settlements along the shoreline west of the north-south
highway or along the caravan road have left a broad range of archaeological evidence, representing the material
culture of almost seven thousand years of history, and reflecting the influx of international material and influence.
The West Bank (about 5,690 square krm) is one of the most important historical parts of Palestine. During the last
century a large number of archeological sites were discovered and excavated. They present the different historical
phases of the area since the Neolithic time down to the present day. The most important sites are located in
Jerusalem, Which was first built by the Jebu sites some 6,000 years ago. Jerusalem possesses many archaeological
sites and historical buildings concentrating within the walled and fortified old city and the close surrounding area.
A summary of the main archaeological sites in the West Bank is presented in the Anmexes.
Impacts
Implenmentation of similar projects would have the potential to uncover, damage, or destroy archaeological
resources. Numerous undiscovered resources may be within a few meters of the soil surface and remain unknown
in the future, unless unearthed by future construction or excavation. In future construction work, excavation should
be done carefully especially in areas of potential archaeological sites. Once the construction is completed, negative
impacts are no more anticipated.
111.13 Recreation and Tourism
Existin2 conditions
The beaches along the 40 km of coast of Gaza are the main source of recreation for Gaza population. However, the
seawater is often below generally recognized standards for swimmners, and the beaches themselves contain
dangerous waste. Palestine in general and the West bank in particular is considered the earliest spot where humnan
civilization started. The above-mentioned archaeological sites and historical buildings, specifically in Jerusalern,
Bethlehem, Nablus and Jericho are considered the most important potential for the Palestinian tourism industry.
They give the traveler a continuing sense of history. In spite of the achieved investment in the field of tourism, the
Palestinian tourism industry is still need to be developed. In addition to the historic sites, the territories of the West
Bank have the most exceptional aesthetic and topographical features in Palestine. The West Bank is divided
longitudinally into three distinct geographical strips: the central highlands, the eastern slopes and the Jordan
Valley.
Impacts
Generally, all infrastructure projects inprove the environmental awareness of the people as the projects
implementation is enhancing the people to work seriously to keep their environment clean. To a certain extent,
pavement of access roads may encourage tourism to this particular place. The other assessed projects nmlay not have
any impact on tourism resources, as the physical constructions are very lirmited.
III.14 Public Health
Existing conditions
It is apparent that waterbome pathogenic bacteria, parasites, and viruses curTently pose a major health problem for
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The health status of the residents of refugee camps and municipalities indicates
strongly that the environment remains a source of disease. Only 5% of the water supplied for drinking in Gaza strip
satisfies WHO guidelines. The water of most of the springs in the West Bank is contaminated with coliform

bacteria, particularly with fecal coliform, Its quality ranges between 'hard' to 'very hard' and may need softening
to reduce the effects of excessive use of detergents.
The poor wastewater collection, conveyance, and storage, in combination with improper solid waste disposal and
an inadequate drinking water supply and distribution, has led to increased health risks associated with mosquitoes,
large flies, rats, and other vectors. Stagnant pools of wastewater and/or storm water enhance mosquito breeding
and large fly populations. These stagnant pools include areas such as the sullage ditches within refugee camps,
low-lying points filled with a mix of storm water and wastewater overflow, and improper dumping grounds of
household liquid waste.
Public health risks are also related to risks generated by any activity related to the construction or the operation
phase of the project those may include; Risk of accidents by transportation facilities or construction equipment,
noise generated by construction facilities or operating generators, and Dust and air pollution.
Impact
During the construction phase, the impact of ICDP project components depends mainly on the sector of the
proposed activity. Negative impacts on workers health may arise due to the exposure to noise, high temperature,
dust, and work accidents. These impacts could be characterized as local, direct, short-term and mostly
insignificant.
Implementation of small scale sewage and water projects may not solve the water quality problemns in terms of
salinity and TDS but, would locally provide better water supply and sanitation services for the conmmunity under
consideration. These services include more reliable water supply and healthy disposal of wastewater. This will
indirectly cause lower incidence of disease, lower infant mortality, and an overall longer life span.
The improvement of level of services would decrease the risk associated groundwater pollution, thus reducing the
spread of pathogenic infectious diseases. Proper wastewater collection, conveyance, and storage will reduce health
risks associated with mosquitoes, large flies, rats, and other vectors.
Road pavement projects will reduce dust generated by moving vehicles on unpaved roads but may increase other
vehicles emissions due to potential increase in traffic over paved roads. It would also increase the accidents risk
due to increased speed. These impacts can be easily mitigated through traffic regulations and monitoring.
