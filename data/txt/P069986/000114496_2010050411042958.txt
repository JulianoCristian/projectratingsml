equal to or exceed the equivalent of $3,000,000. 
2. 
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible

Special Account, and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account, shall be 
made as follows: 
 
(a) 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall

equivalent of twice the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount

such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice 
will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures. 
 
6. 
(a) 
If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that any payment 
out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible
