F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
Project Objective: To expand access to comprehensive and evidence-based HIV/AIDS prevention,
treatment, and care programs by supporting a network of subregional learning sites to expand training of
health care practitioners. The project supported HIV/AIDS-related health sector human resource capacity
building in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania using a training-of-trainers (TOT) model. The project
components include (a) health care practitioner training; (b) monitoring, evaluation and knowledge-sharing;
and (c) program coordination. It was expected that, as a result of increased capacity among health care
practitioners in the subregion, this project would contribute to the enhanced delivery of HIVIA IDS-related
services, stronger linkages between prevention and care interventions, and expanded South-South
partnerships.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.      HIV IAIDS is a major economic, social, and human challenge to Sub-Saharan Africa:
Two-thirds of all people infected with HIV-22.5 million people with HIV live in the region. The
impact of HIV I AIDS on households, human capital, the private sector, and the public sector
undermines the alleviation of poverty.
1.1 Context at Appraisal
2.       Country situations with respect to HIV/AIDS at appraisal were dire: Ethiopia, Kenya, and
Tanzania were among the most heavily affected countries by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. A
UNAIDS estimate as of December 2003 put the national adult prevalence rate in Ethiopia at 4.4
percent, indicating that 1.5 million Ethiopians (adults and children) were living with HIV I AIDS.
There were also estimated to be 720,000 AIDS orphans (under the age of 17 ye'ars) in Ethiopia at
that point. The national adult prevalence rate in Kenya was estimated to be 6.7 percent in
December 2003, with 1.2 million individuals living with HIV/AIDS and 650,000 orphans. In
Tanzania, the corresponding adult prevalence rate was 8.8 percent, with 1.6 million individuals
living with HIV/AIDS and over 980,000 orphans.?
3.       In responding to this challenge, three countries committed to containing the epidemic by
developing' universal prevention, care, and treatment interventions for their populations. They
placed a high priority on the provision of relevant and comprehensive training for health care
practitioners involved in HIV/AIDS.
4.     ,Similarly, addressing HIV/AIDS challenges and focusing on capacity issues were also
prominent in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategies (CAS) for Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania.
The common focus of the three countries' CASs was to improve human development outcomes
by enhancing pro-poor growth and reducing vulnerability. The strategies indicated that the health
sector was essential to achieving this goal, and pointed out HIV I AIDS as the biggest challenge
faced by the sector. The Ethiopia CAS identified that the shortage of skilled human resources in
HIVIAIDS as the foremost threat to national poverty and vulnerability reduction efforts. The
Kenya CAS stated that HIV/AIDS was a top priority for the government. In the case of Tanzania,
the CAS noted the emergence of HIVIA IDS as a multi-sectoral development issue posing a
severe constraint to poverty alleviation efforts.
5.       The essentials of stopping this trend are prevention, treatment and care. s The majority of
country level responses in late 1990s/early 2000 aimed at addressing these pillars. Despite
increased levels of political commitment at both national and international levels, substantial
deficiencies remained in building the necessary capacity in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Part
of the capacity gap resulted from the lack of financing by development partners and donors for
capacity building projects at the time of appraisal. A more fundamental factor was that the
additional skills and approaches required for an effective response to HIV I AIDS were not
typically part of these countries' health systems. Also the health systems in these countries were
relatively weak and under-resourced prior to the advent of AIDS, which has since served to
exacerbate these institutional and financial vulnerabilities. During project appraisal, the maturing
epidemic was placing greater strains on these already over-stretched systems, as the demand for
health services grew concurrently with increasing morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS also has
led to resurgenc~ in tuberculosis, a lethal synergy, which required yet more additional efforts and

resources. This meant a dramatically increased workload for healthcare practitioners, among
other strains on the healthcare system.
6.      The result was that at a time when resources for HIV/AIDS were starting to increase, the
capacity to translate the investments in equipment, drugs and other commodities for HIV/AIDS
control was limited as low capacity among healthcare workers remained a significant problem.
The African Regional Capacity Building Network for HIV / AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care
(ARCAN) project was designed to address this challenge in three large countries.
7.       The Governments of Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania and the Bank jointly adopted the
"training-of-trainers" (TOT) model to address the capacity problem through this operation, where
health care practitioners from three countries were to be brought together at regional learning sites.
Project designers envisioned that African Regional Capacity Building Network for HIV/AIDS
Prevention, Treatment and Care (ARCAN) project trainees would then train other health workers
upon return to their countries. In determining the content for the training, project design adopted,
to a large extent, the findings of a 2003 USAID study that analyzed the capacity needs for
HIV / AIDS-related training in 12 Eastern and Southern African countries. The subsequent choice
to deliver the trainings in multiple countries a~d institutes, on the other hand, was made due to (i)
the lack of a single country that possessed training programs with the requisite proven
implementation capacity and expertise in all priority areas and (ii) the desire to promote south-
south learning through exchange of experiences between health workers. Given the increasing
challenges faced by under-resourced healthcare workers, their low technical capacity and the
relative absence of financial support towards building it, the project's choice to invest in targeted
human capacity development through training was appropriate.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.       The original PD~ was "to expand access to comprehensive and evidence-based
HIVIAIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs by supporting a network of subregional
learning sites to expand training of health care practitioners ". The PD~ was formulated
differently in the legal agreement to account for the full range of activities supported under the
project: "to expand access to comprehensive and evidence based HIVIAIDS prevention, treatment,
and care programs in Participating Countries by: (a) supporting a network oflearning sites for
the training of health care practitioners; (b) increasing the capacity of health care practitioners;
(c) enhancing the delivery of HIVIAIDS-related services; (d) strengthening linkages between
prevention and care interventions; and (e) expanding South-South partnerships. "
9.       At the time of project design, there was a sense that while physical access to HIV / AIDS
services was starting to expand (thanks to investments in equipment and commodities), human
resource capacity constraints caused effective access to lag (because physical availability of
services was not being translated into functioning HIV/AIDS services). The project rationale and
description suggests that the primary focus of the project was therefore to improve capacity of
HIV /AIDS service providers as a means to translating the physical access to HIV / AIDS services
into effective access where capacity was lacking.
10.     Key performance indicators stated in the PAD were as follows:
        I. Increase in the percent/number of successful ARCAN "graduates" (i.e. those who
        conduct at least the minimum required level of cascade training in the first six months
        after their preliminary training) whose effectiveness was predicted on the basis of the
        project's student selection criteria ratings, pre- and post-course tests/evaluations, and/or
        rating 0 ftraining work plan quality.
        2. Increase in percent of service delivery points in ARCAN countries with one (or more)
        primary recipients of project-supported TOT training.
                                                  2
          3. Increase in level of job satisfaction reported by ARCAN graduates one year after
          course completion.

1.3 Revised PDO
11.    The PDO and KPls remained the same throughout project implementation. (See 2.3
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design: Implementation and Utilization for more details).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
12.     Primary beneficiaries were professionals in the health sector, including physicians, nurses,
counselor supervisors, laboratory technicians, HIVI AIDS program managers as well as
procureinent and supply chain management specialists drawn from government, private sector
and NGOs, working in urban and rural areas of the participating countries.
13.      The indirect beneficiaries were people with HIV/AIDS and TB, as well as cases where
HIV I AIDS and TB were averted. A secondary group of beneficiaries expected to benefit from
the project were institutions which provided the training. Also, those with HIV I AIDS and TB in
the three countries are another set of beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components
14.     The project had three components. The components and their estimated costs remained
unc;hanged throughout implementation:

a.    Health care practitioner training component (US$ 7.72 million; 80.4% of project costs)
      aimed to support the implementation of short-term (non-diploma) training courses for the
      primary project beneficiaries (professionals in the health sector, including physicians, nurses,
      counselor supervisors, laboratory technicians, HIV/AIDS program managers as well as
      procurement and supply chain management specialists). The courses were to follow the ToT
      approach, where graduates of the course would train their colleagues upon return to their
      work stations; also known as "cascading". The ToT approach and cascading model were
      designed to maximize sub-regional capacity building by training as many healthcare workers
      as possible, despite relatively modest resources.

b. Monitoring and evaluation and knowledge sharing component (US$ 0.38 million; 4.0% of
   project costs) was designed to establish an M&E system that would enable the rapid synthesis
   and sharing of lessons learned from the project. Routine dissemination of HIV IAIDS-related
   program information would also be financed under this component to ensure greater
   knowledge sharing between and within counties. Under this component, the project would
   also explore options for distance learning to maximize resources and to ensure a broader
   regional approach for sharing experiences and enhancing skills.

c.    Program coordination component (US$ 1.5 million; 15.6% of project costs) aimed to support
      the development of strong coordination and capacity building between ARCAN counties and
      their implementing, coordinating, and governing agencies. A major focus of this component
      involved providing the ARCAN Project Coordination Unit (PCU) with support to conduct its
      administrative, fiduciary, and technical responsibilities.


1.6 Revised Components
15.       Components remained unchanged


                                                   3
1.7 Other significant changes
16.     The composition of the PCU was overhauled in May 2006, when the original PCU staff
members were terminated and a new group of staff was hired. This was welcome as it (i) helped
improve relations between the Bank and the three countries by addressing the clients' concern
over the transparency of the hiring ofthe original PCU, and (ii) untangled a number of key
operational issues, such as the drafting of the implementation manual or conclusion of contractual
agreements with the training centers (see 2.2 Implementation).
17.      The project was extended from its. original closing d!lte on June 30, 2009 to April 30,
20 10, in order to have a little more time to complete project activities and resolve outstanding tax
issues due to the regional nature of the project (see 2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance).
18.     In 2009, training courses were expanded to include prevention and control ofHIV/AIDS
and TB co-infections. This change was important in addressing the growing number of co-
infections and was responsive to global concerns about multi-drug resistant TB (see 2.2
Implementation).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
19.       During project preparation, the team drew lessons learned from existing AIDS projects,
most of which were in a stage of "emergency response". Lessons drawn for the preparation of
ARCAN from these projects included: (i) the crucial need to build capacity at all levels of the
healthcare workforce to develop a long-term, sustained response to HIVI AIDS; (ii) importance of
having a strong and flexible M&E system to track performance and capture lessons learned; and
(iii) an emphasis on partnership and collaboration among governments, public and private sectors,
civil society, donors and specialized agencies. The regional approach of ARCAN was not widely
tested at the time of project design, particularly in addressing HIV I AIDS issues. Nonetheless, the
design features adopted by the team appeared sound (e.g., TOT model; involving reputable
institutions; accomplishing efficiency gains by involving regional bodies and exploiting
opportunities for south-south learning).
20.      While acknowledging key design challenges, the PAD correctly identified most of the
potential risks posed, and recommended close monitoring of implementation as the main way to
mitigate the risks. In retrospect, the two key shortcomings of the risk assessment were: (i) the
underestimation of the risks associated with the funding for the cascading element9 and (ii) failure
to have the respective ministries of health to officially endorse the training and recognize the
ARCAN graduation certification.

2.2 Implementation
21.     The project implementation had four distinct phases:(i) the period between approval in
September 2004 and November 2005, which was dominated by disputes among the clients and
between the clients and the Bank, effectively bringing the project to a halt at the onset; (ii) a
subsequent two year phase of strong team leadership that addressed many of the problems and got
the project back on track; (iii) a period during which the project's progress slowed, and (iv) a
final phase starting in September 2009 during which project performance picked up and all
outstanding operational issues were addressed.


9Within the ARCAN context, cascading is the provision of training by ARCAN graduates to their fellow
colleagues upon return to their workstations.

                                                  4
22.      The project's regional nature, which brought implementation efficiency (section 3.3),
high design relevance (section 3.1) and other gains to the project, posed challenges in practical
issues such as the location and staffing of the PCU. Disagreements on these issues during project
start up created friction among the clients and the TTL, which delayed the start of project
activities. To help break the stalemate, the Bank appointed a new TTL to the project in May 2005.
This improved relations with clients which allowed the team to address operational problems,
namely: (i) termination of the original PCU which lacked the necessary human resources and
hiring a new and competent PCU team; (ii) addressing procurement irregularities; (iii) approving
the project operations manual, which was a condition of effectiveness; (iv) conducting a financial
audit and fraud investigation; (e) approval of operational manual, administrative and financial
management handbooks for the project; (t) start of the main project activity - the trainings, and
(g) involvement of health specialists in country offices in implementation. As a result, the project
was lifted out of problem status.
23.      The number of trainees reached over 1,000 by mid-2007. Ofthese, 35 had held cascade
training by that time. DO and IP ratings, which were unsatisfactory, through 2006, became
satisfactory. At project mid-term review (MTR) held in October 2007, task team and clients
agreed to involve health specialists in Bank offices in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania in the project
with the objective of improving, among other things, the link between ARCAN and National
AIDS Commissions/ Councils (NAC). Specifically, it was decided that Bank health specialists in
client country offices would help convene national forums where A TGs presented their
achievements, challenges, and future plans ensure that NACs would provide funding for cascade
training through national MAP projects they managed and promote effective use of A TGs
through other programs.
24.      Following the improvements in project performance, the TTL moved to another duty
station and a Washington-based operations analyst became the de-facto team leader. During this
period, implementation was weakened by the lack of TTL response to numerous no-objection
requests for operational and procurement issues, tax reimbursement problems and an overdue
external project evaluation. Sector management did not address these issues, while the clients'
attempts to move activities along were limited.
25.      In September 2009, task team leadership changed hands to a seasoned TTL based in
Tanzania. During this period, the outstanding operational issues were addressed-including the
resolution of tax reimbursement problem, and the much delayed external project evaluation was
completed 10 and the project was extended to ensure full completion of critical activities. A
regional dissemination and stakeholder workshop was also organized to discuss post
implementation strategy.
26.       ARCAN implementation produced the following commendable aspects: First is the
flexibility shown during implementation to address changing training demands. Highlighted as a
significant risk during project design, the HIV /AIDS response to is a rapidly changing field and
rigid training content would have been to the detriment of meeting the project objectives.
ARCAN successfully adapted to the changing circumstances of the field by (i) regularly updating
its training curriculum to present the most up to date information, as well as by (ii) introducing
new trainings as they became necessary. The decision to deliver the training in the specialized
regional institutes of excellence contributed significantly to the achievement of the first point,
while the proactivity of the task team enabled the latter. Launching of the new training program



IOThe external project evaluation conducted in March 20lOby a third party (ITAD, UK) to assess the effects
of ARCAN training by measuring the change in trainees' technical knowledge and professional behavior as
a result of the training as well as the effects of increased trainee capacity in health institutions they work.

on combined diagnosis and care of tuberculosis (TB) and HfV/AIDS in May 2009, for instance, is
a good practice example for content flexibility. The second noteworthy element is the attention to
quality during implementation. This will be discussed in greater detail under the achievement of
project objectives (section 3.2).
27.      In sum, ARCAN implementation was flexible to changing training demands, paid special
attention to quality and produced significant and concrete results.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
28.      Design at appraisal stage chose indicators that are measurable, but did not include
baselines and targets. It should be noted, however, that this was common practice at the time,
particularly for HIV I AIDS projects due to the new nature of the interventions and absence of
established benchmarks. Target estimate values, however, were established in April 30, 2005,
shortly after project launch. During project revival phase in 2006 and later in project
implementation, the task team paid close attention to M&E and highlighted M&E as an area of
improvement in Aide-memoires and ISRs. PCU's work on monitoring progress was
complemented by a third party project evaluation undertaken in March 2010. Conducted by IT AD
Consultants, UK, the evaluation assessed the effects of ARCAN training by measuring the change
in ATGs' technical knowledge and professional behavior as a result of the training as well as the
effects of increased trainee capacity in health institutions they work. To this end, the study
specifically analyzed behavioral change, knowledge and skills gained and retained and changes in
HIV I AIDS health care provision practices among ARCAN graduates, as well as their satisfaction
with the training material. The study conducted document reviews, administered web surveys
(reaching out to JOI respondents) as well as interviews with 60 ATGs and 28 beneficiaries of
cascade training, in the three countries. The data and findings of the evaluation are extensively
used in this report.
29.      Two following M&E design and implementation elements are of importance:

(i)     PDQ: The PDO should have been worded more carefully to explicitly match the PDO
        with the scope of the project. Nonetheless, the PAD acknowledged that while capacity
        building alone will not expand access to HfV I AIDS prevention and care, it is an
        important means to translate the physical access to HIV I AIDS services into effective
        access where capacity is lacking.
(ii)    Indicators: The project's M&E structure contained measurable indicators such as the
        number of people trained directly by the project, the amount of money raised for
        cascading or the number of people trained through cascading. During implementation, the
        project team rigorously tracked this essential information. While tracking output level
        data adequately, the results framework would have benefitted from indicators that
        measured output quality (i.e. training quality) and outcomes (i.e. the post-training change
        in A TG behavior in executing their professional duties). Seeing this gap, the team
        specifically focused the external project evaluation on analyzing training quality and
        behavior change, and used the data from the evaluation to complement the formal results
        framework.


30.     Aide-memoires and ISRs, as well as interv"iews conducted for this report indicate that the
team was well aware of these shortcomings in the M&E system, wanted to make the necessary
improvements and began the work for a formal restructuring of the project. However, after the
preliminary work and discussions, task team and Bank management decided not to move forward
with a formal restructuring since the project had already disbursed more than 60% of the funding
and would therefore still need to be evaluated primarily against the original M&E indicators.


                                                6
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
31.     The project was rated category C and hence did not trigger any safeguards.
32.     Fiduciary arrangements: Given the project's regional nature, the project envisioned
Financial Management (FM) and procurement to be carried out by a Financial Management and
Procurement Agent (FMA) who would be contracted by the PCU.
33.      Fiduciary compliance during implementation: The project faced a number of FM and
procurement challenges which the team addressed diligently, albeit sometimes with delays by the
Bank. At the outset, hiring of the original PCU was contested by the project Steering Committee
(SC) members from Ethiopia and Kenya who raised concerns about procurement irregularities.
This issue was resolved in May 2005, and a competitive hiring process was completed by the
FMA in May 2006. Secondly, it took a long time to refine the project financial and procurement
manuals, which were completed in September 2007 (delayed mainly due to delays from the
Bank). Thirdly, the project was implicated with a fraud investigation on the use ofVS$ 57,665
project funds by the project's commercial bank, which was later resolved. In October 2007, the
task team diagnosed poor performance by and overpayment ofthe FMA, and cancelled the
contract. After a failed attempt to recruit a specialist, the PCU was charged with procurement
activities and all procurement came under the review of the Bank.
34.      The sluggish pace of Bank's response to requests for ''No Objection" slowed down
project procurement and the absence of a procurement specialist within the PCU at times caused
procurement irregularities, such as the hiring of a SC member to perform consulting services for
the project. This issue was promptly diagnosed and resolved by the project team. Another issue
has been the payment of income taxes on PCV staff salaries to the Tanzania Revenue Authority
for the period of 2006-08, which were ineligible under the legal agreement. Financing parameters
were changed in December 2009, which resolved the issue by allowing these taxes to be paid out
of the grant proceeds.

2.5 Post-completion OperationlNext Phase

35.      ARCAN graduates established national networks in the three countries to ensure the
continuation of (i) cascade training and (ii) exchange of best.practices beyond project closing.
Each with official NGO status, the networks were not in the original project design and they
emerged as a result of ATGs' concern over the possible erosion of cascading and loss of contact.
Both of these concerns were accurately raised as possible challenges to sustainability in the
original project PAD, and the project team aptly supported the formation of the national ATG
network entities by providing VS$ 5,000 of seed funding for each network, helping organize their
meetings and introducing the entity leaders to their national AIDS commission/council to
encourage the inclusion of the networks with appropriate HIV/AlDS activities. In addition to
working towards mitigating some of the risks to sustainability of ARCAN, these entities, with
over 1,000 members across Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania, represent a significant constituency in
the fight against HlV/AlDS.
36.      The project convened a regional dissemination and stakeholder workshop in March 2010,
among other reasons, to prepare for the next phase. Led by the PCV, the workshop was attended
by SC members, partner training institutions, ATGs, national ATG networks, health facilities
with ATGs, national ARCAN focal officers, training needs assessment consultant, external
project evaluation consultant, heads of training institutions in participating countries and the core
ARCAN task team members (Annex 6). SC members committed at the workshop to support post-
ARCAN cascade training and expressed their governments' request for ARCAN II. Subsequently,
ARCAN II proposal has been developed, endorsed by the SC and forwarded to the Bank.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
37.      Relevance of objectives. The stated development objective of ARCAN as designed in
2003 is to "expand access to HIV / AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs by supporting a
network of subregional learning sites to expand training of health care practitioners". As
mentioned previously, the PDO should have been worded more carefully to explicitly match the
PDO with the scope of the project. Nonetheless, this objective was relevant at the start of the
project, and remains substantially relevant in 20 10 terms. The relevance of the objective is further
supported by the fact that it is consistent with 2010 priorities of Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania,
namely the Plan for Accelerated and Sustainable Development to Eradicate Poverty (PASDEP),
Ethiopia; Kenya National AIDS Strategic Plan (2009110 - 2012113); Tanzania National Strategy
for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP or MKUKUT A) and Zanzibar Poverty Reduction
Plan (ZPRP or MKUZA).
38.      The context in the three countries show that this focus is well placed: HIV is still the
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the most economically productive age cohort (15 to
49 years) in Ethiopia and Kenya, and it follows malaria with the second place in Tanzania. Yet
there is not enough human resource capacity in these countries to respond to the increasing
demand for health services. Increasingly, national strategies and analyses conducted by the Bank
and other donors point to enhancing human resource capacity as a crucial necessity in responding
to the epidemic. Expanding capacity is therefore a major priority today, as was the case at
appraisal. On this basis, relevance of objectives is rated high.
39.      Relevance of design. In addition to full alignment with the priorities of the three clients
as of 20 I 0, the project is also relevant from a design aspect. The project components and
organization matched what the project aimed to achieve. The choice of Specific Investment Loan
(SIL) as the instrument was appropriate given that the investment was used for training programs
aimed at enhancing healthcare worker capacity and improving institutional infrastructure of the
regional training institutions.
40.      The regional character of the project was particularly appropriate. ARCAN's design as a
regional project and its focus on partnership with training institutions across three counties merit
special mention because these design elements provided multi-country and multi-level technical
exchanges and partnerships, as well as implementation efficiency. The six partner training
institutes developed the training curriculum, executed the training, provided accommodation for
participants and took part in follow up meetings of national ATG networks. These institutes were
chosen as a result of rigorous screening process and each had a proven track-record of providing
high quality training for the particular courses taught.
41.     The design was also highly efficient. Cost savings were made as a result of (i) leveraging
existing expertise of institutions and (ii) working with regional institutes. Implementation costs
would have beeri higher if the project had selected only one institution to deliver all the courses,
due to potentially high curriculum development costs. Similarly, high implementation costs
would have been incurred if the project had selected institution(s) outside of the region, due to
high travel and accommodation costs (more details in Section 3.3).
42.     The ToT approach adopted by project design is particularly appropriate. Given the
daunting human capacity shortage in the three client countries' healthcare sectors, ToT approach
was the optimal design to maximize the impact of a modest operation of US$ 10 million.
43.      The involvement of recognized and reputable institutions in the region was a further
positive design aspect. The high quality training delivered through multi-country institutions to
healthcare practitioners from three countries, the flexibility in incorporating new content, direct
applicability of the content to trainees' work and the ToT model are key design features which are
                                                  8
highly relevant. Both the external project evaluation and interviews conducted for this report
indicate that beneficiaries and stakeholders unanimously praise the regional nature, technical and
practical strength of ARCAN.
44.     Given that both project's design features and its objective of increasing the capacity of
healthcare workers are highly relevant in 2010 the project design is rated substantial.

3:2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
45.      Quantity and scope of capacity building efforts. ARCAN achieved its targets towards
the goal of increasing capacity of health workers: It fulfilled 90% of the target set for courses to
be held by the project (112 courses held out of a target of 125) and realized 85% of the target for
number of participants in trained (2463 11 participants trained out of 2884 target number). Overall,
the project trained 2463 participants from Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania through 112 sessions in
six institutions of excellence. 12 These trainees now work in 1,006 service delivery points across
three countries and have also provided training to 67,393 other health workers through cascading
(12,870 through structured training, 54,523 through on the job training or awareness creation).
46.      In addition to direct outputs such as the number of A TGs trained, the PCV data on
external resources mobilization by A TGs for cascade training is also useful in assessing progress
towards achieving objectives. ATG self reporting shows that 848 ATGs (49% of the total ATGs)
have mobilized $3,599,988 from various sources for cascade training i3 which were used to train
the above"mentioned 67,393. This means that ATGs have raised an average of$3,988 and trained
87 people with a unit cost of $46. Moreover, beneficiary surveys conducted for this report with 50
A TGs, and the external project evaluation indicate that these trainings made tangible behavioral
and institutional changes in healthcare service delivery.
47.      Quality of capacity building efforts. The external evaluation conducted in March 2010
which analyzed project outcomes indicates a (self reported) 98% ATG satisfaction rate with
ARCAN training due to their high quality. When asked by the external evaluators in 2010 to
evaluate the ARCAN training, graduates gave an overwhelmingly positive response (Figure 1).
Similarly, when asked if the ARCAN training improved their knowledge and skills, almost all "
ATGs responded that it was "fully satisfactory" or better (Figure 2). While these measures of
quality are based on self-assessment, a more objective measure of quality is the ability of the
A TGs to mobilize resources for cascading. The competitive review processes for resources have
their own quality screening and the successful resource mobilization efforts provide evidence of
reasonable level. of quality of training.




II   1,721 individual health care workers, 742 of whom received a refresher course with updated curricula"

12 The trainees were physicians, nurses, counselor supervisors, laboratory technicians, and HIV/AIDS
program managers. Additional training added at the later part of the project include TB/HIV co-infection
management, and procurement and supply chain management. Level I training (1,721 trainees) followed
the training-of trainers (TOT) approach in order to maximize the impact of the capacity-building project,
while level II (742 trainees) were refresher courses aimed at recalling and reinforcing previously acquired
knowledge and skills.

48.     In addition to self reporting by ARCAN trainees, the adoption of ARCAN curriculum by
a number of higher training institutions, such as the Zanzibar College of Health Sciences and the
Dar- Es Salaam based Aga Khan School of Nursing, also points to the quality of training.

49.      Capacity building efforts and service delivery. Self reporting by ATGs indicate that,
ARCAN also contributed to increased quality in health service delivery of its graduates, namely
through the introduction of various new forms o( counseling including adherence counseling,
improvement of HfY case management, feedback mechanisms, non-judgmental attitudes,
provision of information on rational use of ARVs, and treatment literacy. Increase in the number
of patients receiving services has also been reported, where ATGs attributed this trend to the
emergence of more positive attitudes by the service providers. While the project's contribution to
                                                                 10
the overall increase in the quality of national healthcare systems is not measurable, ARCAN
contributed to an increase in the quality of healthcare provided at the individual level.
50.      Equally importantly, ARCAN caused significant behavior change among health care
workers trained. Over 90% of the 300 ATGs contacted for the external evaluation agreed that
ARCAN courses had influenced their behavior in health care delivery. Specifically, they noted
that there has been stigma reduction, improved ability to abide by ethics and accept feedback.
According to the external project evaluation report, "the ATG training did impact on A TGs' job
satisfaction, behavior and attitude to work, service delivery, and job and organizational
performance. The training also significantly improved the competency of ATGs with respect to
training skills." These findings correlate with the interviews conducted with randomly selected
A TGs for this report. One A TG reports that "the ARCAN TOT Nursing training which I attended
was a turnaroundfor me. It enhanced my knowledge about HIV and AIDS and clarified so many
things that I do not know before. I have since offered training on Basic HIVIAIDS Workplace
Prevention at four factories and transport companies. I also participated in trainings organized
by AMREF and have been given a reference letter for my professional capability and skills in
using participatory training methods. "
51.      The project also helped increase the capacity of regional training institutions. Discussed
in detailed in the Institutional Change/Strengthening section of this report, all six training
institutes which delivered ARCAN curricula reported capacity improvements. The Ethiopian
Health and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI), for instance, used the ARCAN curriculum and
model to conduct an international training for the WHO Afro-Malaria program. The All Africa
Leprosy, Tuberculosis and Rehabilitation Training Centre (ALERT), Ethiopia changed a TBIHIV
training program to TOT TB/HIV Training using the ARCAN curriculum, to promote cascading
and widen the reach to other health workers.
52.       When compared with other active programs in HIV/AIDS field in all three countries -to
varying degrees- such as the Global Fund or The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPF AR), the project's size is dwarfed. Yet given the fact that none of these programs were
active in the project countries when ARCAN became effective, stakeholders (i.e. national AIDS
commission/councils, training institutions and trainees) observe that the project was one of the
first efforts to increase the capacity of health workers and that it did a lot with a relatively small
budget.
53.    These substantial results, however, were achieved despite the following three moderate
shortcomings:

(i)     Fundingfor cascade training by ARCAN trained graduates (ATGs) through national
        MAP projects. The ARCAN design placed special emphasis on cascading: it was through
        cascading that the multiplier effect would· be created and large numbers of healthcare
        workers would be trained on key HIV/AIDS issues in a cost effective way. Project design
        gave the national governments the responsibility to finance the vital cascade training and
        pointed to the national MAP projects as the source of financing. All three countries
        accepted this responsibility through letters they provided to IDA at appraisal. Yet, in
        reality, the funding never materialized except for a small number of cases in Tanzania,
        where 57 ATGs received $200,000 MAP funding for cascading and subsequently trained
        855 other health workers. This amount is dwarfed by the $3,399,988 A TGs raised from
        non-MAP sources (Figure 3).




                                                 11
Figure 3: Composition of cascade funds

        The MAP financing remained low and came only from one of the three client countries
        (Tanzania) because by the time ARCAN produced its initial group of graduates who
        applied for cascade funds in late 2007, the three countries had already largely committed
        their MAP project funding.

(ii)    Coordination with emerging national healthcare ToT programs. At appraisal, ARCAN
        was the primary ToT program for HIV/AIDS healthcare workers in the project countries.
        However, a number of national programs run by national AIDS commissionsl councils
        (NAC) emerged during project implementation. In Tanzania, for instance, two ToT
        programs on HIV/AIDS counseling were offered following the launch of ARCAN: One
        by the Africa Medical Research Foundation and one through the National AIDS Control
        Program (NACP). Aside from the potential inefficiency created by similar projects
        running simultaneously, the increasing numbers of HIV I AIDS ToT projects also resulted
        in a competition for funds for cascading between graduates of ARCAN and those of other
        programs.
(iii)   The MoH endorsement ofATGs in a timely manner. The three countries committed
        themselves to involving ATGs in the national programs and linking them with the
        national human resource management plans. However, the project graduates did not
        receive Min istry of Health endorsements from the beginn ing because the project design
        did not include MoH endorsement or integration of ATGs into national human resource
        plans. The fact that ARCAN trainees were not endorsed by their respective Ministries of
        Health brought their ToT status under question by the various cascading financing
        sources. The SC attempted to address this challenge by having National AIDS Control
        Programs (NACP's) send ATG endorsement letters to regional public health managers in
        mid-200B. However, the regional public managers did not include the A TGs in human
        resource management plans as the plans were mostly complete by the time the letters
        reached their destination. Although not official MoH certificates, the letters nonetheless
        provided a seal of endorsement for ATGs and helped them address the ToT status
        question posed by the various cascading financing sources after mid-200B.
54.      These limitations, although not significant enough to prevent the achievement of project
objectives substantially, nonetheless had an impact .. Due to these moderate shortcomings, the
project efficacy is rated modest.




                                                12
3.3 Efficiency
55.     As per standard practice in 2004, no formal economic or financial efficiency analysis was
done at appraisal stage. The project documents referred to the economic analysis of the MAP,
which justified an overall HIV/AIDS intervention scheme and did not single out capacity building.
Given this background, this report considers four major factors for assessing ARCAN's
efficiency; (i) implementation; (ii) project returns, (iii) gains to the sector and (iv) project
execution.
56.      First, the regional nature and the multi-country execution brought significant efficiency
gains in the training, the biggest of which was attained though the use of existing traini"ng
institutions located in the three project countries. This provided cost savings in logistics terms; i.e.
instructor vetting, travel and lodging for ATGs. Another gain brought by the regional nature of
ARCAN is the exchange of best practices across countries during training. These elements, which
could not be attained through single country interventions, increased the project's effectiveness.
Another aspect of execution worth noting is the curriculum templates given to the trainees. These
templates are used in cascading training and they reduce the cost of tailoring cascade trainings for
specific audiences.
57.      Secondly, ARCAN's returns on investment are noteworthy: US$ 8.7 million out of the
total project cost (US$ 10 million) was spent on trainings (Annex 1). Out of US$ 8.7 million,
US$ 5.07 million was spent on curriculum development and course delivery by partner training
institutions (less than the original US$ 5.8 million estimated in the PAD) and the remaining
US$ 3.63 million was expensed towards ATGs travel and logistics. With US$ 8.7 million, 2,463 14
units of trainings were provided, short of the original target of2,884 15 • The reason for the actual
value to be 85% of the targeted is the increase in training costs by about 32% from what was
budgeted in 2004 to the project implementation period of 2006-20 1O. Given the increase in costs,
the training output delivery was commendable. Out of the US$ 3,532 16 unit cost of training, US
$2,058 was for curriculum development and course delivery, while US$ 1,474 was for travel,
accommodation and per diem. Subsequently after their ARCAN training, ATGs raised a total of
US$ $3,599,988 producing a 36% leverage ratio. With these funds raised, they trained 12,870
health professionals through cascading and reached out to 54,523 others through awareness
creation activities and on the job training. When the number of workers reached through cascade
and on the job training, the project unit cost expense is further reduced to US$ 596 and US$ 126
respectively (Figure 4).




14 1,721 Level I trainings, 742 Level II trainings. Level II trainings were refresher courses aimed at
recalling and reinforcing previously acquired knowledge and skills.

15   This target was set in April 30, 2005 shortly after project launch.

16   Calculated by dividing US$ 8.7 million spent for 2,463 units of training.

                                         Number of trainings held

58.      Third element is the project's gains to the sector, namely the complementary nature of
ARCAN's capacity building in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Most global and domestic funds for
fighting the epidemic are allocated to more quantifiable projects such as ARV provision or
hospitallclinic construction, while addressing human shortages remains underfunded. By
investing in the capacity building of workers who will deliver the services with higher efficiency
and quality, the project also played a role in helping build long-term sustainability of other
HIVI AIDS programs and complemented the national and international efforts, thereby increasing
the chances of success of other projects that rely on human capacity to provide HIVI AIDS
healthcare services.
59.      The fourth factor is project execution: Disbursement was on track. Despite initial delays,
the disbursement profile suggests that in the first year of the project (end- 2005) disbursement
caught up with projected; During later stages, actual disbursement amounts trailed closely the
original amounts: By MTR in October 2007, actual disbursement ofUS$ 6.2 million was slightly
behind the projection amount ofUS$ 6.9 million. 100% disbursement was reached in five years,
and project was extended for 10 months, which allowed the completion of the external project
evaluation. Project supervision was particularly efficient as total Bank management costs were
about $470,000179 staff weeks for supervision.
60.      Efficiency gains attained though (i) the use of existing regional training institutions, (ii)
considerable returns on investment indicated by 2,463 direct trainings delivered with a unit cost
ofUS$ 3,532 and US$ $3.6 million funds raised after the trainings, producing a 36% leverage
ratio and helping train 67,393 other healthcare workers, (iii) project's role in complementing
national and international efforts by investing in local human capacity and (iv) efficient project
execution, efficiency is rated substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
61.      Rating: Moderately satisfactory. The rating is based on substantial relevance, modest
achievement ofproject's objective and substantial efficiency. Relevance rating is based on
objectives, design features and implementation modalities that are highly relevant in 2010. The
rating on the achievement of project objectives is the result of high quality training provided to a
significant group of healthcare workers and the subsequent change in their behavior in HIVI AIDS
healthcare provision, moderately limited by implementation challenges. Finally, the efficiency
rating is based on significant economic and human resource gains attained by the project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


62.      The project was gender sensitive and nearly 50% of A TGs were females (844 female,
877 male). The external project evaluation also indicates that there has been an increase in the
number of clients or patients obtaining services from institutions where ATGs serve and the
quality of HIV /AIDS healthcare they receive. This is attributed by the trainees to the development
of a more positive attitude, ability to tackle stigma and discrimination and enhanced capability to
deliver qualitative services, obtained as a result of the ARCAN training, though it should be noted
that some ATGs also attended other training. Another significant impact of the project is the
increase in the job satisfaction and career advancement of its trainees. Interviews conducted for
this report and the external project evaluation show that most ATGs pointed to ARCAN as a
"turning point" in their careers.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
63.        The project contributed significantly to the following areas of institutional strengthening:
64.      Strengthening of regional institutions: ARCAN trainings were delivered to physicians,
nurses, counselors, lab technicians, procurement and supply officers, and health program
managers by the following entities: Kenya Medical Association; Aga Khan School of Nursing,
Kenya; Kenya Association of Professional Counselors; Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research
Institute (ENHRI), and Eastern and Southern Africa Management Institute (ESAMI), Tanzania ..
The All Africa Leprosy, Tuberculosis and Rehabilitation Training Centre (ALERT), Ethiopia also
delivered the TB-HIV/AIDS course to a mix of these professionals. The project contributed to
improvements in these institutions by (i) assisting them in the development of toolkits or
operating manuals; (ii) establishing new relations among them, or reinforcing existing ones, that

                                                      15
lasted beyond ARCAN activities, and (iii) paving the way for work with other donors. The Aga
Khan School of Nursing, for instance, received EU funding after ARCAN to develop a masters in
nursing curriculum, while Kenya Association of Professional Counselors (KAPC) was contracted
to provide the course in Rwanda and Botswana.
65.      Dissemination ofARCAN curriculum: A number of schools of medicine in the region
adopted ARCAN curricula (with modifications). Among these, the College of Health Sciences,
Zanzibar adopted the ARCAN HIV / AIDS curriculum in its nurse, midwife, clinical officer, dental
assistant and public health nurse trainings, while the Aga Khan School of Nursing, in cooperation
with ESAMI, developed the ARCAN course for nurses to a bachelor degree level.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
66.      The two key un intended outcomes include (i) formation of national ATG networks, and
(ii) significant institutional changes (sections 2.5 and 3.Sb).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
67.      A series of meetings in Addis Ababa, Nairobi, Dar Es Salaam and Zanzibar organized as
part of the ICR mission discussed the project with a total of 50 ATGs. Key findings include: (i)
satisfaction with the training material content and equally overwhelming frustration with the lack
of cascade funding; (ii) impressive level of entrepreneurialism from A TGs in raising alternative
funds for funding cascading; (iii) national ATG networks should be sustained to help raise funds
for cascading; (iv) concern over the material "getting older" over time and loss of cutting edge
knowledge, and (iv) significant willingness to engage in a potential follow on phase, ARCAN II.
68.     Meetings with stakeholders (training institutions and SC members) found: (i) training
content was cutting edge; (ii) failure to fund cascading and integrating ARCAN into national
HIV / AIDS programs were caused by the lack of country ownership, high turnover among SC
members and lack of strategic leadership from the Bank, and (iii) capacity building in HIV/AIDS
service provision is still a major gap in the countries and there is need for an ARCAN phase II,
with design adjustments.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate. The two key risks to the project's objectives are:
69.     Cascade training slowing down: During implementation, ATGs provided training to
67,393 other health workers through cascading, mostly thanks to personal fund raising efforts.
There is a risk that momentum for cascading will be lost over time. However, that risk is largely
mitigated by the fact that cascading never relied on project funding and was self-sustaining from
the onset. Financing for cascading was not dependent on the project in the first place, and this
increases the change that cascading will continue beyond project closing. Also, the establishment
of national ATG networks, whose primary goal is to assist its members in raising funds for
cascading, is another factor mitigating this risk.
70.      Outdated ARCAN content: Prevention, treatment and care ofHIV/AIDS is a fast evolving
field, where new developments, research and methods emerge rapidly, often making former
methods and teachings redundant. Hence, similar to most other training, particularly in the field
of HIV / AIDS, ARCAN's content faces the risk of becoming. outdated over time. However, the
risk is mitigated by the involvement of various training institutes in delivering the training beyond
ARCAN which will ensure that the material will be updated regularly. Additionally, the intrinsic
value of ARCAN training as a whole is not limited to the HIV/AIDS technical component. Skills
acquired by A TGs such as proposal writing, fund-raising and exchange of best practices are

                                                 16
among elements which are included in the ARCAN training. Complemented by the behavior
change observed among trainees, these elements will continue to be valid.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
71.      Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The human capacity shortage for HIV / AIDS service
delivery was a significant bottleneck at project appraisal, and the limited number of global actors
with know-how and financing brought the Bank under considerable pressure to deliver. While
clients and the Bank held consultations during project appraisal, inadequate experience in
managing regional HIV / AIDS projects undermined the quality of analysis for determining the
implementation arrangements as well as for the risk assessment. The Bank also fell short in
ensuring a robust M&E framework (as discussed in Section 2.3).

(b) Quality of Supervision
72.      Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank supervision quality was erratic. At critical
junctures, particularly at project start, the sector management failed to provide the needed
strategic problem solving assistance in a timely fashion to address operational challenges and
tensions between the Bank team and other project parties. In later stages, the Bank responded
with -sometimes significant- delays to absence of objection requests, which delayed procurement
and training activities. ISR ratings were generous and, in the case of the DO ratings, could have
been better supported by empirical evidence. Although M&E shortcomings were identified and
repeatedly highlighted during supervision, the Bank failed to bring solutions. The Bank could
have done a better job in ensuring consistency of supervision quality through project
 implementation.
73.      On the other hand, the Bank's reporting and follow-up of agreed actions were adequate.
While problematic at project start, compliance with covenants became satisfactory in the later
stages of implementation. Supervision quality improved first with the involvement of country
office- based health specialists after the MTR, and then with the new task team leadership toward
project closing. At this stage, the Bank improved its relations with the clients, conducted a third
party evaluation of the project and supported national ATG networks to ensure adequate
transition for post-ARCAN cascade training.
74.      Quality of supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory because task team leadership
and sector management attention were not adequate and although supervision quality
significantly improved, it came late in the project life.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
75.     Rating: Based on the moderately unsatisfactory quality at entry and moderately
unsatisfactory quality of supervision, overall Bank performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
76.     Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The three governments showed strong engagement,
as evidenced by the level of representation at the project SC and the frequency of their meetings.
However, the ability to effect change and/or deal with implementation issues was varied at best.
                                                17
The three strategic challenges that tested the performance of ARCAN countries were: (i) Cascade
funding; (ii) integration of ATGs in the national HIV/AIDS training programs, and (iii)
coordination with other projects which emerged during ARCAN implementation ran similar
training programs.
77.      Firstly, out of the VS$ 3 million raised for cascading, only VS$ 200,000 came from
government sources and that was only in Tanzania. Kenyan and Ethiopian authorities failed to
provide cascade funding altogether. In most cases ATGs never received an official response to
their application for cascade funding from their respective NACs. Secondly, although the
governments (through representatives in the SC) committed themselves to improving the
involvement of ATGs in the national programs by linking them with the national human resource
management plans, this to a large degree did not happen. Although NACPs sent ATG
endorsement letters to regional public health managers, most ATGs continue to suffer from non-
recognition by the Ministries of Health. Finally, a number of projects similar to ARCAN emerged
during project implementation, some of which were government initiatives. Governments failed
to ensure that there was no replication of efforts among these projects, causing ATGs to compete
with the graduates of other programs for cascade funding and recognition.
78.   Collectively, these point out low government ownership of the project and less than full
commitment to achieving its development objectives.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
79.      Rating: Satisfactory. The project coordination unit (PCV) was the implementing agency
and there were no shortcomings in its performance. Since its entry into the project in mid-2005,
the unit showed significant commitment to achieving the development objectives. It conducted
regular and frequent consultations with the ATGs, training institutions, SC and the Bank team to
ensure full coordination and proactive diagnosis of any challenges to come. The PCV signaled
implementation challenges in a timely fashion and proposed appropriate and realistic choices for
solutions. The M&E system maintained by the PCV captures important project information, and
is crucial in supplementing the official results framework in assessing project performance. As
acknowledged by all parties, the PCV "kept the project moving", and even at times while in an
"orphan" status, with little support from Bank management and task team leadership.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
80.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The borrowers failed to tackle larger strategic issues,
and did not demonstrate strong and consistent ownership of the project. However, due to high
PCV performance, activities were implemented with high beneficiary satisfaction, operational
issues were addressed and key project progress information was captured.

6. Lessons Learned

•   Enhance outreach to rural practitioners, especially in the public health offices. This group
    of health care workers was underrepresented among ATGs, due mainly to the lack of internet
    and other communication services. Similar projects that depend on applications for selecting
    beneficiaries should develop specific tools for this segment, such as radio or regional print
    media, where available, as well as mobile phone technology.

•   Heterogeneity in audience exposure to HIVIAIDS service delivery caused challenges. Some
    ATGs had extensive experience in delivering these services, whereas others were more
    novices, which occasionally caused frustration during trainings. A two tiered structure where
    novice trainees receive a period of intense "orientation" would help alleviate this challenge.

                                                18
•   Respond to changing technical landscape. At project design, the Bank was the leading actor
    in the field and national systems were not mature. Future projects in addressing human
    capacity issues should leverage the emerging national capacity and efforts of other partners
    such as PEPFAR or the Global Fund by (i) embedding operations in national targets, and (ii)
    harmonizing efforts. Namely, training programs supported by the Bank and other donors
    should be aligned with existing national human resource development targets, and project
    indicators should be fully harmonized with national HIV/AIDS indicators and targets.

•   Working with regional institutions of learning worked. This allowed the flexibility of
    updating course content with cutting edge information, kept the costs low and strengthened
    these institutions. Operations that aim to build human capacity should continue this good
    practice, where feasible.

•   The regional approach was a hig win. This allowed the exchange of best practices across
    different countries, established relations between practitioners and most importantly,
    responded appropriately in helping alleviate the regional epidemic.

•   Keep M&E tight. Project development objective should be focused and specific. M&E
    should be fully integrated with national efforts, and should capture information about the
    experiences of trainees. This will help indicate what works and direct emerging efforts on
    human capacity building in HIV /AIDS.

•   Human capacity in HIVIAIDS is still an important gap in the region. Although the project
    trained a substantial number of health workers, the changing nature of the epidemic and the
    continuing gaps in national capacity mean the Bank and other partners should continue to
    support these national efforts.                            .

•   Select Bank task team leader carefully. Although now a cliche, this issue was key in
    determining the quality of Bank contributions in the project. Over the course of
    implementation, the Bank team was led by three different TTLs, and the quality increased
    only when (i) TTLs focused efforts and energy and engaged the client, and (ii) were located
    physically in the project area.

•   Bank's internal structures discouraged the much needed restructuring. As indicated in
    numerous Aide memoires, ISRs and other reports, the PDO, KPI and intermediate indicators
    was in grave need of revision. Yet the already overstretched team could not afford the
    extensive time needed to restructure the project. Bank task teams, of particularly smaller
    operations, face this challenge frequently. The recent Bank-wide simplifications to the
    restructuring process are therefore welcome.

Behavior change among ATGs directly trained: 1,721

1. Web survey conducted for the external project evalua~ion with a random sample of 300 ATGs
   across seven training categories shows (Table 3) that majority of ATGs report ARCAN as
   having changed their behavior in health care delivery, which specific reference to reducing
   stigma, abiding by ethics and accepting feedback from clients.

2. The survey also indicates that over 77% of respondents agreed that the knowledge acquired
   from the ARCAN training has benefited other health professionals in their work places.
   Similarly, all 50 ATGs randomly selected and surveyed for this work reported behavioral
   changes. The changes vary from the use of a new diagnostics system, to the formation of new
   professional associations.


Behavior change among health workers trained through cascading: 67,393

3.    Due to insufficient monitoring of cascading quality and effectiveness, the analysis of cascade
      trainings relies heavily on the external project evaluation and stakeholder accounts. External
      project evaluation reports that the cascading trainees noted significant benefits and positive
      impact on work output, job performance and behavior. Majority of cascade trainees sampled
      for the evaluation reported high rates of knowledge and skill acquisition (Figure 5).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

         Annex 3 provides some background information on larger HIV/AIDS context and·
capacity building needs in the three countries to provide context for the discussion of efficiencies
at the project level, as well as in the sector.

HIVIAIDS Background in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Expected Gains from ARCAN

        Ethiopia is among countries most affected by HIV and AIDS. The existence of HIV
infection in Ethiopia was recognized in early 1980s with the first two reported AIDS cases in
1986. Since then, the epidemic has rapidly spread throughout the country. It peaked in mid-1990s
and started to decline in major urban areas since 2000 while stabilizing in rural settings.

        According· to projections based on the single point estimate - a calibrated estimate of
ANC sentinel surveillance data up to 2005 - the national adult HIV prevalence was at 2.3% in
2009 with an estimated 1,116,216 people living with HIV I AIDS. Out of the estimated 5.4 million
orphans in Ethiopia, 886,820 were orphaned due to AIDS. There were an estimated 44,751 deaths
due to AIDS in 2009. The number of AIDS -related deaths would have been much higher ifit
had not been for the free ART program which has been scaled up by the government in
collaboration with development partners since 2005. The estimated national adult HIV incidence
of 0.28% in 2009 translates to over 131,145,000 new HIV infections on top of over 1 million
Ethiopians living with HIV. With the current status it is evident that HIV and AIDS remain
formidable development challenges to the country.                                  .

          The Ethiopian Government established the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office
(HAPCO) to mobilize multi sectoral and grassroots efforts in the fight against the HIV/AIDS
epidemic. The Government's 5-year national HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (2004 - 2008) for·
 intensifying multisectoral HIV I AIDS response was built around six strategic issues: capacity
building; community mobilization and empowerment; integration with health programs;
.leadership and mainstreaming; coordination and networking; and targeted response .

         . World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia (2003) focused on
improving human development outcomes, enhancing pro-poor growth, and reducing vulnerability,
and also placed emphasis on the need for· capacity building. The strategy indicated that
constraints to improving health services lie primarily in the shortage of skilled human resources
and identifies HIV I AIDS as the foremost threat to national poverty and vulnerability reduction
efforts.

        Kenya also suffers from a severe and generalized HIV epidemic. In recent years the
country has experienced a notable decline in HIV prevalence, attributed in part to significant
behavioral change and increased access to ART. National adult HIV prevalence is estimated to
have fallen from 10% in the late 1990s to about 6.1 % in 2005. This, however, rose to 7.4%
among the age group 15-49 and at 7.1 % among the age group 15-64 based on the 2007 Kenya
HIV and AIDS Indicator Survey Report. Women face considerably higher risk of HIV infection
than men, and also experience a shorter life expectancy due to HIV I AIDS. The seventh AIDS in
Kenya reports an HIV prevalence rate of 8% in adult women and 4% in adult men.

        Despite recent decline in prevalence, HIVI AIDS continues to be a major challenge in the
country's socio-economic development. Since the first case was discovered in 1984, it is
estimated that over 1.5 million people have died due to AIDS-related illnesses, resulting into 1.8
million children left as orphans. It is also estimated that 1.5 million people are living with HIV.


                                                 28
        The Government of Kenya declared HIV/AIDS a national disaster and established the
National AIDS Control Council (NACC) in 1999. It then developed the Kenya National
HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (KNASP) 2000-2005, which set out a multisectoral response to the
epidemic. The plan identified human resource development and management as one of seven key
areas that could create an obstacle for effective implementation of the plan and pointed to
capacity building through training was as a vital process for addressing health sector staff need.
The Bank's CAS for Kenya (2004) notes that HIV/AIDS is a top priority.

        In Tanzania, HIV/AIDS adult prevalence has been estimated at 7.0%, with 1.6 million
people estimated to be living with the virus as of 2007. This figure may not be truly
representative of the HIV epidemic in Tanzania as a high number of AIDS cases are under-
reported. The Ministry of Health estimates that only one out of five cases is reported. According
to Tanzania National Multisectoral Strategic Framework on HIV/AIDS, AIDS is the leading
cause of death among adults in the country. There are 1.3 million adults aged 15 and over living
with HIV, of which 760,000 are women. 140,000 children under the age of 14 are living with
HIV. The country has an estimated 970,000 orphans due to AIDS under the age of 17.

         The health sector in particular is experiencing high demand for its services, as AIDS
patients occupy an ever-increasing number of beds in hospitals. More than 60% of patients
admitted in the general ward are suffering from TB, prolonged fever, headache, skin disease, and
diarrhea. This results in increased workload for hospital workers, who are already understaffed.
There is a marked deterioration observed in the referral systems due to extra demands for medical
care and treatments by AIDS patients. These all have their own recurrent impact on the economy
as there is an increase in the recruitment and training costs for health personnel as well as an
increase risk of HIV infection in hospitals/HBC due to lack of protective equipment.

         Tanzania established the Tanzania Commission for AIDS (T ACAIDS) in 2001 and the
Zanzibar AIDS Commission in 2002 to lead and coordinate multi-sectoral responses to the
epidemic, monitoring and evaluation, including research, resource mobilization and advocacy.
Both entities point to capacity building as the main focus of national HIV response. Yet only a
fraction of the health personnel have been trained on HIV and AIDS.

         Against this backdrop of significant pressure on the human resources of three econom ies,
ARCAN was developed to provide a model for facilitated knowledge and skills acquisition by
personnel critical to HIV /AIDS control in the health sector. The training of nurses, counselors,
physicians, laboratory technologists, program managers and procurement specialists was
expected to contribute to addressing the human capacity need in the country and bringing
significant economic gains.

Implementation Efficiency

         Implementation efficiency refers to economic and financial gains attained by project
design and execution. ARCAN's regional nature and multi-country execution brought efficiency
gains in training through the partnership with training institutions located in the three project
countries. The six partner training institutes developed the training curriculum, executed the
training, provided accommodation for participants and took part in follow up meetings of national
ATG networks. These institutes were chosen as a result of rigorous screening process and each
had a proven track-record of providing high quality training for the particular courses taught
(Table 6). Cost savings were made as a result of (i) leveraging existing expertise of institutions
and (ii) working with regional institutes. Implementation costs would be considerably higher if
the project had selected only one institution to deliver all the courses, due to potentially high
curriculum development costs. Similarly, high implementation costs would have been incurred if

                                                29
the project had selected institution(s) outside of the region, due to high travel and accommodation
costs.

                TB-HIV service delivery.


        Another significant gain brought by the regional nature of ARCAN is the exchange of
best practices among participants from different countries, which ATGs reported as a significant
value. A final dimension of implementation efficiency gain is attained through the follow up
material given to trainees, such as curriculum templates, which are used in cascade training.
These follow up material reduce the cost of tailoring cascade trainings for specific audiences.

Project Returns
         Project returns refer to the financial cost of training. The estimated unit cost of each
ARCAN training is US$ 3,532: Total project training cost (US$ 8.7 million), over the number of
trainings conducted (1,721 A TGs with a total of 2,463 trainings [1,721 Level I and 742 refresher
Level II training]). The project cost was leveraged by the US$ $3,599,988 raised by A TGs to
conduct cascade training, producing a 36% leverage ratio. With these funds, ATGs trained 12,870
health professionals through cascade training and reached out to 54,523 others through informal
cascade training, such as awareness creation activities and on the job training. With the cascade
training, the unit cost of each training decreases to US$ 596 (US$ 8.7 million / [2,463 ARCAN
trainings + 12,870 cascade training]). With informal cascade training, the unit cost is further
reduced to US$ 126 (US$ 8.7 million / [2,463 ARCAN trainings + 12,870 cascade training +
54,523 informal cascade training]) (Table 7).

Gains to the sector
         Gains to the sector refer to the contribution of the project to larger efforts in the health
sector, namely the complementary nature of the project's capacity building in the fight against
HIV/AIDS. More challenging to quantify, this gain is acknowledged by most parties interviewed
for this report. Most donor funds for fighting HIV /AIDS are allocated to more quantifiable
projects such as ARV provision or hospital/clinic construction, while addressing human shortages
remains underfunded. By investing in the capacity building of workers who will deliver the
services with efficiency and high quality, the project contributed to the long-term sustainability of
other HIV/AIDS programs and complemented the national and international efforts, thereby
increasing the chances of success of other projects that rely on human capacity to provide
HIV /AIDS health care services.

Implementation Efficiency
         Implementation Efficiency is the pace with which the project was implemented, taking
into account disbursement and any project extensions. ARCAN disbursement was on track.
Despite initial delays, the disbursement profile suggests that in the first year of the project (end-
2005) disbursement caught up with projected. During later stages, actual disbursement amounts
trailed closely the original amounts: By MTR in October 2007, actual disbursement ofUS$ 6.2
million was slightly behind the projection amount ofUS$ 6.9 million. 100% disbursement was
reached in five years, and project was extended for 10 months. The main reason for the extension
was to complete the external project evaluation. Project supervision was particularly efficient as
total Bank management costs were less than $400,000179 staff weeks for supervision, which is
commendable.

(b) Key outcomes of surveys

Training Material Content:
   • 90% found the training content to be useful and applicable to their work.
   • 74% gained knowledge/skills from the project.
   • 74% recorded behavior change.
   • 72% found content different than other trainings.received.

The following skills were frequently reported:
   • Adherence counseling
   • Joint HIV/AIDS - TB diagnosis
   • Strategic work planning
   • Budgeting
   • Proposal writing
   • Fundraising
   • Conducting needs assessment

6. 90% found the training cascade funding disappointing. None of the A TOs in Kenya and
   Ethiopia received cascade funding from their national AIDS commission/council and
   they did not receive an official response to their funding request.

7. Despite the lack of official support, 38 out of the 50 ATGs surveyed reported that they
   provided cascade trainings to a total of3275 other healthcare workers. 12 of the 38 ATGs
   who cascaded received MAP funding in Tanzania. Others raised funds from other sources, or
   convinced their institutions to provide space, time and supplies for the trainings.

8. 92% of those surveyed raised the cascading issues as a major risk moving forward
   and requested that the national A TO networks be sustained to help mitigate against
   the risk. 80% raised concern over the training material "getting older" over time and
   loss of cutting edge knowledge.



                                                  34
9. When asked if they thought a similar capacity program would be beneficial, 98% said
   there should be a potential follow on phase i.e. ARCAN II.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

(a) Organization of the dissemination and stakeholder workshop

10. The following summary was based on presentations made at the ARCAN Regional
    Dissemination and Stakeholder Workshop held on March 18-192010 in Nairobi, Kenya. Led
    by the PCU, the workshop was attended by Steering Committee members, partner training
    institutions, ATGs, national ATG networks, health facilities with ATGs, national ARCAN
    focal officers, training needs assessment consultant, external evaluation consultant, heads of
    training institutions in participating countries and the core ARCAN task team members.

(b) Strengths and weaknesses

11. The interrelationship among the SC members, health facilities with ATGs and the ATGs
    attending the workshop, showed the broad satisfaction with this project. Their presentations
    highlighted the following strengths: ARCAN paved the way for effective collaboration with
    other facilities such as the Global Fund or PEPFAR, it highlighted capacity building as a
    focal point of attention for HIV Response, enhanced South-South cooperation and facilitated
    collective learning through exchange of best practices.

12. Directors of Amana Municipal Hospital (Tanzania), Kenyatta National Hospital (Kenya) and
    Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (Ethiopia), who are employers of ATGs,
    reported marked improvement of service provided by their staff after ARCAN training.
    Specifically, they pointed out improved quality of care, reduced hospital stay, increased
    patients satisfaction, improved dissemination ofHIV prevention algorithm and introduction
    of the use of provider initiated testing and counseling (PITC) as correlated with ARCAN
    training;

13. Presentations converged on the following three points as the project's biggest shortcomings:
    (i) Cascading model has not worked well, (ii) recognition and of ATGs as ToTs due to lack of
    endorsement and certification has created additional obstacles before cascading, particularly
    from a fundraising perfective and finally (iii) lack of a holistic monitoring of ATG activities,
    (i.e. quality of cascade trainings, post- training behavior change and impact of trainings on
    healthcare quality) has prevented a fully accurate picture of the project's accomplishments.
    Partner training institutions have also highlighted flaws within trainee selection, particularly
    due to varied treatment of ATGs from backgrounds with the same level of instruction.
(c) Lessons learned

14. In general, the teams who attended the workshop emphasized the following positive
    outcomes and lessons: (i) despite being critical of the failures of cascading, training of
    trainers model in increasing health care worker capacity is considered as a model in three
    countries, (ii) there is a grave need for in-service training, given high staff turn-over, and (iii)
    HIV capacity building strategies need to be based on specific priority needs with clear
    and well defined monitoring indicators.                       .

(d) Main outcome

15. The continued need for the project (dubbed ARCAN II) was highlighted by
   participants.

Assessment of the project's development objective

With a project disbursement rate of 100% as at April 2010; 2,463 participants (85% of project
target of 2,884) in 112 courses (90% of end of project target of 125) have been trained utilizing
87% (VSD 5.07m. out of planned costs ofVSD 5.82m) of the total project plan for training costs.
A network of six sub-regional 'learning sites' have been supported (Partner Training Institutions
or PTIs), and over 50% of the ATGs have reported to the PCV that they are actively equipping
health workers with HIV/AIDS knowledge gained from the training held by PTIs. As of
December 2009,848 (55%) ofthe total 1543 ATGs supposed to have trained/cascaded, have
submitted cascading reports which show that they have managed to mobilize and use in their
various forms of training, VSD 3,599,988.

The geographical coverage of ATGs in each country was over 90% serving a total of 1,006 health
service delivery points in the three countries (that is over 280 service delivery points in each
country- which is more than 7% of all service delivery points in Ethiopia and Kenya, and more
than 5% in Tanzania) thereby contributing to enhanced service delivery of HIV and AIDS related
services and forging stronger linkages between prevention and care interventions. South-South
partnerships have been expanded directly amongst the ATGs, PTIs and the national AIDS
institutions represented in the Steering Committee, and indirectly to other specialists who worked
on project activities such as procurement and consultancies. Consequently, the project has been
on track in meeting its project development objective. More detailed information on the PDO can
be seen in the Annexes which all address a certain aspect of the PDO.

Challenges
The PDO was problematic. The PCV and SC recognized within the first year of project
i"mplementation that parts of the PDO were too broad and not measurable with existing PAD
indicators and were beyond the project mandate thereby requiring system-wide interventions,
namely the objectives on "enhancing the delivery of HIV and AIDS-related services;
strengthening linkages between prevention and care interventions; and expanding South-South
partnerships"; The SC also noted that there was need to include the quality of the training in the
PDO. This was discussed with the World Bank during the mid-term review but it was agreed that
the PDO remains as it is as there would be a lengthy process to change it and the project had
already spent more than 50% of the project expenditure and had less than two years to completion.

Lesson Learnt
There is need for the PDO to be realistic and in line with the project design. This needs to be done
during project design and if challenges are experinced during project implementation, then there
is need to change it through quick decision making and follow through.

Project Operations Manual and Project Implementation

PCV has executed the project in line with the Project Operation Manual (POM) which was in
draft for two years. The POM was a condition for project effectiveness of the Development Grant
Agreement. All the project manuals had not been cleared by the World Bank when the current
pev joined in May 2006. The PCV had to update the draft manuals for clearance in December
2006. These were all cleared by July 2008.

Challenges
                                                37
Delay in the approval of the Project Operational Manual contributed to implementation
challenges and confusion at the beginning in various areas such as what is the per diem payable to
the SC and PCV. The delay of project implementation in 2005-06 was a missed opportunity to
integrate the ARCAN cascading plan into the country MAP I programs in the three countries.
The Project was also not launched and development of the communication strategies was delayed.
As a result the Project was not widely known at national level and contributed negatively in the
national cascading efforts

Lessons learnt
It is important that all conditions of project effectiveness are met before the start of project
implementation. This will ensure that there is clear understanding by all parties on their roles and
hence reduce the risk of project closure/delays and related implementation activities.
