The project\n            will support HIV/AIDS-related health sector, human resource\n            capacity building in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania using a\n            \"training-of-trainers\" (TOT) model. It is expected\n            that, as a result of increased capacity in the sub-region,\n            this project will contribute to enhanced delivery of\n            HIV/AIDS-related services, stronger linkages between\n            prevention and care interventions, and expanded South-South\n            partnerships. In Tanzania, the project components will: 1)\n            support the implementation of short-term (non-diploma)\n            training courses for health care practitioners at various\n            levels, including physicians, nurses, counselor supervisors,\n            laboratory technicians, and HIV/AIDS program managers, based\n            on the training-of trainers (TOT) approach, maximizing the\n            impact of this capacity-building project; 2) prioritize on\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E), enabling knowledge\n            sharing, and lessons application to strengthening the\n            program. Routine dissemination of HIV/AIDS-related program\n            information will also be financed, to ensure greater\n            knowledge sharing between, and within counties. The project\n            will explore options for distance learning, to maximize\n            resources, and to ensure a broader regional approach for\n            sharing experiences and enhancing skills; and, 3) support\n            strong coordination, and capacity building between the\n            project counties, and their governing agencies. A major\n            focus of this component would involve providing the Project\n            Coordination Unit with support to administrative, fiduciary,\n            and technical responsibilities."}, "docdt": "2004-08-19T00:00:00Z"}
