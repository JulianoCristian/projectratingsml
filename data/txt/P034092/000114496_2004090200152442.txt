Agreement
Dear Mr. Kandymov:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Institution Building / Technical Assistance 
Project) dated October 5, 1994 (the Loan Agreement), as amended, between Turkmenistan 
and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).  We also refer 
to your letter dated May 26, 2000, requesting restoration of funds previously canceled 
under the Loan Agreement and certain other amendments to the Loan Agreement.
We hereby confirm the Bank's agreement to the following amendments to the Loan 
Agreement: Restoration of Funds 
1.
The amount of $9,184,571.28 equivalent is restored to the loan amount and the 
commitment charges on such amount begin to accrue from January 6, 1999. The table in 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended to reflect the above noted 
restoration and the amounts now allocated to each of the categories set forth in said 
table which now reads as per Annex 1 to this letter. Schedule 3 to the Loan Agreement, 
the Amortization Schedule, is being revised by the Bank as a result of the restoration 
of funds and the revised figures will be sent to you shortly. Schedule 1 to the Loan 
Agreement

In paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement the word "and" at the end of 
paragraph 2(a) is deleted, the period at the end of paragraph 2(b) is replaced by a

which reads as follows:
"(c)

incurred by 
the PIU on account of management of Project implementation for utilities, 
printing, office 
supplies, office maintenance, communications, and such other 
expenditures as may be agreed 
upon by the Bank."

Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:
“4.

on the basis  of statements of expenditure for expenditures for: (a) contracts for

(c) PIU’s incremental operating 
costs; and (d) services under contracts costing less
