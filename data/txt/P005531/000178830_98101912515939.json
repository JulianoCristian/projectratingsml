The project would comprise the\n            following components: (i) periodic maintenance and minor\n            improvements of highways; (ii) equipment and spare parts for\n            highway maintenance, workshops, training, and pavement data\n            collection; (iii) construction and/or rehabilitation of\n            workshops and highway maintenance centers; (iv) technical\n            assistance to Directorate General of Roads and Ministry of\n            Communications; and (v) routine highway maintenance. While\n            experience with the first project suggests that\n            unavailability of sufficient numbers of trainees presents a\n            risk to meeting planned targets, this would be offset by the\n            commissioning of new workshops in the near future and\n            increased efforts being made by the Government to make\n            trainees available."}, "docdt": "1981-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
