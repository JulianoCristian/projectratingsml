SULTANATE OF OMAN - SECOND HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Sultanate of Oman
Amount:                   US$15 million equivalent.
Terms:                    Amortization in 15 years, including a 3-year grace
period, with interest at 11.6 percent per annum.
Project
Description:             The project would consist of the first three years
of the five-year (1982-1987) national program for
highway maintenance. It would build on the first
Highway Maintenance Project financed under Loan
1441-OM and pursue its institutional-building
objectives, thus contributing to preserve the large
investments Oman has made in the recent past to
develop its road network. The project would
comprise the following components: (i) periodic
maintenance and minor improvements of highways;
(ii) equipment and spare parts for highway
maintenance, workshops, training and pavement data
collection; (iii) construction and/or
rehabilitation of workshops and highway maintenance
centers; (iv) technical assistance to Directorate
General of Roads and Ministry of Communications;
and (v) routine highway maintenance. While
experience with the first project suggests that
unavailability of sufficient numbers of trainees
presents a risk to meeting planned targets, this
would be offset by the commissioning of new
workshops in the near future and increased efforts
being made by the Government to make trainees
available.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
SULTANATE OF OMAN FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Sultanate of Oman for the equivalent of US$15.0 million to help
finance a Second Highway Maintenance Project. The loan would have a term of
15 years, including 3 years of grace, at 11.6 percent interest per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       A report entitled "Oman:  Current Economic Position and Prospects"
(2528-OM) based on the findings of a mission which visited Oman in January
1979 was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 16, 1979. An
updating mission visited Oman in April 1980. The findings of these missions
and updating information are reflected in the following paragraphs. A
mission to review the Second Five-Year Plan is currently in Oman. Country
data sheets are attached in Annex I.
3.       Prior to 1970, Oman was a traditional society with very limited
exposure to the outside world. Since July 1970 when Sultan Qaboos bin Said
came to power, Oman has been undergoing major structural changes. In the
short span of a decade, economic infrastructure has been built up from a
very rudimentary stage and Oman has made impressive gains in education,
health and housing. Unprecedented increases in personal incomes and the
rapid expansion of public services have substantially improved the living
conditions of the Omanis, particularly those in the urban centers. These
improvements in the material welfare of the Omanis have been accompanied by
a visible change in the social structure and values. The pace of social
change is, however, much slower than that of the economic change, and
century-old traits of a traditional society persist. Income distribution in
Oman remains highly skewed. Oil revenue, the major source of income,
accrues to the Government and is channelled to the economy through public
expenditures, mainly on construction and purchases of goods. During the
same period, a modern government comprising various technical ministries and
executive agencies was created. The traditional social structure is,
nevertheless, represented in the Government.
Past Economic Developments
4.       Prior to the commercial exploitation of oil in 1967, the Omani
economy was at a subsistence level based largely on agriculture and
fisheries. Although oil exports began in 1967, Government expenditures
remained at low levels until 1970 and foreign exchange reserves
accumulated. With the launching of major investment projects and increased
civil and military spending, Government expenditures rose more than fivefold
between 1969 and 1973, resulting in a significant liquidity crisis in 1974



- 2 -
despite the sharp increase in the oil prices at the end of 1973. Efforts to
control rising budgetary deficits included introduction of various
administrative measures such as establishment of a planning organization and
a tender board. The realization of the need for a rational long-term
approach'to development led to the preparation of the first Five-Year
Development Plan, (1976-1980) in the mid-seventies.
5.       The main objectives of the first Five-Year Plan were to:
(i) shift the concentration of investment from infrastructure to
income-generating projects, particularly in the sectors of
manufacturing, mining, agriculture and fisheries, in order to
supplement and eventually replace oil revenues;
(ii) effect a wider geographical distribution of investment in order to
improve regional income distribution and reduce the rate of
migration to major urban centers;
(iii) develop local human resources to increase Omani participation in
economic activity;
(iv) achieve the basic requirements of a free market economy with the
private sector playing a leading role, through the provision of an
appropriate legal and incentives framework;
(v) pay more attention to the development of water resources; and
(vi) improve the efficiency of the Government administration.
6.       The first Five-Year Plan projected an annual average GDP growth
rate of 1.6 percent and a GNP growth rate of 3.1 percent in real terms
during the 1976-1980 period. The GNP growth was projected to be higher due
to the projected decline in net factor service payments. Fast growth in
non-oil sectors, mainly agriculture and manufacturing, was expected to more
than offset the projected decline in oil production. In line with declining
oil revenue, Government investment was projected to decline substantially
along with a sharp cutback in defense expenditures. With a projected annual
average decline in imports of 11 percent, the Plan projected that the
current account of the balance-of-payments would be in surplus in 1980.
7.       During the first Plan, the Omani economy did not attain several of
the targets for the productive sectors. Public investment declined faster
than forecast in the Plan mainly because of constraints in project
preparation and implementation in the productive non-oil sectors; major
projects such as a cement and a copper plant and an industrial estate



suffered delays of up to five years. The projected cutback in defense
expenditure was not achieved although a slight reduction in real terms took
place since 1976. However, the Plan succeeded in attaining most of its
targets for infrastructure investments.
8.       Oil was the leading growth sector until 1977 when production
started to decline at an annual average rate of about 6.0 percent. However,
following the large oil price increases in 1979 the petroleum sector
increased its output in value terms by over 70 percent in 1980. While
agriculture is the major source of income for the majority of the
population, its value-added accounts for less than 3 percent of GDP. After
two years of strong expansion in 1975 and 1976, the construction sector
slowed down during 1976-78 reflecting a retrenchment in development
expenditure. It has since expanded because of the increase in Government
expenditures and improved access to interest-free loans. Oman's industrial
sector other than construction is still small; it accounted for about
2.0 percent of GDP in 1980. Government services continued to increase
rapidly throughout the Plan period. Overall, an annual average increase of
2 percent in GDP in real terms is estimated for the 1976-80 period.
9.       Oil revenue accounts for almost 90 percent of Government revenue.
Non-oil revenues, composed mainly of corporate income tax, customs duties
and income from public utilities have shown a modest average increase since
1976, while defense expenditure accounted for about half of current
expenditure. Civil recurrent expenditure rose by an average of 24 percent
per year since 1976. Public investment declined rapidly from 1976 to 1978.
In 1977, in sharp contrast to the previous years, an overall current surplus
was registered, caused by a substantial rise in grant receipts and
shortfalls in development expenditures. After a deficit in 1978, the budget
showed a substantial surplus again in 1979, reflecting a 54 percent oil
price rise over 1978 and a shortfall in budgeted development expenditures.
This enabled the Government to repay almost all of the domestic debt and
increase its deposits with the banks. Similarly, Oman was able to repay in
advance a large part of external loans with relatively hard terms. Oman's
balance-of-payments reflects the performance of the oil sector and public
expenditure policy. Deficits occurred between 1972 and 1976. Following a
surplus which resulted mainly from a record level of grant receipts in 1977,
a deficit of $97 million was incurred in 1978 as grant receipts fell sharply
and repayments on external loans were particularly high. In 1979 and 1980,
oil price increases brought oil export revenues of about $2.2 billion and
$3.6 billion respectively. Furthermore, inflow of grants was at $100
million in 1980. Overall, the balance-of-payments showed a surplus of $1.2
billion and net foreign assets rose to $1.8 billion at the end of 1980
(equivalent to 11 months imports at the 1980 level).



- 4 -
10.      During 1981, the decline in oil output came to an end.  Production
increased as the technical problems responsible for the decline in the
northern fields were solved. The rest of the economy, particularly the
construction sector, has also benefitted from increased oil revenue and
Government expenditures. The 1981 budget provided for a 43 percent increase
in overall Government expenditure. Government investment has been budgeted
to double compared to the 1980 level. Government oil revenue is estimated
to reach RO 1.3 billion. A Reserve Fund was created in 1979 and 15 percent
of the oil revenue and all budget surpluses will be deposited in it. The
Reserve Fund allocation for 1980 was about RO 280 million (about $800
million).
Future Prospects
11.      Oman's long-term development objectives are basically those
enunciated in the first Five-Year Plan. These objectives have been
reemphasized in the Second Plan (1981-85), which was approved in November
1980. Despite the improved outlook for oil production (para. 13), the
long-term prospects of the Omani economy depend on the country's capacity to
diversify its productive base in non-oil sectors, to shift the concentration
of investment from infrastructure to productive sectors (i.e. agriculture,
fisheries, manufacturing) and to eliminate the two key constraints which, so
far, have hampered such diversification. First is the critical constraint
of scarcity of technical and professional manpower. This has been a major
factor behind the lack of project preparation, evaluation and implementation
capacity which has also been a cause of the decline in public investment
since 1976. Alleviation of this constraint would also help reduce the
growing dependence on expatriate labor at all levels. Second, the lack of
clearly defined sector policies in agriculture, fisheries and industry has
severely hampered realization of the Plan's growth targets.
12.      The limited natural resource base, with a paucity of water and
minerals, and the small size of the domestic market are further constraints
to diversification, in agriculture and manufacturing; there is nevertheless a
growth potential in these sectors that is yet to be fully exploited. In
agriculture, given the present low crop yields, relatively large increases
in yields appear technically feasible through timely application of
fertilizers, improved plant spacing, weeding, pest and disease controls. In
manufacturing, selected import substitution industries for non-durable
consumer goods and down-stream copper products (from the copper mine
expected to enter into production in 1982) would have a significant impact
on the balance-of-payments. In fisheries, the prospects are extremely good
as the fish resources off the country's 2,000 kilometers of coast are rich.



- 5 -
13.      Prospects for the oil sector are now considered better than
previously forecast. Official estimates of Oman's proven oil reserves stood
at 2.5 billion barrels in 1980; this would last about 20 years at the 1981
rate of extraction. With improved reservoir performance and the use of
secondary recovery techniques in the northern fields and the development of
southern fields, it should be possible to maintain the 1981 output level of
330,000 barrels per day.
14.      The tentative projections given in Annex I show a real GDP growth
of 4.2 percent during the 1981-85 period. The balance-of-payments shows
increasing surpluses in the current account until 1985. Rapid accumulation
of reserves would take place over the period in line with the "Reserve Fund"
policy (para. 10). In case of a higher international inflation than
assumed, accumulation of reserves would be less than projected. Similarly,
higher investment levels than assumed would absorb some of the projected
surpluses. These projections are merely illustrative; the actual level of
oil production will be determined, among other factors, by public
expenditure and development policies over the next few years.
External Assistance and Foreign Debt
15.      Oman's external public debt amounted to about $345 million
(outstanding and disbursed debt) in 1980. Loans from commercial banks
accounted for the major part of borrowing in 1974 and 1975 on relatively
hard terms. Concessionary borrowing in recent years has softened the
average terms of Oman's external debt as the share of bilateral and
multilateral loans increased. In view of the economic prospects described
above, future external assistance requirements are likely to be smaller than
in earlier years. Oman's debt service was 9.2 percent in 1979 but fell to
4.2 percent of exports of goods and services in 1980 as a result of advance
repayment on most of the commercial loans.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN OMAN
16.      Oman joined the Bank in December 1971, and has since received five
Bank loans totalling $46.9 million (of which $0.4 million was cancelled from
Loan 1442-OM for Engineering Studies). Two were approved by the Executive
Directors in FY1974 (Education and Technical Assistance), two in FY1977
(Highway Maintenance and Engineering Studies) and one in FY1980
(Telecommunications). Of these loans, Education and Engineering Studies are
fully disbursed. Annex II contains a summary statement of these loans and
of IFC activities as of September 30, 1981, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects. Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily. In
FY1979, IFC approved a $2.0 million equity participation in the newly
created Oman Development Bank.



- 6 -
17.       Bank lending to Oman has been principally directed towards the
provision of technical assistance in crucial areas; the relief of national
manpower constraints; and the develcpment of appropriate policies and
investment strategies in priority sectors.
18.       Some projects have had a significant development impact, but
difficulties have been faced in mapping a systematic Bank program in the
sectors which required technical assistance, such as agriculture, fisheries,
industry, water supply and power. However, the Technical Assistance Project
of 1974, under which the Development Council was established, can be
credited for helping introduce economic management and planning in Oman with
the First Plan (1976-1980). The Development Council has shaped many of the
fiscal and budgetary procedures applied in the administration, continues to
exercise a considerable influence in economic decision-making, and prepared
the Second Plan (1981-85). As a result, Oman has developed a capability for
identifying priorities for economic devel'opment. The Education Project of
1974, which was prepared and implemented with the assistance of UNESCO and
of the United Kingdom, was successfully completed in 1980 and has helped
upgrade national educational opportunities and standards. Implementation of
the first Highways Maintenance Project, the precursor to the proposed
project, is proceeding well although a year behind schedule and its
institution-building impact and potential is widely recognized. The same
can be said of the Telecommunications Project, which is, however, at an
earlier stage of implementation.
19.       Tentative Bank projections (para. 14) indicate that Oman will need
limited if any external borrowings over the medium term. However, Oman's
technical assistance and training requirements in the next decade will be
significant. Scarcity of technical and managerial manpower necessitates
external technical assistance in economic planning, project preparation,
evaluation, and implementation as well as in improving organizational
capabilities. The Bank will continue to respond to Government requests for
assistance in keeping with Bank policy vis-a-vis high income countries. A
first step has been taken in this direction with the signing of an Agreement
on Technical Cooperation between Oman and the Bank which provides technical
assistance towards the establishment by Oman of a Manpower Planning Unit
within its Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
20.       Until 1970 there was no modern transport system in Oman.  The road
network consisted of only 10 km of paved roadway and an unknown length of
earthen tracks; there was limited coastal and air traffic. Now, the
country's basic transport system includes an extensive and rapidly growing
road network, two modern deep-water ports, an oil port, an international
airport and several civilian and military airfields.



-7-
Highways
21.      The national road network is under the jurisdiction of the
Directorate General of Roads (DGR) within the Ministry of Communications.
It includes 2,270 km of paved roads, completed or under construction; 6,700
km of maintained earth roads; and several thousand km of tracks which only
4-wheel drive vehicles can negotiate but which are being gradually improved
as traffic develops. The network is adequate for the main needs of almost
all regions of the country, and provides good access to the major
agricultural areas and population centers. The critical need now is to
build up in Oman a capacity to carry out highway maintenance.
22.      The DGR is a well conceived organization, but was only established
in 1972, and is still very short of trained staff at all levels. A training
unit was established under the first Highway Maintenance Project (Loan
1441-OM) to train DGR staff at all levels, and is beginning to bear fruit.
Increasing numbers of Omanis are acquiring technical and administrative
skills. The proposed project would pursue this effort and begin to plan for
the gradual phasing out of expatriate technical assistance in the highways
subsector.
23.      Highway planning and design are carried out in DGR with the
assistance of consultants financed under the first Loan. Construction is
undertaken by foreign contractors. DGR carries out routine maintenance of
the earth road network by force account in its six regional centers, but due
to its still limited capabilities, contracts out periodic and routine
asphalt maintenance. Management of maintenance operations is also assisted
by consultants financed under Loan 1441-OM.
24.      Highway expenditures are financed from the general budget.  Direct
and indirect taxes on road users consist of a 2 percent tax on the c.i.f.
value of imports; a circulation tax based on the weight of the vehicle; and
a modest fuel tax. These taxes are not earmarked for highway expenditure,
but go into the general fund. Investment in highway infrastructure was
budgeted at about $172.0 million in 1979, and recurrent expenditures in the
same year at $6.6 million.
25.      Traffic data show that over the past three years there has been a
high rate of growth. Increases of 14 to 20 percent per annum have been
recorded on some main roads. The vehicle fleet has grown from 1,000 in 1970
to 31,000 in 1975 and to over 86,000 by the end of 1979. Government
regulation of transportation is very recent. Axle load limits were
determined under a study carried out within the Technical Assistance Project
and put into force during the first project (see paragraph 35). There is
considerable competition among small trucking operators.



- 8-
Ports, Civil Aviation, and Railways
26.      Oman has a number of natural harbors, including the historically
important small port of Muscat. The completion of Port Qaboos in 1975, very
close to the capital city of Muscat, provided the country with a modern
deep-water port with a capacity of 1.5 million tons of cargo per year. The
port has eleven berths, ten transit sheds, a cement silo, fish canning and
general deep-freezing facilities, and a grain silo. A nearby oil port
serves as the export terminus for Oman's oil. Near the southern town of
Salalah at Raysut, port expansion was completed toward the end of 1980 to
handle one million tons a year, a capacity substantially in excess of
current needs. There are also several natural coastal harbors for dhow
traffic.
27.      Civil air transport is still in an early stage of development.  The
mostly dry climate and subsoils with good bearing capacities allow for
numerous natural landing places for light aircraft, and rudimentary
airstrips exist in many parts of the country. Regular domestic service is
limited to flights between Muscat, the capital, and Salalah in the south.
Seeb International Airport, 32 km west of Muscat, opened in late 1972 and
can handle the largest commercial airplanes, although some expansion of the
repair and hangar facilities will be needed soon. There are no railways in
Oman, and none are planned.
Bank Strategy in the Sector
28.       Under Technical Assistance Loan 985-OM, a transportation study was
carried out to help establish planning and basic policies in the sector. It
produced a five-year program for maintenance of the road network which
served as a basis for the first Highways Maintenance Project financed under
Loan 1441-OM. The latter financed procurement of equipment for maintenance;
construction of six workshops for repair and maintenance of highway
maintenance equipment and of a training center; and technical assistance for
construction planning and design, highway maintenance planning, and for
training. Execution of the project is proceeding well, albeit about a year
behind schedule: four of the six workshops and the training center are
completed and are expected to become operational shortly and training is
underway, although at levels lower than projected at appraisal mainly due to
a shortage of mechanics trainees. The loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by September 1982.
29.      Because of the very recent expansion of Oman's paved and gravel
highway network to connect all the major areas of the country, priorities
have been shifting from highway construction to maintenance. Under the
First Highways Maintenance Project financed under Loan 1441-OM, the Ministry
of Communications and its DGR underwent very substantial reinforcement
through technical assistance and training, and the provision of support
infrastructure for training and routine maintenance. Basic regulations were



- 9 -
also developed limiting axle loads. Under the proposed project further
technical assistance and training would be provided to pursue and
consolidate the institutional gains achieved under the first project,
support infrastructure would be completed for routine maintenance, while DGR
activities would be extended to the periodic maintenance activities of
regravelling and asphalt overlays on selected road sections where
economically justified. Planning and control in the sector would be
reinforced with the provision of pavement data collection equipment.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
30.      The proposed project was prepared by consultants financed under
Loan 1441-OM in close collaboration with the DGR. It was appraised in
June/July 1980. Negotiations were held in Washington from November 9 to
November 13, 1981. The Omani delegation was led by Mr. Tariq Al-Mantheri,
Director General of Roads, Ministry of Communications. Staff Appraisal
Report no. 3191-OM dated December 8, 1981 is being distributed separately.
The general characteristics of the project are described in the Loan and
Project Summary and Annex III provides supplementary data. A map is also
attached.
Description of the Project
31.      The project would consist of the first three years of the five-year
(1982-1987) national program for highway maintenance. It would build on the
first Highway Maintenance Project financed under Loan 1441-OM and pursue its
institutional-building objectives, thus contributing to preserve the large
investments Oman has made in the recent past to develop its road network.
The project components are listed in the Loan and Project Summary.  The Bank
loan would finance all or part of the foreign exchange requirements of the
following components of the project: (i) asphalt overlay of selected
roads; (ii) procurement of highway maintenance equipment and spare parts;
(iii) procurement of pavement data collection equipment; (iv) civil works
for construction of highway maintenance centers; and (v) consultant and

The Highway Maintenance Prcgram
32.      The maintenance mdnagement consultants financed under Loan 1441-OM
prepared an updated five-y.Xar routine and periodic maintenance program for
the highway network. The government has given its preliminary approval to
this program, and its detailed scope has been discussed and agreed with the
Bank.

33.      Because the paved road network is relatively new and predominantly
of high pavement design standard, periodic maintenance requirements
(rehabilitation, resealing, pavement reinforcement) are likely to be small
within the next five years. These would be carried out by contractors.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that periodic maintenance works
for each specific road link will be subject to a minimum economic rate of
return of 12 percent, calculated according to an agreed methodology, and
that each road selected will be subject to technical criteria and submitted
to the Bank for prior approval (Loan Agreement, Section 2.02 (b) and
Schedule 5).
34.      Under the routine maintenance program, specialized force account
units in each of the six maintenance regions, which would receive training
under the project (see paragraph 37), would regularly reshape earth road
surfaces, carry out minor patching of asphalt surfaces, and maintain
shoulders, drainage, side slopes, signs and markings. A list of equipment
and machinery to be procured under this program has been provisionally
identified and agreed upon during negotiations. In addition, two
supplementary maintenance workshops would be added to the six workshops
being built under the first project. The eight maintenance workshops will
provide satisfactory geographic distribution of support for operational
servicing, repairs and overhaul of highway maintenance equipment. In
addition, it was agreed during negotiations that the Government will
implement its Five-Year Highway Maintenance Program in accordance with
physical targets and budgetary allocations as may be agreed between the
Government and the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 4.05).
35.      Axle load limits were introduced in Oman under the first project.
As under the first project, agreement was reached during negotiations that
the Government will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that the
legal limits with respect to the dimensions and axle loads of vehicles will
be observed and enforced (Loan Agreement, Section 4.04). The loan would
also finance procurement of pavement data collection equipment and vehicles
for the use of the Traffic Section of DGR so that traffic data collection
for planning of highway maintenance and construction activities can be
continued and extended.
Technical Assistance and Training
36.      The lack of trained manpower at all levels of economic activitity
is perhaps the single most pressing development constraint in Oman. The DGR
is no exception, with many of its authorized positions vacant and others
occupied by partly qualified personnel. The proposed project would, as did
the first project, focus on developing DGR's institutional capability.
Therefore, consultant services to provide technical assistance is foreseen
mainly in three areas: (i) 100 man-months for assistance in administration,
planning and operations; (ii) 150 man-months for assistance in highway
maintenance management; and (iii) 90 man-months for training of supervisors,



- 11 -
operators and workshop mechanics. Draft terms of reference for the
consultant's services were discussed and agreed upon at negotiations. The
project also provides for 240 man-months of direct in-line services of
individual experts and technicians to serve directly with the DGR and for
the services of a Project Coordinator throughout the project.
37.      Training is a critical activity to be undertaken under the project
since it is crucial to upgrading the level of maintenance carried out by
DGR, and fostering a gradual replacement of expatriates at all levels. As
under the first project, which made useful progress in this respect despite
a critical shortage of trainees relative to targets in a few categories,
training would be provided to middle- and high-level staff, road
supervisors, equipment operators, drivers and mechanics and, not least
important, Omani instructors. Training would be conducted in the field
maintenance centers, in regional workshops and in the training center
completed under the first project, as appropriate. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that the Government would (i) implement a
comprehensive training program; (ii) make available sufficient numbers of
experienced personnel to be trained as instructors; (iii) make available
sufficient manpower to be trained for maintenance operations; and (iv)
maintain a permanent training section within the DGR (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.05). An understanding was reached that the comprehensive training
program would be submitted for approval of the Bank three months after the
arrival of the training consultant in Oman.
Project Cost and Financing
38       A detailed breakdown of the cost of the project is given in the
Loan and Project Summary. The total cost is estimated at $48.1 million of
which $34.2 million would be in foreign exchange. The loan of $15 million
therefore represents 31 percent of total project costs. Price contingencies
were calculated using domestic escalation rate estimates of 10 percent for
1981, and 9 percent for 1982 and thereafter, and foreign rates of 9 percent
for 1981, 8 percent for 1982 and 7 percent thereafter. The cost of
consultants is estimated at an average of $8,200 per man-month, including
social costs overheads and fees and overseas allowances; average travel and
local costs are $500 and $600 respectively. Technicians, mostly mechanic
instructors recruited on an individual basis to serve with DGR, are
estimated at $800 to $1,000 per man-month excluding housing and local
allowances.
Project Implementation
39.      The Ministry of Communications would have overall responsibility
for project implementation. The DGR, under the Ministry of Communications,
would have direct responsibility for the execution and implementation of the
maintenance and training programs, with the assistance of consultants. The
project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1985.

Procurement and Disbursement
40.      The bulk of procurement for civil works or equipment purchase would
be carried out after international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines. Contracts for highway asphalt overlay estimated to
cost less than $1 million each would be procured in accordance with local
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts for the construction of
highway maintenance centers shall be awarded after competitive bidding in
accordance with the Borrower's procedures which are satisfactory to the
Bank. The presence of a large number of foreign and local contractors in
Oman should ensure adequate competition. The purchase of pavement data
collection equipment as well as some highway equipment and spares contracts
which do not in the aggregate exceed $0.2 million would follow the local
purchase procedures of the Government, which are satisfactory to the Bank.
Consultants to carry out technical assistance would be selected in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02(b)).
The loan would be disbursed against 95 percent of the full cost of imported
equipment (mostly for maintenance and training), 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost of technical assistance, the estimated foreign exchange cost
of construction of highway maintenance centers (50 percent of total cost)
and of asphalt overlays (70 percent of total cost).
Project Benefits and Justification
41.      The proposed project is necessary to consolidate and strengthen the
institution building achieved under the first project. Its economic
benefits would accrue directly to (i) the country, which would preserve its
road investment and ultimately lower its maintenance costs as Omani
nationals are trained to replace expatriates; (ii) the trucking industry
through reduced vehicle operating costs which would be passed on to
consumers because free competition prevails in the trucking industry; and
(iii) the wide range of other highway users.
42.      Great care has been exercised under the proposed project to
determine the optimum maintenance level which would be applied under the
project; it is estimated to give an overall economic rate of return of about
44 percent for the project when compared with present maintenance levels.
Periodic maintenance works would be subject to a minimum economic rate of
return requirement of 12 percent, calculated according to a methodology
agreed upon during negotiations (see paragraph 33).
43.      Project risks arise mainly from the possibility that an
insufficient number of Omanis would be available for training under the
proposed project to take over, in due course, the highway maintenance
functions which in most critical areas are currently being carried out by
expatriates. These risks would be offset by the commissioning of new
workshops in the near future and increased efforts being made by the
Government, such as through recruiting drives and competitive wages, to make
trainees available.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION/1
AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 1981
Ln. No. 985 Technical Assistance Project: US$2.75 million Loan of May 15,
1974. Date of Effectiveness: December 11, 1974; Closing Date;
June 30, 1982.
The economic planning and management team, financed under the Loan,
completed preparation of Oman's second economic development plan (1981-1985)
in March 1981. With this, the major activities under the loan are now
virtually completed. Further planning and management is being provided by
experts under the loan.
Ln. No. 1441 Highway Maintenance Project: US$15 million Loan of June 20,
1977; Date of Effectiveness: September 14, 1977; Closing Date:
September 30, 1982.
After some delays, consultant's work on maintenance management and
training is expected to be completed shortly. Implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily: four of the six workshops have been completed and
construction of the two remaining ones is expected to start in 1982. The
training center has been built and training activities are underway. A
training section in the Directorate General of Roads was established in
March 1981 and a Chief of Training Affairs has been appointed.
Ln. No. 1884 - Telecommunications Project: US$22.0 million of October 22,
1980; Date of Effectiveness: May 1, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
The General Telecommunications Organization (GTO) has recruited the
consultants to assist in project implementation. The new schedule
represents about one year's delay from the original forecast due to delays
in GTO's selection of the consulting firm, but some of the lost time is
expected to be recovered within the project period. A technical management
expert is being recruited in accordance with the terms of the loan.
Substantial progress has been achieved in GTO's finance and accounts.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
