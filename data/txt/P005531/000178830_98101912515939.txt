I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Sultanate of Oman has asked the Bank to help finance a proj-
ect comprising road maintenance, training of maintenance personnel and
technical assistance to the Directorate General of Roads (DGR). The pro-
posed project is expected to be a continuum of the present Highway Main-
tenance Project (Loan 1441-OM) both in scope and point in time, and the
basic five-year (1982-87) maintenance program on which it is based was
prepared by the maintenance management/training assistance consultants
(MMT), Roy Jorgensen Associates, Inc., financed under Loan 1441-OM. The
total costs of the first three years of the five-year maintenance program
is estimated at US$48.1 million including routine maintenance arid US$41.9
million excluding routine maintenance, towards which a Bank loan of
US$15.0 million is proposed, representing 31% and 36% respectively of the
total costs.
1.02     This report was prepared on the basis of information by the Omani
authorities, the DGR, MMT consultants, and general technical assistance
consultants (Dar Al-Handasah Consultants, Shair & Partners) and on the
findings of an appraisal mission composed of A. I. Ramuglia (Economist),
M. R. Payne (Engineer) and G. A. Morra (Training Specialist) who visited
Oman in June 1980, and an updating mission in March 1981 of Messrs. Howard
(Division Chief) and Payne (Engineer).
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
2.01     Details on the geography, economic development and the transport
network as a whole including background on transport policy, planning and
organization are available in the Project File under Transport Sector
Memorandum dated February 1976 (see Document Al of Annex 1), and in the
gray cover "Appraisal of a Highway Maintenance Project in Oman" (Report
No. 1508a-OM) dated May 17, 1977 (Document A2) and in the Draft Report on
a Highway Master Plan by Dar Al-Handasah Consultants, dated March 1980
(Document A3).
2.02     The existing transport infrastructure now provides for the basic
needs of almost all regions of the country although some of the tracks
still require four-wheel drive vehicles; however, these tracks are con-
stantly being improved, some to paved road standards. The main road net-
work is of high standard and provides direct access to the main agricul-
tural and population centers of the country. With the recent upgrading of
the port of Raysut in Dhofar Province, Oman has two major ports and gener-
ally adequate facilities although the port of Sur, southeast of Muscat
where the Gulf of Oman joins the Arabian Sea, represents a possible area
for future port development. International air traffic is well served by
Seeb International Airport but some additional hangar space seems neces-
sary. The airport at Salalah (Province of Dhofar) is presently adequate
but additional facilities, especially refueling and repair, would be



- 2 -
required if the airport becomes an international link. The airports at
Khasab, Sohar, Buraimi, Nizwa, Sur and Masirah have limited facilities for
passengers and are only served by irregular, and fairly frequent, military
flights on a space available basis.
2.03     On the whole, the critical needs now in the transport sector are
maintenance and operations. The present and still expanding highway net-
work needs more and better maintenance, while the ports and, to some ex-
tent, the airports require improved operations.
Bank's Role Related to the Transport Sector
2.04     The Bank's involvement in the transport sector of Oman (Loan
985-OM, approved by the Board in April 1974 and Loan 1441-OM, approved by
the Board in May 1977) has supported the development of the DGR generally
and its maintenance and planning capabilities in particular. Under Loan
985-OM technical assistance consultants to the DGR prepared a five-year
routine and periodic maintenance program for the national roads of Oman.
This program, the first such for the country, served as a basic input for
the ongoing Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 1441-OM) which comprised a
three-year portion (1978-81) of the five-year maintenance program and
included a staff training component for Omani highway maintenance
personnel.
2.05     Future Bank lending for the highway subsector should aim at
extending and consolidating the country's highway maintenance program,
including the critical training element, as well as providing necessary
general technical assistance to DGR. These are the objectives of the
proposed Second Highway Maintenance Project (paras. 4.01 to 4.03).
III. THE HIGHWAYS
A. The Network
3.01     The historical development of the highway network is detailed in
Documents Al, A2 and A3 and Table Cl of the Project File (See Annex 1).
B. Traffic
3.02     Historically, traffic data has been limited.  In October 1975,
the technical assistance consultant to the DGR conducted the first com-
prehensive traffic surveys in the Sultanate and subsequently established a
section responsible for traffic surveys in the DGR. This small section,
with the aid of the technical assistance consultants financed under the
Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 1441-OM), conducted 188, 12-hour and
24-hour, classification counts during 1979. This was followed by a compre-
hensive traffic study including origin/destination surveys undertaken by
consultants between December 1980 and February 1981. Since the DGR traffic
section's effectiveness has been hampered by lack of dependable vehicles



and serviceable automatic counters, the proposed project would strengthen
this section's capability by providing funds for traffic counters, vehi-
cles and related equipment (para. 4.12). Technical assistance to the
section would also be available from the consultant services provided the
DGR and in the form of individual technicians (paras. 4.14 to 4.16).
3.03     Available traffic data show a high rate of traffic growth over
the last three years in most areas; some of the heavily travelled roads in
the capital area show traffic increases of 14 to 20% per annum and some
important rural links show traffic growth rates as high as 35% per annum.
Future maintenance planning, as well as general highway planning, will be
based on the trends established from data!/ collected during 1976-79 and
the early 1981 O/D study (see para. 3.02).
3.04     The vehicle fleet in Oman has also shown significant expansion.
In 1970 there were only about 1,000 motor vehicles of all kinds in Oman
and most of these belonged to the Armed Forces or the Petroleum Develop-
ment Oman Limited. By the end of 1973 the vehicle fleet had increased to
about 14 500 by the end of 1975 to 31,000 and by the end of 1979 to over
86,000..7
3.05     With the exception of urban bus transportation, there is no
government regulation of tariffs. This has encouraged an economically
rational pricing demand for transport since the road transport industry in
Oman is characterized by great competition between small operators. A
study carried out under the Technical Assistance Loan (985-OM) in
1977,3/ recommended basic axle load limits; these were established and,
in accord- ance with a covenant in the Loan Agreement for Loan lL441-OM
(Section 4.03), are now being enforced by the Government. Traffic
regulations are generally well enforced and obeyed, especially in the
capital area which is the only area with a significant concentration of
traffic.
C. Administration
3.06     Administration of the national highway network is directly under
the jurisdiction of the DGR which is a part of the Ministry of Communica-
tions (MOC). Although the basic organizational structure of the DGR is
sound, a shortage of professional staff has meant that the actual operat-
*         ing structure is considerably different than the formal structure.  The

1976 through 1979, see "Draft Report on Highway Master Plan,," March 1980,

(Document A3).

- 4 -
main administrative and technical departments of the DGR are in Muscat.
Actual maintenance of the road network is centered on six regional areas
each of which in turn supports a number of field work centers.
3.07     Althougn many of the approved staff posts of the DGR are vacant
and many of the individuals who are filling positions lack the required
qualifications to be fully effective, a sustained effort in recruiting
expatriates to fill line positions has allowed the DGR to improve its
capabilities over the last few years. The First Highway Project (Loan
1441-OM) provided funds for a number of individual expatriates to be
recruited, mostly in conjunction with the training programs.  This pro-
posed project will provide additional technical assistance for financing
the foreign costs of expatriate individuals to fill a broad spectrum of
in-line positions related to the DGR maintenance responsibilities (para.
4.16).
D. Planning, Finance and Investment, and Engineering
3.08     Details of planning, finance and investment, and engineering in
regard to highways in Oman are contained in the Project File, in parti-
cular, Documents No. Al, A2 and A3 (see Annex 1).
E. Highway Maintenance
3.09     Although highway maintenance is one of the prime functions of the
DGR, it cannot now, on its own, achieve adequate routine and periodic
maintenance of the expanding Omani highway network due to understaffing
and a serious shortage of key administrative and technical personnel at
all levels. Since paved highways in Oman essentially date from 1970, with
most of the paved kilometrage more recent than that, and with most paved
links having received one or two years' maintenance from the construction
contractors as part of their contract, deterioration due to inadequate
maintenance has not yet become a major problem. Nevertheless, some
important links either now need, or will soon need, periodic maintenance
(overlays). To meet this need, the DGR will wisely turn to the large and
capable contracting industry operating in Oman to carry out essential
periodic maintenance on paved roads. The Government has indicated that
they would also like to undertake such periodic maintenance tasks as re-
graveling and surface treatment of gravel roads by contract to the extent
that this work would attract competent contractors at reasonable prices.
It is expected that in most cases such work will be sufficiently attrac-
tive to assure reasonable competition and prices. The proposed Second
Highway Maintenance Project will support these efforts to upgrade periodic
maintenance through the use of contractors to protect the existing invest-
ments in highway infrastructure without burdening the DGR with the neces-
sity to purchase increased quantities of special equipment for such work
and recruit or train adequate staff to effectively utilize the equipment.



3.10     Appropriately, the MOC has included in the five-year periodic
maintenance program improvements by asphalt overlay, gravel replenishment
and maintenance of paved roads by major patching, guard rail installation,
etc.
3.11     Although the level of routine maintenance has improved during the
last few years, the level of maintenance effort on most unpaved roads
under the DGR still is only between fair and poor. Although scarifying
and grading of the travelled way alleviates corrugated surfaces, excessive
operations sometimes result in channelization as the travelled way is cut
down below natural ground level. The training program for maintenance
equipment operators under the First Highway Maintenance Project (Loan
1441-OM) has helped to develop an awareness of the importance of maintain-
ing the shape and grade and ensuring drainage of unpaved roads while
eliminating corrugations. The proposed project will strengthen and expand
these training efforts as well as meet the equipment needs for the in-
creased routine maintenance effort found to be economically justified (see
paras. 5.04 and 5.05).
F. Training
3.12     The present Bank Highway Maintenance Project in Oman (Loan
1441-OM) has provided for a broad spectrum of training for DGR personnel
based on an evaluation of needs directly related to the highway mainte-
nance program.!/ The proposed project would continue and strengthen
this effort, taking into account the particular lessons learned during the
implementation of Loan 1441-OM (see para. 4.17-4.23).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01     The overall objectives of the project remain as for the First
Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 1441-OM), namely, to protect recent
highway improvements and sustain an efficient national highway transport
network to serve present and future demand.
4.02     The project will provide assistance to the DGR to apply effective
routine highway maintenance procedures initiated under the First Project.
Additionally, it would be extended to the periodic highway maintenance
activities of gravel replenishment and asphalt overlays.
4.03     The objectives of sustained development of the DGR maintenance
management and training operations and the improvement of its planning
function would be supported by consultant services.
1/ For particulars, see Project File, especially Document No. A2.



B. Description
4.04     The project would be a continuation of the First Highway Project
(Loan 1441-OM) in intent and comprises the first three-year portion (1982
to 1985) of the Directorate's five-year highway maintenance program (1982
to 1987) for:
(i)  periodic maintenance and minor improvements of highways;
(ii) equipment and spare parts for highway maintenance, workshops,
training and pavement data collection;
(iii)  construction and/or rehabilitation of workshops and highway
maintenance centers;
(iv) technical assistance to DGR and MOC; and
(v)  routine highway maintenance.
4.05     The proposed loan would finance all or part of the foreign
exchange costs of the following project components during a three-year
period from 1982 to 1985:
(i) the asphalt overlay component of the periodic maintenance and
minor improvements program;
(ii) highway maintenance equipment and spare parts;
(iii)  pavement data collection equipment;
(iv)   construction of two highway maintenance centers; and
(v)   consultant services and individual technicians (see paras. 4.14
to 4.23) for highway maintenance management, training, planning
and general technical assistance to both the DGR and the MOC.
Periodic Maintenance and Minor Improvements
4.06     The Omani paved road network is quite young (weighted average age
just over four years) and predominantly of high pavement design standard.
Approximately 200 km of the 2,270 km of paved highways are over eight
years old; consequently periodic maintenance requirements during the five-
year maintenance program (1982-87) are expected to be few and only 100 km
of asphalt overlay have been included in the project. In addition, provi-
sion has been made for periodic maintenance (basically gravel replenish-
ment) of some 500 km of unpaved roads. In view of the relatively small
size of the relevant contracts and the presence in Oman of a large number
of foreign and local contractors, the five-year periodic maintenance pro-
gram would be best procured by local competitive bidding.
4.07     Periodic maintenance activities for gravel and paved roads would
form components of the proposed Second Highway Maintenance Project. The



- 7 -
program is detailed in the special report on the Sultanate's "P'hysical
Maintenance Program" (see Project File Document B1) and was discussed at
negotiations. A section of the Ibri-UAE border near Buraimi WaS tenta-
tively identified for asphalt overlay. Technical and economic evaluation
of this section will be carried out by the technical assistance consult-
ants and the results sent to the Bank for review to ascertain its
eligibility for financing (see para. 4.25).
Routine Maintenance
4.08     As for the First Highway Maintenance Project, the day--to-day cost
of operations (salaries, wages, fuels, oils, lubricants, etc.) represent
recurrent expenditures which are not eligible for reimbursement: from the
proceeds of the loan.  They are, however, part of the overall cost of the
project and these costs would be met from Government funds (see
para. 4.31). The program is detailed in Project File Document B1 (see
Annex 1).
Equipment and Spare Parts for:
4.09     Highway Maintenance.  The numbers and types of highway main-
tenance equipment and spares to be procured have been assessed from the
numbers and condition of the existing inventory, work loads by maintenance
activity, equipment productivity rates and spare parts consumption rates.
A provisional list of equipment and related spares to be procured was
discussed and agreed during negotiations (see Project File Document C16
and Annex 6).
4.10     Workshops.  The procurement of the numbers and types of equipment
to operate the proposed new mechanical workshops and highway maintenance
centers will be phased with the proposed construction program (see para.
4.13, below).
4.11     Training.  Equipment required for the training function part of
the technical assistance component (see paras. 4.17 to 4.23 below) will be
selected and procured to meet the training course requirements for
mechanics and equipment operators.
4.12     Pavement Data and Training.  The project includes pavement data
collection equipment and vehicles for the use of the Traffic Section of
the DGR so that pavement and traffic data collection for planning of
highway maintenance and construction activities can be continued and
extended as well as classroom and field training equipment. Details were
discussed and agreed at negotiations (see Project File Document C18 and
Annex 7).
Construction and/or Rehabilitation of Workshops and Highway
Maintenance Centers
4.13     The DGR confirmed the locations and justified the construction/
rehabilitation of two additional regional workshops at Ibra and Masira



- 8 -
Island to complement the four new workshops at Azaiba, Salalah, Al-Ghaliel
and Ibri and the two workshops remaining to be constructed under the First
Project. When completed, the eight workshops will provide satisfactory
regional distribution of mechanical support for operational servicing,
repairs and overhaul of highway maintenance equipment. Workshop design
layouts will be similar to those of the First Project. The layouts of
highway maintenance centers were discussed at negotiations and locations
identified as Azaiba, Quriyat, Barka al Mos, Buraimi, Masira, Ibri, Murbat
and Titan.
Consultants Services and Individual Technicians
4.14     During appraisal the DGR and the MOC expressed their wish to
engage a single consultant firm to assist them with both highway main-
tenance management/training and general technical assistance. The experi-
ence gained in the First Project, where two consultant firms were sepa-
rately engaged for highway maintenance and general technical assistance,
demonstrated that easier liaison within the MOC would be maintained with a
single consultant firm. Draft Terms of Reference for the consultant's
services were discussed and agreed at negotiations (see Project File
Document D2).
4.15     The Terms of Reference include provisions in this project for
continuing and expanding the technical assistance started in the First
Project for:
(i)  highway maintenance management (150 man-months);
(ii)  the training program for highway maintenance supervisors,
operators and workshop mechanics (90 man-months); and
(iii)  general technical assistance in administrative, planning and
operational support of both the DGR and MOC, including the
continuation of pavement and traffic data collection (100
man-months).
4.16     The project also provides for 240 man-months of direct in-line
services of individual experts and technicians to serve directly with the
DGR and for the services of a Project Coordinator throughout the project.
Specific job titles, descriptions and man-months required for each cate-
gory of staff will be decided after the preparation of a plan of action by
the training consultants (see para. 6.01 (iv)).
Training
4.17     The three-year (1982 to 1985) program of training for highway
maintenance personnel would follow up and expand the program undertaken
under the First Highway Maintenance Project and would be specially
addressed to maintenance supervisors, equipment operators, drivers and
mechanics.



- 9 -
4.18     Technical assistance and Arabic-speaking instructors required for
the implementation of the three-year program would be provided under the
project. Newly trained Omani instructors would continue to be upgraded
and work alongside the training specialists. One of the expatriate staff
would act as the senior training adviser to DGR, and be responsible for
planning, implementing and supervising all DGR's training activities which
are directed by a Training Committee through a recently appointed Training
Section Chief.
4.19     The program would include the strengthening of the existing road
and mechanical training production units (RTPU and MTPU), the maintenance
of a permanent Training Section within DGR (established under Loan
1441-OM), the procurement of training equipment and materials, the con-
tinuation of training consultancy services, and the recruitment of Omani
and/or other Arabic-speaking instructors.
4.20     Road foremen/supervisors and operators/drivers would be trained
mostly in the field at the existing RTPU enabling the trainees to gain
experience under actual working conditions.
4.21     Training of mechanical staff would be conducted mostly at the
Azaiba workshop (MTPU) where physical facilities already exist. Repairing
worn and broken-down equipment would form the basis of the training of
mechanical personnel.
4.22     Periodic seminars would also be conducted for middle and high-
level staff by technical assistance specialists.
4.23     Details of the training program, including the strengthening and
equipping of the RTPU and MTPU and funds for their operation were dis-
cussed and agreed during negotiations (see Project File Document DI, for
estimated training requirements.)
C. Engineering
4.24     The five-year maintenance program was developed by the technical
assistance consultants to the DGR under the previous Loan 1441-OM (see
Project File Documents BI and B3).
4.25     For asphaltic overlays, the DGR will, with the help of the tech-
nical assistance consultants, collect traffic data, including axle load
data, on which to base the design and timing of the overlays and to
establish their justification.

These estimates were confire during negotiations.



- 11 -
4.27     The total capital cost of the three-year project has been esti-
mated at US$30.3 million in January 1981 prices of which US$22.8 million
is foreign exchange; physical and price contingencies raise these esti-
mates to US$41.9 million and US$31.3 million respectively giving a foreign
exchange component of 75%. Total cost of the three-year time slice in-
cluding recurrent costs is US$48.1 million of which US$34.2 million (70%)
is foreign exchange.
4.28     The total cost for the five-year program including routine main-
tenance has been estimated at US$54.6 million in January 1981 prices of
which US$38.6 million is foreign exchange; physical and price contingen-
cies raise these estimates to US$79.9 million and US$55.9 million respec-
tively (see Annex 4).
4.29     Man-month rates for consultants for maintenance management,
training and general technical assistance are expected to average over the
project duration US$8,200 including social costs, overhead and fees, and
overseas allowances.  Travel costs to and from home office, including
excess baggage, etc., are estimated to be $170,000 or $500 per average
man-month. Local per diem, based on the assumption that the Government
will continue to provide housing for the consultants' team members in Oman
is RO 6.800 (US$20) or $600 per man-month. Man-month rates for individual
technicians to serve directly on the DGR staff are estimated at US$800 to
$1,000 excluding housing and local allowances, which vary but are
generally much less than those provided consultants.
E. Financing
4.30     The proposed loan of US$15 million represents 36% of th,e total
cost of the project and 22% of the five-year program excluding routine
maintenance costs and 31% and 19% including routine maintenance costs.
The loan would be made to the Government of the Sultanate of Oman; the
beneficiaries of the loan are the MOC, and through MOC, the DGR. The
Government would finance the additional foreign costs of the five-year
program (US$ 40.9 million) and all local costs (US$ 24.0 milliorn) of which
about US$0.3 million is direct taxes.
F.  Implementation
Responsibility for Implementation and Supervision
4.31     The MOC would have overall responsibility for the execution of
the project and would deal directly with the general technical assistance
aspect of consultants planning services. The DGR, acting as a department
of the MOC, would have direct responsibility for all other loan components.
Procurement
4.32     Since MOC intends to undertake asphalt overlay by contract, pro-
curement and eventual reimbursement from the proceeds of the loan would be
conditional upon:



- 12 -
(i)  review and concurrence of the Bank to sample standard bid docu-
ments (form of tender, conditions of contract, specifications,
etc.) which the DGR prepare;
(ii)  technical and economic justifications of proposed asphalt overlay
programs before procurement (see para. 5.06); and
(iii)  mutually agreed selection at loan negotiations of the financial
limit of US$1,000,000 per contract above which international
competitive bidding would be undertaken for asphalt overlay
activities for numbers of road sections, which, if aggregated
would attract competitive bids from large contractors.
4.33     The highway maintenance equipment and spares would be procured
after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement." Bids would be evaluated on the basis of
compliance with the specifications, price, delivery time and service
facilities.
4.34     The costs of particular items of pavement data collection and
some highway equipment and spares (total cost of each US$ 0.2 million) are
too small to justify the expense of international competitive bidding and
procurement for these items would be by the regular local purchase pro-
cedures of the Borrower which are satisfactory.
4.35     Contracts for the construction of two highway maintenance centers
would be awarded after competitive bidding in accordance with local pro-
cedures. This procedure is appropriate since it is unlikely that any
foreign contractor not already operating in Oman would be interested in
minor, scattered individual contracts and because the presence of suffi-
cient foreign and local contractors assures adequate competition. How-
ever, foreign contractors who wish to bid would not be excluded. Invita-
tions for bids would be published in local and Gulf newspapers and bid
documentation will be reviewed by the Bank before their issue to
contractors.
4.36     The maintenance management/training and general technical assist-
ance would be carried out by a single firm of qualified and experienced
consultants according to Terms of Reference and conditions satisfactory to
the Borrower and the Bank.
Project Implementation Schedule
4.37     The highway maintenance program financed under this loan would
cover a period of three years beginning June 1982. Asphalt overlays are
expected to start in early 1983 and continue for a year. Highway equip-
ment procurement is expected to be procured in two stages beginning in
early 1983. Bids for construction of some highway workshops and mainte-
nance centers are expected to be invited in the second half of 1982. The



- 13 -
training program and the general technical assistance would effectively be
a continuation of the program financed under Loan 1441-OM, which started
at the beginning of 1978. The implementation schedule, which was dis-
cussed and confirmed with the Government during negotiations, is shown in
Annex 2.
G. Disbursements
4.38     The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed on the
following basis:
(i)  70% of the total costs of asphalt overlay, which represents the
estimated foreign exchange component of this item;
(ii)  95% of the total costs of highway maintenance equipment and spare
parts;
(iii) 95% of the total costs of pavement data collection equipment;
(iv) 50% of the total costs of highway maintenance centers, which
represents the estimated foreign exchange component of this item;
and
(v) the actual foreign costs of the consultants undertaking mainte-
nance management/training and general technical assistance and of
individual technicians serving directly on DGR staff.
4.39     The estimated cumulative quarterly disbursement schedule shown in
Annex 3 assumes that the loan would become effective by June 19832. During
negotiations the Government and the Bank discussed and confirmed the Bank
participation rates for each loan category and the disbursement schedule.
H. Environmental Impact
4.40     None of the project elements have any significant effec:t on the
environment.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.01     The proposed road maintenance program would protect the national
investment in highway infrastructure and, in conjunction with the project
training component, improve Omani highway maintenance capabilities to
match the increasing demands of growing traffic on an expanding highway
network. Pavement and traffic data collection equipment will be used to
provide a basic input to maintenance planning as well as highway invest-
ment planning generally. The whole project will provide significant eco-
nomic benefits in the form of reduced highway user costs and reconstruc-
tion costs.



- 14 -
5.02     Economic benefits will accrue directly to:
(i)  the state, which would preserve its investment in highway infra-
structure and ultimately lower unit maintenance costs as the
skills of its personnel and the capability of the DGR as a whole
to maintain roads is improved;
(ii)  to the trucking industry through reduced vehicle operating costs;
and
(iii)  to the wide range of income groups who directly use highway
passenger transport.
The extent to which benefits to truckers are passed down to consumers
would depend on competition within the trucking industry; the industry is
now freely competitive.
B. Economic Evaluation
Road Maintenance
5.03     The economic justification of some level of maintenance effort is
apparent since protection of past capital investments by relatively mar-
ginal annual expenditure is axiomatic. However, the optimal level of
maintenance effort will depend on the relation between the marginal costs
of increasing the maintenance effort beyond that which would just prevent
the road from complete impassability and the resulting decrease in vehicle
operating cost (VOC), periodic maintenance and future reconstruction
costs. This optimum would, therefore, represent the level of least total
VOC, routine and periodic maintenance costs and reconstruction costs in
terms of present worth at the (projected) opportunity cost of capital.
5.04     In theory the optimal level will vary between different road
sections, depending on various incremental costs and benefits for each
section. As a practical matter, however, the physical and administrative
requirements of a maintenance program (as well as the fact that such "fine
tuning" is really not justified by the actual empirical data) means that
certain discrete levels of maintenance are planned and then applied with
flexibility in the field.  Nevertheless, in the development of a mainte-
nance program the economic analysis serves to establish the reasonableness
and to verify the size and scope of the program. This, in fact, rather
than some conventional measure of Economic Return, is the real value of
the analysis.
5.05     For this project five possible levels of maintenance (routine and
periodic) were analyzed, including the selected, least cost alternative.
The analysis was made separately for paved and unpaved roads, and for each



- 15 -
five discrete grouping of links, based on traffic volumes, were con-
sidered.l/ On the basis of this analysis the proposed program will give
an economic return of about 48% for unpaved roads, 36% for paved roads and
44% overall, over present levels2/ of maintenance over the next: five-
year period (1981-85).
5.06     Further, specific highway links to be overlaid with asphalt under
the periodic maintenance component of this project will be subject to
individual economic analysis and will be acceptable only if a minimum
economic return of 12% is indicated. The general methodology to be used
and presentation of the analysis was agreed during negotiations; economic
analysis would be made on the basis that, if asphalt overlays were not
applied, vehicle operating costs on the progressively deteriorating pave-
ments would increase, and those highway sections which would fail prema-
turely would require reconstruction at a cost higher than that of an
immediate asphalt overlay (see Project File Document C21 and Annex 8).
Training
5.07     Standard methods of economic justification cannot reaListically
be applied to the training component of the proposed project. Nevethe-
less, this component is a critical element of the project and ultimately
should significantly lower costs as skills of maintenance personnel are
increased and the capability of the DGR to maintain the highway network is
improved.
Technical Assistance
5.08     The costs of the technical assistance that are directLy related
to the maintenance effort are part of the total maintenance costs and are
therefore included in the economic evaluation of maintenance. These costs
represent perhaps 70% of the total. The other 30% or so represents tech-
nical assistance to the DGR of a more general nature and cannot: be
directly assignable to precise project elements. However, such assistance
is considered indispensable to the effective functioning of the DGR.
Pavement Data Collection Equipment
5.09     The equipment will be used to develop essential basic inputs to
highway maintenance and investment planning.
1/ For details, see "Special Report Economic Analyses of the Proposed
Maintenance Program for Roads", Roy Jorgensesn Associates, Inc.,
June 10, 1980, in Project File (Document B2).
2/  Present levels of maintenance are at about two-thirds the  Levels
recommended and used as the 100% case in the analysis.



- 16 -
Overall Economic Justification
5.10     The road maintenance program, which directly includes maintenance
equipment and spares, mechanical workshops, maintenance centers, workshop
equipment, periodic maintenance and minor improvements and routine mainte-
nance, as well as about 70% of the technical assistance component represents
some US$46.4 million of the estimated total of US$48.1 million, or about 95%
of project costs. These components of the project show an economic return of
between 36 and 48% with 44% overall (para. 5.05).
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government will:
(i)  implement its five-year highway maintenance program in accordance
with a general timetable of physical targets and budgetary alloca-
tions agreed between the Borrower and the Bank (paras. 4.08, 4.24,
4.28, 4.29 and 4.37);
(ii)  employ consultants whose qualifications experience, and terms and
conditions of employment shall qualify them to undertake the highway
maintenance management, training program and general technical
assistance aspects of the project and shall be satisfactory to the
Bank (paras. 4.14 through 4.23);
(iii)  include only those highway sections for asphalt overlay which shall
be agreed upon by the Borrower and the Bank and on the basis of tech-
nical and economic feasibility studies (paras. 4.07 and 5.06);
(iv)  submit for the prior approval of the Bank, three months after
consultants' services under the project are initiated in Oman, a
comprehensive training program, make available sufficient numbers of
experienced personnel to be trained as instructors, recruit suffi-
cient manpower to be trained for maintenance operations, and maintain
a permanent training section with the DGR (paras. 4.17 through 4.23);
and
(v) continue to take such steps as shall reasonably be required to ensure
that the dimensions and axle loads of vehicles using public highways
within its territories are consistent with the established limits
(para. 3.05).
6.02     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$15 million equivalent
to the Sultanate of Oman for a 15-year term, including a three-year grace
period.
