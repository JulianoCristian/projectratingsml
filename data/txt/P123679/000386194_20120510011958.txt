payroll; (v) approving the internal audit committee charter and appointing the
members of the internal audit committee; (vi) establishing an IFMIS interface
at the Central Bank; (vii) reducing government arrears on payments on
electricity tariffs to NAWEC; (viii) licensing the Gambia Submarine Cable
Company (GSCC) Ltd.; and (ix) signing service-level agreements between the
Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education, its Regional Directorates, and the
head teachers of the basic and secondary public schools.
The proposed operation is consistent with the Africa Strategy, and the
proposed reforms are an integral part of the country's new Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper - the Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment
(PAGE) covering the years CY2012-15. Also, this project is aligned with
IDA's forthcoming Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) covering the period
FY2012-15. In light of the government's funding constraints, the proposed
operation will provide much needed resources for the emerging food crisis and
the implementation of the PAGE -- Program          for Accelerated Growth and

﻿Employment.
Risks:         The main risks associated with the proposed operation are: (i) the
government's limited institutional capacity to implement the reform agenda;
(ii) macroeconomic slippages and inadequate adjustments to exogenous
shocks; (iii) weak governance; and (iv) difficulties in sustaining reforms in the
agriculture, energy and telecommunications sectors.
The risks associated with low institutional capacity are mitigated by a reform
agenda that is built on an ongoing policy dialogue and supported by either
ongoing or forthcoming IDA projects. In addition, the government will
continue to receive support for capacity building through various other donor
projects, including projects supported by the AfDB, EC, IMF, UNDP and the
WFP.
With respect to macroeconomic risks, the government has so far carried out
prudent measures in response to recent external shocks and continues to
maintain a dialogue with the development partners on appropriate policy
responses and the possible need for augmented concessional external aid in the
form of grants. Furthermore, macroeconomic risks would be mitigated by
close monitoring and coordination by IDA, IMF and other donors. The need
for external borrowing would be reduced by increased grant resources
provided through the proposed operations by AfDB and IDA, as well as other
proposed projects by the two institutions.
The country's weak governance could be further strengthened by enhancing
the transparency and accountability of the public sector. To mitigate the
governance risk, several prior actions for this operation seek to define
institutional arrangements that enhance transparency and accountability in
public sector procedures and promote private sector participation.  The
continued engagement of the AfDB and IDA in the implementation of the
Policy Matrix also contributes towards ensuring continuity and building
political commitment to reforms.
Difficulties  in  sustaining  reforms  in  agriculture,  energy  and
telecommunications sector would be mitigated by continued engagement of
the AfDB and IDA, as well as extensive consultations with both public and
private stakeholders in these sectors aimed at ensuring country ownership,
alignment of reform measures with the government's sector strategy and
additional complementary investment support provided by IDA, the AfDB and
other development agencies.

﻿INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
FIRST ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE REFORM GRANT (EGRG-I)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.  This program document proposes the First Economic Governance Reform Grant
(the "Grant") to the Republic of The Gambia in the amount of SDR 3.9 million (US$6.0
million equivalent). The proposed Grant is the first in a series of two such Development Policy
Grants (DPGs) covering the period 2012 to 2013. It would support the implementation of the
country's Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE), which aims at
improving the living conditions of the Gambian population by implementing cross-cutting
reforms to diversify the economy and thereby reduce its vulnerability to external shocks. It is
organized around the five pillar of the new development strategy: (i) accelerating and sustaining
economic growth; (ii) improving and modernising infrastructure; (iii) strengthening human
capital stock and enhancing access to social services; (iv) improving governance and increasing
economic competitiveness; and (v) reinforcing social cohesion.'  Therefore, the program
document for this operation is being presented alongside the Joint Staff Advisory Note on the
Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment.
1.2.  The proposed grant will also provide urgently-needed assistance to deal with the
recently-announced crop failure. Along with the rest of the Sahelian countries of West Africa,
The Gambia has suffered from inadequate and erratic rainfall in 2011. The full impact is now
becoming apparent and the government has officially requested emergency assistance from the
international community. The harvest is estimated to be only one-half of the average for the last
five years and around 60 percent lower than last year. With 75 percent of the population
dependent on agriculture, poverty and malnutrition are rising. This operation provides much-
needed financial assistance at a time when IDA has limited alternatives to extend immediate
support. In doing so, this operation also tackles some of the policy reforms in agricultural policy
necessary to reduce the vulnerability of this sector, through triggers for the next operation in this
series.
1.3.   On March 7, 2012, the government of The Gambia announced the 2011-12 crop
failure, requesting an estimated US$23 million for seeds, fertilizers, and food aid. Donors
have responded by pledging around US$14.5 million up until now.   The UN's Central
Emergency Rescue Fund (CERF) has promised US$4.8 million, with the World Food Program
(WFP) receiving US$3.1 million to provide assistance to 125,000 people, including 56,000
children under the age of 5, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) getting US$1.4
million to provide emergency food to the poorest households, including pregnant and
breastfeeding mothers and people living with HIV and AIDS located in the most affected
districts. The proposed operation will help fill the remaining gap.
1 The PAGE and the accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) are scheduled to be discussed by the World
Bank Board of Executive Directors on April 5, 2012.

﻿1.4.  The development objectives of the proposed Grant are strengthening transparency,
accountability and efficiency in public financial management, and improving the management of
key   sectors  for  economic  growth, namely    agriculture,  education,  energy,  and
telecommunications. Agriculture, which is the economy's backbone and the main employer and
income generator for the country's poor, had been enjoying a boom until the recent crisis
exposed its continued vulnerability. While reforms are needed to minimize the impact of future
shocks, these only begin to be outlined in the next operation. The energy and telecommunication
sectors are undertaking major investments that will be important for the development of new
enterprises and sectors, but these require policy reforms if they are to yield the expected results.
The education sector will play a critical role in diversification of the economy as well as
upgrading agricultural productivity. A strong effort is being made to improve the quality of
teaching now that higher primary school enrollment and completion rates are being recorded.
Commensurate with the government's ongoing plans, this operation covers a selective set of
critical reform measures in key areas of the PAGE: (i) public financial management reforms and
(ii) interventions in the education, energy and telecommunications sectors. These measures are
critical complements to the objectives of the PAGE, namely the attainment of macroeconomic
stability and improvements in public financial management, as well as the promotion of pro-poor
growth and employment.
1.5.  The government has prepared a Budget Support Policy Matrix ("Policy Matrix")
that sequentially outlines priority PAGE reform measures, with quantitative and
qualitative outcome indicators for the 2012-15 period in these reform areas. The Policy
Matrix was developed through consultations with key stakeholders, drawing from a wide range
of analytical and project-related work. Also, IDA has been working closely with the government
and other development partners to identify the appropriate complementary reform measures
through investment projects and analytical exercises. The reform measures for the energy and
telecommunications sectors are an extension of the policy dialogue currently being conducted by
country team colleagues and aims at supplementing the support currently being either provided
or planned by IDA, AfDB, and the EC's and the IsDB's investment projects.
1.6.  The proposed IDA Grant supports the implementation of a subset of reforms in the
government's Policy Matrix in 2012 (Annex 3). These reform measures are the prior actions
for the disbursement of IDA's budget support grant and triggers for the preparation of the next
budget support grant in this series of two operations. The AfDB is also preparing a similar
budget support policy grant for which disbursement of the funds for the first operation is
expected in the fall of CY12. In the division of responsibilities between the two institutions,
IDA will retain a broad-based policy matrix, encompassing both core PFM and sector specific
issues, reflecting a broad development agenda and the requirements for its effective
implementation, whereas the AfDB will focus exclusively on PFM issues, with attention to two
main areas: (i) budget and expenditure management and (ii) external and internal auditing. The
government and the participating development partners are expected to sign a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) to formalize these coordination arrangements. It is therefore in line with
the development community's aid effectiveness agenda.
1.7.  The proposed donor coordination arrangement will reduce the government's
transaction costs, and allow IDA to leverage its limited resources across a range of critical
policy reforms over this two-year period. The proposed arrangement is consistent with the

﻿Bank's FY012-15 Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) being prepared with the AfDB.2 It is also
well-aligned with the Africa Region's strategy, with prior actions addressing the growth and
economic governance agendas. In addition, the grant is timely since its financial contribution
will be critical in dealing with the current vulnerability of the economy and its people.
2. COUNTRY CONTEXT
2.1.   The country continues to maintain a stable political system. President Yahya Jammeh
was reelected to a fourth five-year term in November 2011 with 72 percent of the vote.
Parliamentary elections were held in March 2012, but six of the seven parties boycotted them
because their request for a postponement was rejected. The President's party (the Alliance for
Patriotic Reorientation and Construction - APRC) won 43 of the 48 contested seats, with the 5
other seats captured by opposition (mostly independent) candidates. The 5 remaining seats are
filled directly by the President according to the constitution. The President thus remains firmly
in control of political power. He has, however, relinquished some of his direct involvement in
government, notably by nominating a Minister of Agriculture whereas previously he had filled
this role himself. In general, the government consists of technocrats who are considered quite
strong.
2.2.   The Gambia is a small West African country with an average per capita GDP of
US$610 in 2011 (Atlas Method) and a 2010 Human Development Index ranking of 151th Out
of 178 countries. The overall poverty headcount index is estimated at 48.4 percent (UNDP
2011),' and 36.7 percent (at the US$1.00 poverty line), down from 58.0 percent estimate for the
upper poverty line (US$1.25), and 51.2 percent for the lower poverty line (US$1.00) estimated at
the time of the 2003 Integrated Household Budget Survey (IHS). There are large regional
variations of poverty within The Gambia, with urban areas recording a much lower poverty
headcount (32.7 percent) when compared with rural areas (73.9 percent) using the $1.25 poverty
line, with a similar gap when the U$ 1.00 poverty line is used -- 21.0 percent for urban areas and
62.1 percent for rural areas.
2.3.   Although the poverty headcount index declined between 2003 and 2010, income
inequality has not. In 2010, the lowest quintile (the poorest 20 percent of the population)
consumed only 5.6 percent of overall expenditures, while the highest quintile (richest 20 percent)
was consuming 46.5 percent. The concentration of land ownership continues to increase as the
population urbanizes (today over 50 percent lives in urban areas, mostly in the Greater Banjul
area, compared to less than 30 percent 30 years ago). There is pressure for the expansion in

Assistance Strategy for the Republic of The Gambia for Fiscal Years 2008-2011," Report No. 42267-GM, February
2008, as well as World Bank, "Joint Assistance Strategy for the Republic of The Gambia for Fiscal Years 2008-
2011 - Progress Report," Report No. 55219-GM, June 2010. The Africa Strategy was reviewed by the Bank's Board
in March 2011, while the JAS and the JASPR were discussed by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on
February 26, 2008, and on July 27, 2010, respectively.
These estimates are derived from the 2010 Integrated Household Budget Survey jointly conducted by the the
Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) and the National Planning Commission (NPC), and facilitated by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The poverty headcount ratio was measured at US$ 1.25 and US$1.00
per day at purchasing power parity equivalent as a percentage of the Gambian population.

﻿skill-intensive urban activities (e.g., hotels, telecommunications, and banks), which contributes
to widening the gap between skilled and unskilled labor income.
2.4.  The recent crop failure is likely to have raised the vulnerabilities of households,
particularly female-headed households. Female workers represent 60 percent of those
employed in rural areas whereas male workers account for the majority of the urban labor force
(52 percent). While women are overall somewhat less economically active than men, with their
labor force participation rate at 72 percent, compared to 83 percent for males, this has not
translated into higher poverty rates. The poverty rate for female headed households is 38 percent,
significantly lower than the 51 percent for male headed households (according to the 2010
Integrated Household Survey). One possible reason for this disparity is that females are
economically active in sectors, such as education, health and retail trade, where earnings are
relatively higher.
2.5.  Women are well represented in senior government administrative positions in The
Gambia, accounting for six out of 14 Cabinet members. Their participation in Cabinet
includes the Vice President and Minister of Women Affairs, the Minister of Basic and Secondary
Education, the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology, the Minister of Health
and Social Welfare, the Minister of Tourism and Culture, and the Deputy Minister of Petroleum
and Mineral Resources (the Minister is the President). Approximately ten percent of the
National Assembly members are female. There is an extensive institutional structure for
promoting gender equality, including the Ministry of Women's Affairs, a cross-sectoral National
Women's Council and Women's Bureau, and a National Policy for the Advancement of
Gambian Women.
2.6.  The Gambian economy is relatively undiversified and its important re-export trade
is under threat. Services account for over half of GDP, reflecting the importance of external
and retail trade, banking, tourism, transport and telecommunications. Tourism is the country's
most significant foreign exchange earner, while agriculture accounts for approximately one-third
of GDP, around 10 percent of overall exports, and more than 60 percent of employment. While
liberal trade policies and an efficient port infrastructure and services allowed The Gambia to act
as a regional re-export hub, recent developments suggest that this is changing. The
harmonization of trade policies within ECOWAS and reforms in Senegal has reduced arbitrage
opportunities between Senegal and The Gambia that were one of the driving motivations for the
re-export trade. In addition, Dakar has made significant improvements in its port infrastructure
and Banjul is beginning a similar process for its port. Nevertheless, a gap has opened between
Banjul and Dakar in the meantime. While The Gambia ranked 77th (out of 150) countries in the
Logistics Performance Index (LPI) in 2007, and Senegal ranked 101, by 2010 The Gambia
th                                                          th
ranked 113 (out of 155 countries) whereas Senegal's ranking had increased to 58
2.7.  Service exports remain the foundation of The Gambian economy. The Gambia earns
almost 90 percent of its export revenues from services it provides to visitors and trading partners.
Tourism services are the country's main foreign exchange earner, netting out almost US$60
million in 2011 or around 55 percent of gross service export revenues, with transit-trade services
accounting for the remaining 45 percent (but a smaller share in net terms). Meanwhile,
groundnuts and groundnut products account for the bulk of the exports of domestic merchandise.
The remainder of the country's merchandise export earnings is derived from cotton, fish and a
few non-traditional exports, which represented only 2.5 percent of overall exports of
-4-


﻿merchandise and services in 2010, and include a range of natural resource-based merchandise,
such as palm kernel, and horticulture products.
A.    RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.8.   The Gambian economy is now estimated to have grown by only 3.3 percent in 2011,
compared to the previous real GDP growth forecast of 5.5 percent, because of the 2011-2012
crop failure. Earlier growth estimates were based on pre-harvest projections, so the crop failure
reduced the projected contribution of agriculture to real GDP growth in 2011 by about 25
percent. As a result of irregular rainfall, there was a 60 percent decline on average in crop
production, with important consequences for groundnut exports and the need for additional food
imports. The impact on GDP is split 20:80 between 2011 and 2012 because the contribution to
GDP is only measured when output reaches the market.
Box 2.1: The 2011/2012 Crop Failure
Late, erratic and unevenly distributed rainfall during the 2011/12 cropping season led to a significant decline
and to low quality of agricultural production. The overall crop production is estimated have declined by 62
percent compared to 2010 and by half relative to the 5-year average. Amongst the most affected crop are rice (down
74 percent), millet (down 54 percent) and groundnut (down 64 percent). The period when subsistence farmers are
able to rely on food stocks from their own production is estimated to have dropped to 3-4 months, down from the
usual 6-7 months following harvest.
Because of the major income decline from the failed groundnut harvest, the most important cash crop in The
Gambia, and higher prices for imported staple foods, farmer households are facing significant difficulties in
their access to food. The Gambia is heavily dependent to imported food, with 50 percent of needs met by imports,
which has subjected domestic prices to the volatility in international markets. In the fourth quarter of 2011 the
nominal price of imported rice was 19 percent higher than in the same period of 2010, while the income of
groundnut farmers was, in the most affected areas, 67 percent lower than the farm gate price set by the Gambia
Groundnut Corporation. These farmer households are reportedly resorting to reducing the frequency of meals,
intensifying the collection of forest wood, selling livestock, consuming the seeds they would normally save for the
next planting season, and withdrawing children from schools to avoid paying school fees.
The crop failure has also resulted in low seed quality and to seed scarcity in general, placing the upcoming
planting season at risk. This seed shortage is expected to have negative consequences for the outlook of the
Gambian economy, which is still heavily dependent on agriculture for economic growth, foreign exchange earnings
and poverty reduction. Agriculture provides employment to 75 percent of the country's population, and 91 percent
of employment for those extremely poor.
In this context, the UN-System has finalized a Joint CERF Rapid Response proposal with the objective of
saving lives and preventing acute malnutrition of the population most affected by the crop failure (428,000
people). In parallel, UN agencies are scaling up existing operations and mobilizing resources through internal
mechanisms and the Government of The Gambia, together with the UN-System and other humanitarian partners, is
finalizing the preparations of a multi-sector needs assessment with the objective of completing pending data needs in
preparation of a joint emergency response.
2.9.   The 2011-2012 crop failure is a major blow to the Gambian economy, which over the
last few years had shown remarkable resilience thanks to increasing investments in agriculture,
supported by good rains. Real GDP growth averaged just over 5.0 percent during the 2008-2011
period, compared to a 4.0 percent average during the preceding 3 years. All major food crops
had been performing very well between 2007 and 2010, with output of maize, millet and
sorghum doubling, while rice increased by a factor of nine. This strong agricultural performance
-5-


﻿complemented growth in tourism, while compensating for a declining re-export business. The
latter has suffered as neighboring countries have upgraded their transport infrastructure and
reduced disparities between their trade and tax policies and those of The Gambia.
2.10. The decline in the transit trade business has had important fiscal implications for the
country since taxes imposed on these re-exports account for around 25 percent of overall tax
revenues. There was also erosion in the tax base as a result of: (i) delays in adjusting the pump
prices for gasoline in line with rising world market prices for crude oil, and (ii) an increase in tax
exemptions on import duties, sales taxes and excise taxes on imports, especially in the run up to
last year's Presidential elections.
2.11. Greater fiscal discipline was attained in 2011 by aligning expenditures with revenue
inflows (i.e. cash budgeting). The country generated a basic primary fiscal surplus estimated at
1.2 percent of GDP, up from a 0.4 percent deficit in 2010. This newly found fiscal discipline
helped contain the government's net domestic borrowing, cleared its overdraft with the central
bank and marked an end to the central bank financing of the public deficit (Table 2.1).

2.12. The budget execution rate of poverty reducing expenditures in 2011 was 96.5
percent (Table 2.2). The highest budget execution rates were recorded for education, health and
nutrition programs, attaining rates in the upper 90 percent. While these high budget execution
rates reflect the fact that a large share of the budgets for these sectors are committed to wages
and salaries, funding and execution of the budgeted capital expenditures are also important to
ensure service delivery. Since these expenditures are financed primarily by grants and external

2.13. Greater fiscal and monetary discipline contributed to maintaining consumer price
inflation for 2011 at just under 4.5 percent, or over one percent lower than in 2010 (Figures
2.1 and 2.2). However, official statistics do not fully capture the impact of higher food prices
resulting from the crop failure. According to the WFP, annual increase in food prices is believed
to have reached closer to 10 percent at end-201 1, compared to official estimates of 5.65 percent.

2.14. Exports performed well in 2011, contributing to narrowing the deficit in current
account of the balance of payments and the recovery in the level of international reserves
(Table 2.4 and Figures 2.3 and 2.4). There was a strong recovery in the tourism sector and good
performance of domestic exports due notably to the rise in groundnut prices in international
markets. There was only a slight depreciation of the Gambian dalasi against the US dollar, which
by end-2011 had stabilized at just under 29 dalasi/US dollar, up slightly from the 28.5 range
observed at end-2010. Exchange rate stability is important as food imports account for around

﻿B.     ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
2.15. Although The Gambia's economic outlook is one of lower growth and higher
inflation than originally projected, the overall macroeconomic framework is deemed
adequate for the purpose of this operation. Economic growth has been strong for many years
until erratic rainfall hit the agricultural sector in late 2011, and can be expected to resume if
normal rainfall returns. The government has re-established a track record of strong fiscal
management during 2011 and intends to implement a new IMF-supported program. The
authorities had been projecting to achieve a basic primary surplus already in 2012 until the recent
food crisis struck.
2.16. It is now known that the economy is projected to contract by 1.7 percent in 2012 due
to the crop failure and that inflation is likely to accelerate to the 5 to 6 percent range. The
government is taking actions to address the more immediate concerns by accelerating food and
seed imports to meet consumer demand and to protect the next planting season. It is also seeking
additional support for these efforts in the upcoming development partner meeting in Doha, Qatar,
in May. Meanwhile, steps taken last year and earlier this year aim at instilling confidence
amongst these development partners that these additional resources will be used for their proper
purpose while indicating the government's commitment and new tools for maintaining a prudent
fiscal policy.
2.17. Prudent fiscal management is particularly important for The Gambia given the
country's relatively high public debt to GDP ratio, with low maturity levels for domestic
debt. Total public debt reached almost 70 percent of GDP at end-20 11, reflecting the
combination of a fast-growing domestic public debt (29 percent of GDP), and a slow-growing,
mostly concessional external public debt (39 percent of GDP). While the real yield on the total
public debt is relatively low (averaging less than 5 percent), this average conceals the very high
average real yield on the domestic public debt (just under 9 percent) and the very low average
real yield on the external public debt (less than 2 percent). While there is little refinancing risk
arising from foreign currency debt, there is a significant domestic debt refinancing exposure.
The average time to maturity of the external debt is 14.5 years, whereas the average time to
maturity of the stock of domestic debt is less than one year.
2.18. In response, the government is implementing a measured fiscal adjustment program
aimed at reducing the net domestic borrowing to 0.5 percent of GDP by 2014. To achieve
this objective, there is the need for support from development partners since the government is
maintaining the cash-budgeting program implemented last year that is designed to keep
expenditures aligned with revenue inflows.
2.19. An IMF-supported ECF program will be presented to its Board on May 25, and it
also includes additional initiatives to maintain and enhance the country's current fiscal
discipline. Actions under the ECF program to increase tax revenue collection include the full-
implementation of the fuel pricing formula in 2012 and the introduction of the planned Value
Added Tax (VAT) in 2013. Actions to be completed under this proposed grant will help

interest rates are very low.

﻿improve the efficiency of borrowing by allowing the Ministry of Finance to monitor its cash
balances at the Central Bank and, as a result, better time its borrowing operations.
2.20. Actions are also being taken to set limits on how tax exemptions are being awarded,
to strengthen tax administration and to raise tax payer education regarding the application
of tax laws and the coverage of the VAT prior to its planned introduction in 2013. These actions
will be further strengthened by the establishment and institutionalization of the Tax Tribunal
which is also supported under this grant. Better and more frequent manpower planning will be
critical for payroll management and control given the increase in the civil service over the last
few years. The validation of the Human Resource records in the IFMIS payroll envisioned under
the proposed grant would allow the regularization of these records, with the removal of ghost
workers and the elimination of vacant positions. This will, in effect, strengthen the base for a
more judicious management of the personnel records, including the inclusion of new entrants
into the payroll, under the auspices of the Personnel Management Office. These actions further
safeguard the acceptable macroeconomic framework achieved in 2011.
C.    DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
2.21. The 2011 IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that The
Gambia still faces a high risk of debt distress, as the present value of external debt to exports
breaches its threshold over a protracted period, while other indicators are vulnerable to adverse
shocks. The situation is somewhat less serious when remittances and re-exports flows are
included in the analysis. Also, thresholds for The Gambia may soon be adjusted upward, which
could lower the risk of debt distress. Nevertheless, fiscal deficits in recent years, and limited
access to concessional external borrowing, have resulted in high interest costs for domestic debt,
which now accounts for almost one-fifth of fiscal revenues and far exceed the cost of interest
payments on the external debt. The DSA recommends that the country continue taking a
cautious approach in engaging in new external borrowing, seeking concessional loans with a
grant element of at least 35 percent, reducing their stock of domestic debt, and completing
reforms that would improve the country's external competitiveness.
2.22. In the institutional set up in The Gambia, the Central Bank is responsible for
domestic debt management while a dedicated unit within the Ministry of Finance is
responsible for external debt management. In general, domestic debt administration appears
to be adequate while external debt management is in the process of strengthening its capacity
with respect to debt recording, monitoring and analysis, even though debt service has not been an
issue. The government prepares an annual plan for financing as part of its budget and plans on
extending this to a medium term financing plan as part of a debt management strategy. The legal
framework for public borrowing is clearly defined in the Government Budget Management and
Accountability Act.

﻿3. THE GOVERNMENT'S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR
ACCELERATED GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT - PAGE (2012-2015)
3.1.   The Gambian authorities launched their Programme for Accelerated Growth and
Employment (PAGE) covering the years 2012 to 2015 in December 2011.6 The PAGE is the
country's new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and is organized around five pillars: (i)
accelerating and sustaining economic growth; (ii) improving and modernising infrastructure; (iii)
strengthening human capital stock and enhancing access to social services; (iv) improving
governance and increasing economic competitiveness; and (v) reinforcing social cohesion. The
PAGE focuses on stepping-up infrastructure investments to address the country's severe
shortcomings and to help create a more enabling business environment.
3.2.   The preparation of the PAGE was the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Affairs, who coordinated the preparation of the document in a participatory and
consultative manner. Stakeholder consultative workshops and focus group discussions were held
with representatives of the public and private sectors, as well as from civil society. Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) participated in the drafting of some chapters of the PAGE
document, and consultations reached down to the level of local communities. The 2011 Poverty
Assessments prepared by UNDP, and based on estimates derived from the 2010 Integrated
Household Budget Survey jointly conducted by the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) and the
National Planning Commission (NPC) and facilitated by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), underpins the proposals in the PAGE.
3.3.   The country's poverty headcount index remains high at 48.4 percent,' albeit on a
downward trend from the 1998, 2003 and 2008 estimates at 69, 58 and 55 percent,
respectively.   Poverty is deeper and more widespread amongst households headed by
agricultural and fishery workers, and there is a marked spatial difference in the poverty
headcount, with the poverty headcount index for rural households twice as high as for urban
households. While the PAGE projects a 15 percent decline in the poverty headcount index to
33.4 percent, allowing the country to reach the MDG target of halving the 1990 poverty rate by
2015, the crop failure represent a setback not anticipated in these projections. 8,9,10 Poverty is
likely to increase because of the crop failure, as the purchasing power of rural households is
further eroded by subtracting their sources of income while raising food prices.
6 The first PRSPs covered the years 2002 to 2006 and 2007 to 2011, respectively, and were presented to the Boards
of IDA and the IMF in April 2002 and 2007.
At a poverty line of US$1.25 per day equivalent at purchasing power parity.
These projections are based on the assumption that per capita GDP growth will average 3.1 percent over the 2011-
15 period. A per capita GDP growth rate of 3.1 percent implies a real GDP growth rate of around 5.5 percent, given
that it is estimated that the population growth rate is around 2.4 percent and an elasticity of poverty incidence with
respect to changes in per capita GDP at close to 1, which is similar to estimates reported on other work for African
countries.
' Additional assumptions are that the distribution of income remains unchanged during the projection period, and
that household consumption will increase at the same rate as GDP. This last assumption is important because the
corollary is that household consumption is constrained by GDP growth, something that is somewhat restrictive in the
Gambian case. Remittances have been an important source of household income, although primarily for higher
income households. This caveat must be borne in mind when considering these projections.

Messages from the 1990s. Poverty Dynamics in Africa, The World Bank, Washington D.C.
- 11 -


﻿3.4.  The PAGE builds on the findings of the mid-term review of the second PRSP, which
was completed in March 2010 and posted on the Bank's external website. The mid-term
review recorded the achievements reached under the five pillars of the PRSP II, beginning with
the macro-economic developments. The country performed beyond the targets of 4.5 percent
real GDP growth, reaching actual real GDP growth rates of 6.3 and 6.1 percent in 2007 and
2008, respectively. The social and productive sectors for the first time during the PRSP II period
accounted for 26 percent of overall expenditures in 2007, 2008 and 2009, which was short by 3
to 4 percentage points from the PRSP II targeted allocation of 30 percent. Real GDP growth
rates in the productive sectors, especially agriculture, experienced a boost in 2007 and 2008 due
to a good rainy season and the introduction of the NERICA rice variety. There were also new
public and private investments in fisheries and natural resources, including new infrastructure
developments such as fisheries landing sites and ice plants.
3.5.  The rest of this section reviews sequentially the document's individual pillars,
ranging from plans to accelerate growth and sustain economic growth (pillar I) to modernizing
infrastructure (pillar II), strengthening human capital (pillar III), improving governance (pillar
IV), and identifying cross-cutting interventions (pillar V).
A.    INDIVIDUAL PILLARS
Pillar I: Aaccelerating and Sustaining Economic Growth
3.6.  The primary objective of this pillar is to underscore the importance of
macroeconomic stability for sustained economic development. This overarching objective
translates specifically into implementing structural reforms aimed at improving the fiscal
balance, pursuing sound monetary and exchange rate policies to keep inflation below 5 percent,
strengthening the financial system, and supporting sources of economic growth.
3.7.  The following areas are identified amongst the sources of economic growth in the
PAGE: (i) agriculture and natural resources; (ii) tourism; (iii) telecommunications; and (iv)
improvements in the business environment, such as reducing the cost of production (electricity
and telecommunications), improving access to finance, ensuring access to land, reducing and
simplifying tax systems and facilitating business registration. Actions to support the several
sources of growth and ensure sound macroeconomic policies are important because as global
market conditions change the challenges to domestic macroeconomic management are bound to
increase, making the promotion of macroeconomic stability and growth even more important.
Pillar II: Improving and Modernizing Infrastructure
3.8.  The goal of the second pillar of the PAGE is to enhance conditions for economic
growth through the provision of needed economic infrastructure, and the promotion of
productive sectors with large impacts on employment creation and poverty reduction.
While encouraging the participation of the private sector in new infrastructure investment, the
focus of the PAGE is primarily on public sector investment in transport, energy and
telecommunications.
- 12 -


﻿Pillar III: Strengthening Human Capital Stock and Enhancing Access to Social Services
3.9.  The PAGE highlights how investing in human capital stock is a priority in the
national government's development agenda. This priority is reflected in recent achievements,
such as the rise in school enrollment where Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) at the lower-basic
level reached almost 90 percent in the academic year 2009/10, up from around 70 percent in
2005/06. School enrollment stagnated over the last year, however, with the GER caught at
around 89 percent despite the growth in population. The good news is the expansion in
enrollment has been matched by continuously high primary completion rates (75 percent) and a
low average repetition rate (less than 5 percent). These average rates in school enrollment,
retention and repetition conceal, however, a number of inequities and disparities when figures
are split according to wealth and region. Gambian households contribute significantly to the
education of their children. At the lower basic level, 46 percent of education costs are covered
by households.
3.10. The PAGE reports also good progress in health indicators, although infant and
maternal mortality rates at 81/1000 and 400/100,000 live births, respectively, remain high.
Moreover, malnutrition is still prevalent in The Gambia. After the 35 percent reduction in
malnutrition rates between 1995 (26 percent) and 2000 (17 percent), progress has since stalled
with malnutrition rates creeping up again to 22 percent. On a more positive note, the country has
made some progress regarding the measles immunization rate (96 percent in 2009 compared to
87 in 1991), and the National Sentinel surveillance study conducted among pregnant women
aged 15-49 years shows that the increasing trend of HIV-1 was reversed in 2007 after peaking in
2006. Also, the National Malaria Sentinel surveillance study (2008/09) suggests that malaria has
started to decline too.
3.11. The third and final heading under this third pillar of the PAGE outlines actions
aimed at increasing the population's access to safe drinking water with a view to reduce
their susceptibility to water-borne diseases. This is an area where The Gambia has seen good
progress. The proportion of the population with access to safe drinking water increased to 87
percent in 2009 from 69 percent in 1990, exceeding the MDG target of 84.5 percent by 2015.
Water supply depends on available electricity, however, which creates problems for rural
households, and rural health and education facilities. The good news is that country is well-
endowed with groundwater resources. To mobilize the needed resources to implement these
interventions, the PAGE outlines actions aimed at increasing the advocacy of this issue and at
mobilizing additional financial resources by strengthening the management of available financial
resources in the health sector, and by exploring other financing mechanisms such as, for
example, the possibility of introducing a national health insurance scheme. Finally, donor
funding will be streamlined through a coordinated system using a Sector-Wide Approach
(SWAp).
Pillar IV: Improving Governance and Fighting Corruption
3.12. The Government's effort to improve governance is, as outlined in the PAGE and
focused in two key areas: (i) strengthening the governance of public services is a centrepiece of
the government's strategy to boost economic performance, improve the business sector
environment, increase employment, eradicate poverty and reduce corruption; (ii) improving the
- 13 -


﻿effective public institutions and efficient service delivery. The government has implemented
several reforms to improve public services recently, and will address the remaining reforms
during the PAGE implementation period.
3.13. Strengthening the management of the civil service will be critical for the
implementation of the PAGE and for the success of the ongoing civil service reform. The
PAGE focuses on capacity building within ministries, the introduction of result-based
management, and gives greater attention to service delivery. Also, there is a need to maintain
and increase civil service compensation to allow the recruitment and retention of qualified
personnel. While addressing low salaries will be important, it will not by itself necessarily result
in improved performance and public service delivery. Staffs recommend that the authorities
focus on complementary reforms such as strengthening staff assessments, carrying out
performance management reviews and strengthening manpower planning. Manpower planning
is critical given the expansion in the civil service in recent years.
Pillar V: Reinforcing Social Cohesion and Cross-cutting Interventions
3.14. The fifth pillar of the PAGE emphasizes the importance of creating jobs, pursuing
equity, reducing regional disparities, and paying attention to environmental sustainability
and to climate change. Interventions aimed at improving food security capture the cross-cutting
nature of the actions envisioned under this pillar, although most of the focus is placed on
increasing agricultural production rather than nutrition security. As a result, actions aimed at
attaining food security range from building farmers' capacity to adopt best agricultural practices
in environmentally sustainable farming to providing farmers with adequate storage facilities and
assisting in maintaining soil fertility and conserving the soil. Boosting agricultural productivity
alone does little to protect the population from staving off nutritional deficiencies and
malnutrition, however. Attention to this issue is important because the Government intends to
use nutrition indicators in the surveillance of food security. Achieving the objectives envisioned
under the PAGE requires a broader range of actions therefore, ranging from reforming the land
tenure system so that women can have equal access to farmland to efforts aimed at reducing
individual and household risk to food insecurity and malnutrition.
3.15. The PAGE represents a comprehensive medium-term development strategy, but it
faces key challenges. Given the constrained resource envelope, further prioritization is required
to ensure that the programme is financeable and implementable. Also, as detailed in the PAGE,
achievements over the next years will build upon the progress made earlier in areas ranging from
the strengthening of public financial management to improving social indicators in education and
health. It is important to underscore the challenges created for the implementation of the PAGE
as a result of the frequent rotation of senior civil servants and the opportunities derived from
encouraging operational continuity. Financing the PAGE will be a challenge and mobilizing
external funding will need to be supported by improvements in the efficiency with which
external aid is managed. Effective institutional frameworks will need to be in place to ensure
productive private sector participation.

﻿4. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
A.    LINKS TO THE AFRICA STRATEGY AND TO THE JOINT ASSISTANCE STRATEGY (JAS)
AND THE JAS PROGRESS REPORT
4.1.  The forthcoming IDA and the AfDB Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) for FY12-15
period is in line with the principles of the Bank's Africa Strategy, as it emphasizes
partnerships and knowledge as key instruments of development. The overall approach of the
JAS emphasizes selectivity given limited IDA resources and takes account of the comparative
advantage of the IDA and the AfDB as well as other donors. It focuses on: (i) strengthening
economic management and public service delivery; and (ii) enhancing productive capacity and
accelerating growth and competitiveness. There are two new major IDA operations proposed in
the JAS: this proposed series of Development Policy Grants (budget support) and an agriculture
growth and competitiveness grant. The JAS also envisions a budget support grant by the AfDB,
being delivered in close coordination with IDA, as well as an ongoing institutional support
project focusing on macroeconomic and fiscal stabilization.
4.2.  The proposed operation would account for 10 percent of the JAS' proposed
resource envelope. At the time of the preparation of the JAS it was determined that The
Gambia was ready for another budget support operation based on the following considerations of
the country's economic policy and institutional environment and its capacity to carry out its
reform program:
*    There is a coherent country policy program, the PAGE, which benefits from a broad
country ownership built through a participatory and consultative preparation process.
Thirteen thematic groups working under the coordination of the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Affairs prepared the document, and a donor conference around the document is
expected to be taking place in Doha, Qatar, in May 2012. Important issues expected to be
considered include emergency support for food and seeds imports, developments at the
community level, investments in agriculture and infrastructure and the strengthening of
statistical system.
*    An adequate macroeconomic framework is in place with a new IMF-supported Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) program being presented to the IMF Board on May 25, 2012.
*    The budget support is consistent with the country's efforts to achieve greater debt
sustainability given that it will be provided as grants.
*    There is reasonable dissemination of the government's budget information, with
budget traditionally being presented to and approved by the National Assembly
before beginning of the fiscal year. For several years now, the annual budget has been
presented, approved, and published in a timely manner. There is ample press coverage on
the annual budget, printed copies are made available at a fee and the budget speeches are
posted on the website of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs.
*    The country's governance and institutional framework is improving. In particular, the
government has made significant progress in strengthening public financial management,
with several reforms completed have already increased budget transparency and
accountability.
- 15 -


﻿4.3.  The government has expressed a strong preference for budget support at this
moment given that it improves predictability of funds and reduces transaction costs in
dealing with development assistance. The decision by two of the main development partners,
IDA and AfDB, to once again coordinate their budget support operations acknowledges this
assessment, while providing an opportunity to improve donor coordination, minimize the burden
on the government's limited capacity, and allow each donor to be engaged in a range of critical
policy reforms despite limited resources.
4.4.  The design of the proposed operation is consistent with the JAS, since it indicates that
public financial management remains a critical area for continued IDA and AfDB assistance.
This proposed DPG would build upon and broaden this focus to support other reforms related to
government interventions in agriculture, education, energy and telecommunications.
B.    COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES
4.5.  The staffs of IDA and the IMF closely collaborate on The Gambia, particularly with
respect to the implementation of the country's PAGE by harmonizing support for policy
reforms and coordinating policy analysis and recommendations. IDA typically takes the
lead on sectoral issues, including public sector reform, while the IMF takes the lead on
macroeconomic policies. The two institutions are jointly preparing the new Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA). The IMF will be consulted on the Policy Matrix for this proposed DPG, not
least because The Gambia's successful engagement under a new ECF-supported program will be
critical for ensuring the maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic framework and the
sustainability of the reforms proposed in the Policy Matrix.
4.6.  Also, budget support in The Gambia has been catalytic for donor harmonization
around key policy measures and results. The donors participating in budget support, IDA and
the AfDB, will coordinate their disbursements based upon the government's Policy Matrix,
formalized through a MOU -- the government and the two agencies plan on conducting annual
joint reviews of progress in implementing the Policy Matrix, which will allow for consensus-
building and lower the transaction costs for the government. All the prior actions for the
proposed DPG are part of the joint Policy Matrix. Meanwhile the European Commission is
working in coordination with the IMF in providing technical assistance in public financial
management areas related to budget programming, the establishment of a Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and the introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT), and with
the Bank in public procurement reform (Table 4.1).
4.7.  Table 4.1 outlines technical assistance already provided or scheduled to be provided
to The Gambia in public financial management, identifying the range of areas in which the
Bank and other development partners have been contributing to capacity building in public
financial management in the country. Efforts have been made to help strengthen capacity in
macroeconomic management, HR management, medium-term budgeting, revenue mobilization,
and internal and external auditing.

C.            RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
4.8.   The proposed development policy operation complements four ongoing investment
projects: (i) the 2010 Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) project; (ii)
the 2010 Gambia Growth and Competitiveness (GGC) project; (iii) the 2010 West Africa
Agriculture Productivity (WAAP) project; and (iv) the 2010 West Africa Regional
Communications Infrastructure Program APL (WARCIP APL 2). This DPG supports policy and
institutional reforms in public financial management, and in the management of the agriculture,
education, energy and telecommunications sectors. These reforms complement the investments
in goods and works, technical assistance and training provided by the above mentioned
investment projects.
D.     LESSONS LEARNED
4.9.   The proposed operation reflects the key lessons of Bank experience during the
previous JAS period (FYO8-12), including those lessons from the first budget support
operation, as registered in the JAS progress report:"
*   Design programs in line with local capacity.        The FY2008-11 JAS was overly
ambitious in its coverage, with planned interventions in rural development and rural
See World Bank JAS FYO8-12 Progress Report.

﻿energy provision never launched. In acknowledging local capacity constraints, this DPG
limits its coverage to public financial management (where there is an ongoing project)
and other reform areas (agriculture, education, energy, and telecommunications) were
projects are either ongoing or envisioned.
*  Target sectors with clear strategies. This proposed DPG focuses on sectors with either
existing strategies or where there are ongoing reforms based on already finalized
analytical work.
*  Emphasize the importance of institutional stability. Capacity building and economic
adjustment efforts tend to succeed when key performing civil servants are retained in
position for a reasonable period of time and when there is institutional stability. The
Gambian civil service has been beset by a very high turnover of staff and frequent
organizational reforms that have weakened development progress and the sustainability
of achieved reforms. This operation addresses this concern by focusing on sector where
continuity of engagement from development partners has contributed to organizational
and staffing stability.
*  Provide close staff supervision. This proposed DPG is expected to be supervised by
joint assessment missions that will facilitate continued policy dialogue. Clearly defined
and monitorable policy actions and indicators will, in turn, facilitate supervision.
*  Improve donor coordination. The DPG is being prepared in close collaboration with
the African Development Bank (AfDB), as well as in consultation with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Commission's (EC) office in Banjul. Other
development agencies are also being consulted, including the UNDP and the WFP. This
joint work is designed to lead to closer dialogue with government in the formulation and
in monitoring the implementation of the proposed budget support operation.
E.    ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
4.10. A number of analytical, technical projects and strategic studies provide the basis for
the design of the proposed operation (see Tables 4.2 overleaf). IDA has actively collaborated
with the government and other development partners on many of these analytical exercises and
technical assistance projects, and this active engagement is expected to continue beyond the
disbursement of the proposed Grant's single tranche.
4.11. There have been a series of diagnostic assessments of the country's public financial
management (PFM) capacity, including the 2011 Public Expenditure Review Update, the 2010
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the IMF's 2011 Technical Assistance
on Strengthening Budget Management and Sequencing Reforms. These diagnostic assessments
indicate that there have been significant improvements in PFM capacity, particularly through the
recently established Integrated Financial Management Integrated Management System (IFMIS).
The key challenges are to continue with the ongoing reforms so that they become entrenched and
permanent, particularly regarding the timely preparation of financial statements and the judicious
audit of government accounts. These and other PFM reforms are incorporated in the proposed
Policy Matrix.

4.12. The Agriculture Policy Note provides a good overview of the sector's performance
and key challenges going forward.      It documents the impressive growth in food crop
production and yields from 2007 to 2010, while warning that climate change is likely to lead to
reduced yields in the long term, in the order of 20-30 percent. Reliable provision of improved
seeds and fertilizers is judged to be critical for the long-term health of the sector. The analysis of
recurrent expenditures shows that the Ministry of Agriculture has been more and more involved
in supplying agricultural inputs (particularly fertilizer), and points out that this increased
involvement in delivering inputs could reduce investments in research and extension services. It
also noted that the significant role played by Government in the procurement and distribution of
fertilizers raises the potential for possible political interference and the inadequate delivery of
appropriate fertilizers and pesticides to farmers.
4.13. The Country Gender Profile prepared by the AfDB notes that a new National
Gender Policy has been formulated and, since the completion of the Country Profile,
approved by the government. The new Women's Act combined Gambia's international and
national commitments within a comprehensive legal framework. Critical gaps still remain,
however, including an unambiguous policy statement regarding women's access and control over
land, which is especially important given the higher participation of women in the rural labor
market. Meanwhile, efforts are being made to ensure equal access to public services. According
to the latest (2012) World Development Indicators (WDI), the share of pregnant women
receiving anti-natal care rose to 98 percent in 2011, up from 91 percent in 2005, and the share of
births attended by skilled personnel increased to 57 percent in 2011, compared to 44 percent in
1998. Also, the authorities have increased significantly girls' enrolment in primary education
with a 3 percent annual average growth rate over the period 2000-11 through active
interventions, including scholarship schemes for girls, targeted recruitment of female teachers,
and an advocacy and social mobilization campaign. The Gender Parity Index (GPI) for primary
education stood well above balance in 2010, indicating that the enrollment of girls is now higher
than for boys.

﻿4.14. The shortcomings of the country's power system are well documented in a series of
diagnostic reports of which the 2010 Power Sector Diagnostic Review mentioned in Table
4.2 above was the most recent installment. The steady and drastic decline in the financial
performance of the country's power utility company (NAWEC) is due to a large degree to the
rise in crude oil prices (the country's main fuel for power generation) from 2008 onwards for
which NAWEC was unable to raise offsetting revenues. The result has been a large build up in
arrears which has now become an impediment for NAWEC' financial ability to undertake
needed investments aimed at reducing transmission and distribution loses, as well as to make
needed conversions to new fuel alternative. The report also highlights a range of reforms needed
to strengthen the company's financial performance and practice, including the mandated
reduction in public sector arrears to NAWEC by having the payment of utility bills automatically
deducted from budget transfers to ministries, departments and agencies, the introduction of pre-
paid meters, and advertising campaigns warning of stiff penalties and aggressive criminal
prosecution in case of non-payment of electricity bills. Thereafter, collection of past bills can be
handled through the legal system and future bill delinquencies can be minimized by the
implementation of such practices as pre-paid meters.
5. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION
5.1.  The proposed Grant of SDR 3.9 million (US$6.0 million equivalent) will be the first
installment in a two-grant series supporting, along with the AfDB, the implementation of
the government's Proposed Policy Matrix. The Proposed Policy Matrix outlines the
government's priority reform measures and benchmark for 2012 (see Annex 2). It is derived
from the country's 2012-15 Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE).
While the proposed operation supports the entire set of Policy Reforms, a subset of reform
measures supported by the proposed operation are the prior actions for the disbursement of the
Grant (see Annex 2 and Table 5.1) and are highlighted in bold in the Policy Matrix. The
expectation is this first installment of support will be followed by similar support later in
calendar year 2012 being prepared by the AfDB and then by a second installment in 2013 by
IDA and the AfDB, which would then complete this series.
5.2.  The main development objective of the proposed Grant is to strengthen
transparency, accountability and efficiency in public financial management, improve
public management in the key sectors of education, and energy, and promote competition
in telecommunications, as catalysts for growth. The removal of policy bottlenecks is expected
to generate positive externalities and help achieve the project's development objectives by
supporting prior actions in the following five PAGE priority policy areas:
* Improving public financial management through reforms focused on increasing
transparency and accountability.
- 20 -


﻿*   Strengthening accountability in the management of the education sector by having in
place service-level agreements between the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education,
its regional directorates and the head-teachers in public basic and secondary schools.
*  Improve the financial situation of the energy sector by reducing payment arrears to the
National Water and Electricity Corporation (NAWEC).
*  Ensuring private sector participation in telecommunications by licensing the recently
established Gambia Submarine Cable Company (GSCC).
5.3.   These development objectives are consistent with pillars one (macroeconomic
stability and public sector reform) and pillar two (promotion of pro-poor growth and
employment through private sector development) of the government's national development
program outlined in the Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE). They are
also consistent with the Africa Strategy, which identifies the region's undiversified production
structure, low levels of human capital, and weak governance amongst its long term development
challenges. Finally, they are in line with the strategic objectives of the Joint AfDB/World Bank
Assistance Strategy (JAS), namely: (i) strengthening economic management and public service
delivery and (ii) enhancing productive capacity and accelerating growth and competitiveness.
5.4.   Table 5.1 details the proposed Grant's prior actions. They were selected due to their
importance to the government's reform program, and government's commitment and
institutional capacity for implementation. The country's performance in meeting these prior
actions has informed IDA's decision to proceed with the approval of the proposed Grant.
5.5.   This operation will also act as a catalyst for improved cooperation between the
government and the development partners, as well as to facilitate the coordination in the use
of IDA's other instruments to support the Policy Matrix. This is already the case with education
and telecommunications.12 After the release of its first tranche, IDA expects to add value to the
policy dialogue in the five major reform areas under the Policy Matrix - public financial
management, agriculture, education, energy and telecommunications.
B.      POLICY AREA 1: IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY IN
PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
5.6.   The government has been making strides in improving its public financial
management and transparency, as reflected in the findings of the 2010 Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the 2011 Public Expenditure Review (PER) Update.
The timeliness of financial reporting has been improved with the establishment of an Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), providing monthly and comprehensive
within-year budget execution reports and facilitating the preparation of the annual financial
statements."
12 For IDA, the policy dialogue on the telecommunications sector is essentially led by the team working on the West
Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (WARCIP APL 2), an investment project, with this DPG
supporting the policy reforms aimed at achieving the objectives of increase competition in the telecommunications
sector (see section 5, Policy Area 4).
" The IFMIS currently produces in-year fiscal reports with an average lag of one month and reconciles most
banking and fiscal records also on a monthly basis.
-21 -


﻿5.7.  Meanwhile, the operations of the IFMIS has permitted:
*  Closer control of the status of budget execution and of spending levels, assisting in
fostering macroeconomic stability;
*  Enhanced management of ministerial resources due to the access to real time
information on the status of their budgets;
*  Strengthened sectoral allocation planning and analysis leading to greater effectiveness
of expenditure due to more accurate financial data; and
*  Greater effectiveness in Government expenditure programs by identifying cost-
drivers in program activities.
5.8.  The backlog of audited Government financial statements is being reduced thanks to
the establishment of the IFMIS and the strengthening of the accounting and reporting
environment within the public sector. This task is important because Government financial
statements provide information on the financial position and performance of the government,
allowing Parliament and the population at large to know and appreciate how public resources
were used and can be better allocated.
5.9.  With the establishment of the Tax Tribunal, the Gambian government is seeking to
improve the credibility of the tax system to increase compliance. This initiative is part of the
government's drive to reverse the recent decline in tax revenue collection by providing the
appropriate channels for tax payers to object to their tax liability if they are not in agreement
with the tax assessed and believe that the tax and penalty (in case of late payment) need to be
reviewed. The Tax Tribunal was envisioned in the 2004 Income and Sales Tax Act and the 2010
Customs and Excise Tax Act, and is now becoming operational with the appointment of tribunal
judges as supported under this operation.
5.10. The internal audit function has been missing for many years. The establishment of
the function was a requirement embodied as part of the institutional arrangements set out in the
2004 Gambia Budget Management and Accountability Act (GBMAA), and in the 2006 legal
mandate for the internal audit function. It has been recently given renewed attention, with the
full rollout of IFMIS, and the establishment of an improved the accounting environment. There
has been a shift from pre-payment auditing to risk-based auditing, concentrating on systemic
issues. The objective now is to ensure: (i) conformity to the Government's strategy; (ii)
effectiveness and efficiency of operations; (iii) reliability of financial reporting; and (iv)
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As part of the process to render this function
operational, the Director for Internal Audit at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs was
appointed in 2011 as were, more recently, the members of the Internal Audit Committee.
5.11. An IFMIS interface at the Central Bank has been established, ensuring real-time
information on budget shortfalls and on the timing of needed public domestic borrowing. This
was important because the high cost of servicing the domestic public debt resulted both from
high levels of borrowing and from the lack of predictability in the government's demand on
Central Bank resources (Figure 5.1). The IFMIS interface contributes toward increasing the
predictability in public borrowing needs by providing the Ministry of Finance with real-time
information on cash balances in government accounts at the CBG. This allows the benefits of
the Treasury Single Account to begin to be reaped as government borrowings take cognizance of

1) 2011 figures are estimates.
5.12. Monthly IFMIS fiscal reports are being posted on the website of the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs. 14 These reports provide figures on overall fiscal outturns
(revenues and expenditures) as well as the breakdown of budget expenditure execution according
to the responsible ministries. This initiative seeks to establish a virtuous cycle whereby greater
transparency encourages efficiency and further dissemination of information, and to encourage
fair competition among alternative claims to resources during the budget formulation stage and
to help detect wasteful use of resources during the budget execution stage.
5.13. There are an estimated 26,000 central government employees on the IFMIS payroll,
and efforts are being made to regularize their HR records with the systematic validation of
these records. While the Personnel Management Office (PMO) is officially in charge of
managing HR records and has the authority to create new positions and close existing ones,
payroll funding is provided through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MoFEA),
which controls the wage bill. The goal with this validation of HR records is to set up a
functioning link between the payroll and the HR records data base, allowing with this validation
a better control of the number of staff whose records are regularized and should continue
receiving their payroll payment.
5.14. These actions taken by the government to improve the supply-side of public
financial management complement the demand-side efforts for greater transparency and
accountability. By making the IFMIS reports available through the internet, and submitting
government's financial accounts to the National Audit Office, more information will be made
available to the popular media and to the NGOs currently operating in the country. These NGOs
operate an umbrella organization - The Association of Non-Government Organizations, TANGO
- and have created a pro-poor advocacy group (pro-PAG) that has proven quite effective in using
such information in policy dialogue. IDA is exploring other ways to improve demand-side
governance, including through training on, and dissemination of, CPIA ratings.
14 These reports can be accessed at www.mof.gov.gm under downloads.

﻿5.15. Expected Results. The implementation of the public financial management reforms
outlined above is expected to achieve several objectives. Disseminating the IFMIS reports and
establishment of the internal audit function will strengthen all stages of the budget process:
formulation, execution and monitoring. Finalizing the government financial statements for the
period 2008-09-10 is an important first step so that they are then submitted to the National Audit
Office (NAO), which will eventually provide Parliament and civil society information about how
public resources were used. Removing ghost workers will free up more public resources to
improve the salaries of high-performing civil servants. Creation of a tax tribunal should improve
compliance and establish an environment for complaint redress measures. Finally, establishing
the IFMIS interface at the Central Bank increased the predictability of government borrowing,
helping to reduce interest payments on domestic debt - the fastest growing government
expenditure item at present.

﻿Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
There is a strong country ownership of the program design given that it is based on the PRSP which was prepared through
a highly participatory and consultative process. Stakeholder consultative workshops and focus group discussions were held
with representatives of the public and private sectors and civil society, down to the level of local communities. There has
also been extensive analytical work which has informed policy formulation in a timely manner.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
There is a joint Policy Matrix shared by all the donors planning on providing budget support. Prior actions for donor
disbursements are identified in the Policy Matrix, thus allowing for aid coordination. Policy dialogues are conducted
jointly and joint appraisal missions are planned to assess progress in implementing the Policy Matrix.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The joint Policy Matrix was developed in close coordination with the government, including various sector ministries, thus
ensuring that it reflects the government's expressed policy intentions and the country's circumstances. The design of
policy reforms has been backed by analytical work. Most of the reforms are either ongoing or extensions of ongoing
government initiatives which are prioritized in government sector reform strategies. Donor coordination on the budget
support has reduced transaction costs and the expected timing of the IDA disbursement is aligned with the government's
domestic budgeting process.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
Prior actions are chosen from the Policy Matrix and focused on measures that are critical to achieving the objectives of the
program. The matrix is selective and streamlined, consisting of eight prior actions for the Bank's operation.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
The government and the participating donors plan on conducting annual joint progress reviews of the implementation of
the Policy Matrix. The reviews are expected to promote results orientation given that the Policy Matrix includes
benchmark indicators which are results-focused.
C.      POLICY AREA 2: IMPROVING AGRICULTURE SECTOR MANAGEMENT
5.16. Description and Challenges. The PAGE aims at transforming The Gambia into a major
supplier of agricultural products to local and international markets. To realize this objective, the
government is considering the implementation of structural reforms and intends to gradually
increase public investments in the sector from three percent of overall expenditures in 2009 to
six percent already in 2012 and at least 10 percent by the end of the PAGE period. These
additional expenditures would center on irrigation, quality inputs, research and extension
services, post-harvest management and marketing. To address the vulnerability to erratic rainfall
which has lead to the current crisis, discussions with the Gambian Government are centered on
tailoring these public investments to small-scale, tidal irrigation which has emerged as a more
profitable approach that also avoids the problems of inadequate maintenance that overwhelmed
earlier irrigation programs. A proposed IDA investment project will seek ways to reduce this
vulnerability due to dependence on rain-fed agriculture.
- 27 -


﻿5.17. The success in expanding rice production in The Gambia is probably attributable in
part to the protection of women's rights. Women have gained improved access to land
through the bantafaro rice schemes. These schemes involve reclaiming swamp land from
riverine mud flats which has not been previously allocated through communal traditions, and
which gives women who clear the land, the rights to use it. Also, in villages where men have
started to grow rice alongside women, women still continue to control the harvested rice,
including harvests from the men's fields.
5.18. The Gambia has the potential to become a producer of quality seeds, capitalizing on
the availability of irrigation while recognizing the limited availability of land. There is a
growing market for quality seeds that meet the needs created by increased prices for food crops,
larger demand resulting from fast urbanization, and the impact of weather changes on soil
fertility. Climate changes will require the adoption of improved cultivars as agro-ecological
conditions adjust. Seizing this opportunity to become a producer of quality seeds will require
that farmers balance the higher prices that seeds can command against higher input prices, and
that government action assist them in overcoming technological (e.g., farm size, education,
technical links) as well as management constraints (ownership, off-farm activities, and, again,
education). To these ends, the agriculture strategy is embedded in the overall drive to modernize
the state, placing an emphasis on planning capacity, resource management and the ability to
better organize and deliver public services in agriculture.
5.19. Government's proposed Reform Actions for 2013. Actions taken last year by the
government were focused on increasing funding for the agriculture sector in the 2012 budget,
with a view to increase public investments in the sector. These investments are not being
supported by this grant. Instead the actions envisioned for 2013 aim at reforming agriculture
policy and should be completed over the course of this year and early next year. These actions
would aim at encouraging greater private sector involvement in the delivery of agricultural
inputs and will be outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding to be signed between
government and the Agribusiness Services and Producers Association (ASPA), which should
provide a framework to enable viable participation of the private sector in input delivery.
5.20. Expected Results. The proposed reform in the next operation would aim at opening the
scope for the private sector to deliver agricultural inputs, thereby improving the efficiency of
input delivery and freeing up needed public resources for irrigation works, and research and
extension. Greater support to research is urgently needed to produce improved seeds that will
raise yields and be more drought resistant.
D.    POLICY AREA 3: ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION
5.21. Description and Challenges. The Gambia has seen enrollment and school completion
rates increase steadily over the last few years, rising from 70 and 65 percent, respectively, in
2005/6 to 90 and 70 percent in 2010/11. Student score in performance in assessments tests have
not improved at the same pace, however. In the National Assessment Test, for instance, very
few students reached the minimum requirement, with the success rate varying between 45.7
percent for Grade 5 social studies, and 19.5 percent for Grade 3 English. Also, the results in
Grade 5 math and sciences were particularly worrying, with an average success rate of just 20
percent. The results at upper basic and senior secondary levels were scarcely better, having
- 28 -


﻿barely improved since 2002. At the GABECE assessment test (the Grade 9 exam for senior
secondary admission) 76 percent of candidates failed to obtain a credit in any of the 4 core
subjects, and only 4 percent achieved a credit in all 4. Results were the poorest in math, with
only 7 percent of candidates obtaining the credit. Meanwhile the results of the WASSCE
assessment test (end of senior secondary exam) are improving but are still far behind other
WAEC countries. In math the pass rate is just 3.2 percent, compared with up to 47 percent in
other countries. In 2008/09, 50.8 percent failed to obtain a single credit in any of the 9 subjects
and only 11 percent achieved credits in five or more subjects. Grant-aided and mission schools
performed better than public and private schools with 20.2 percent of the candidates obtaining a
credit in at least 5 subjects, compared to 5.5 percent for public school candidates and 9.1 percent
for private ones.
5.22. The challenge for the education system in The Gambia is to raise the quality of
teaching and, as a result, the student's scores in these assessment tests. To meet this first
challenge the Government has signed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between the Ministry of
Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE), its regional directorates, and the head-teachers of the
public basic and secondary schools. The SLAs with the regional directorates were first signed in
2009-10 and were extended last year, and are not technically new agreements. The SLAs with
head-teachers were signed for the first time last year, which was the first time that SLAs reached
the class room level. These SLAs define the mutual accountability in the provision of public
education, and cover issues such as teacher attendance and curriculum program. Also, the SLAs
are jointly reviewed every quarter, helping the MoBSE monitor what is happening in schools and
in the class rooms. Meanwhile, these reviews help schools focus their efforts on the objectives
set out in the SLAs since they provide useful feedback and help to determine what is expected
from teachers in terms of curriculum output.
5.23. Government's Policy Matrix Reform Actions for 2012. The proposed Grant supported
the improvement in the design and implementation of these service-level agreements between the
Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education, its regional directorates and the head-teachers of
public basic and secondary schools. For the academic year 2011-2012, 6 SLAs were signed
between the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE) and its regional directors, and
just under 500 SLAs were signed between the MoBSE and the school head teachers. It is on the
basis of these SLAs that performance is now being monitored, since these SLAs now define a
new level of accountability in public basic and secondary education and helps define actions
needed to improve the quality of teaching.
5.24. Expected results. The implementation of these service level agreements is expected to
be reflected in higher scores in the National Assessment Tests (NATs).
E.    POLICY AREA 4: STRENGTHENING ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT
5.25. Description and Challenges. The power sector of The Gambia faces many challenges
that span from structural and operational issues to significant investment needs to upgrade and
expand the country's generation, transmission and distribution capacity. NAWEC faces serious
financial issues, and efforts are needed to improve its financial viability and operational
performance. Losses in 2011 were estimated at around 27.0 percent. Some of these losses are
due to technical problems stemming from ageing infrastructure that are, at the moment, beyond
- 29 -


﻿the control of NAWEC, while other problems stem from commercial losses due to the failure of
consumers to pay its bills. While tariffs need to be reviewed on a more regular basis, the
government and NAWEC need to assure the regulators that they are doing more to improve its
financial situation before asking consumers to pay higher tariffs.
5.26. Power Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Losses. The current transmission and
distribution system suffers losses of approximately 27 percent (including both technical and
commercial losses). The current system is inadequate and preliminary indications are that it
requires significant improvements to recover these losses. Table 5.2 provides estimates of
current energy losses (electricity unaccounted for as a percentage of net generation) from the
transmission and distribution system.'6 These losses include technical and non-technical losses
from the distribution equipment (technical) and the energy consumed but not metered or billed
(non-technical). While there is no information available on the breakdown between the non-
technical and technical losses, it is likely that technical losses make up the majority of these
estimated losses.

e) Estimate.
5.27. Table 5.3 provides a comparison of the system losses of some of The Gambia's
neighboring countries and other African Countries. The system losses for each country were
calculated as a percentage of the country's total generation for 2005, which was the latest data
available. To carry out the needed investment aimed at reducing power transmission and
distribution losses, there is the need to place NAWEC's financial position back in balance.
Table 5.3: Power Transmission and Distribution Losses in Sub-Saharan Africa, 2005 (%)

﻿5.28. Another key issue that must be overcome for electricity service in The Gambia is
NAWEC's inability to collect its bills from customers (both public and private sector
customers). In mid-October 2011, customer arrears amounted to around GMD325 billion,
representing about 38 percent of the year's revenue. The largest proportion of unpaid bills
belonged to Local Governments (36 percent), which together with arrears from the Central
Government, added to 51 percent of all arrears. The breakdown of arrears to NAWEC is
presented in Figure 5.2 below:
Figure 5.2: Breakdown of the Arrears to NAWEC, October, 2011 (%)

5.29. Government's Policy Matrix Reform Actions for 2012. The proposed Grant supports
the reduction in non-payment of public sector power bills to NAWEC by having the central
government make timely payments of utility bills with a view to place the NAWEC's balance
sheet on a more stable financial position. Actions that have complemented this efforts required
ministries, departments and agencies to set up pre-paid arrangements for electricity bills, such as
having the payment of utility bills automatically deducted from the budget transfers to ministries,
departments and agencies and introducing of pre-paid meters in public offices. The only offices
excluded from this second requirement are hospitals, clinic and the offices of security
organizations. These initiatives are an important first step to allowing NAWEC to be in the
position to carry out needed investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure that could
then reduce system losses. This reform measure is therefore one of the prior actions for the
proposed operation.
5.30. Expected results. An improvement in NAWEC's financial balance is expected as a
result from actions aimed at stemming the increase in government arrears to NAWEC. With
NAWEC's improved financial balance, the company is expected in turn to be better placed to
undertake the investments needed to reduce current system losses.

﻿F.     POLICY AREA 5: PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION
IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
5.31. Description and Challenges. The Gambia telecommunications industry includes a fixed
network operator, Gamtel, and four mobile operators, Gamcel, Africell, Comium and QCell (a
fifth operator - Globacom - was licensed in July 2010 but is not yet operating). Existing
international connectivity for The Gambia is very inadequate, however. The Gambia depends on
Senegal for international fiber bandwidth and as a result Internet access prices are high. Also,
the quality of service is reportedly poor, subject to frequent cuts. The anticipated growth of
mobile data services is expected to increase demand for international connectivity from all
operators, and the new submarine cable running down the West African coast - the Africa Coast
to Europe (ACE) project -- has the potential to change this situation (see Box 2 below).
5.32. To allow for a competitive access to the ACE, the Gambian government established
a framework for private sector participation in the ownership of the access to the cable.
The framework for private sector participation entailed transferring Gamtel's rights under the
This Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set the basis for the recently established Gambia Submarine
Cable Company (GSCC) Limited that is open to multiple stakeholders. Under this newly
established GSCC Limited share/capacity owners, service providers intend to bundle the
international capacity with other services they provide and sell at retail to their customers.
Because the capacity in the ACE cable is allocated to each shareholder proportionately to its
interest in the GSCC Limited, each shareholder is free to do what it wants with its capacity sub-
allocation. Meanwhile, the backbone for the system will remain owned and operated by
GAMTEL and will operate under an open access principle.
Box 5.2: The ACE sub-marine telecommunication cable
The ACE is a 14,000 km sub-marine cable system aimed at connecting South Africa to Europe, which would have
approximately 24 landing stations down the Western coast of Africa, including a landing station in The Gambia.
The cost for The Gambia to participate in the ACE consortium as a single member landing station is estimated at
approximately US $25 million, and support is being provided through IDA's West Africa Regional
Communications Infrastructure Program. To take advantage of this unique ACE opportunity The Gambia
Telecommunications Company (Gamtel), the State Owned Telecommunications operator, signed a Construction
and Maintenance Agreement (CMA) for ACE on June 5, 2010, and is now under obligation to secure funding for
its full membership. This endeavor is important and worthwhile because competitive access to the cable could
result in lower cost/higher quality connectivity for the country, and, in doing so, remove an important constraint to
the country's future economic development.
5.33. Government's Policy Matrix Reform Actions for 2012. The proposed grant supported
the licensing of the GSCC Limited, where shares in the company also represent the right for
shareholders to use the country's allocated capacity in the ACE system. The licensing of the
GSCC Limited opens therefore access to the ACE system to the private sector and, in doing so,
endeavors to ensure non-discriminatory access to the cable.7
17 The current ownership structure of the SPV is as follows: Gamtel (20 percent); Gamcel (10 percent); Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs (19 percent); Africel (15 percent); Comium (10 percent); Netpage (5 percent); Qcell
(16 percent); and Unique (5 percent).
- 32 -


﻿5.34. Expected Results. The licensing of the GSCC opens access to the ACE system to the
private sector, ensuring the non-discriminatory access to the cable.          The private sector
participation in the ACE system is important because the country's existing international
connectivity requires new investment. A reduction in connectivity costs as a result of this
investment should result in lower prices and expanded services.
G.     PROPOSED TRIGGERS FOR THE SECOND ECONOMIC
GOVERNANCE REFORM GRANT (EGRG-II)
5.35. The triggers for 2013 were defined between the Government of The Gambia and
IDA, and satisfactory progress on these actions would lead to the preparation of the next
operation in this series. The next operation would be the second and final grant under this series.
The assessment of these triggers would inform the Government of The Gambia about the amount
to be provided via budget support before the Government's budget proposal is submitted to the
National Assembly.
5.36. The agreed triggers for the next operation are as follows (Table 5.4):

with the commitment to greater reliance on country systems established in
the donor harmonization agreements reached Paris in 2005 and in Accra in
2008. The current disconnect between these projects and the national
budget process leads to unpredictable fluctuations in the net domestic assets
in government accounts at the Central Bank, creating difficulties for
liquidity management. By increasing the coverage of the IFMIS to include
self-accounting projects, the Gambian government will achieve two goals:
(i) broaden its within-year reporting of government expenditure; and (ii)
improve overall government cash management.
4. Submit a revised Gambia  At present, the GPPA has the responsibility for both ex-ante and ex-post

7. Adopt PURA regulation     Opportunities for competition in underdeveloped markets, such as The
for open access to the      Gambia, depend on three factors: the demand for new services, the
telecommunications          economies of scale and scope that emerge over time and the technological
backbone,                   innovations introduced. Competition is important because it allows
consumers to enjoy more reliable and cheaper services, and for the
economy to benefits from increased investment, job creation and export-led
growth. Monopolistic behavior, in contrast, holds markets back, lowers
investments, provides services at a higher cost, and places the entire
economy in a competitive disadvantage. The three key competition issues
facing the The Gambia telecommunications sector at the moment are: (i)
the access to the cable, (ii) the control of the international gateway, and (iii)
the connection to the national broadband backbone. The arrangement made
under the WARCIP project ensures that the first two bottlenecks are
removed. The proposed trigger for this second budget support operation
aims at removing the third bottleneck.

﻿6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A.    COUNTRY OWNERSHIP
6.1. The proposed operation is fully owned by the Government of The Gambia.
Discussions have been held with key government stakeholders in developing the reform agenda
of the operation. The specific reforms are critical elements of the government's national
development strategy as outlined in the country's PAGE. The PAGE was the result of a
participatory and consultative process, with thematic group meetings organized with
representatives of the public and private stakeholders, and reaching down to the level of
communities. The government's Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1) outlines progress in
preparing the PAGE reform agenda, as reflected in the Draft Budget Support Policy Matrix.
B.    POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
6.2. The reform measures supported by the proposed Grant are expected to have positive
poverty and social impacts. The strengthening of public financial management is expected to
improve the government' capacity to more effectively manage its resources and deliver public
services. The focus of government interventions in the management of information from
agriculture and the allocation of public resources in this sector should also help maximize the
poverty impact of these interventions.  Similarly, the strengthening of the government
management of the energy sector is expected to allow an improvement in NAWEC's financial
health, opening scope for the company to carry out needed investments in transmission and
distribution. These investments would aim at reducing current system losses and at improving
service delivery. Finally, broadening access to the ACE system to the private sector is expected
to reduce the cost telecommunication services and expand public access to telecommunication
services.
C.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
6.3. The specific reforms supported by the proposed Development Policy Grant are not
likely to have significant negative effects on The Gambia's environment. The priority
environmental challenges in the country include deforestation, desertification, erosion and
salinization of tidal lands far upriver. The economic governance reforms supported by the
proposed operation are unlikely to affect these problems.
6.4. The main government agencies responsible for environmental management are the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA). The
Gambia Environmental Action Plan - GEAP - was adopted by the Cabinet in 1992, and was
updated - GEAP Phase II - and validated by all key national stakeholders, including government,
civil society and private sector, before being adopted by the Cabinet early in 2009. There is
currently no permanent structure of the monitoring environmental indicators to enable one to
determine changes and trends. The environmental indicators for water and sanitation are
however fully developed by the Health authorities, and they are being monitored for the MDG
Progress Reports. Government actions in the environment sector are guided by priorities clearly
spelt out in sectoral policies and action plans.
- 35 -


﻿D.    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.5. The existing institutional structure for the implementation of the PAGE process will
be used to implement and monitor the policy reforms supported by the proposed Grant. It
is expected that a Cabinet subcommittee, the High Level Economic Committee (HILEC), will
provide overall guidance for the budget support program, and that MoFEA will assume overall
responsibility for coordinating the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Policy
Matrix. It will be ultimately responsible for reporting progress and coordinating actions among
other concerned ministries and agencies, as identified in the Government's Policy Matrix
(Annex 2).
6.6. It is proposed that the government and the development partners providing budget
support will jointly conduct annual reviews of the implementation of the Policy Matrix.
These reviews will be used to monitor reform actions, evaluate the impact of the reforms on the
development objectives, and discuss strategic adjustments to the Policy Matrix taking into
account the latest country developments, stakeholder support and alternative options for realizing
the intended development objectives. The reviews will be based on the reform measures and
outcome indicators outlined in the Policy Matrix. Even after the disbursement of its single
tranche, IDA plans to continue participating in the annual reviews in order to coordinate support
to the government and participate in the policy dialogue.
E.    FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
6.7. Fiduciary aspects, particularly the strengthening of the government's own systems,
are at the core of this operation. PFM and procurement reforms are incorporated in the
government's Policy Matrix. The analytical underpinnings in the area of PFM are anchored on
the 2010 CFAA and the 2011 Public Expenditure Review conducted by the World Bank at the
request of the government of The Gambia. The PFM reform measures under this operation have
been drawn from these analytical works and they complement the measures to be supported
under the AfDB's capacity building project - the ongoing second stage of the Institutional
Support for Economic and Financial Governance (ISEFG II).
6.8.  This analytical work, as well as actions taken since these works were completed,
confirm that significant progress has been achieved by The Gambia in the area of PFM,
including: (i) an improved budgetary planning and budgeting process, (ii) introduction and roll-
out of a robust IFMIS across the central government, covering the whole cycle of budget
execution, with a system of commitment accounting and control as well as budget execution and
financial reporting, (iii) the establishment of a functioning Internal Audit Department as an
independent, risk and systemic-focused function within MoFEA, (iv) strengthening the capacity
of the external audit function, and (v) the evolution of a legislative oversight function (pubic
accounts and public enterprise committee. Nevertheless, there are a few areas that still require
improvements. These areas include: (i) developing on the foundation of the MTEF and
utilization of the program element as part of the IFMIS implementation, (ii) further strengthening
the legal and regulatory framework for PFM through the revision of the Government Budget
management and Accountability Act (2004), (iii) eliminating the backlog in the preparation of
fully reconciled annual public accounts for the fiscal years 2010 (fiscal years 2008 and 2009
having already been completed and delivered as supported under this operation), and the
- 36 -


﻿completion of the audit certification of these public accounts, and (iv) the review of the GPPA
(2003) to separate its regulatory and policy and operational functions, as envisioned under the
forthcoming operation.
6.9.  IMF safeguards assessments of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) were
completed in February 2004, February 2007, and November 2009. The 2007 assessment
concluded that the CBG had initiated steps to improve its safeguards framework and
recommended additional measures to strengthen the CBG's internal controls and financial
reporting practices. The 2009 update report concluded that the CBG had made good progress in
implementing safeguards recommendations. The central bank continued to be audited by a
reputable audit firm and implemented International Financial Reporting Standards. The
assessment stressed that key safeguards should remain in place and recommended that the central
bank formalize a framework for extension of credit to government to ensure compliance with the
statutory limits.
6.10. Overall, the fiduciary risk of this operation rated as moderate and The Gambia's
PFM system is deemed robust enough to appropriately manage the country's budget
resources. This assessment is based on the results of the latest IMF Safeguards Assessment of
the Central Bank of The Gambia, the improvements already made since the results of the lastest
analytical work on the country's PFM performance, and the demonstrated commitment of the
Government to implementing other wide ranging reforms in the PFM area, including in public
procurement.
F.    DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
6.11. Recipient and Grant Agreement. This proposed operation is a single tranche Grant of
SDR 3.9 million (US$6 million equivalent) that would be made available to the Republic of The
Gambia upon grant effectiveness. The Grant disbursement will follow the standard Bank
procedures for Development Policy Lending. The administration of this credit will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, and the closing date of the
operation would be June 30, 2013.
6.12. Funds flow arrangements. The Government of The Gambia shall identify a Foreign
Exchange Account with the Central Bank of The Gambia and that forms part of the country's
official foreign exchange reserves, into which the proceeds of the Grant will be disbursed upon
meeting the agreed prior actions and upon credit effectiveness. The Gambian Dalasi equivalent
of the funds in the Account will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated
Fund of the Government of The Gambia, and the amount recorded appropriately in the financial
management system of the Government of The Gambia.
6.13. Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund by the Government of The Gambia
shall not be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be
needed. The proceeds of the Grant shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the
negative list as defined in the Schedule 1 of the Grant Agreement. If any portion of the Grant
proceeds is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule 1 of the Grant
Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an
- 37 -


﻿amount equal to the amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such
request shall be cancelled from the Grant.
6.14. Assurance Requirements. Based on the moderate fiduciary risk associated with the
operation, there will be no special fiduciary arrangements established for the Grant in terms of a
requirement for an audit. However, within seven days of the disbursement of the Grant by IDA,
the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance & Economic Affairs of The Gambia shall
provide a written confirmation to IDA, certifying the receipt of the Gambian Dalasi equivalent of
the Grant into the Consolidated Fund Account of the Government of The Gambia held with the
Central Bank of The Gambia, the number of the account, the date of the receipt, and the
exchange rate applied to translate the Grant currency into Gambian Dalasi, and confirming that
the said amount has been appropriately accounted for in the recipient's financial management
system. As the Auditor General is required by law to submit its annual report and the audited
accounts on the public consolidated fund to the National Assembly, a copy of the said reports
and accounts shall be provided to IDA within one month of presentation to the Assembly. In
addition, the Government shall ensure that the annual entity financial statements of the Central
Bank of The Gambia, audited in accordance with international standards on auditing as
promulgated by the International Federation of Accountants, are publicly available.
6.15. The Association reserves the right to request, at any time, an audit of the receipt and
accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the Government of The
Gambia. Upon the Association's request, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs shall:
(i) have the account and the recording of amounts of the Grant into the government's budget
management system audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association, in
accordance with consistently applied auditing standards acceptable to the Association; (ii)
furnish to the Association as soon as available, but in any case no later than four months after the
date of the Association's request for such audit, a certified copy of the audit report by said
auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested; and
(iii) furnish to the Association such other information concerning the said account and recording
of Grant proceeds into the budget management system, and the audit thereof, as the Association
shall have reasonably requested.
G.    RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
6.16. There are several risks to the proposed operation, and risk mitigating strategies
have been identified:
6.17. Capacity Constraints of the Government. Public sector capacity constraints are typical
in a small, poor country such as The Gambia. The proposed operation seeks to mitigate this risk
in several ways. First, it focuses on policy areas and reform measures where there is ongoing
policy dialogue. Second, it support actions that maximizes the synergies with the Bank's
portfolio of operations, such as the ongoing Education Sector project and the IFMIS project, as
well as the forthcoming Commercial Agriculture and Value Chain Project and the IFMIS
additional financing. Third, this operation aims at maintaining the momentum developed earlier
in the engagement with the Bank. This is important because the recent track record with PFM
reforms indicate that progress on capacity building requires a long term engagement and
sustained political commitment.
- 38 -


﻿6.18. With respect to macroeconomic risks, the government has so far carried out
prudent measures in response to recent external shocks and continues to maintain a
dialogue with the development partners on appropriate policy responses and the possible need
for augmented concessional external aid in the form of grants. Furthermore, macroeconomic
risks would be mitigated by close monitoring and coordination by IDA, IMF and other donors.
The need for external borrowing would be reduced by increased grant resources provided
through the proposed operations by AfDB and IDA, as well as other proposed AfDB and IDA
operations.
6.19. The country's weak governance could be further strengthened by enhancing the
transparency and accountability of the public sector. To mitigate the governance risk, several
prior actions for this operation seek to defined institutional arrangements that enhance
transparency and accountability in public sector procedures and promote private sector
investment and participation. The support and participation of the AfDB and IDA in the
implementation of the Policy Matrix also contributes towards building political commitment to
reforms.
6.20. Difficulties in sustaining reforms in agriculture, energy and telecommunications
sector will be mitigated by extensive consultations with both public and private stakeholders in
these sectors aiming at ensuring country ownership, alignment of reform measures with the
government's sector strategy and additional complementary investment support provided by IDA
and the AfDB.

FIRST ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE REFORM GRANT (EGRG-I)
Robert B. Zoellick                               April 19, 2012
President
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Zoellick,
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
1.   I am writing to request, on behalf of the Government of Republic of The Gambia,
a first Economic Governance Reform Grant (EGRG-I) from the International
Development Association (IDA) to support the programs and policy measures outlined
in The Gambia's Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE). This
letter sets out the actions that Government has already and will seek to undertake over
the medium term to implement its development agenda. The attached policy matrix,
developed in collaboration with the World Bank team sets out the contents of this letter
in a summary form.
2.   The Gambia's Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE)
covers the period 2012 to 2015 and is organized around five pillars: (i) accelerating and
sustaining economic growth; (ii) improving and modernising infrastructure; (iii)
strengthening human capital stock and enhancing access to social services; (iv)
improving governance and increasing economic competitiveness; and (v) reinforcing
social cohesion. The PAGE focuses on stepping-up infrastructure investments to
address the country's shortcomings, strengthening the country's public financial
management, and helping to create a more enabling business environment.
- 41 -


﻿3.   The PAGE builds on the achievements recorded under the implementation of the
second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II) covering the period 2007-2011,
with realizations ranging from higher real GDP growth rates to new infrastructure
developments. During the implementation of the PRSP-II the country performed
beyond the targets of 4.5 percent real GDP growth, reaching average real GDP growth
rates of over 6.0 percent during the period 2007-2010. While real GDP growth declined
to 3.3 percent in 2011, this decline was due to the weather-related shock that led to
the 2011-12 crop failure. It is in this context that the request being presented in this
letter is made even more important.
Macroeconomic Stability, Growth and Employment
4.   The primary objective of our growth strategy is to maintain macroeconomic
stability for sustained economic growth and employment. This overarching objective
translates specifically into implementing structural reforms aimed at improving the
country's fiscal balance, pursuing sound monetary and exchange rate policies aimed at
keeping inflation below 5 percent, strengthening the financial system and supporting
sources of economic growth.
5.   The PAGE notes the country's strengthened public financial management, with
an improvement in budget outcomes during 2011 and the establishment of the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). The country generated
a basic primary fiscal surplus estimated at 1.2 percent of GDP in 2011, up from a 0.4
percent deficit in 2010. Also, the operationalization of the IFMIS has allowed more
frequent and accurate fiscal reporting, closer monitoring of poverty-reducing
expenditures, and the upgrading of payroll management and control. In this context,
the government has validated the HR records in the IFMIS payroll, regularizing the
records of civil servants not identified during this validation exercise.
6.   Actions have also been taken on four other fronts. First, the backlog in audited
financial statements is being gradually reduced with the recent submission of the 2008,
2009 and 2010 accounts to the National Audit Office (NAO) and the expected
submission of the 2011 accounts to NAO later this year. Second, the reconciliation and
clearance of accounts between the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of The
Gambia (CBG) has been accelerated by establishing the IFMIS interface at the Central
Bank. This interface will contribute towards increasing predictability in public borrowing
by providing the Ministry of Finance with real-time information on cash balances in
government accounts at the CBG. Third, the internal audit function has been re-
established at the Ministry of Finance thanks to the stronger accounting environment
resulting from the operations of the IFMIS.  More recently, letters were issued
appointing the Internal Audit Committee members and their work would seek to
ensure: (i) conformity of budget management to the Government's strategy; (ii)
effectiveness and efficiency of government operations; (iii) reliability of financial
reporting; and (iv) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Fourth, the
- 42 -


﻿government has authorized the publication of the IFMIS reports on the website of the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, encouraging greater transparency and
efficiency by allowing the public to monitor the use of public resources.
7.    Looking forward the Government plans actions on two important fronts, namely
to strengthen procurement and to add in the foreseeable future several new
functionalities to the IFMIS. The strengthening of procurement will be realized through
the planned revision of the 2004 Gambia Public Procurement Act to separate the
regulatory and policy functions of the Gambia Public Procurement Authority and
through the closer alignment of the procurement plans of line ministries and the
budget's annual Appropriation Act. The new IFMIS functionalities will include: (i)
establishing and making operational the interface between the IFMIS and the
Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording Management System (CSDRMS); (ii)
completing the transition of the IFMIS to EPICOR 9 (the web-based IFMIS); and (iii)
incorporating self accounting projects with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs,
and with the Ministry of Information and Communication Infrastructure, into the IFMIS.
These new functionalities will achieve several important objectives, such as: (i)
strengthen the country's debt management capacity; (ii) broadening the use of the
IFMIS by making it accessible to government offices outside of the Banjul perimeter;
and (iii) extending the reach of the IFMIS to projects that today account for a large
share of government expenditures, making it possible to have improved budget
reporting through the IFMIS. By increasing the coverage of the IFMIS to include self-
accounting projects, the Gambian government will achieve two important goals: (i)
broadening its within-year reporting of government expenditure; and (ii) improving
overall government cash management.
8.   The following sources of economic growth are identified in the PAGE: (i)
agriculture and natural resources; (ii) tourism; (iii) telecommunications; and (iv)
improvements in the business environment, such as reducing the cost of production
(such as electricity and telecommunications), improving access to finance, ensuring
access to land, reducing and simplifying tax systems, and facilitating business
registration. Actions to support the several sources of growth and ensure sound
macroeconomic policies are important because as global market conditions change the
challenges to domestic macroeconomic management are bound to increase and this will
make promoting macroeconomic stability and growth even more important. A more
concrete action already taken was the establishment of the Tax Tribunal that seeks to
provide an appropriate channel for tax payer to object to his/her tax liability if s/he is
not in agreement with the tax assessed and believes that the tax and penalty (in case
of late payment) needs to be reviewed.
9.   The development of agriculture is central to implementing the objectives of the
PAGE. The goal for the agriculture sector in the PAGE is to transform the country into a
supplier of agricultural products to local and international markets. To achieve this
goal, the agricultural sector would be transformed from traditional, subsistence farming
- 43 -


﻿into a modern, market-oriented, commercial sector. To realize this objective, the
government's actions are centered on two fronts. First, the government intends to
gradually increase public investments in the sector from 3 percent of overall
expenditures in 2009 to 6 percent in 2012 and at least 10 percent by the end of the
PAGE period. These additional expenditures would center on irrigation, quality inputs,
extension services, post harvest management and marketing. Second, the government
will seek to encourage the private sector's contribution in the delivery of quality inputs
and the provision of extension services, building on the successful partnership it has
had with the Agribusiness Services and Producers Association (ASPA) in the groundnut
sector.
Improving and Modernizing Infrastructure
10.  The objective of the second pillar of the PAGE is to enhance conditions for
economic growth through the provision of needed economic infrastructure, and the
promotion of productive sectors with large impacts on employment creation and
poverty reduction. The PAGE seeks to encourage the participation of the private sector
in new infrastructure investment, and to focus public investment in key growth sectors,
such as transport, energy and telecommunications. Specific PAGE proposals include the
following:
* Transport Infrastructure. The road construction, renewal and maintenance
program will focus specifically on access to rural and remote areas. The
government will invest and seek private sector participation in the
maintenance and rehabilitation in areas with poor access to the trunk road
network. Also, the government plans to put in place sustainable funding
sources and at operationalizing the road fund to effectively carry out the
required road construction works and other activities on the roads aimed at
promoting, its economic growth, efficiency, and accessibility objectives.
* Energy. The efforts of the government in the energy sector will focus on
four initiatives.  First, at raising the electrification rate by increasing
electricity generation, as well as by encouraging more efficient uses of
electricity, and by attracting, through appropriate and reasonable incentive
and facilitation processes, the private sector investment in the sector.
Second, at promoting the use of renewable energy resources, such as wind
and solar for electricity generation, particularly in the rural areas. The goal
is to support fuel switching from fossil to renewable and thus reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases.  Third, at enhancing the operational
efficiency of the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) through
the reduction of public sector arrears to NAWEC, timely reviews of tariffs,
updating, monitoring and implementing the regulations governing electricity
production and distribution. Fourth, at upgrading and replacing the aging
transmission and distribution infrastructure to reduce the electricity losses.
- 44 -


﻿* Telecommunications. The activities of the Government will focus on: (i)
providing high-capacity and reliable bandwidth the operationalization of the
Gambia Submarine Cable Company, (ii) modernizing, expanding and
ensuring open access to the national telecommunication backbone
infrastructure, and (iii) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework
for the ICT sector (e.g., PURA Act 2001, IC Act 2009).
Strengthening Human Capital Stock and Enhancing Access to Social Services
11.   The PAGE highlights how investing in human capital stock is a priority in the
national government's development agenda.  This priority is reflected in recent
achievements, such as the rise in school enrollment where Gross Enrollment Rate (GER)
at the lower-basic level reached almost 90 percent in the academic year 2009/10, up
from around 70 percent in 2005/06. This expansion in school enrollment has been
matched by continuously high primary completion rates (reaching 75 percent), a low
average repetition rate (less than 5 percent), and improvements in school management.
In this context, the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education recently signed Service-
Level Agreements (SLAs) with its regional directorates and with the school-heads for
basic and secondary public schools that seeks to provide the basis for continuing to
monitor performance levels on both sides of the agreement.
12.   To sustain the progress achieved over the last few years in the provision of
education services, the PAGE outlines six proposals the Government intends to pursue.
The Government plans to (i) establish new schools where the school-aged population is
significantly high with a view to improve access to education where distance from
schools is an issue and, in doing so, increase the enrolment rate, especially in the
deprived regions; (ii) implement specific measures aimed at reducing gender inequality
and regional disparities, especially in upper levels of education; (iii) continue to provide
hardship allowances to teachers willing to serve in designated hardship areas; (iv)
strengthen the training of Gambian secondary teachers in Math and Sciences; (v)
continue to subsidize schools and the official Madarassa institutions that complement
the conventional schools on equal terms by providing quality inputs through school
grants or other delivery mechanisms; and (vi) eliminate all unauthorized levies to
strengthen equity in access to education and identify strategies to attract the last
percentage of children out of school into schools.
13.   The PAGE reports that health indicators have also improved, although infant and
maternal mortality rates at 81/1000 and 400/100,000 live births, respectively, remain
high. The PAGE acknowledges that improving health outcomes is contingent on the
ability of the government to provide adequate recurrent resources to the health
facilities, particularly for the recruitment and retention of health care professionals and
for purchasing of drugs. Therefore, the government intends to maintain its current
incentive programs for the placement of health care staff in rural areas.
- 45 -


﻿14.  To overcome problems in the delivery of health services, the PAGE outlines the
seven efforts to be implemented over the next four-year period aiming at increasing
accessibility and affordability of quality services at the point of demand, in particular for
women and children. These interventions include: (i) improvement of antenatal and
perinatal care; (ii) emergency obstetric care services; (iii) the provision of adequate and
safe blood transfusion services; (iv) maintaining the increase in immunization rates; (v)
promoting Insecticide Treated bed Nets (ITNs) utilization; (vi) the prevention and
control of HIV, tuberculosis, and other communicable and non-communicable diseases;
and (vii) the prevention and control of malnutrition.
15.  To implement these strategic interventions, the government efforts during the
implementation of the PAGE will be directed toward: (i) the preparation of adequately
trained health personnel and their retention; (ii) the improvement of health-related data
collection, analysis, planning, monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) modernization of
health infrastructure. These interventions are important because there has been
increased coverage of immunization and other basic health services, even though it
covers only an estimated 32 percent of communities. Also, the National Nutrition
Agency (NaNA) and a cross-sectoral national Nutrition Council are implementing the
National Nutrition Policy, including through community interventions based on nutrition
education and provision of care to malnourished children at health facilities. The
Primary Health Care program and the community nutrition program are complimentary
and go hand in hand. Coverage of the community nutrition program is still limited,
however, reaching approximately 16 percent of the population.     Also, the
implementation of the PAGE gives particular attention to efforts aimed at increasing the
coverage of basic health services to poorly served areas, including by: (i) expanding
nutrition service delivery and the revitalization of the Primary Health Care Program; and
(ii) ensuring that facilities are properly staffed and that drugs and equipment are
adequately supplied.
16.  The third and final heading under this third pillar of the PAGE outlines actions
aimed at increasing the population's access to safe drinking water with a view to reduce
their susceptibility to water-borne diseases. This is an area where The Gambia has
seen good progress. The proportion of the population with access to safe drinking
water increased to 87 percent in 2009 from 69 percent in 1990, exceeding the MDG
target of 84.5 percent by 2015.  Water supply depends on available electricity,
however, which creates problems for rural households, and rural health and education
facilities. To mobilize the needed resources to implement these interventions, the PAGE
outlines actions aimed at increasing the advocacy of this issue and at mobilizing
additional financial resources by strengthening the management of available financial
resources in the health sector, and by exploring other financing mechanisms such as,
for example, the possibility of introducing a national health insurance scheme. Finally,
donor funding will be streamlined through a coordinated system using a Sector-Wide
Approach (SWAp).
- 46 -


﻿Improving Governance and Fighting Corruption
17.   The Government's effort to improve governance, as outlined in the PAGE,
focuses on five areas: (i) strengthening the governance of public services -- a
centrepiece of the government's strategy to boost economic performance; (ii) improving
the business sector environment; (iii) increasing employment; (iv) eradicating poverty;
and (v) reducing corruption. Effective public institutions and efficient service delivery
are seen as vital for the achievement of these goals. The government has implemented
several reforms to improve public services recently, and will address the remaining
reforms during the PAGE implementation period.
18.   Specific reforms being considered under this pillar include the implementation of
a comprehensive Civil Service Reform Strategy 2012-15, which seeks to attract and
retain qualified staff in the public sector by reforming public sector pay, pensions, job
descriptions, and carrying out human resource management reforms. Also, the PAGE
outlines civil service reforms that would strengthen the capacity within ministries and
introduce results-based management aiming at improving service delivery. Finally,
attention would be given to capacity and service delivery at the decentralized level of
government.
19.   Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms delineated in the PAGE include:
introducing a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and a Program Based
Budgeting (PBB) system, as well as building on the achievements of the recently
established  Integrated  Financial Management  Information  System  (IFMIS).
Furthermore, six other priority issues are identified in the PAGE such as: (i) broadening
budget coverage and documentation; (ii) consolidating aid coordination and addressing
government's debt position; (iii) timely preparation and submission of government
financial statements for auditing, and submitting the audited reports and their
recommendations to the Finance and Public Accounts Committee (FPAC) of the National
Assembly; (iv) increasing the capacity of the Financial Public Accounts Committee of the
National Assembly to effectively scrutinize the government's budget and government
financial statements; (v) improving the capacity in public procurement; and (vi) rolling
out internal audit functions to all MDAs.
Reinforcing Social Cohesion and Cross-cutting Interventions
20.   The fifth pillar of the PAGE emphasizes the importance of creating jobs, pursuing
equity, reducing regional disparities, and paying attention to environmental
sustainability and to climate change. Interventions aimed at improving food security
capture the cross-cutting nature of the actions envisioned under this pillar, although
most of the focus is placed on increasing agricultural production rather than nutrition
security. As a result, actions aimed at attaining food security range from building
farmers' capacity to adopt best agricultural practices in environmentally sustainable
farming to providing farmers with adequate storage facilities and assisting in
- 47 -


﻿maintaining soil fertility and conserving the soil. Boosting agricultural productivity alone
does little to protect the population from staving off nutritional deficiencies and
malnutrition, however. Attention to this issue is important because the Government
intends to use nutrition indicators in the surveillance of food security. Achieving the
objectives envisioned under the PAGE requires a broader range of actions therefore,
ranging from reforming the land tenure system so that women can have equal access
to farmland to efforts aimed at reducing individual and household risk to food insecurity
and malnutrition.
21.   While the PAGE places emphasis on climate change, with a focus on adaptation
to climate change, it also outlines a biodiversity agenda for the country. Because of the
time lag between causes and effects within global climate systems, the adverse impacts
of environmental degradation are likely to persist for decades and generations, even
after the global community succeeds in limiting greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere. At the same time, conditions specific to The Gambia make it particularly
imperative that the government factor climate change into its development policies and
programmes. Recognising this, the Government of The Gambia developed a National
Adaptation Programme of Action on climate change in 2007 to stimulate a critical re-
examination of the role of climate on societal and natural systems in the areas of
agriculture, fisheries, wildlife, energy, water resources, and forests and woodlands.
22.   The government's projects under the National Adaptation Programme of Action
will address urgent and significant climate change-related threats through actions that
(i) deliver immediate adaptation benefits, (ii) help build local and national adaptive
capacity, (iii) increase awareness, and (iv) build a foundation for maximising long-term
adaptation benefits.
23.  In the agriculture sector, the government will adopt and implement the following
strategies: (i) optimisation of the use of natural resources, (ii) the increase and
stabilisation of crop productivity, (iii) the stabilisation of the rural population, and (iv)
the management of rangeland and the preservation of eco-assets.
24.  Insofar as integrated energy planning in the energy sector is concerned, the
government's strategic decisions will pursue nine goals : (i) to reduce the pressure on
natural forests; (ii) to provide access to reliable technologies and better or cheaper
fuels; (iii) to limit damages to infrastructure; (iv) to improve energy efficiency, disaster
planning, and the management of water resources; (v) to raise public awareness; (vi)
to restore biodiversity and the health of ecosystems; (vii) to develop a less polluting
public transport system; (viii) to promote clean technology; and (ix) to minimise the
impact of flooding and saline intrusion in lowlands.
25.  In other key sectors, the government will seek out sources of alternative and
renewable energy (solar and liquefied petroleum gas) and technological innovation and
diffusion. It will promote and strengthen integrated coastal zone management, e.g., by
- 48 -


﻿boosting the adaptive capacity of coastal communities and by encouraging the optimal
use of marine resources.
26.   Although small in size, The Gambia harbors a wealth of terrestrial, coastal,
marine and wetland habitats, as well as species of local, national, regional and global
significance. The coastal and marine environment is defined in the Gambian context as
not only those areas that border the Atlantic but similarly for those with brackish water
that border the River Gambia, extending 200km inland. Coastal and marine areas are
nevertheless under increasing pressure. A large proportion of the country's population
resides in coastal areas and depends upon them for their livelihoods. Population
growth and in-migration as a result of disrupted rainfall patterns and land degradation
in the hinterland translates into growing pressure on coastal and marine resources.
Biodiversity and climate change are two dimensions of the same agenda, and it is
imperative to have complementary environmental activities to address both the
country's adaptation needs while reinforcing the biodiversity conservation agenda.
Conclusion
27.   The government is committed to implementing the programs and policies
outlined in our Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE), particularly
those summarized in the policy matrix supported by this Economic Governance Reform
Grant. While the government will necessarily use some of its own resources to
implement the PAGE, substantial additional resources will be required, especially in light
of the recent adverse developments resulting from the 2011-2012 crop failure.
Continued support from our development partners is critical at this time, and I hope
that IDA will provide the requested grant.
Yours Sincerely,
Hon. Abdou Kolley
Minister

﻿Annex 6: IMF Public Information Note
On January 18, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with The Gambia.1
Background
The Gambian economy has performed well in recent years, despite challenging global
conditions. Real GDP growth averaged around 61 percent a year during 2008-2010, driven
mainly by a strong expansion in agriculture. Tourism and remittances, however, were hit
hard by the global economic crisis. In 2011, although there were signs that tourism was
recovering, real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen slightly to 51 percent, because of
poor weather conditions adversely affecting agriculture in some areas of the country.
Inflation ranged between 21 and 7 percent (year-on-year) in recent years, as the Central
Bank of The Gambia (CBG) generally maintained a restrained monetary stance. At times,
this required extensive mopping up of liquidity generated by central bank financing of
fiscal deficits. In recent months, inflation has fallen below 5 percent, aided by an improved
fiscal performance.
The government's fiscal deficit widened substantially during 2007-2010, resulting in a
sharp increase in domestic debt. The deterioration of the fiscal balance was caused by a
steady decline in government revenues and episodes of large spending overruns. Extra-
budgetary expenditures, including realized contingent liabilities, were major factors behind
the surge in government spending, particularly in 2009 and 2010.
The Gambia continues to face a heavy debt burden. As of the end of 2010, domestic debt
had risen to almost 30 percent of GDP. Correspondingly, interest on domestic debt has
consumed an increasing share of government revenues (18 percent in 2011). Moreover,
most domestic debt consists of short-term Treasury bills, which poses substantial rollover
risks. Despite a large reduction in external debt under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in December 2007,
external debt indicators suggest that The Gambia is still at high risk of debt distress.
Domestic debt stabilized in 2011, as the fiscal deficit narrowed substantially. Although
government revenues continued to fall (to about 14 percent of GDP)-mainly due to lost
revenues from fuel taxes-the government applied a strict cash-budgeting framework to
control spending. This has contributed to a reduction in T-bill yields in recent months,
which could generate fiscal savings going forward.

﻿The banking system in The Gambia has expanded at a rapid pace since 2007, with the
number of banks nearly doubling (to 13). This contributed to a rapid expansion of much
needed financial services. It also strained the CBG's resources for banking supervision.
While banks are generally well capitalized and liquid, competition in a relatively small
market has increased risks. Credit quality and profitability weakened in 2009-2010, and
high loan concentration is a concern. Similarly, several banks are vulnerable to liquidity
risks from exposure to large depositors. In 2011, financial indicators have strengthened
under the CBG's intensive supervision.
The Gambia's external current account deficit has widened in recent years, due to weak
tourism receipts and remittances and high global commodity prices. In 2011, strong exports
of groundnuts early in the year combined with an upswing in tourism in the fourth quarter
to narrow the deficit, despite a surge in the cost of fuel imports. Official international
reserves have remained at a comfortable level at over 5 months of imports.
The Gambia has made significant progress in implementing structural reforms, particularly
in the areas of public financial management, debt management, and financial sector
development. Good progress has also been achieved toward meeting several of the
Millennium Development Goals, most notably in health and education. However, poverty is
still widespread.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for making progress in poverty reduction
and achieving strong growth and low inflation despite a difficult global environment.
Looking ahead, Directors observed that although the outlook for the economy is generally
positive, there are a number of risks, particularly the high cost and rollover risks of
domestic debt.
Directors welcomed the improved fiscal performance and supported the government's plans
for additional fiscal consolidation in the period ahead. They agreed that further fiscal
adjustment aimed at curbing domestic borrowing is appropriate. Directors considered that
comprehensive tax reforms, including an early introduction of the VAT and additional steps
to increase tax compliance, are essential to rebuild government revenues. In particular,
strengthening revenue administration and phasing out fuel subsidies would bolster the
credibility of the authorities' fiscal plans for the medium term. Simplicity, broad coverage,
and low tax rates would also help to improve the business environment.
Directors agreed that monetary policymaking should remain focused on safeguarding price
stability. To this end, they encouraged the central bank to develop liquidity management
instruments that would enhance the efficiency of the money market and reduce
58


﻿intermediation costs. Directors also encouraged the authorities to maintain exchange rate
flexibility, as well as the import coverage of international reserves.
Directors observed that the banking system is well capitalized and liquid. Noting however a
still elevated non-performing loans ratio and other vulnerabilities in the banking sector,
they welcomed the authorities' intention to reinforce their oversight of the financial sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities' new poverty reduction strategy, the Programme for
Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE). They emphasized, however, that the
financing strategy should safeguard debt sustainability. Directors agreed that greater private
sector participation in infrastructure projects could help achieve PAGE objectives, but
success hinges on effective policy frameworks and institutions.
