1.            Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.      As initially designed, the First Economic Governance Reform Grant (EGRG-I) was the first
of a programmatic series of two budget support operations. However, due to delays tied to an
inadequate macroeconomic policy framework and challenges in achieving the prior actions, the series
lapsed. The EGRG-I was approved on May 31, 2012, became effective on July 6, 2012, disbursed fully in
one tranche on August 6, 2012, and was closed on June 30, 2013. This ICRR covers the implementation of
EGRG-I policies and progress on outcome targets set for end-2012.
2.      Since EGRG-I was approved in May 2012, the implementation, supervision and tracking of
output indicators for EGRG-I were carried out with the preparation of the EGRG-II operation. The
EGRG-supported reforms were an integral part of the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper – the
Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE) covering the years CY2012-15.
1.1           Context at Appraisal
3.      The EGRG-I was appraised in April 2012, against the backdrop of two major events in The
Gambia. First, the Gambian economy was hit hard by the 2011/2012 crop failure that significantly reduced
agricultural production and led to falling agricultural incomes and rising poverty. Second, the Presidential
and parliamentary elections that were held in late-2011 and early-2012, respectively, also adversely affected
macroeconomic policies. Taken together, these developments made it particularly challenging for the
Government to implement reforms in a timely manner.
Economic Situation
4.       After growing by 6 percent during the 2007-2010 period, real GDP growth was estimated to
have sharply decelerated in 2011 and projected to contract in 2012 because of the 2011-2012 crop
failure. Prior to the crop failure, strong agricultural and tourism activity more than compensated for a
declining re-export business, as neighboring countries upgraded their transport infrastructure and given the
convergence of trade and tax policies across the ECOWAS countries, including The Gambia1. It was
estimated that the crop failure, due to the severe Sahelian drought, reduced crop production by 60 percent
and contribution of agriculture to real GDP growth in 2011 by about 25 percent. Agriculture accounted for
approximately one-third of GDP, around 10 percent of overall exports, and more than 60 percent of
employment. The second-round effects on growth came from reduced groundnut exports, and the need for
additional food imports.
5.       Despite the decline in GDP growth, along with a fall-off in transit trade, and a corresponding
decline in tax receipts, fiscal discipline was assessed as having been largely maintained. Taxes imposed
on re-exports accounted for around 25 percent of overall tax revenues, while, additionally in the run-up to
Presidential elections, increases in tax exemptions2 and delayed adjustments of gasoline prices in line with
rising world market prices eroded an already low tax base. At the time of appraisal, the 2011 gross fiscal
deficit was reduced from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to an estimated 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011. The
primary deficit3 was also reduced to an estimated 1.0 percent of GDP in 2011, which still led to an estimated
increase in total public debt to above 71 percent of GDP in 2011. Aligning expenditures with revenue
inflows (i.e. cash budgeting) helped contain the Government’s net domestic borrowing, cleared its overdraft
with the central bank, and was believed to mark an end to the central bank financing of the public deficit.

6.      Greater fiscal and monetary discipline contributed to lowering consumer price inflation in
2011. While the official inflation numbers at the time of appraisal (April 2012) suggested the CPI had
remained below 4.5 percent, as in 2011, official statistics were assessed as inaccurately capturing the impact
of higher food prices resulting from the crop failure, which likely led to inflation underestimation4.
7.       Despite the 2011/2012 crop failure, terms of trade gains and strong tourism exports
contributed to narrowing the current account deficit in 2011 (Table 1). There was a strong recovery in
the tourism sector and good performance of domestic exports, due notably to the rise in groundnut prices
in international markets. A real depreciation of the Gambian dalasi against the US dollar by 5.7 percent in
2011 contributed to improved competitiveness as well. However, exchange rate stability remained an
important stability anchor as food imports accounted for around half of the country’s consumption needs,
and crude oil, which represented the country’s main energy source, equaled 10 percent of overall imports.
Subsequently, measures had been taken to control the exchange rate stability in early 2012.

8.      Although the poverty headcount index declined between 2003 and 2010, the crop failure
raised the vulnerabilities of households, particularly for female-headed households. While the
estimated poverty rate for female-headed households at 38 percent was significantly lower than the 51
percent for male-headed households (according to the 2010 Integrated Household Survey), due to their
employment in sectors such as education, health and retail trade, female workers represented 60 percent of
those employed in rural areas and were thus more affected by the crop failure.
9.      At appraisal, while the economy was projected to contract and record higher inflation, due
to the external shock, given the Government’s adjustment efforts, the overall macroeconomic
framework was assessed as adequate. The economy was projected to contract by 1.7 percent in 2012 due
to the crop failure with inflation rising towards 5 percent. An emergency food and seed imports was
launched to meet immediate consumer demand and to protect the next planting season.5 Economic growth

returns. However, the pre-election policy slippages and the weather-shock impacts on growth and fiscal
policy led the Government to negotiate a new IMF-supported program that was to be presented to the Board
on May 25, 2012. The Fund program was focused on enhancing country’s fiscal discipline6 and achieving
primary surplus already in 2013.
10.      Prudent fiscal management was emphasized, given a high and rising public debt to GDP
ratio, rapidly growing short-term domestic debt, and limited fiscal space to support the
Government’s ambitious development objectives. Total public debt was estimated to have breached 71
percent of GDP at end-2011, reflecting the combination of a fast-growing domestic public debt (29 percent
of GDP), and slow-growing, mostly concessional external public debt (42 percent). While the real yield on
total public debt is relatively low (less than 5 percent), the real yield on the domestic public debt was close
to 9 percent. Given the debt dynamics, total public debt was projected to increase to 77 percent of GDP
before stabilizing and then falling in 2013 to a projected 71 percent and then further to 66 percent in 2014.7
The interest payments for domestic debt accounted for almost one-fifth of fiscal revenues. The average
Treasury bill rate (with longest dated maturities of 365 days) was relatively high at 11 percent (6 percent in
real terms). There was little refinancing risk arising from foreign currency debt, but a significant domestic
debt refinancing exposure and a rising interest rate risks.8 The joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA) conducted in 2011 indicated that The Gambia still faced a high risk of debt distress, as the
present value of external debt to exports breached its threshold over a protracted period, while other
indicators remained vulnerable to adverse shocks. The moderately high level of foreign exchange reserves
seemed to be prudent, given the refinancing concerns.
The Political Situation
11.    At the time of appraisal, the country continued to maintain a stable political system. President
Jammeh was reelected to a fourth five-year term in November 2011 with a reported 72 percent of the vote.
Parliamentary elections were held in March 2012, where the President’s party (the Alliance for Patriotic
Reorientation and Construction) won the majority in the National Assembly (Parliament).
The Government’s Response
12.     In the run up to appraisal, during late-2011 and early-2012, the Government was struggling
with a shrinking economy due to crop failure, and the fiscal impact of policies ahead of elections. On
March 7, 2012, the Government of The Gambia announced the 2011-12 crop failure, and requested an
estimated US$23 million for seeds, fertilizers, and food aid. By the time of appraisal, donors had responded
by pledging around US$14.5 million. The EGRG-I aimed to fill in the remaining financing gap. It was
believed that after the weather-inflicted shock, the country would shift its focus to the medium-term
development strategy.
13.            In December 2011, the Gambian Authorities launched the Programme for Accelerated
Growth and Employment (PAGE) for 2012-159—the new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper prepared
by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs through a broad participatory and consultative process.10
The PAGE is organized around five pillars: (i) accelerating and sustaining economic growth; (ii) improving
and modernising infrastructure; (iii) strengthening human capital stock to enhance employment

  The ECF program included additional initiatives to maintain and enhance the country’s current fiscal discipline like
the full-implementation of the fuel pricing formula in 2012, the introduction of the VAT in 2013, setting the limits on
how tax exemptions are awarded, and strengthening tax administration.
7
  Assuming completion of the EGRG series, and of the complementary AfDB budget support, and IMF ECF program.
8
  The average time to maturity of the external debt is 14.5 years, whereas the average time to maturity of the stock of
domestic debt is less than one year.
9
  Given delays with implementation, the Government extended the PAGE through 2016.
10
   This was the third PRSP. Previous five-year programs were presented to the Boards of IDA and the IMF in
April 2002 and 2007.

opportunities; (iv) improving governance and fighting corruption; and (v) reinforcing social cohesion. The
PAGE represents a comprehensive medium-term development strategy, which still faces the challenges of
the constrained resource envelope, requiring further prioritization, more efficient mobilization and
management of external aid and private sector participation, as well as more stable pool of senior civil
servants to ensure operational continuity.
14.     The EGRG-I was broadly designed in accordance with the Policy Matrix prepared by the
Government, and that sequentially outlines priority PAGE reform measures. The PAGE Policy Matrix
has quantitative and qualitative outcome indicators set for the 2012-15 period, and has benefited from broad
consultations with key stakeholders, including civil society, private sector and other development partners
to identify the appropriate complementary reform measures through investment projects and analytical
exercises.
IDA’s Response
15.     The EGRG-I was consistent with the Africa Strategy, and was aligned with the IDA and AfDB
Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) FY2012-15. The operation would account for 10 percent of the JAS’
proposed resource envelope, while all preconditions for another budget support operation—in terms of the
country’s economic policy and institutional environment and its capacity to carry out its reform program—
were considered met. The PAGE delineated a coherent country policy program, including an adequate
macroeconomic framework with a new IMF-supported Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program, greater
debt sustainability, reasonable dissemination of the Government’s budget information, and an improving
governance and institutional framework, particularly with respect to public financial management.
16.     More importantly, the EGRG series was aligned with the country’s Programme for
Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE) for 2012-15, and had mobilized other development
partners’ support. The operation itself supported a subset of reforms in the Government’s Policy Matrix
in 2012, in particular Pillars I (accelerating and sustaining economic growth), Pillar III (strengthening
human capital stock and enhancing access to social services), and Pillar V (reinforcing social cohesion and
cross-cutting interventions). The AfDB also provided a budget support policy grant, which was focused
exclusively on PFM issues, while IDA, through the EGRG series, retained a broad-based policy matrix,
encompassing both core PFM and sector specific issues. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed to
formalize the coordination arrangements around the development community’s aid effectiveness agenda.
17.       Ongoing investment projects and strong analytical underpinnings complemented the EGRG
development policy operation series. There were four investment projects that complemented the EGRG-
I: (i) the 2010 Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) project; (ii) the 2010 Gambia
Growth and Competitiveness project; (iii) the 2010 West Africa Agriculture Productivity project; and (iv)
the 2010 West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program APL (WARCIP APL 2). These
operations had supported institutional reforms and investments in public financial management,
management of the agriculture, education, energy and telecommunications sectors. The analytical
underpinnings for the EGRG series rested on the large body of reports and technical notes, on which IDA
has actively collaborated with the Government and other development partners. They span from poverty
analysis, country financial accountability assessments, PERs, technical notes on civil service performance,
pension policy reform, public sector pay and employment, youth employment, gender (AfDB), revenue
authority enhancement, budgetary management and VAT (IMF), energy, telecommunications and
agriculture.
The EGRG Series
18.     The Bank’s EGRG series was conceived in response to the Government’s request to support
the ongoing reform effort, as outlined in the PAGE 2012-15, to address the economic slowdown and
the resulting fiscal vulnerabilities. At appraisal for EGRG-I, at the Government’s request, Bank’s
intervention was conceived as a two-operation programmatic series – EGRG-I and EGRG-II. A two-


                                                     4




operation series was considered appropriate because the reforms being implemented were medium-term in
nature. The two-phase reform program outlined in the first, but implemented over two operations, would
provide the task team a framework to engage in a policy dialogue with the Government, after the first
operation was presented to the Board and the Government was implementing the next phase of the reforms.
The EGRG-I was presented to the Board in May 2012, and the AfDB’s complementary budget support
operation was delivered later in the same calendar year 2012. However, the EU withdrew its budget support
operation following a breakdown in the political dialogue11. The EGRG-II operation was expected to be
presented to the Board in mid-2013 and to be followed by another AfDB operation. In retrospect, the
anticipated timing of the EGRG-II proved optimistic. As discussed in detail in Section 2.4, many of the key
reforms identified for EGRG-II were delayed, and the macroeconomic policy framework repeatedly faltered
and was periodically deemed inadequate for the budget support operation to proceed.12 Consequently, due
to the delays, the two-operation-programmatic series lapsed in May 2014, which triggered the requirement
for the preparation of this Implementation Completion and Results report for EGRG-I, and at which time it
was decided to continue processing EGRG-II as a stand-alone operation.
19.     The financing provided by the two operations, EGRG-I and EGRG-II, of about US$6 and
US$5 million, respectively, should have helped ease the public financing needs. Financing provided by
EGRG-I (US$6 million), amounted to around 38 percent of the external debt amortization needs of the
economy in 2012 or around 11 percent of the overall borrowing needs13. The Government thus saw the real
value of the operation, not just in terms of the financing, but in the donor coordination, analysis and policy
advice around the PAGE implementation that came with it. Moreover, the Government also saw the IDA’s
operation as a stamp of approval for The Gambia’s structural policies, when it presented its reform efforts
to the IMF, AfDB and EU. To some extent this explains the very active engagement with the Government
between the two operations described in Section 2.2.
Relationship with the IMF and other Development Partners
20.      During the formulation and implementation of EGRG-I, The Gambia was in the process of
negotiation of a new IMF-supported Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program that was then under
supervision and implementation during the preparation of EGRG-II14. The IDA team closely
collaborated with the IMF on macroeconomic policies and in the preparation of the DSA’s during these
years. The IMF was consulted on the Policy Matrix for the EGRG series, making the ECF program and the
EGRG mutually coherent. Similarly, the European Commission worked in coordination with the IMF in
providing technical assistance in public financial management areas related to budget programming, the
establishment of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework, and the introduction of the Value Added Tax
(VAT), and with the Bank and the EU on public procurement reform.
1.2           Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
21.    At appraisal, there was broad consensus on the development objectives that The Gambia
needed to pursue. These were contained in the PAGE prepared by the Government, as well as the Policy
Matrix outlining the implementation steps and the results expected. Consistent with this consensus, the

   While the political dialogue broke down and resulted in the EU’s budget support being dropped, achievement of the
agreed policy reforms for the operation were well advanced.
12
   Ultimately, in May 2015, although all of the policy actions for EGRG-II were then finally met and cleared by the
Bank’s legal department and sectoral specialists at the start of the month, further processing (that entailed submission
to the Board) was placed on hold, because of the introduction of exchange rate controls that resulted in an inadequate
macroeconomic policy environment. The exchange controls included substantial overvaluation of the Gambian dalasi
and restrictions on transfers of hard currencies outside of the country.

   Deficit and debt amortization requirements.
14
   An IMF-supported ECF program was presented to its Board on May 25, 2012, and the First Review was completed
in May 2013. The ECF program went off track in September 2014, before the Second Review could be completed,
and the ECF then expired in early-2015.

                                                               5

original PDOs of the EGRG-I were to: (i) strengthen transparency, accountability and efficiency in public
financial management; (ii) improve public management in the agriculture, education, and energy sectors;
and (iii) promote competition in the telecommunications sector. These would be done by supporting prior
actions in the following four PAGE priority policy areas:
      x      Improving public financial management through reforms focused on increasing transparency and
             accountability.
      x      Strengthening accountability in the management of the education sector by having in place service-
             level agreements between the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education, its regional directorates
             and the head-teachers in public basic and secondary schools.
      x      Improve the financial situation of the energy sector by reducing payment arrears to the National
             Water and Electricity Corporation (NAWEC).
      x      Ensuring private sector participation in telecommunications by licensing the recently established
             Gambia Submarine Cable Company (GSCC).
22.          The specific policies to meet these PDOs were as follows:
Policy Area 1: Improving Transparency and Accountability in Public Financial Management
      i)         Enhancing transparency in the management of Government’s accounts, through the furnishing
                 of its financial statements for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010 to the National Audit Office
                 (NAO);
      ii)        Disseminating the monthly IFMIS fiscal reports, through the periodic publication of the
                 monthly IFMIS reports and the budget performance report on poverty on the MOFEA’s
                 website;
      iii)       Improving public financial management accountability, through the appointment of five judges
                 for the tax and customs tribunal, as required in the Income and Sales Tax Act and the Customs
                 and Excise Tax Act;
      iv)        Enhancing effectiveness in public spending, through the identification and interruption of
                 payments by the MOFEA to all civil servants not validated by the IFMIS payroll;
      v)         Strengthening its audit institution, through the approval by the MOFEA of the MOFEA’s
                 internal audit committee’s charter and the appointment of the members of the internal audit
                 committee;
      vi)        Strengthening budget management, through the establishment of a system of real time
                 reconciliation and clearance of accounts between the MOFEA and the Central Bank
                 establishing an IFMIS interface at the Central Bank.
Policy Area 2: Strengthening Energy Sector Management
      vii)       Government providing for a reduction of an amount of GMD228.6 million by March 31, 2012
                 in Public Sector Energy Arrears to the NAWEC.
Policy Area 3: Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Telecommunications Sector
      viii)      Adopting a strategy to enhance private participation in its telecommunication sector, through
                 the issuance by the MOICI of a license authorizing the operation within its territory of the
                 Gambia Submarine Cable Company (GSCC) Limited in order to improve the quality of the
                 telecommunications infrastructure by allowing connectivity with the Africa to Europe
                 submarine telecommunications cable.
Policy Area 4: Enhancing Education Sector Management


                                                         6




      ix)      Enhancing accountability in education services, through the execution of service-level
               agreements between the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education and 6 regional directives
               and at least 498 primary and secondary schools head-teachers to improve the overall
               performance of students at the basic and secondary levels.
1.3         Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
              NA. PDOs and indicators were not revised.

1.4         Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program
23.      The policy areas supported by the EGRG-I were grouped into four policy areas, as discussed
above. Each of these policy areas contained measures, which constituted prior actions for the EGRG-I as
per the legal documents as well as outcome indicators to measure progress of the reform program. Since
the EGRG-I was a one-tranche operation, from a strictly legal point of view, all prior actions were met
before the grant was submitted to the Board. Table 2 presents the summary of prior actions and the progress
on implementation of the policies. The impact of the measures implemented under the EGRG-I, and the
progress on outcome indicators is discussed in Section 3.2, on “achievement of program development
objectives”.

24.      The triggers that were identified in EGRG-I for the second and final operation in the series,
EGRG-II, were defined by the Government of The Gambia and IDA. Satisfactory progress on these
actions would lead to the preparation of the next operation in this series, assuming that the macroeconomic
policy framework was assessed as adequate. Due to delays in achieving reforms in the agricultural sector,
tied in part to the disruptions of the drought, agricultural sector policy reforms for the series were back-
loaded into the second operation. The triggers for EGRG-II are summarized in Table 3, below.

     Proposed triggers                        Rationale for the proposed EGRG-II triggers
1. Complete the transition in    The transition to a web-based IFMIS platform (EPICOR 9) provides the
IFMIS to EPICOR 9 (the           opportunity to broaden the use of the IFMIS by making it more user-
web-based IFMIS).               friendly and accessible to government offices outside of the Banjul
                                 perimeter. Ultimately, this transition to EPICOR-9 should lead to a more
                                 timely and reliable within year budget reporting.
2. Establish and then make     Debt service currently accounts for 20 to 25 percent of government
operational the interface      revenues, placing a premium on prudent and effective debt management
between the IFMIS and the      in The Gambia. To strengthen the country’s debt management capacity,

Software (CSDRMS).
3. Include self-accounting     Self-accounting projects are donor funded projects that require separate
projects with the Ministries   accounting reports. Combined they represent around 40 percent of
Finance and Economic           government expenditures in any given year, as well as a fair share of the
Affairs, as well as            idle-money in government accounts. The extension of the IFMIS to

Communication                  project to government accounts drawing from donor funds should be
Infrastructure in IFMIS.      possible, leading to improved reporting through the IFMIS – one that is
                               consistent with the commitment to greater reliance on country systems
                               established in the donor harmonization agreements reached Paris in 2005
                               and in Accra in 2008. The current disconnect between these projects
                               and the national budget process leads to unpredictable fluctuations in the
                               net domestic assets in government accounts at the Central Bank, creating
                               difficulties for liquidity management. By increasing the coverage of the
                               IFMIS to include self-accounting projects, the Gambian government will
                               achieve two goals: (i) broaden its within-year reporting of government
                               expenditure; and (ii) improve overall government cash management.
4. Submit a revised Gambia     At present, the GPPA has the responsibility for both ex-ante and ex-post
Public Procurement Act,        clearances of procurement documents, ensuring their conformity to the
separating the policy and      requirements of the legislation. These overlapping responsibilities
regulatory functions of The    create the potential for a conflict of interest, however. To realize this
Gambia Public Procurement      separation, the capacity of the Authority and Public Procurement
Authority (GPPA), to the       Organizations (PPOs) is currently being strengthened. Once some
National Assembly.             progress has been achieved in capacity building for the GPPA and the
                               PPOs, the government will revise and submit to the National Assembly
                               the amendments of the Gambia Public Procurement Act (GPPA)
                               formalizing this separation of responsibilities.
5. Sign a Memorandum of        Government-provided agricultural inputs meet only a part of the
Understanding between          country’s demand because there is little additional supply response from
Government and the             the private sector since the government supplies these inputs at below
Agribusiness Services and      market prices. The goal of this MoU would be to establish a framework
Producers Association          to integrate the agriculture inputs provided by government (seed,
(ASPA) aimed at increasing     fertilizers, etc.) into the domestic market, rather than have the
the scope for the private      government directly manage the sourcing and distribution of these inputs
sector to also deliver         to the private sector. Otherwise, private sector investment in the
agricultural inputs.           importation and distribution of agriculture inputs will continue to be
                               discouraged, perpetuating the country’s dependence on development aid.
                               This measure should also improve efficiency of input supply and free up

6. Adopt PURA regulations        The adjustment in electricity tariffs to levels closer to cost recovery is
regarding the adjustment of      the second stage in the process of rebalancing the finances of NAWEC –
electricity tariff to levels     the first one being the reduction in arrears achieved under the program
closer to cost recovery.         supported by the first of this budget support operation.
7. Adopt PURA regulation         Opportunities for competition in underdeveloped markets, such as The
for open access to the           Gambia, depend on three factors: the demand for new services, the
telecommunications               economies of scale and scope that emerge over time and the
backbone.                        technological innovations introduced. Competition is important because
                                 it allows consumers to enjoy more reliable and cheaper services, and for
                                 the economy to benefits from increased investment, job creation and
                                 export-led growth. Monopolistic behavior, in contrast, holds markets
                                 back, lowers investments, provides services at a higher cost, and places
                                 the entire economy in a competitive disadvantage. The three key
                                 competition issues facing the The Gambia telecommunications sector at
                                 the moment are: (i) the access to the cable, (ii) the control of the
                                 international gateway, and (iii) the connection to the national broadband
                                 backbone. The arrangement made under the WARCIP project ensures
                                 that the first two bottlenecks are removed. The proposed trigger for this
                                 second budget support operation aims at removing the third bottleneck.
8. Abolish informal fees         The 2012 budget proposal already allocated GMD 8.0 million to offset
charged at public primary        the end of these revenues derived by public primary schools from fees
schools.                         charged from parents of students. This trigger for the second budget
                                 support operation aims at ensuring that this policy action envisions in the
                                 2012 budget will be completed.
9. Expand programs               The 2012 budget proposal already allocated GMD 14 million for these
targeting the most vulnerable,   programs, which aims at reaching approximately 6,000 children, up from
such as Girls Scholarships       1,500 children in 2011. The inclusion of this trigger for the second
and Programs for Needy           budget support operation aims at ensuring that the budget plans will be
Boys.                            fulfilled.
2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1      Program Performance
25.     Most of the policy reforms initiated in the EGRG-I were implemented as intended, as
measured by the results indicators. In a few areas, however, the institutional reforms have not been fully
sustained beyond the EGRG-I horizon. These changes and the progress on achieving outcome indicators
are discussed in detail in Section 3.2.
2.2       Major Factors Affecting Implementation
26.     Since the EGRG-I was a single tranche operation based on prior actions, much of the
preparation work was carried out in 2011, prior to Board approval in May 2012. Implementation of
the operation thus involved working closely with the Government during 2011 and early 2012 to (a)
implement policy and institutional reforms initiated by the EGRG-I, and (b) define the specifics of the
second phase of reforms (i.e., triggers) that would constitute prior actions for EGRG-II. As discussed below,
the operational support through investment operations, effective donor coordination and the strong
analytical basis helped implementation of the operation.
x     IDA’s investment support. EGRG-I was well linked to key areas of the IDA’s engagement in The
      Gambia, such as (i) the 2010 Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) project,


                                                     11




       and the 2012 Additional Financing IFMIS; (ii) the 2010 Gambia Growth and Competitiveness project;
       (iii) the 2010 West Africa Agriculture Productivity project; (iv) the 2010 Additional Financing for the
       Third Education Project (Phase II); and (iv) the 2010 West Africa Regional Communications
       Infrastructure Program APL. These operations had supported institutional reforms and investments in
       public financial management, management of the agriculture, education, energy and
       telecommunications sectors.
x      Effective donor coordination. The Government’s limited institutional capacity to implement the
       reform agenda was mitigated by the consolidated reform program specified in PAGE 2012-15 around
       which support for capacity building was received through various other donor projects, including
       projects supported by the AfDB, EC, IMF, UNDP and the WFP. The joint assessment strategy
       arrangement by these partners also helped enhance efficiency in program delivery and implementation.
x      Good analytical basis. The fast preparation and implementation of EGRG-I was facilitated by the
       extensive analytical work. The Bank’s team provided inputs to the Government in formulating policies
       in financial accountability, public sector reform, revenue authority enhancement, budget management,
       energy, telecommunications and agriculture, while it also actively collaborated with other development
       partners.
27.     However, there were a number of exogenous and endogenous factors, which adversely
affected the progress towards reaching the outcome targets set in the EGRG-I:
x      The macroeconomic situation proved to be difficult (see the discussion in Section 3.2). A weather-
       induced shock in 2011 and the policy slippages tied to election commitments in November 2011 and
       2012, led to inadequacy of the macroeconomic framework for the budget operation, and to the initial
       delays in processing. Namely, increases in indirect tax exemptions and delayed adjustments of gasoline
       prices in line with rising world market prices eroded an already low tax base. However, post-elections,
       the Government took appropriate actions, and was able to reach agreement with the Bank on the EGRG
       series and with the IMF on an ECF program.15 The ECF also included additional initiatives to maintain
       and enhance the country’s fiscal discipline. However, after effectiveness of the EGRG-I, a number of
       endogenous and exogenous factors led to some reversals in reforms and deterioration in the
       macroeconomic policy framework. 
x      The Gambia suffered challenging exogenous shocks following effectiveness of EGRG-I that
       resulted in lower tax revenues and higher expenditures, straining fiscal balances. In particular, real
       GDP posted near zero growth in 2014, reflecting in part the outbreak of Ebola in neighboring countries
       that hit its tourism sector starting in 2014, and another poor harvest for the 2014/2015 crop year. These
       challenges, and the Government’s responses to them, contributed to the fiscal slippages in subsequent
       years.
x      Elections, recurrent policy slippages and reform inertia also contributed to the poor fiscal
       performance and weaker than expected growth outturns following approval of the EGRG series.
       The period before the EGRG-I appraisal was one of uncertainty. EGRG-I was presented to the Board
       in May 2012, six months after the Presidential elections and two months after the parliamentary
       elections. While the new Government indicated its full support of the reform effort delineated in the
       EGRG series, and committed to the PAGE reform implementation, reform inertia took hold in some
       areas, particularly related to macroeconomic policy reforms (fiscal and monetary) and reforms in some
       sectors (agriculture16, energy and telecommunications). While the continued engagement of the AfDB

  Presented to the IMF’s Board on May 25, 2012.

  The proposed agriculture policy reform was subject to support through the EGRG-II operation, and was aimed at
supporting increased private sector participation in the delivery of agricultural sector inputs.

                                                               12

      and IDA in the implementation of the Policy Matrix was meant to ensure continuity and build political
      commitment to reforms, the growth and policy challenges proved substantial.
2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
28.     Monitoring and Evaluation. Within the Government, the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Affairs was responsible for implementing the EGRG-I supported reforms and coordination among various
ministries and agencies. The Bank team, led by the TTL in Washington, and supported by the teams working
on the supporting investment operations, monitored and followed up on progress. This approach worked
well and there was adequate monitoring of reforms and less so on outcome indicators (see Section 5.1).
Since the series lapsed in May 2014, the implementation, supervision and tracking of output indicators for
EGRG-I were planned to be carried out with the preparation of the EGRG-II operation.
29.      Design. The EGRG-supported reforms were an integral part of the country’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper – the PAGE 2012-15, which enjoyed a strong country ownership since the monitoring and
coordinating entity was the same as for the EGRG-I—i.e. MOEFA. There is a joint Policy Matrix shared
by all the donors planning to provide budget support. Prior actions for donor disbursements are identified
in the Policy Matrix, thus allowing for aid coordination. Policy dialogues are conducted jointly and joint
appraisal missions to assess progress in implementing the Policy Matrix were undertaken. The results
framework for assessing EGRG-I outcomes, therefore, was a snapshot of the PAGE Policy Matrix. While
it served its purpose of ensuring adequate monitoring, in several cases, design of the outcome indicators
did not adequately capture the underlying policy effort by the Government: 
      x   In some cases, the link between the reform measure and the output indicator was very
          tenuous. For example, strengthening energy sector management depends on many factors outside
          the immediate influence of policies (or rather actions) supported by EGRG-I (i.e. reduction of
          public sector energy arrears). Clearly, the action supported by the EGRG-I did not lead to
          sustainable results raising the quality of the policy design.
      x   In the case of education sector, the policy action should have been formulated with the
          expected outcome suggested (i.e. the SLAs to be signed to improve the teaching quality and thus
          student performance).
      x   In many cases, the policy matrix did not specify quantitative targets for results that the
          operation can be judged against. Namely, the original target values were missing numerical
          targets, which rendered the evaluation of the operation’s achievements difficult.
      x   In some cases reforms affected a small segment of a medium-term objectives, which also set
          the result indicators as outputs rather than outcomes. For example, the Tax Tribunal
          establishment, or audit capacity strengthening have led to only marginal improvements of public
          financial management accountability and budget management strengthening, as there were parallel
          policies outside the EGRG-I that adversely affected both objectives as evident in fiscal policy
          deterioration post-EGRG-I. However, other reforms, such as the introduction of IFMIS, have led
          to meaningful improvements in PFM systems.
2.4       Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation
30.     As discussed in Section 1, the EGRG-I operation was designed as a programmatic two–
operation series. After the EGRG-I was presented to the Board, while the broad reform program stayed
unchanged, there were slippages on the macroeconomic front that prevented the continuation of the series.
Consequently, the two-operation-programmatic series was discontinued and EGRG-II is currently on hold.
It was scheduled for Board presentation as a stand-alone operation in May 2015; however, the
macroeconomic policy framework deteriorated with a significantly overvalued exchange rate, so processing
of the DPO was put on hold although all prior actions had been met. The EGRG-II builds upon reforms in
EGRG-I, providing continuity for these critical areas of reform in public financial management, electricity,

                                                     13




telecommunications and education. In fact, while the series lapsed, the prior actions that were originally
envisioned (triggers identified in the first operation), are being met, or have even been strengthened (like
in the critical sector of energy and agriculture), despite the delay in achievement with some of them.
3.            Assessment of Outcomes
3.1           Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory
31.      Relevance: There was a consensus within the Government, as well as among The Gambia’s main
external stakeholders (IMF, AfDB), that the objectives of the EGRG-I were relevant. These objectives are;
to strengthen transparency, accountability and efficiency in public financial management, to improve public
management in the agriculture, education, and energy sectors, and to promote competition in the
telecommunications sector. As stated earlier, the operation has supported the Government reform program
PAGE. The AfDB prepared a budget support policy grant in parallel with the EGRG-I operation,
complementing the reforms supported by the EGRG-I. The subsequent economic developments in 2013-
14 exposed Gambia’s fiscal and macro vulnerability and further reinforced the relevance of the objectives.
An assessment of the design and implementation is given in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.
3.2           Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Rating: Unsatisfactory
32.      Macroeconomic Growth and Policy Framework. Maintaining a sustainable macroeconomic
framework was a precondition for the successful implementation of EGRG-I. Macroeconomic
developments during preparation in 2011 and delivery to the Board in May 2012 show that in retrospect,
Bank staff and their Government counterparts were optimistic in their assessment of (a) the growth
prospects for the Gambian economy, and (b) the Government’s commitment to macroeconomic policy
reforms, aside from having (c) underestimated the persistence of challenging governance issues. With
respect to growth outturns, at appraisal, staff assessed a relatively modest GDP growth slowdown in 2011
(to 3.3 percent from 6.1 percent in 2010) and projected a recession in 2012 (1.7 percent contraction), due
to the 2011/2012 crop-year failure, before posting a projected vibrant recovery in 2013 and 2014 (with
growth projected at 9.7 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively). The actual outturn (Table 4) shows that the
country was in a deep recession already in 2011 (the economy declined by 4.3 percent), and that the earlier
than projected rebound posted in 2012 and 2013 proved much weaker than anticipated (5.6 percent and 4.8
percent, respectively). Notably, the weaker than anticipated outcomes also reflect revisions in national
account reporting that the Government introduced in late-201217.
33.      The fiscal outturns were encouraging in 2011-12. Despite recessionary developments, and pre-
election policy slippages, the fiscal deficit was on declining path over the 2011-2012 period, reaching 4.4
percent of GDP, much improved compared to earlier estimates at the time of appraisal. The IMF-supported
ECF program was negotiated in May 2012, and had helped to reverse the expected fiscal deterioration. In
fact, by 2012, the Government was close to achieving the targeted primary balance and had managed to
stem further public debt growth that stayed at 77 percent of GDP by end-2012.
34.      External imbalances improved as well in 2012. The current account deficit declined to below 8
percent of GDP, with both exports of goods and services contributing to a marked improvement.
International reserves reached the equivalent of 5.9 months of import-cover, supported by a prudent
monetary policy that prevented further deficit financing. Interest rates on Government T-bills had declined
to an average of just below 10 percent, signaling improved investor confidence in the Government’s macro-

  The Authorities decided to capture the sharp contraction in the agricultural sector due to the failure of the 2011-
2012 harvest in the calendar year of 2011—instead of spreading it across the calendar years of 2011 and 2012 as in
the past.

introduced for the balance of payments, after EGRG-I became effective.18

35.       However, fiscal policy slippages, compounded by external shocks in 2014, placed the economy
back into recession and close to a balance of payments crisis. Real GDP growth is estimated to have
contracted by 0.5 percent in 201419 from an expansion of 4.8 percent in 2013, tied to the sub-regional Ebola
outbreak that affected tourism20, and the drag of cumulative policy mismanagement--including pronounced
fiscal slippage, ad hoc monetary policy shifts and central bank financing of the deficit. In 2013-14, the fiscal
deficit expanded sharply—doubling in 2013 compared to 2012 and then tripled in 2014 (with the deficit
expanding from 4.5 percent as a share of GDP to 8.8 percent and 14 percent, respectively). These deficits
stemmed in large part from large quasi-fiscal and unbudgeted spending, including to the National Water
and Electricity Company (NAWEC) and other state-owned enterprises, and most recently revenue losses
and spending impacts tied to the Ebola shock on tourism and to a lesser extent the negative impact of the
2014-2015 poor crop year and agricultural sector losses. Cash budgeting and the VAT introduction could
not offset the mounting fiscal pressures, including those created by extra-budgetary spending21. As a
consequence, public debt expanded to 101 percent of GDP as of end-2014 from 77 percent in 2012, and
high-cost, short-term domestic debt expanded to47 percent as share of GDP from 33 percent in 2012. The
interest burden expanded sharply as a consequence, due to the high rollover rate on domestically held
Government debt and the deterioration in confidence that was reflected in higher Government borrowing
interest rates. Hence, debt servicing costs increased rapidly as debt was rolled over and new debt secured.
36.     Slippages on monetary policy emerged as well, with the ad-hoc introduction of exchange rate
controls from late-2012 through early-2015, and contributed to heightened policy uncertainty, and

   These changes reflected the Government and the IMF harmonized their BOP reporting.
19
   As reported by MoFEA (September 3, 2015).
20
   A decline in tourist arrivals was estimated at 60 percent.
21
   Notably, the introduction of the VAT in January 2013 supported a significant increase in revenue collection, along
with other tax reforms, evidenced by an increase in tax revenues from 14.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 16.1 percent in
2014.

                                                                                        15

economic and financial disruptions. These controls significantly overvalued the Gambian dalasi against
the US-dollar, and at times included shipment controls, and resulted in significant economic and financial
distortions. Since the EGRG-I went to the Board in May 2012, the authorities introduced exchange rate
controls five times and lifted them four times. These were in place during October-November 2012 (with
the dalasi about 20 percent overvalued against the US-dollar), June-July 2013 (about 20 percent
overvalued), July-August 2013 (about 10 percent overvalued), August-October 2013 (about 15 percent
overvalued), and from May 2015 to the present, as of early August 2015, (about 30 percent overvalued).
See Annex 5, below, for the latest May 2015 Office of the President’s directive on the exchange rate policy.
37.      The ad hoc exchange rate policy shifts and controls contributed to delays in processing the
EGRG-II, as well as delays with complementary activities supported by the IMF and AfDB. For
example, the exchange rate controls introduced in late-2012 contributed to a delay in the First Review of
the IMF’s ECF, which was not completed until May 2013. The Second Review of the ECF was
subsequently delayed as well, due to both monetary and fiscal policy slippages, and eventually, The Gambia
was officially declared off-track from the program in September 2014.22 The authorities re-engaged with
the Fund in late-2014, and this led to the approval in early-April 2015of a Rapid Credit Facility and a one-
year Staff Monitored Program (SMP, to facilitate a possible successor ECF in 2016). At the time, the new
SMP—which included an aggressive fiscal consolidation program that the Government introduced in
January 2015 and a commitment to a market determined flexible exchange rate policy, and therewith
establishing an adequate macroeconomic policy framework—facilitated going forward with what had
originally been intended as the second grant in the lapsed EGRG series, along with the achievement of the
EGRG-II prior actions. However, the Government introduced the fifth of the aforementioned exchange rate
decrees in early-May 2015 (See Annex 5), which resulted in an inadequate macroeconomic policy
framework, and processing of EGRG-II was placed on hold in May 2015 (although by that time all of the
prior actions had been met and cleared). The new monetary policy also contributed to the Government’s
going off track from the just agreed SMP, less than a month after the IMF’s Board approved it.
38.      While the macroeconomic policy framework for the EGRG-I was moderately satisfactory at
approval, during the preparation for the EGRG-II, delays in achieving policy actions and
deterioration in the macroeconomic framework led to a lapsing of the EGRG series. Deterioration in
the macroeconomic policy framework, during the supervision period for EGRG-I and preparation period
for EGRG-II, is evident across many indicators, including for example the international reserves position.
Notably, despite the challenges posed by the severe drought that took hold during the 2011/2012 crop year,
international reserves rose to the equivalent of 5.9 months of import cover in 2012 from 5.1 months in 2011.
But, reserves were drawn down thereafter to 5.2 months and 4.0 months of import cover in 2013 and 2014,
respectively, and most recently to below 3 months of import cover in May 2015 (as of August 2015). The
low import cover position represents significant vulnerabilities for The Gambia, given its heavy reliance on
imports for food security and complete dependence on oil imports for power generation. The authorities
had recognized the need to rebuild market confidence and periodically pursued fiscal consolidation and
consistent monetary policies. These efforts allowed them to conclude the first review of the ECF program
that was approved by the IMF’s Board in May 2013 (delayed from 2012), and later the SMP that was
approved in April 2015. However, the Government was unable to complete the second review of the ECF,
due to macro-policy slippages that took hold in the third quarter of 2013. While the authorities remained
engaged with the IMF, the ECF was eventually declared off track in September 2014, when sharp
deterioration in the fiscal position became apparent. The new IMF SMP very quickly went off track as well,
in May 2015 with the introduction of the exchange rate controls, as discussed above. Apart from putting
together a more credible policy mix and legislative framework that would prevent the reoccurrence of policy
slippages of that magnitude, the authorities need to accelerate the work on production of the improved

22
  The first review of the ECF was cleared by the IMF’s Board on May 28, 2013. Due to policy slippages in late 2013,

Policy Area 1: Improving Transparency and Accountability in Public Financial Management
       1) Enhanced transparency and accountability in the management of Government’s accounts
       through furnishing of 2008-2010 financial statement to the National Audit Office.
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
39.     Regularly audited financial statements are a key element of good accountability and
Government transparency. Timely publication and auditing of the Government financial statements
provide information on the financial situation and performance of the state allowing parliament and the
general public to better understand how public resources were used and how they might be better allocated.
The impact of the audits is to confirm correct reporting, attesting to the fairness of financial statements and
related disclosures, and to indicate needed corrections where this might not be the case. The State Audit
Office, with a full independence, is a critical check and balances institution supporting the parliamentary
oversight of the Government performance. Prior to the EGRG-I there was a ten-year backlog of financial
statements not submitted to the NAO. The EGRG-I attempted to clear the backlog of audited Government
financial statements and thus increase its accountability.
40.     Implementation experience and outcome targets: Financial statements for 2008-2010 were
submitted by the MOFEA to the NAO in March-April of 2012, for auditing and thus the EGRG-I prior
action has been met. However, the audit reports for 2009 and 2010 were presented to the Public Accounts
and Public Enterprises Committees (PAC/PEC) of the National Assembly only in February 2014. These
audit reports were done following the international standards for auditing and have revealed “weaknesses
in controls which need urgent attention,” and are mainly related to procurement and adequate payment
documentation. The audit backlog accumulated during the previous Auditor General’s mandate that
involuntarily seized in June 2013. The new Auditor General had by 2014 cleared the backlog through 2010,
and raised the issue of capacity of the NAO, given the large number of unfilled vacancies, including of the
directors’ positions. The security of tenure has also been a problem of the Auditor General’s office. By
February 2015, financial statements for 2011 were also audited and submitted to the PAC/PEC of the
National Assembly; however, although two more financial years, 2012 and 2013, were audited by June
2015, the reports are still waiting to be sent to the National Assembly.
41.      The perception of the independence and the credibility of the NAO need to be ensured
through high quality and timely audits. The Constitution mandates that the Auditor General must report
at least once every year to the National Assembly on the accounts of The Gambia Government, courts and
all public enterprises. This should be done within six months of the end of the immediately preceding
financial year; i.e. leaving a year and a half to issue audit reports. The audit reports also need to be published
after the discussion in the National Assembly. The last audit report publicly available is for 2010, while
reports for 2011-2013 are available in hard copies upon request. The authorities have taken steps to reduce
the backlog of audited Government financial statements by submitting all but 2014 financial statement to
the NAO. This was also made possible due to the establishment of the IFMIS and the strengthening of the
accounting and reporting environment within the public sector. However, the standards need to be improved
and the time lag shortened.

  Both IMF and IDA estimates for 2011-2012 real growth suggested a recession for 2011 and a rebound for 2012 well

       2) Monthly IFMIS fiscal reports disseminated through the periodic publication on the
       MOFEA’s website.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
42.      The EGRG-I attempted to ensure timely public access to budget execution reports and thus
increase budget transparency, supported by the establishment of an IFMIS. The Government started
implementing IFMIS in early 2006, and since 2007 it has been operational at the central Government level
to support core budget preparation, execution and reporting functions. It was supported by the IDA credit
for Capacity building for Economic Management. The 2010 Country Financial Accountability Assessment
and the 2011 Public Expenditure Review Update confirmed that. One of the benefits of the IFMIS was the
improved timeliness of financial reporting of the budget execution reports on monthly basis. Prior to that,
the lack of timely and relevant financial information for decision making and the use of manual or partially
automated routine tasks of planning, preparing and aggregating budget estimates made the budgeting
process highly inefficient and staff time-intensive.
43.      Implementation experience and outcome targets: Monthly IFMIS fiscal reports have been
posted on the website of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs since December 2011, albeit on an
ad hoc basis with some delay.24 These reports provide figures on overall fiscal outturns (revenues and
expenditures) as well as the breakdown of budget expenditure execution according to the responsible
ministries. The reporting lag was initially set at three months from the reporting period, but in the interim
the authorities agreed to reduce this to a maximum of a two month lag (under the IFMIS Additional
Financing, or IFMIS AF, investment project that was approved by the World Bank’s Board in August 2013).
However, the lags in reporting have periodically become substantial, and the latest available monthly report
is for December 2014 (as of early-August 2015), with no reports available for 2015 that should be available
through May (posted at end-July).
44.     While the posting of fiscal reports has been irregular, the format has become more user
friendly. Since first agreed under EGRG-I, the Government began posting the reports in Excel-format
instead of in PDF (agreed under IFMIS AF), making the data more accessible and user friendly for further
analysis and regular monitoring as reports are posted. The dissemination of the IFMIS fiscal reports
attempted to encourage greater transparency and efficiency by allowing the public to monitor the use of
public resources and help detect wasteful use of resources during the budget execution stage. The umbrella
NGO organization – The Association of Non-Government Organizations, TANGO – has created a pro-poor
advocacy group (pro-PAG) that has proven quite proactive in using poverty budget information in its policy
dialogue. The public availability of financial reports also encouraged the MOFEA to publish the 2014
Citizens Edition of the Budget and limited information on public debt.
45.      The authorities have put further efforts in upgrading and rolling out the IFMIS since 2012,
supported by IFMIS AF. The IFMIS is now used for budget planning and would allow introduction of the
performance budgeting. The transition to a consolidated web-enabled platform (from Epicor 7.3.5 to Epicor
9.05) provided the opportunity to broaden the use of the IFMIS by making it more user-friendly and
accessible to Government offices outside of Banjul. Supported by the IDA IFMIS AF investment project
(effective until 2018), the system should provide access to around 500 users (including 8 sub-treasury
offices and embassies) for various budget preparation, execution and reporting functions. Apart from the
planning and the execution modules, the IFMIS also contains accounting, general ledger, HRMS and
payroll, procurement, and contract management modules. The consolidation of the IFMIS system will
further improve public financial management by allowing the establishment of the Treasury Single
Account, implementing interface with the debt management system, central bank systems, customs

systems, and incorporating donor-funded projects into IFMIS (representing around 40 percent of
Government expenditures per year).
46.      The purpose of the IFMIS goes beyond the accounting IT tool, and could be more fully
exploited by the Government. Both auditors and line ministries still need to fully absorb and implement
the policy-making and service delivery characteristics of the system. There have been several workshops
conducted by the MOFEA to collect feedback and provide information to the users on what the system can
deliver.
    3) Improved public financial management accountability through the appointment of five
    judges for the tax and customs tribunal, as required in the Income and Sales Tax Act and the
    Customs and Excise Tax Act.
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
47.     Faced with the decline in tax revenue collection rate, the Gambian Government was seeking
ways to encourage tax compliance. With the establishment of the Tax Tribunal, the Gambian Government
aimed to improve the credibility of the tax system by providing the appropriate channels for tax payers to
object to their tax liability if they are not in agreement with the tax assessed and believe that the tax and
penalty (in case of late payment) need to be reviewed. The Tax Tribunal was envisioned in the 2004 Income
and Sales Tax Act and the 2010 Customs and Excise Tax Act, and the EGRG-I supported its
operationalization.
48.     Implementation experience and outcome targets: The institutionalization of the Tax Tribunal
happened only in March 2012, eight years after it was the first envisioned in the legislative framework; it
became operational with the appointment of five tribunal judges. The taxpayers can first object to a decision
made by the Commissioner General to the Commissioner General. If, after review of the objection by the
Commissioner General the taxpayer is still not satisfied with the outcome, it can then appeal to the Tax
Tribunal. Further, the appeal can be made to the Court of Appeal. While there are several instances of
appeal made available, until May 2015, the Tax Tribunal has reviewed no cases as no complaints were
received so far. The authorities had attempted earlier to promote the new service to taxpayers (through
billboards, radio announcements, pamphlets, etc.). The Gambian Revenue Authority also suggested that a
diagnostic study could be conducted to investigate the possible reasons for the lack of cases being brought
forward; no such investigation has been conducted so far. It will be critical to ensure taxpayers a full
protection from unnecessary audits after complaints are submitted. Ensuring the Tax Tribunal
professionalism and independence could help build trust in this service as a tax administration watchdog.
Despite these challenges, the Government has succeeded in generating higher revenues through other
measures (supported for instance by the VAT), and domestic tax and other revenues have increased from
16.4 percent of GDP in 2012 to an estimated 18.7 percent in 2014.
    4) Enhanced effectiveness in public spending through the identification and interruption of
    payments by the MOFEA to civil servants not validated by the IFMIS payroll.
Rating: Satisfactory
49.     The authorities made an effort to enhance the effectiveness of public spending on civil
servants’ wages by ending payments to invalidated civil servants (ghost workers). This was planned
to be done through better management and control of the payroll, in particular after the constant increase in
the number of civil servants. The development of the payroll module within the IFMIS enabled this process.
The EGRG-I supported the validation of the Human Resource records, maintained by the Personnel
Management Office, with the IFMIS payroll module, maintained by the MOFEA. This allowed the
regularization of these records, with the removal of ghost workers and the elimination of vacant positions.
As a consequence of the validation exercise, the Government was able to save the expenditures tied to the
ghost workers,




50.      Implementation experience and outcome targets: In April 2011, the Personnel Management
Office (PMO) authorized the Treasury of the MOFEA to stop payments of salaries to all civil servants not
validated in the IFMIS payroll. Out of close to 36,000 central Government employees (this includes the
entire civil service, the army, the National Audit Office and the Judiciary) on the IFMIS payroll, by June
2015, 727 civil servants were removed from the payroll. Further efforts are being made to regularize HR
records with the systematic validation of these records. While the PMO is officially in charge of managing
HR records and has the authority to create new positions and close existing ones, payroll funding is provided
through the MOFEA, which controls the wage bill. These links need to be automatic and need to be linked
to the monthly payroll if they are to be up-to-date. The payroll module is already fully integrated with the
financial module, so that all employees with the bank accounts are paid directly through the Central Bank
Treasury account. Namely, for all Government employees, tax identification numbers need to be entered
into the IFMIS if they are to be paid from the budget. Consequently, the number of civil servants registered
in the payroll module of the IFMIS increased from 28,246 in 2012 to close to 36,000 by mid-2015. This
payroll cleaning measure will be complemented by the capture of photos for all employees (and pensioners)
on the IFMIS.
    5) Strengthened internal audit institution through the approval of the MOFEA’s internal audit
    committee’s charter and the appointment of members of the internal audit committee.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
51.      The internal audit function has been non-existent despite being legislated in 2006. The
establishment of the function was a requirement embodied in the 2004 Gambia Budget Management and
Accountability Act, while in 2006 the legal mandate for the internal audit function was approved. The
benefits of internal audits include establishing the effectiveness and efficiency of the Government’s budget
operations, the reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, and
where needed identifying lapses and areas of improvement. The establishment of an improved accounting
environment and the financial reporting availability supported by the IFMIS enabled the effective internal
audit function establishment. The internal audit function has been re-established at the MOFEA with the
appointment of a Director for Internal Audit (the function has been elevated from a Unit to a Department)
in 2011.
52.      Implementation experience and outcome targets: The full operationalization of the internal audit
function was done through (i) the appointment of the Internal Audit Committee members in March 2012
by MOFEA, and (ii) the approval of the Internal Audit Committee Charter in April 2012. Since March
2012, 57 internal audit reports were produced, of which 31 produced in 2014. Senior management reviews
the audit reports from the PFM Department and then liaise with the relevant authorities (usually the
Accountant General’s Department-AGD) for necessary actions. If it appears that there is blatant corruption
or fraud the AGD forwards the report to the Police for action. There has been also a positive shift from pre-
payment auditing to risk-based auditing, concentrating on systemic issues, which received renewed
attention with the roll-out of IFMIS and the establishment of an improved accounting environment. Further
efforts are needed to broaden the audit focus on conformity of budgetary spending with the Government’s
strategy; effectiveness and efficiency of operations; reliability of financial reporting; and compliance with
applicable laws and regulations.
    6) Strengthened budget management through the establishment of a system of real time
    reconciliation and clearance of accounts between the MOFEA and the Central Bank through an
    IFMIS interface.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
53.     With improved cash balances information, the forecast horizon of liquidity planning can be
extended, which enables more efficient cash and debt management. This on the other hand leads to
greater predictability of Government financing needs, including through the preannounced T-bill auction

calendar, helping to lower interest rates and bringing greater stability to the local money market. A real
time reconciliation and clearance of accounts between the MOFEA and the CBG, that manages the Treasury
account, contributes toward increasing predictability in public borrowing by providing the real-time
information on cash balances in Government accounts at the CBG.
54.      Implementation experience and outcome targets: The IFMIS interface at the CBG was
established on December 7, 2011. The MOFEA is now able to access Government accounts at CBG online,
and to download these bank account statements so that they can be uploaded onto the IFMIS. The end-users
of this interface were identified and the system is fully operational, providing access to real-time
information on budget shortfalls and on the timing of needed public domestic borrowing. The MOFEA can
also carry out automated bank reconciliation. This was important because the high cost of servicing the
domestic public debt resulted both from high levels of borrowing and from the lack of predictability in the
Government’s demand on financing resources. With this real-time reconciliation of bank accounts the
benefits of introducing a Treasury Single Account (TSA) could begin to be reaped, as Government
borrowings gets informed by Government cash balances, excluding for those earmarked resources related
to donor-funded operations. However, the Government has not introduced a TSA, and the potential savings
that might be generated by improved management of idle balances through a TSA, for example, are not
being generated. Further, while capacity for improved budget management has been enhanced with the
upgrade of the IFMIS, the Government’s management of fiscal accounts has deteriorated, if measured by
budget outcomes and the extent to which they have deteriorated since the EGRG-I was approved and by
the extent to which they have diverged from the programmed budgets.
Policy Area 2: Strengthening Energy Sector Management
       7) Public sector energy arrears to the NAWEC reduced by Government providing an amount
       of GMD228.6 million by March 31, 2012.
Rating: Unsatisfactory
55.      Another key concern related to public resource management is the public utility, National
Water and Electricity Company, and its strained finances and associated contingent liabilities. The
sector was also seen as a major bottleneck for economic growth and the business environment. The power
sector of The Gambia requires significant investments to upgrade and expand the country’s generation,
transmission, and distribution capacity. However, over the last three years, there were no important
investments in the network or generation capacity. At the same time, the sector faced significant operational
deficiencies, due to ageing infrastructure, commercial losses and low tariffs. The transmission and
distribution systems suffered losses of around 27 percent (technical and commercial) which was high
compared to the neighboring African countries. However, public sector energy arrears contributed to the
dire situation of the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC), the energy sector monopoly25.
The public sector energy arrears amounted to over half of all energy arrears which got accumulated to the
point of placing the company close to bankruptcy and preventing its ability to carry out needed maintenance
and investment. The EGRG-I aimed to support the reduction of central Government stock of arrears towards
NAWEC that would be complemented by additional actions that would prevent a further accumulation of
arrears, like payment of utility bills automatically deducted from budget transfers to ministries, departments
and agencies and introducing of pre-paid meters in these offices. This effort to reduce the stock problem of
the arrears was to be complemented by the agreed upon prior action for the successor EGRG-II of a tariff
rate hike for the utility to improve cost recovery that would address the flow problem.
56.    Implementation experience and outcome targets: The authorities adopted the executive order
number OP268/318/01/XXV, on November 9, 2011 that required clearance of public sector energy arrears
to NAWEC. By March 2012, the MOFEA had reduced the energy arrears to NAWEC down to GMD28. 4

million from its peak of GMD257 million in 2009. However, the arrears grew again in 2013 to GMD71.1
million and further to GMD157.6 million by February 2015, suggesting lack of preventive actions being
taken to stop the reoccurrence of energy arrears in the public sector. For example, while automatic budget
deduction for utility bills and the pre-paid meters have been installed in some public premises to control
consumption, they have not been put in place in hospitals, the social security administration, and for street
lightning. The arrears are sizeable, and as a share of GDP, for example, arrears increased from 0.1 percent
in 2012, to 0.2 percent in 2013 and to 0.4 percent of projected GDP in 2015. In June 2015, the Government
arrears were offset against NAWEC’s 2014 tax arrears; however, the final reconciled arrears balances were
not available in September 2015. Therefore, while on the one hand, the prior action was taken and the result
of the reduction in arrears by 2012 was accomplished (a satisfactory result), the action was a one-off
measure that did not lead to a sustainable results (an unsatisfactory design). Further, the subsequent utility
tariff rate hikes that were achieved as prior actions under EGRG-II (with rate increases introduced in August
2013 and January 2015) to support sustainability of the EGRG-I action were insufficient in the face of the
emergence of far greater than anticipated arrears given the payment problems incurred by public sector
entities.
57.      NAWEC still faces serious financial issues—it faced possible bankruptcy in 2014, when the
Government took over their debt servicing requirements equivalent to about 2.5 percent of GDP—
and there is a need to improve its financial viability and operational performance. The largest public
sector arrears to NAWEC since 2013 are coming from the Gambia Telecommunications Company
(GAMTEL) and the Gambia Radio and Television Services, both public sector agencies, calling for a
stronger state-owned companies’ governance framework. Aging infrastructure and commercial losses, due
to failure of consumers to pay bills is still present. The subsequent operation (now suspended), EGRG-II
aimed to mitigate the exposure to fuel price volatility (that accounts for 80 percent of its expenditures) by
providing for more regular tariff adjustments and lowering the cost of imported fuel. To that extent,
electricity tariffs were increased by 12 percent in 2014, as recommended by the 2013 and 2014 reviews,
respectively, of the tariff by the national regulator Public Utilities Regulatory Agency. However, the
improvement of NAWEC’s finances should also come from a general improvement of company
performance and assets efficiency, and not only rely on tariff rate hikes.NAWEC faces important technical
challenges that need to be addressed: (i) insufficient and inefficient generation (which is translated into
extremely expensive generation costs); (ii) high transmission and commercial losses (translated into a
decrease in incomes); and (iii) deficient commercial organization (partially due to the issue of joint
accounting with water and sewerage, and reflected on the general lack of visibility about customer payments
and high failure payment from big consumers).
Policy Area 3: Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Telecommunications Sector
       8) Adopting a strategy to enhance private participation in its telecommunication sector, through
       the issuance of a license to the Gambia Submarine Cable Company (GSCC) in order to improve
       the quality of the telecommunications infrastructure.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
58.     At the time of the EGRG-I, the Gambia telecommunication market faced limited competition,
and was offering inadequate services at higher prices to beneficiaries. The industry had a fixed network
operator monopoly, GAMTEL, and a vibrant mobile market with four operators. However, the international
connectivity was inadequate as it was dependent on the Senegal fiber bandwidth leading to high Internet
access prices and the low quality of service. At the same time, the new submarine cable—the Africa Coast
to Europe (ACE)26 opened the potential for accessing the international network at more competitive terms.

The EGRG-I aimed to support the new strategy for the telecommunication sector geared to enhance private
participation in service delivery.
59.     Implementation experience and outcome targets: In March 2012, the Ministry of Information
and Communications Infrastructure (MOICI) issued a license to the Gambia Submarine Cable Company
Limited (GSCC) owned by multiple stakeholders, including the Government (through MOFEA), that would
share the country’s allocated capacity in the ACE system. The operationalization of the GSCC aimed to
reap the benefits of the Government investment (supported through the IDA’s West Africa Regional
Communications Infrastructure Program-WARCIP) in establishing the link with the submarine cable ACE
by allowing the access to the international gateway to be exploited by multiple competing operators. This
would then support removing opportunities for monopolistic and discriminatory behavior. By May 2013,
there were two internet service providers and three mobile operators connected to the Gambia Submarine
Cable (GSC). Prior to the issuance of licenses, Gamtel had a monopoly over the data and voice gateways,
constraining operators to originate and terminate international data/voice traffic through Gamtel’s gateway.
The market grew further and by June 2014, there were four GSM mobile operators and five Internet Service
Providers.
60.      Although progress has been made, more needs to be done to move away from monopolistic
behavior and towards a level-playing field. While there is a strong demand for mobile service with
penetration rate over hundred percent, the access to Internet services is still low – 14 subscribers per 100
people. There are still complaints of poor service for VoIP and access to certain websites. The system still
suffers from the need to eliminate the international voice termination fees that are well above the regional
average. There is a need to allow the mobile operators to independently negotiate terms with telecom
companies outside The Gambia. Gamtel still has a monopoly over the international voice gateway. Further,
the GSCC needs to ensure financial viability and sustainability of its operations. The subsequent EGRG-II
(for which processing has been suspended) supported the liberalization of the international data (liberalized
in March 2013) gateway through issuing licenses to the private operators and service providers to allow for
competition in the international segment of the telecommunications market. 
Policy Area 4: Enhancing Education Sector Management
       9)             Enhancing accountability in education services through the execution of service-level
                      agreements between the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education and regional
                      directives and primary and secondary schools head-teachers to improve the overall
                      performance of students.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
61.     Gambia has witnessed a significant expansion in school enrollment rates over the past decade
that has not been matched by improvements in student performance. While the rise in enrollment rates
was followed by continuously high primary completion rates and a low average repetition rate27, inequities
and disparities existed when disaggregating this data by income and region. Also, student score
performance in assessment tests did not improve at the same pace. In the National Assessment Test, for
instance, very few students reached the minimum requirement, with the particularly worrying success rate
for Grade 3 English, at 19.5 percent, and Grade 5 Math and Sciences, with an average success rate of just
20 percent.28 The results at upper basic and senior secondary levels were scarcely better, having barely
improved since 2002. These poor results would amplify at the higher grades where results would be

dismal29. The EGRG-I aimed to support improvement in the incentives for delivery of higher quality
education service to students. This prior action has been reinforced going forward through the Results for
Education Achievement and Development Project (READ).
62.      Implementation experience and outcome targets: The challenge for the education system in The
Gambia was to raise the quality of teaching and thus improve the student’s scores in the national assessment
tests. To meet this first challenge the Government has signed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between
the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MOBSE), its regional directorates, and the head-teachers
of the public basic and secondary schools. The SLAs with the regional directorates were first signed in
2009-10 and were extended thereafter. As evidenced by letter dated April 18, 2012 the MOBSE confirmed
that the SLAs were signed on November 29, 2011 with 6 Regional Directors and 498 school head-teachers
of public basic and secondary schools. The SLAs are defining the strategic medium-term plan for the
regional directors and the MOBSE staff, while they define the annual work plan and expected results for
the school-level staff. These SLAs have enabled monitoring of the education staff performance as they
defined a new level of accountability and service delivery in public basic and secondary education through
monitoring teacher attendance and curriculum program. The SLAs are being reviewed every quarter
providing feedback on the teaching outputs. The implementation of SLAs was expected to lead to higher
scores in the National Assessment Tests (NATs).
63.      The new accountability system for delivery of public education led to improvements in the
teaching quality as evidenced by NAT scores. NAT scores for 3rd grade English and Math improved to
45.7 and 47.2 percent in 2013, respectively, from 20 and 18 percent in 2008. However, it should be noted
that the test items in the NAT are not necessarily comparable over time and therefore it cannot be fully
confirmed that student learning indeed improved.30 Nevertheless, the new system involved a cultural
change, and challenged long entrenched ways of doing things. The above notwithstanding, there is a
question to what extent this would be a long lasting incentive system given the teachers’ payroll setting has
not been informed by their performance based on the SLAs, but the payroll is decided by the Public Service
Commission that does not look at the delivery of the SLAs.31 Further, there are also issues with how the
NATs are being undertaken and monitored. The anecdotal evidence suggests that low performing students
are not being subjected to NATs, therefore leading to biased NAT results.
64.     Going forward, the sector agenda is focused on improving completion rates and quality of
teaching along while reducing disparities in rural areas. Gambian households mad considerable
contributions to the education of their children, covering 46 percent of education costs at the lower basic
level back in 2009, for example. Informal school fees at public schools contributed to these costs, and the
EGRG-II supported their elimination in basic education at public schools. Under the IDA-supported Results
for Education Achievement and Development (READ) Project, student per capita school grants are being
provided instead for all public upper basic schools in demoted areas.
3.3           Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (Combining Relevance, Achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
65.     Based on the relevance, impact of the policies supported by the EGRG-I and an analysis of
the outcome indicators, the performance of the EGRG-I operation is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. The objectives of the EGRG-I were and remain highly relevant to the country’s

   At the GABECE assessment test (the Grade 9 exam for senior secondary admission), 76 percent of candidates failed
to obtain a credit in any of the four core subjects, and only 4 percent achieved a credit in all 4. Results were the poorest
in math, with only 7 percent of candidates obtaining the credit.

   MOBSE will apply the same test items in the 2016 NAT as in the 2012 NAT to have a comparable data for student
performance.

   The IDA-supported Third Education Project Phase II was providing awards of team performance bonuses to those
teachers having fulfilled their annual work plan commitments.

development needs and fit squarely into the Government’s strategic document (the PAGE). Based on the
discussion in Section 3.2, out of the nine policy actions included in the EGRG-I, the outcomes of five are
rated moderately satisfactory (MS), the outcome of one satisfactory, the outcome of two prior actions
moderately unsatisfactory and the reduction in public sector arrears to NAWEC is rated unsatisfactory. One
of the reform measures in terms of its substance supported by EGRG-I has been reversed (arrears reduction
to NAWEC), while the institutional framework in each of the reform area is much stronger as a result of
the operation.
66.      Overall, because of the policies supported by the EGRG-I, the Government has better tools
for control over the expenditure policy, through the IFMIS reports, improved cash management,
introduction of the payroll system to control the staffing, internal and national audit reports. These
policies and those implemented under the follow up EGRG-II, constitute important improvements of the
institutional framework that would result in savings over medium term. Similarly, through the interventions
in the education sector and the telecommunications, there were important policy changes that would lead
to lasting improvements of the business environment and would support the private sector growth once the
economy recovers from the double-dip recession.
67.     The progress on the outcome indicators set in EGRG-I was adequate. Out of nine outcome
indicators set in the operation, the outcomes of two did not meet the numerical targets set in the Program
Document. Of these two, outcomes have initially moved in the right direction, but have either stayed the
same or worsened (Table ). However, as also discussed in Section 2.2 and 2.3, the progress on outcome
indicators did not necessarily adequately capture the underlying reform effort by the Government.

3.4     Overreaching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or to
amplify discussion above):
a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
68.      It is unclear whether the EGRG-I reform measures have had positive poverty and social
impacts, as expected at the appraisal, but the sharp deterioration in public finances and weak growth
outturns point to a reversal, compounded by the two challenging exogenous shocks in 2014. The
strengthening of public financial management improved the Government’ capacity to monitor, compile and
report on fiscal accounts in a more timely manner to support more effective management of its resources
and improve delivery public services over the medium term. Notwithstanding, Government finances
deteriorated markedly since 2012, and the deterioration in policy management led to a loss in investor
confidence, and Government borrowing interest rates have increased markedly from an average of 10.4
percent in 2012 to 17.1 percent in 2013, and higher in the interim32. Aside from absorbing fiscal buffers
(through a higher interest burden), the higher prevailing interest rates have led to crowding out, evidenced
by an 8 percent contraction in the growth of credit to the private sector of in 2014. With respect to sectoral
policies, the strengthening of the resource management in the energy and education sectors through
improvement in NAWEC’s financial position that would enable investments at reducing current system
losses and at improving service delivery, as well as through providing accountability mechanisms for

32
  Interest rates for one-year treasuries, the longest-dated issuance, have averaged about 20 percent in the first half of
2015.

                                                               26

upgrading teaching quality, would improve the service delivery over the medium term. This proved
temporary, as NAWEC’s financial position deteriorated substantially in the interim. By broadening access
to the region telecommunication network to the private sector, the quality of services improved, although
still not up to the expectations, while the cost of telecommunication services dropped. Overall, GDP growth
has disappointed, and annual per capita income is estimated to have declined from US$407 in 2012 to
US$268 in 2014 in constant prices (based on preliminary Government figures).
b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer term capacity
   and institutional development)
69.      Almost all the policy areas supported in the EGRG-I involved institutional strengthening.
These include: the implementation of IFMIS, real-time balance reconciliation with the central bank, and
the payroll module; strengthening NAO’s proactivity as well as Internal Audit institutional capacity to act
as fiscal watchdogs, implementation of a new accountability system in the education sector, as well as
licensing the access to the international gateway allowing entry to multiple competing operators.
c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

4.      Assessment of Risks to Development Outcome
Rating: High
70.      At appraisal, development outcomes were subject to four risks. In the aggregate, these risks
were high. As identified in the PD, the first risk pertained to the Government’s limited institutional
capacity to implement the reform agenda. In retrospect, the Government received support for capacity
building through various complementary IDA projects as well as other donor projects, including projects
supported by the AfDB, EC, IFAD, IMF, UNDP and the WFP. The main impact of this risk—aside notably
from the aspects of institutional determination of the macroeconomic policy framework—was not so much
tied to a reversal of policy reforms (except with the arrears to NAWEC) or a change in the “content” of the
reform agenda, but on speed with which these policies were implemented. As a result of these delays, the
series lapsed, and processing of the stand-alone EGRG-II has been repeatedly delayed, and indeed was
suspended due to an inadequate macro-policy framework in May 2015. 
71.     With respect to macroeconomic risks, the risk was and remains high. Under the EGRG-I, in the
post-election period, the Government had carried out prudent measures in response to external shock,
through the support of the EGRG-I, IMF EFC and other IFI support, and was able to stabilize public
finances in the post-crisis scenario. However, this was short-lived and the country was unable to conclude
the Second Review of the EFC that was officially declared off-track in September 2014, and despite
subsequently securing the RCF and agreeing to an SMP in May 2015, the country is now at risk of balance
of payments crisis. While the Government continues to maintain a dialogue with the development partners
on appropriate policy responses, and possibly securing concessional external aid in the form of grants
through the proposed operations by AfDB and IDA, macroeconomic policy mismanagement remains an
impediment to moving forward with them.
72.      The risk of the country’s weak governance was substantial and is deemed to have deteriorated to
high. Policy efforts supported by the EGRG-I mitigated to a certain extent this risk. The continued
engagement of the AfDB and IDA in supporting the PAGE implementation via structural reform and
investment support ensured the continuity and a commitment to reforms at the technical levels. At the
political level, however, the commitment was less clear and credible, and the Government’s implementation

of reforms has been slow and halting, and in particular tied to the fiscal and monetary policy framework
has deteriorated substantially since EGRG-I was approved by the Board.
73.     Difficulties in sustaining reforms in energy and telecommunications sector, and in introducing
agreed upon reforms in the agriculture sector, proved to be high, and despite continued engagement by
the AfDB and IDA. The progress in these sectors is uneven—faster for telecommunications, slower for
energy, and particularly for agriculture that was back-loaded into EGRG-II—and has been further hampered
by the distressed economic environment, for both the energy and agricultural sectors. However, there is a
follow-up support through the complementary investment and structural reform operations that facilitates
the continuity of the reform efforts and preserves commitment to address the structural bottlenecks.
5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1     Bank Performance
a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
74.     The EGRG-I program was: (i) aligned with Government’s reform program and the PAGE Policy
Matrix; (ii) consistent with the higher-level objectives of the JAS; and (iii) focused on key reform areas
(see section 2.2 and 2.3 factors affecting implementation and monitoring).
75.     Strong efforts were made by the Bank team to design a robust program, based on
considerable analytical work. The EGRG-I team also worked closely and complemented the efforts with
the investment project teams and was selecting complementary prior actions supported also through the
investment operations. However, the Program Document could have been made clearer in terms of
consistent wording of PDOs, policy pillars as well as outcome indicators across the document, and as
indicated above, some of the results indicators could have been better defined to more accurately measure
outcomes rather than outputs.
76.     The Bank team was comprised of staff with the appropriate skills mix. It held regular missions
(four DPO missions and several missions on relevant supporting investment projects), and was responsive
to the Government’s needs. In addition to the strong policy dialogue maintained with the Government, the
Bank participated in joint reviews with the AfDB. Additionally, the Bank’s team conducted ten missions
for EGRG-I supervision and EGRG-II preparation, after the Board approval of EGRG-I on May 31, 2012.
The missions for the EGRG series included joint missions with the AfDB, and participation in discussions
with the authorities and the IMF for the Article IV, ECF and SMP review missions. The list of the EGRG
missions and delivery of Aide Memoires (AM) and Action Plans are presented in Table 6. Supporting the
dialogue with the Government and macro-policy monitoring, the team also attended the IMF’s Board
meetings for the First Review of the ECF in May 2013 and for the RCF and SMP in April 2015, as well as
the IMF’s annual and spring meeting discussions with the Government in 2013 and 2014.

77.      In addition to these ten EGRG missions, the team also conducted other related IFMIS-
missions during this period for the preparation, Board delivery, and supervision of the IFMIS
Additional Financing (IFMIS AF) investment project. The findings and next steps for the IFMIS
missions were sometimes combined with those in the AMs for the EGRG and macro-monitoring missions
(noted above) and sometimes prepared as stand-alone AMs. The team also led a join IFI Statistical Capacity
Building Mission (with the AfDB, IFAD, IMF and UN) to support improved national account statistical
reporting, given the urgent need to improve timeliness and reliability of national account data to in turn
facilitate improved capacity for macro-policy management and responsiveness to emergent shocks. This
was also aimed at improving the sequencing of donor support projects and to reduce redundant efforts. The
IFMIS and Statistical Capacity Building missions are listed in Table 7, along with information on the AMs.

78.     However, the design seemed to be too optimistic about the government’s future fiscal
management and policy framework, given previous policy slippages. For example, there had been
marked policy slippages ahead of the elections in 2011 and 2012, during which time the fiscal position had
deteriorated significantly and distortionary exchange rate controls had been introduced, which had
temporarily resulted in delays in processing of EGRG-I. In retrospect, the anticipated timing of the EGRG-
II proved optimistic as well, and the macroeconomic policy framework repeatedly faltered, was periodically
deemed inadequate for the operation to proceed, and ultimately, in May 2015 processing of EGRG-II was
suspended. Further, the design of the operation apparently made overly optimistic assumptions about the
Government’s capacity to deliver on such a wide range of reforms, and to maintain achievement of reforms

in some instances, as evidenced by later delays in delivery of audit reports and in regular posting of the
IFMIS reports. Also on the design, some of the results indicators measured outputs more than outcomes.

    b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
79.      Since the EGRG-I was considered the first of two grants in a programmatic series, the
supervision of the operation was to be conducted with the preparation of EGRG-II. Since the EGRG-
I operation was based on prior actions, which were implemented before it was approved by the Board of
Directors, much of the subsequent supervision should consist of tracking the progress of the reform program
ensuring that there was no backtracking and tracking progress in achieving the outcome indicators. Since
the EGRG-I was approved, no Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) were prepared—nor were ISRs
required, as the project closed a year later in May 2013, before the series lapsed in May 2014. Information
on the implementation of EGRG-I reforms and some outcome indicators from the EGRG-I policy matrix
were collected during the supervision missions and preparation missions of the EGRG-II (Table 6, above).
Additionally, the continuity on the Bank side after the EGRG-I Board approval was disrupted with a change
in the task leadership in July 2012, as well as team members and across the complementary investment
portfolio in agriculture, IFMIS, energy, telecommunications and education. Although the new team came
on board in July 2012, and capably continued with the supervision and the preparation of the new operation,
continuity in the case of the programmatic series in The Gambia might have helped to keep the operation
within the initially perceived timeline. However, deterioration in the macroeconomic policy framework that
became apparent already in late-2012, and deepened markedly in 2013, 2014, and further again in 2015,
posed particularly challenging circumstances and also became a factor in the team’s sectoral engagements.
    c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
80.    On the basis of ratings for the quality at entry and quality of supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
5.2       Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance:
Rating: Unsatisfactory
81.      As discussed in Section 1, the Government struggled to maintain the momentum for reform
implementation in the face of a declining economy, given the severe Sahelian drought and an intensive
election period in 2011, and subsequent exogenous shocks in 2014. It was able to implement a substantial
portion of the prior actions for EGRG-I only in early 2012, a year after the concept for the EGRG-I was
approved. It was decided to shift the agricultural sector related reforms into what was originally intended
as the second and final operation in the series. In terms of follow-up actions, there were no significant
changes in the content of reforms, but there were delays in implementing difficult reform policies, such as
in the agricultural and energy sectors, in the face of governance challenges and economic shocks, and policy
decisions that contributed to an unsustainable macroeconomic framework. This is most evident in the
authorities’ reversals in the macroeconomic policy framework, as reflected in the repeated and ad hoc
monetary policy shifts, and repeated and substantial slippages in fiscal consolidation efforts. While the
Ebola outbreak in neighboring countries in 2014 and the poor harvest for the 2014/2015 crop year presented
significant challenges, the macro-policy reversals also contributed to substantial deterioration in
Government finances and generated financial and economic distortions that hampered economic activity
(most clearly apparent through the rise in public sector, and correspondingly private sector, borrowing
interest rates). For these reasons, the overall borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
82.     The MOFEA assumed overall responsibility for coordinating the implementation, monitoring
and evaluation of the Policy Matrix. MOFEA was also ultimately responsible for reporting on progress
with the EGRG-series, and for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. It also
ensured that the broader consultation with stakeholders took place, and facilitated this engagement. In
particular, the MOFEA was very responsive and supportive of the engagement across the stakeholders with
the Bank’s teams and other IFIs, which also facilitated monitoring. Data availability and quality for
monitoring and reporting progress toward the PDO’s and results indicators was adequate, although provided
on occasion with some delay.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
83.   On the basis of ratings for the Government and Implementing Agency performance, the overall
Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
6.            Lessons Learned
84.     The EGRG-I operation confirmed general good practice lessons, such as to: work closely with the
Government, build on the Government’s program, have strong analytical foundation, work closely with
sector specialists and focus on a few achievable objectives that have the greatest impact (See Sections 2.2
and 2.3 on the factors affecting implementation and monitoring). The operation reflected the key lessons of
Bank experience during the previous JAS period (FY08-12)33. There are, however, several lessons that
could guide IDA’s future programmatic lending operations in The Gambia.
       x      Embarking on a programmatic two-grant series in an uncertain macroeconomic and political
              environment with weak governance poses high risks. As discussed in Section 2.3,
              macroeconomic and governance risks led to the lapsing of the EGRG series two years after the
              approval of the first operation. The PD for EGRG-I had indeed highlighted these risks. The
              coordination with the AfDB on their budget support operation was intended to support mitigation
              of such risks, aside from the support of the complementary IDA investment projects. The
              discussions with the Government officials indicate that the Government saw the real value of the
              EGRG-I operation in supporting the policy design and implementation efforts, in addition to the
              financing that came with it. Similarly, they valued the complementary IDA investment projects and
              AfDB budget support operations. In retrospect, the “lesson” from the experience with the EGRG
              series is not to abandon the two-series route, but to be aware of the high risks associated with an
              uncertain macroeconomic and political environment, and to be prepared to change course if
              necessary, as was done with this series with the decisions to delay processing of EGRG-II.
       x      To better mitigate against risks presented by uncertain macroeconomic conditions and weak
              governance, greater focus should be placed on guiding and supporting an appropriate macro
              policy mix—and in particular on requiring that the Government demonstrate their
              commitment to macro-policy reforms at the highest levels. As a small open economy, The
              Gambia remains highly vulnerable to external shocks, given its relatively undiversified economic
              base and the vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change. With its rapidly growing public
              debt and depleted economic buffers, the economy has become much more vulnerable to shocks
              than when EGRG-I was approved. The country is under high risk of debt distress, despite multiple
              efforts invested into strengthening public financial management and governance thereof. Therefore,
              the policy mix in possible future development policy grants should be focused on lasting policy

         management efforts to ensure a sustainable fiscal policy and an independent and prudent monetary
         policy, and to this end, greater emphasis should be placed on policy makers at the highest levels
         demontrating upfront their commitment to such reforms.
     x   Focus on policy areas and reform measures where there is ongoing policy dialogue and where
         there is a clear strategy. The EGRG-I supported actions that maximized the synergies with the
         Bank’s investment portfolio in telecommunications, education, IFMIS. It was much less successful
         with the energy sector actions, which at the time of the Board’s approval of EGRG-I did not have
         a complementary IDA investment project, in part reflecting longstanding governance issues that
         have persisted. In the interim, efforts to support the sector have progressed in subsequent years, but
         significant challenges remain. This is important, as the EGRG-I focused on institutional reforms,
         where progress on capacity building requires a long-term engagement and sustained political
         commitment.
     x   Stability in the composition of Government teams can facilitate timely implementation of
         project activities and the achievement of project development objectives. Capacity building
         and economic adjustment efforts tend to succeed when key performing civil servants are retained
         in position for a reasonable period of time, and when there is institutional stability to facilitate
         reform implementation. The Gambian civil service, particularly at the more senior levels, has been
         beset by a very high turnover of staff and by frequent organizational reforms that have weakened
         development progress and the sustainability of achieved reforms. A positive example is education,
         where senior management within the Government has remained relatively intact for many years,
         which likely contributed to more robust outcomes than in other areas. Given the frequent shifts in
         staffing in the Government, enlisting buy-in from more senior level Government officials might
         support stronger reform outturns.
     x   The design of outcome indicators need to adequately capture the policy efforts and the
         “reach” of the reforms supported by the operation. Setting properly formulated output
         indicators is critical in assessing the efficacy of an operation, and using quantitative targets that
         measure outputs instead of desired outcomes cloud the performance. For example, while the results
         indicator for the first policy area, to support enhanced transparency and accountability in public
         financial management, was supported with the achievement of real time reconciliation and
         clearance of accounts between MOFEA and the Central Bank, the desired outcome of strengthened
         budget management was clearly not (as reflected in the deterioration of the fiscal position and sharp
         increase in public debt). This is an important lesson for all Bank’s operations in The Gambia, not
         only this budget operation.
