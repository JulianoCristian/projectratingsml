Grant Project for the Gambia were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the EGRG-I supported actions that maximized the\n            synergies with the Bank\u2019s investment portfolio in\n            telecommunications, education, IFMIS. It was much less\n            successful with the energy sector actions, which at the time\n            of the Board\u2019s approval of EGRG-I did not have a\n            complementary IDA investment project, in part reflecting\n            longstanding governance issues that have persisted. In the\n            interim, efforts to support the sector have progressed in\n            subsequent years, but significant challenges remain. This is\n            important, as the EGRG-I focused on institutional reforms,\n            where progress on capacity building requires a long-term\n            engagement and sustained political commitment. Capacity\n            building and economic adjustment efforts tend to succeed\n            when key performing civil servants are retained in position\n            for a reasonable period of time, and when there is\n            institutional stability to facilitate reform implementation.\n            The Gambian civil service, particularly at the more senior\n            levels, has been beset by a very high turnover of staff and\n            by frequent organizational reforms that have weakened\n            development progress and the sustainability of achieved\n            reforms. A positive example is education, where senior\n            management within the Government has remained relatively\n            intact for many years, which likely contributed to more\n            robust outcomes than in other areas. Given the frequent\n            shifts in staffing in the Government, enlisting buy-in from\n            more senior level Government officials might support\n            stronger reform outturns."}, "docdt": "2015-09-07T23:47:03Z"}
