The lessons learned indicate that the Klaipeda\n            commitment at municipal level was fluctuating at certain\n            stages of implementation, and that immediately affected on\n            implementation progress both in negative and positive way.\n            It is important to ensure continuity of task team leaders\n            and task teams. The transformation of existing water and\n            wastewater utility developed an efficiently managed self\n            sustaining entity.
