                            Additional financing for Project Scale-up
                                           Project Paper



I.Introduction

This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide an additional grant in
an amount o f SDR18.76 million (US$28.0 million equivalent) to the Afghanistan Emergency
Solidarity Project (P084329), Grant Number H072-AF.

The proposedadditional grant will provide bridgefinancing for a well-implemented, significantly
scaled up national priority program, and it will enable maintaining the momentum o f program
implementation in the coming months prior to the finalization o f funding allocation under the
Government's SY 1384. The grant would cover the funding requirements for block grants to
rural communities over the last two months of the second year work program.

The Emergency National Solidarity Project constitutes the backbone of the Government's
National Solidarity Program (NSP). The NSP is cofinancedby several donors through the World
Bank managed Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (TF 53939, approved on September 30,
2004 inthe amount of US$42 million) and bilateral arrangements.


11. BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancinginthe amount of US$28.0 million.

The Emergency National Solidarity Project was approved on December 23, 2003. The Grant
became effective on April 5, 2004. The closing date is March 31, 2007. It i s a follow-up project
to the Emergency Community Empowerment component funded under IDA Grant H009-AF
(closed in December 2004).

The objectives of the Emergency National Solidarity Project are to lay the foundations for a
strengthening o f community level govemance, and to support community-managed sub-projects
comprising reconstruction and development that improve the access o f rural communities to
social and productive infrastructure and services. The project finances: (i)block grants for
communities (US$72 million) to carry out sub-projects involving reconstruction and
development activities; (ii)community facilitation and sub-project preparation (US$13 million)
to support local communities through facilitation exercises, assistance for preparing sub-project
proposals, assistance in carrying out sub-projects for which block grants have been made
available, and capacity building for members o f local communities; (iii)   capacity building and
implementation support (US$7.6 million) comprising provision o f consultants' services for
capacity building, implementation support to the Ministry o f Rural Reconstruction and
Development (MRRD), and incremental operating costs; and (iv) external monitoring and
evaluation (US$2 million).

As per last Implementation Status and Results report (May 2005)' the Project is rated as
satisfactovy in achieving the Development Objective and in its Implementation Progress.

The Emergency National Solidarity Project i s proving an effective mechanism to transfer
resources to the communities and to use them in consultative, responsible and transparent
manner. The Project's emphasis on community participation has shown very encouraging results.
The secret ballot-based election process has created thousands o f Community Development

                                               - 2 -

Councils (CDCs) that contribute to buildinglocal governance, while demand-driven, community
projects have benefited about a thirdo f the rural poor in rural areas.

The Project implementation is well underway and actual disbursements have been above
appraisal projections. The scaling up o f program implementationraises the funding requirements.
As o f May 21, 2005, US$ 82.28 million (83.53 percent o f Grant H072-AF proceeds) and US$
30.52 million (72.67 percent o f TF53939 proceeds) have been disbursed. Grant H072-AF is
projected to be fully disbursed by July 2005. The proposed supplemental grant o f US$ 28 million
equivalent would cover the funding requirements for block grants over the last two months o f the
second year work program. Discussionwith the Government on the allocation o f IDA and donor
resources for continuation o f the NSP for the period beyond end August, 2005 i s ongoing and
agreement is expected by June 30, 2005.

111. ProposedChanges

The proposed supplemental grant will require an amendment to the Development Grant
Agreement (072H-AF) to increase the amount under Block Grants category by US$ 28.0 million.
The total Project costs will increase by a correspondent amount.

IV. Consistencywith the TransitionalSupportStrategy

The World Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS, March 2003) puts forward priorities for
the Bank's financial and non-financial assistance to Afghanistan. Under this strategy, IDA i s
focusing on supporting four strategic areas: (i)livelihoods; (ii)fiscal strategy, institutions,
management; (iii)governance and public administration reform; and (iv) private sector
development. The Project contributes directly to improving livelihoods and governance and will
facilitate economic growth through improved access to social and productive infrastructure.

V. Appraisalof Restructuredor Scaled-up ProjectActivities

Institutional: Activities under the additional grant are similar to the ones already being financed
under the Emergency National Solidarity Project. The institutional framework and staffing are
already in place. The Ministry o f Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) i s responsible
for implementation o f the pr~oject.Community empowerment i s at the core o f the ministry's
principles, policies and objectives. An inter-ministerial NSP Steering Committee acts in an
advisory capacity to MRRD on overall program policy formulation and direction, and oversees
program implementation. To manage the NSP, MRRD recruited an Oversight Consultant (OC)
whose tasks include (i)appraisal o f project proposals from communities, (ii)     transfer o f block
grant funds and disbursement for approved community projects, (iii)management o f relations
with Facilitating Partners, (iv) supervision and monitoring o f implementation, and (v) capacity
building for MRRD and Facilitating Partners. MRRD also contracted Afghan and international
Facilitating Partner (NGOs and UN-Habitat) to support Community Development Councils,
planning and implementation o f projects, community financial management, and procurement.

Technical: The additional financing will support activities that have been undertaken under the
Emergency National Solidarity Project in the last year. Technical capacities in the country exist
and supervision capacity o f the Oversight Consultant i s available. The update fo the information
system is a continuing activity, with bi-annual, quarterly and weekly report being provided in a
timely manner.




                                                - 3 -

Safeguards:    Sub-projects under the NSP comprise small-scale civil works which are not
expected to have any significant negative environmental or social impacts. The project observes
an updated version o f the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework that has been
developed for emergency rehabilitation projects in Afghanistan. Investments with negative
environmental or social impacts cannot be undertaken and are included in a negative list o f
prohibited investments.

Financial Management: The financial management system for the National Solidarity Project
exists and has been reviewed by the Bank. The system will be used to incorporate the
expenditures financed by the additional grant. The project accounts under the Emergency
National Solidarity Project have been audited annually throughout implementation. Audits were
submitted on time and had unqualified opinions with suggestions for improvement which ere
taken in to account and discussed with the Bank.

Procurement: Based on the experience o f the emergency National Solidarity Program, shopping
and national competitive procedures for the procurement o f technical surveys and software will
be used. The following is the envisaged number and value o f different types o f contracts that will
be made by the NSP Community Development Councils during the use o f their block grants for
this amount (US$ m).

Consultancies will be small value individual contracts, up to a maximum o f US$ 1,000 each, and
will primarily be used to hire engineers to help with technical designs or surveys o f the sub-
projects. They are therefore included under the sub-project category. The above table will be
revisedor updated every 6 months to reflect the actual contracts made.

Counterpart funds: The supplemental grant will not require counterpart funds.

Sustainability: For the near, term, the program's sustainability would require continued
Government commitment to channel adequate resources to support program implementation. The
program's longer term sustainability would depend on: (a) the commitment of communities to
adequately operate and maintain the investments; (b) capacity buildingo f CDCs to enable them
to play a greater role in local level development decision making; and (c) evolution of NSP from
a grant based program focusing on rural irrigation/ transport access to an integrated rural
development program with access to rural finance providers. The Government recognizes the
importance of the program in reaching out to the rural population and its huge potential as a
mechanism to support nation building,       rural development and poverty reduction. The donor
community is highly supportive o f the program's objective. Thus, the program's sustainability i s
considered highly likely.

VI. Expected Outcomes
Additional financing will provide additional community-led reconstruction and development o f
rural infrastructure. Approximately 70 percent o f program funds return to local labor, and
virtually all o f the benefits from the physical works accrue to primary producers. Sub-project
choices by villagers include physical infrastructure and revolving funds. Direct asset transfers
(e.g. tools and equipment for income generation activities) are permitted for vulnerable women
and disabled people, and the use o f block grants for microfinance and income generation
activities is being piloted. Implementation experience indicates that approximately 70 percent o f
program funds return to local labor, and virtually all o f the benefits from the physical works
accrue to primaryproducers.

VII. Benefits and Risks

It is premature to calculate economic and financial benefits in the current Afghanistan disrupted
environment. However, under NSP data are being collected to enable estimation o f expected
retums on individual subproject investments. The proposed supplemental grant faces the same
implementation risks as the overall program. Specific risk and mitigation measures that currently
apply to NSP are listed below:

 Risk                Mitigation measures
 Elite capture       Extemal facilitation o f the establishment o f CDCs through secret ballot and the
 o f benefits        participatory sub-project planning process.    Focus on public rather than private
                     goods, and transparency inbudgeting and the use o f block grants by communities.
 Corruption          Same as above, as well as financial management arrangements where MRRD,
                     Facilitating Partners, and Oversight Consultant staff do not handle cash.
                     Transparency will be further promoted by the involvement o f the press inmonitoring
                     o f the program.
 Delays inblock      Transfer o f funds and disbursement for approved community projects is managed by
 grant               the Oversight Consultant, initially through the Hawala system until it i s determined
 disbursement        on a case' by case basis that a functioning banking system i s established at the
                     provincial level.
 Decreasing          Support for NSP among cabinet members could seriously weaken in the event o f
 political           changes in political leadership. A strategic analysis o f options for govemance and
 support             management o f the NSP will be undertaken during the Mid-term Review to
 for NSP             implement institutional arrangements that promote the continuity and integrity o f the
                     program.
 Decreasing          Deteriorating security conditions may prevent operations in specific areas. Where
 security            this happens, and if feasible, operations may be shifted to other districts within the
                     same province (as has already happened in the provinces o f Zabul, Paktika, and
                     Uruzgan).
 Perceptions of      Deteriorating security conditions as a result o f Taliban re-infiltration may require
 inequitable         suspension o f operations in the south and east, which would in tum foster
 ethnic coverage     perceptions o f inequitable ethnic coverage. Proposed mitigation measures include
                     direct implementation by MRRD o f community development activities that would
                     not have to comply with NSP appraisal requirements, and that would therefore be
                     financed from other sources.
