In\n            late 2001, after the fall of the Taliban and almost three\n            decades of conflict, Afghanistan faced a daunting set of\n            challenges. World Bank programs were aligned with and in\n            support of the National Priority Programs, identified by the\n            Afghan Government as key to the development of Afghanistan\n            and the transition process. Afghanistan had made remarkable\n            progress in many areas. Important development results had\n            been achieved in areas such as health, education,\n            microfinance, irrigation and rural livelihoods, as well as\n            in public financial management. The results achieved reflect\n            the massive support of the international community to help\n            rebuild Afghanistan and the efforts and ingenuity of many\n            enterprising Afghans who continue to deliver services in\n            challenging circumstances."}, "docdt": "2011-04-13T06:21:02Z"}
