National\n            Solidarity Project for Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: that in a difficult post-conflict situation\n            characterized by limited government capacity, the\n            project's choice of institutional arrangements\n            featuring performance based contracting of service providers\n            for management assistance and field implementation lends\n            itself to a rapid scaling up of project outreach. The\n            challenge of maintaining engineering quality of\n            sub-projects, which has been and remains an issue in the\n            project and nationally across other projects and programs,\n            needs to be managed. However, this can not be effectively\n            addressed at the level of a project implementing agency, but\n            requires a broader effort aimed at building capacity for\n            small and medium contractors coupled with a certification\n            process to establish a list of pre-qualified contractors.\n            Monitoring and evaluation needs to be strengthened in\n            several areas including: (a) entry of baseline data into the\n            Management Information System (MIS); (b) periodic audits of\n            Community Development Council (CDC) financial management and\n            procurement; (c) assessments of livelihoods activities in\n            terms of sustainable income increases; (d) entry into the\n            MIS and analysis of data on CDC composition to enable an\n            assessment of the governance outputs of National Solidarity\n            Project (NSP) in terms of inclusiveness versus elite\n            capture; (e) assessment of the factors that critically\n            influence the functioning and roles of CDCs; and (f)\n            assessment of the poverty reduction impacts of the NSP."}, "docdt": "2007-10-24T00:00:00Z"}
