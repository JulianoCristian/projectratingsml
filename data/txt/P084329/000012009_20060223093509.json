This additional\n            financing would provide funds needed to scale-up activities\n            under a successful emergency program in the social sector\n            that has exceeded the original implementation (including\n            disbursement) expectations. The funds to be added through\n            this additional grant were not available under IDA 13 in\n            June 2005. The scaled up activities are expected to be\n            implemented by the original closing date, and are within the\n            original project objectives, subject to the same\n            implementation arrangements. The additional financing will\n            require an amendment to the Development Grant Agreement to\n            increase the amount of Block Grants category by US$24.4\n            million, Consultants Services, facilitation and training by\n            US$15.0 million, Goods by 0.5 million, and Incremental\n            Operating Costs by 0.1 million. It is expected the\n            additional financing will further community-led\n            reconstruction and development of rural infrastructure.\n            Approximately 70 percent of program funds return to local\n            labor, and virtually all of the benefits from the physical\n            works accrue to primary producers. Sub-project choices by\n            villagers include physical infrastructure, direct asset\n            transfers (e.g. tools and equipment for income generation\n            activities) for vulnerable women and disabled people, and\n            the use of block grants for income generation activities.\n            While premature to estimate economic and financial benefits\n            in the current Afghanistan disrupted environment, NSP data\n            are being collected however, to enable an estimate of\n            expected returns on individual subproject investments. This\n            additional grant faces the same implementation risks as the\n            overall program, and specific risk and mitigation measures\n            that currently apply to NSP remain pertinent."}, "docdt": "2006-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
