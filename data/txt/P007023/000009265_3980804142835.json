Education\n            Development Project in Dominican Republic are as follows:\n            overall outcome of the project was rated highly\n            satisfactory, and the performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower were rated satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned from the project are: 1) broad support by\n            representatives take holders is a prerequisite for\n            successful introduction and implementation of educational\n            reform. The ad hoc groups that formed to promote first the\n            argument for educational reform and then the development of\n            the Plan Decenal accounted in large part for the successful\n            start-up and implementation of Plan activities supported by\n            the project; 2) when faced with limited institutional\n            capacity in the responsible line ministry, it may be better\n            to rely on outside capacity and take a phased approach to\n            institutional strengthening than to risk delay or even\n            failure in initiating a much needed reform or project; and\n            3) the ability to take a programmatic approach to project\n            design can facilitate innovation and improvements during the\n            life of a project."}, "docdt": "1998-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
