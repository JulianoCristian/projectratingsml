Development\n            Project aims to strengthen the effectiveness of primary\n            education by raising student retention, promotion and\n            achievement levels; increasing the participation rate of\n            poor rural and urban children; and ensuring effective\n            planning, programming and monitoring of resources available\n            for primary education. There are two main components :\n            educational development and management development. The\n            educational development component would : a) provide skills\n            upgrading in key subject areas and teaching methods for some\n            600 teacher training staff of normal schools and\n            universities and related in-service training for 10,000\n            public primary school teachers; b) initiate a system for\n            maintenance of primary school facilities based largely on\n            community inputs of labor and government financing of\n            materials; and c) provide equipment for, and studies to\n            evaluate, improve and expand an ongoing school nutrition\n            program in rural areas and initiate a similar program in\n            peri-urban areas. The management development component would\n            : i) strengthen management information, planning, and\n            monitoring for primary education based on school planning\n            criteria and socio-economic indicators; ii) support selected\n            studies on issues related to the future development and\n            financing of basic education; and iii) introduce a student\n            assessment system to monitor achievement in language,\n            mathematics, social studies, and science."}, "docdt": "1991-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
