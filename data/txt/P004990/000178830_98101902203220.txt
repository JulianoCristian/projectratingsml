INTERNATIONAL DEVEILOPMINT ASSOC IATION
REPORT AND RECOMMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A COTTON GINNING REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
developmuent credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt for the equivalent of
US$18.5 million to finance the foreign exchange cost of a cotton ginning
rehabilitation project which constitutes the first phase of a ten-year
rehabilitation program of the cotton ginning industry in Egypt. The
credit would also finance up to $250,OOO of local expenditures on
a program for retraining and reemploying workers who would be displaced
as a result of this project. The credit would be on standard IDA terns,
and wonld be onlent by Egypt to the Egyptian Cotton General Organization
(ECGO) at an effective rate of 81½ percent per annum for a period of 15
years including 5 years grace.
PART I. THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Arab Republic of Egypt" (R73-16) dated December 30, 1972
was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 23, 1973. A Country
Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.       With the impetus of the First Five-Year Plan (1961-65), Egypt's
economic growth accelerated in the early 1960's to an average annual
rate of about 6 percent -- nearly reaching the plan target of 7
percent and considerably faster than the pace of growth in the 1950's.
However, the increased investment rate of the early 1960's was accompanied
by growing defense expenditure which led to serious balance of payments
pressures by the mid-i19600_s. In 1966/67, the government imposed severe
import restrictions and deflationary policies, resulting in negligible
growth in that financial year. The war of June 1967 compounded an already
difficult situation, and there was a substantial fall in GDP in 1967/68.



-2-
4.        In the sicceediLng two years, the economy recovered rapidly,
but the growth rate fell to some 4 percent in 1970/71 and was probably
about the same in 1971/72. Defense has taken a progressively greater
share of Egypt's resources (reaching 15 percent of (RNP in 1970/71), largely
at the expense of investment expenditure, -which has fallen to about 12
percent of GNP in recent years. The share of private consumption in GNP
has remained at about 68 percent -- implying a growth rate in per capita
private consumption of about 1½! percent annually. Employment has grown
slowly (by about 2 percent annually in recent years), resmlting in
increased   unemployment and underemployment.
5.        The heavy cla:is of the military on economic and human resources
have not only squeezed investmnent and development resources, but have
also given rise to balance of payments pressures.  Although8 transfer
receipts from Arab countries under the Khartoum Agreement (amounting to
about LE 110 million annually) have more than offset the loss of Suez
Canal revenues, a severe scarcity of foreign exchange continues to limit
both the utilization of existing productive capacity and the implementation
of new development programs. The tight balance of payments position is
highlighted by the large amount of short-term foreign liaibilities which,
at the end of 1972, exceeded external reserves by the equivalent of about
six months imports.
Debt Service Burden
6.        Egypt's medium and long-term external debt outstanding at the
end of December 1972 was reported at $1.2 biillion disbursed, or $1.6 billion
including undisbursed credits.--The USSR is Egypt's principal creditor,
followed in importance by the United States, Kuwait, Germany and Italy.
IBRD debt comprised less than one percent and IDA debt comprised about
4 percent of the total reported debt (including undisbursed) at the end
of 1972. The debt service ratio in 1970/71 was 32 percent. The near-term
debt servicing burden wiLl remain difficult as 29 percent of the reported
outstanding debt at the end of 1972 was due to be amortized within two
years, 40 percent within three years, end 60 percent within five years.
The implication of Egypt's debt profile is that rising gross capital
inflows or substantial reschedulings in addition to those already arranged,
will be needed to sastain a moderate net resource transfer, at least during
the next few years.
Development Prospects and Constraints
7.        In comparison with many less-developed countries, Egypt is
relatively favored in terms of geographicl, natural and human resources;
the size of its domestic market; the extent of existing infrastructural
development; the level of education and skill of its labor force, and
its associations with Arab nations and some developed countries. Egypt also
has a demonstrable comparative advantage in the production and export of cotton,



-3-
textiles, leather, food and engineering goods. These factors suggest
that the long-term growth potential could be promising. On the other
hand, there are a number of formidable constraints to development in the
short and medium terms. The most severe are the defense burden, the
scarcity of convertible foreign exchange (particularly fundb not tied
to new investment projects), the debt burden, and the general political
uncertainty in the area which has seriously impeded medium-term economic
planning.
8.        Egypt has a serious demographic problem.  The population is
already one of the most densely settled in the world, and is growing
fast.     A high rate of natural increase is combined with a high rate
of internal migration to urban areas, resulting in growing urban congestion -
especially in Cairo. In the longer run, continuing rapid population growth
heightens problems of unemployment and underemployment and causes greater
pressure on the land. A promising beginning has been made with a national
family planning program. But more needs to be done, both in family planning
and in regional and urban planning.
9.'       In the absence of significant new political developments in the
Middle East, Egypt's ability to effect major changes in resoarce allocation
is likely to remain limited.  Some encouraging developments, however, have
taken place in the economy in the last two years. These include a rapid
growth in Government revenues, fuller utilization of industrial capacity, a
resurgence of tourism in 1971 and 1972, the conclusion of new trade, aid
and debt rescheduling agreements with Western countries, and promising
indications of petroleum development. In an effort to attract private
Western and Arab capital, an International Bank for Trade and Development
was established and a new investment code was adopted; this code extended
tax exemptions and other incentives to foreign investors in Egyptian indastry
and tourism. The government has taken steps to confer more operational
autonomy on public sector industrial enterprises, increase wage incentives,
stimulate the small private sector, and study price reforms. Thus far,
however, the net effect of these steps on the economy has been small.
10.       In the summer of 1972, agreement was reached between the Heads
of State of Egypt and Libya calling for the unification of the two states
by September 1973. A nuxtiber of joint conmittees are currently studying
the problems of unification and their implications for Egypt's future
economic developnent.



PAiT II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS TN EGYPT
11.       The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's seventh operation
in Egypt and would bring Bank and IDA commitments to $182 million.  The
first was a Bank loan for the Suez Canal Expansion Project ($56.5 million)
in 1959. IDA credits have been made for the Nile Delta Project ($26
million) in 1970, the Egyptian Railways Rehabilitation Project ($30 m/illion)
and engineering and design work for the proposed project ($175,000)1
in 1972, and the Upper Egypt Irrigation Project ($36 million) and the Bank
of Alexandria Project ($15 million) in 1973. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of June 30, 1973, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects. There have been no IFC investments in
Egypt and none is tnder consideration.
12.       The main purpose of the IDA lending program is to assist develop-
ment in key sectors and to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange by
financing high-priority projects in agriculture, industry and infrastructure.
Since IDA funds are severely limited, the program is modest in relation to
Egypt's size and absorptive capacity. The proposed credit would be the
Bank Group's second major project in the industrial sector.  A population
project is expected to be ready for Board consideration within a few months.
Nwo missions visited Egypt in April 1973 to help prepare projects in
telecommunications, cement and fertilizers for possible lending.
Two agricultural projects -- a soil amelioration project and a rral
development project -- are under consideration. A second phase of the
railway rehabilitation program is also being prepared.
PART III. COTTON AND COTTON GINNING
13.       Agric-ulture accounts for 30 percent of GDP, provides employment
for about half of the work force, and earns the major portion of the
country's foreign exchange (about 55 percent of total exports in unprocessed
form, and 80 percent including processed goods). The growth rate of value
added in the sector has averaged about 3ui percent annually during the past
15 years but slowied down after 1966/67. Egypt specializes in production
of long and extra-long staple (LS and ELS) cotton. It produced about
h percent of world output of cotton in 1971/72 and 28 percent of all LS
and ELS in the same year.  Egypt remains a strong and competitive producer
of cotton. It has a comparative advantage in cotton growing which arises
from a rare combination of climate, 3oil and water availability as well as
a successful program of genetic research, control and planning. Increased
1/ To be refinanced under the proposed credit.



yields have permitted Egypt to maintain prodaction substantially constant,
despite some reduction in the area under cotton. At the same time, higner
world prices for cotton have increased reven-ues and export earnings.  Both
the agricultaral sector and the economy as a whole continue to depend
heavily upon cotton.
14.       Cotton and cotton products account for 60 percent of merchandise
exports. Egypt is the third ranked cotton exporter   ir. the world (after
the USA and USSR) with 7.4 percent of the world trade. The direction of
cotton exports has shifted since the 1950ts away from Western mirope and
the USA toward the USSR and other countries with centrally-planned economies.
Despite competition from man-made fibers, world cotton consumption has kept
pace with the growth in world population, although its share in total
textile fiber consumption dropped from an average 67 percent in the I950's
to 44 percent in 1971. World cotton consumption is expiected to increase
from an average of less than 12 million tons in 1970 to nearly 15 million
tons in 1980.
15.       Egypt has an important textile industry, consuming nearly 40
percent of its cotton output and giving employment to 230,000 workers.
Approximately 16 percent of the production of the textile industry valued
at FE 378 million in 1970/71 was exported, nearly one-third to Western
Earope, Africa and Middle East. Textile exports, though still modest,
have increased from ShE 48 to 59 million between 1966/67 end 1970/71 or
by about 5 percent per year. Egypt's textile industry plans by 1975
to expand its installed capacity for yarn and cloth production by 40 and
25 percent, respectively, for local consumption and export.  it is therefore
anticipated that increased supplies of Egyptian cotton will be recnuired for
dom.estic processing.
The Egrptian Cotton General Organization (ECOO)
16.       The Egyptian Cotton General Organization (ECGO) was established
ln December 1961 under the Ministry of Economy to deal with the cotton
sector.  A series of Presidential Decrees culminating with two in 1965
reorganized the corporate set-up of the numerous ginneries and export
companies and placed them under the ownership and control of ECGO as the
holding company. Twelve subsidiary companies were created, five for ginning,
six for exporting and one for pressing cotton bales for export.
17.       The headqlarters of ECGO and three ginning companies are located
in Cairo; the other subsidiaries are based in Alexandria. Each subsidiary
operates as an economic unit, and the six exporting companies compete with
one another in foreign markets. The exporting companies are also responsible
for domestic sales of ginned and pressed cotton. All export contracts
negotiated by the export companies require ECGO's approval. The five
ginning companies, each of which operates from 12 to 15 ginneries, have
similar organization stractures, The Board of each company consists of
a chairman and four executive directors appointed by the Government, and
four members elected from amongst the employees.



- 6 -
18.       ECGO is one of the largest and most profitable wholly-owned
government organizations in Egypt.  It accolLnts for half of Egyptian exports
and has an annual tuniover of almost LE 180 million ($461 million). In
1971/72, it contributed over LE 17.7 million of profits ($45.0 million) to
the Treasury. While sales increased about 10% between 1968 and 1972, ECGO's
income before tax almost doubled during the same period. The capital
stracture of ECC-0 is sound. It has no long-term debt. All cotton ope!rations
from the purchase of seed cotton through ginning to domestic and
export sales of lint are the responsibility of ECGO and its subsidiary
companies.
Cotton Ginning
19.       Cotton ginning is the process used to mechanically separate lint
from seed.  It is one of the most important steps in the processing of
cotton. The first ginneryin Egypt to pro6uce lint cotton from seed cotton
was installed around 1860. The incustry grew fast wiith the incentive
of supplying the growing needs of the U.K. textile incustry.  By 1950 there
were 105 ginneries with 6,475 ginstands. Ultimately over-capacity led to
destructive competition among ginneries and after the July 1952 revolution,
most of the owners, fearing nationalization, ceased to invest in their mills
and reduced maintenance to a minimum.  As a result, upon nationalization in
1963, ECGO inherited ginneries which were antiquated and ran-down. Thirty-
two ginneries have since been closed down leaving 73 in operation with about
4,700 ginstands.  Only three of the remaining ginTeries were built in the
last 30 years and nearly one-half are over 50 years old.
20.       Almost all of the ginneries are cramped for space, with totally
inadequate storage facilities within the premises. The ginneries, therefore,
rent or own storage yards away from the factory unit resulting in greatly
increased handling costs as well as damage to and physical loss of cotton.
Some of the existing ginneries are not well located in relation to the cotton
producing areas. Most of the operations in these ginneries are done manually,
often by women and children. Mechanical equipment requires frequent and
expensive maintenance; productivity is low and the cotton is often soiled,
thereby lowering its quality. Working conditions are unsatisfactory. The
air is filled with lint which poses health problems and fire hazards.
21.       Rehabilitation and modernization of the ginning industry is
essential to ensure reliable production of top quality cotton lint as well
as improving workirng conditions in the ginneries.  The continued operation
of obsolete and uneconomic ginneries would endanger this valuable source of
foreign. exchange. Failure to rehabilitate the industry would lead to major
breakdowns and increase operating cost.

PART IV. THE PFOJECT
Project History
22.       In March 1972  Egypt approached IDA for assistance in preparing
and financing a orogram for rehabilitating its cotton ginning industry.
With IDA's assistance in reviewing a number of suitable candidates,
ECGO engaged L. H. Handerstam, a UK firm of conmalting engineers, to assist
in forn)lating the program and preparing a project feaslbility study. The
program wilil be implemented in three phases <hring the 10-year period from
1973 to 1983 at an estimated cost of about $125 million. Under this
prograro. 12 new girLneries will be constnrcted, 42 rehabilitated and 3)i
shut down. Ginning capacity will be increased by 15 percent by 1985,
in step with an equivalent increase in Egyptian cotton output. An IDA
engineering credit of $175,000 was made in November 1972 to finance the
designh nd engineering ofr the project. L. H. Manderstam was retaaned
for this work. The proposed project, which constitutes the first phase
of the 10-year program, was appraised in December 1972. Negotiations
were held in Washington from May 31 to June l5, 1973; the Eg,rptian delegation
was led by Mr. Zakariah Tawfik, Chairman of FCGO.
Froject Description
23.       The proposed project includes the construction of four new
ginneries, rehabilitation of ten existing ginneries, provision of engineer-
ing services, technical assistance and training, and a pxogram for retraining
and reemployment of workers likely to be displaced as a result of
mechanization. A Credit and Project Summary is provided as Annex III. An
appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation
Project, EGGO" (Report No. 15la-UAR, dated June 28, 1973) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
24.       The locations and capacities of the four new ginneries included
in the proposed project have been chosen to balance ginning capacity with
cotton output in surrounding areas.  Due regard has also been glven to the
need for separating the ginning of different varieties of cotton as well as to
the availability of land, labor and other services. Two of the proposed
new ginneries would be "single"i units of 72 ginstands, and the other two
"twin" units of 144 ginstands.  Construction of larger ginneries would not
be economical because increased transportation costs of cotton from distant
catchment areas would more than offset savings in annual fixed investnent
charges. In the rehabilitated ginneries, the existing ginstands and most
of the construction will remain, but pneumatic conveying, automatic feeding
and humidifying of cotton, as well as other modern mechanical facilities
would be introduced as in the new ginneries.



-8-
Project Cost
25.       The total cost oi the project is estimated to be about $40.4.
million. The proposed IDA credit of $18.5 million equivalent would
finance all foreign exchange costs of the project (including a provision
for the refinancing of both the engineering credit, S-13 UAR of November
1972 for $175,000 a-d $53,000 for technical assistance expenses previously
paid by the Association on behalf of the borrower).  Local financing
requirements of $21.4h million equivalent would be provided from the
retained earnings of EGGO. The estimated cost of the project includes
$1.0 million for the program to retrain and raemploy workers likely to
be displaced by the project.  The proposed IDA credit would provide
$500,000 for this program, up to half of which could be used to meet
local currency expenditures. The gover nment would provide the remaining
$500,000 equivalent of local currency expenditures.
Project Implementaticn
26.       ECGO would be responsible for the project implementation.
However, with the construction and the rehabilitat,ion proceeding at 14
different locations, and with procurement covering international and local
supply as well as local fabrication from imported materials, project
management requireB considerable coordination and supervision. ECGO
would, therefore, in fulfilling its responsibility- for carrying out the
project, set up a Project l4anagement Unit and a Coordination Committee.
The Project Management Unit- would be under a Project Director, and would
include engineering consultants L.H. Manderstam who have been selected
by ECGO. The engineering consultants would assist in the implementation
of the project, and would be part of the Office of the Project 'irector
and act through him. The functions of the Coordination Committee would
include formulation of propos&ls relating to policy issues as well as
the coordination required with the five ginning companies to ensure
efficient and prompt p-oject implementation.  The Committee will also
serve as a channel of communications with other ministrics, government
departments and public authorities.  This Cormmittee woald be chaired by
the Chairman of ECGO and would include the Undersecretary or other senior
representative of the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Foreign Trade,
chairmen of each of the ginning companies, Chairman of the Pressing
Company, Director-Ceneral of ECGO, Project Director, senior representatives
of the Ministry of Agriculture and a representative of the engineering
consultants. ECGO would also appoint an experienced and qualified tech-
nical advisor or advisors, com-netent to advise on civil, mechanical and
electrical matters.



-9-
Driploym^,ent Effects
27.       The project would radically change the composition of the
work force in the cotton ginning industry. Permanent and seasonal
workers would increase, while contract workers, who are not direct
emplcyees of the ginneries but whose services are procured for a fee
based on output, would be considerably reduced. The project would
displace approximately 5,500 workers, or about half of those currently
employad in thle project ginneries.  Total wage income for the affected
ginneries wouid, however, be reduced by only about SE 200,000 or roughly
one-fourth of the pre-project wage incomes. The impact of the project
on the industry as a whole would be much less, amoanting to a 12 percent
reduction in employment and a 6 percent reduction in waga incomes. About
40 percent of the workers who would be displaced under the projecu are
children.  It is felt that, on balance, the benefits accruing to the
economy (e.g., $4.2 million increase in export earnings due to improved
cotton quality, and continued viability of cotton production and cotton
based industry) justify the proposed rehabilitation program despite the
displacement of these workers. The project would also significantly
improve the working and health conditions in project ginneries. Agree-
ment has been reached with the government and ECGO that a program for
retrainirng and reemploying displaced workers would be carried out as
part on the rehabilitation project, during which the trainees are expect-
ed to receive subsistence allowances. This program, consisting of pre-
vocational, vocational, and literacy training, would be presented by
ECGO for IDA's review by October 31, 1973. On IDA's initiative, ILO
with UNICEF assistance and financing has already conduct3d a study to
measure the employment problem that could emerge from the project. The
study would also formulate actions to be taken towards retraining and
reempl'oying of workers likely to be displaced as a result of this project.
A preliminary report arising from this study was submitted to IDA in
April 1973 and will serve as a basis for the retraining and reemployment
program.
Onlending Arrangements
28.       The government would onlend $18.0 million of the credit
to ECGO for 15 years, including five years grace, at an interest rate
of 6 percent plus a supplemental charge of 2½! percent per annum by
the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Pbreign Trade, making a total
financing cost of 8½! percent per annum. The government would make the
remainimng $500,000 of the credit available to EGGO as a grant for the
implementation of the ..retraining and reemployment program on behalf of
the govermsnt. The foreign exchange risk vould be borne by the government.
Procurement and Disbursement
29.       Equipment to be financed under the proposed credit would be
procured through intemational competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA guidelines. Equipment to be financed by the Egyptians, such as shaker
conveyors, hopper feeders, fuel tanks, small boilers and miscellaneous
electricals, is available in Egypt at prices expected to be below c.i.f.
prices of imports, and wouild be procured through local competitive bidding.
The government has agreed that, should prolonged deliveries threaten to
delay the project, it would allow this equipment to be imported.



- 10 -
Civil works would be locally financed and carried out by government-owned
civil engineering organizations, following local competitive bidding among
these organizations.
30.       The issociation would finance the c.i.f. cost of imported equip.-
ment, matc is ani spares, the actual foreign exchange cost of engineering
services and technical assistance relating to reemployment training. Disburse-
ments for expenditures incurred in Egyptian Pounds relating to reemployment
training would bo made against periodic statements of expenditures incurred.
A projected disbirsements schedule is given in Annex III.
Rate of Return
31.       The expected econoomic rate of retutrn of the project without con-
sidering the training and health benefits is ca.lculated at about 25'. Ti
these indirect benefits were quantified, the expected economic return would
rise to about 29%. The financial rate of return of this project is about 18%.
PAIC V. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Develolpment Credit Agreement between the Arab Republic
of Egypt and the Association, the dra-ft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Egyptian Cotton General Organization, the Recormmendation
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section I(d) of tThe Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Development Credit- are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART 17I.  RECOMMDATION
34.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

R. POJECTS IN EXECUTION1/
Cr. No. 181         Nile Delta Drainage Project; US$26 million Credit
of April 17, 1970; Closing Date: 1Theember 31, 1976.
The Nile Delta Drainage Authority (N)DA) was established in 1970
under the Minis -y of Irrigation for project execution.  Many of its senior
vacancies WE a Left unfilled.  Appointment of consultants was a condition of
credit effectiveness and protracted negotiations with the consultants se-
lected (VEB of Sweden) delayed this for 12 months. Since then ineffective
management, inadequate utilization of existing equipment and an unwillingness
to use the consultants have been major problems. IDA expressed to the
government its disappointment with this project's slow progress. A revised
implementation program was piepared, extending the project un-til 1978 and,
following discussions in December 1972, the government agreed to take a
number of actions recommended by IDA to improve performance and provide an
effective management. In February 1973, NDDA and the Egyptian General Authority
for Drainage (EGAD) were merged in the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage
Projects (EPADP) established by Presidential Tscree.  A new Chairman and Vice
Chairmen for the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt drainage projects were appointed
and the staff reorganized and strengthened by the appointment of additional
qualified personnel. A panel of experts was nominated to undertake project
evaluati on and action is being taken to replace the consultants for the Nile
Delta project uhose contract expired in March 1973, by next consultants w1ho
would advise and assist the authority on the implementation of both the
Nile Delta and Upper Egypt projects. The new Authority is actively working
on the arrangements for the maintenance of equipment and the storage of spare
parts and has drafted the terms and conditions under which projact equipment
will be transferred to local contractors for construction of drainage works
and for the manufacture of drainage tiles.
Cr. No. 284         E   tian Railway ProJect US$30 million Credit of

for track materi     locomotives a   spare parts- and
(ii) September 30, 1976 for signalling and teleccmmu-
nications eauipment and installation.
The project has started satisfactorily. Most of the procurement
contracts have been a-arded. Some complaints have been received about eva-
luation procedures.  It appears that delays have occurred in passing out
information to potential bidders. IDA has discussed this problem with
T4yptian Railways and steps are being taken to improve procurement- procedures
and increase the number of staff in the procurement office.
1/These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encoauntered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this senae, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.
