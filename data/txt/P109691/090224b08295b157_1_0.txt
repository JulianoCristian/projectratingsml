Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This report summarizes the results of the final implementation support mission, conducted in November, and progress made thereafter. During the
 November mission, the team reviewed the results and implementation of the project. The Implementation Completion Report author also joined the
 mission to collect data and information on the project's results and implementation.

 The team spent much of the mission discussing plans to ensure implementation and disbursement are complete prior to the project's close in December
 2014. All of the loan has been disbursed. The matching grants component has completed implementation to over 860 firms. In the business climate
 component, almost all project activities have also been completed, with the exception of two activities. The first is the presentation of the revised
 commercial code to the National Assembly. The revision and consultation of the code has been completed and it has been submitted to the Office of the
 Presidency, which will submit it to the National Assembly once approved. Consultation was completed with the National Assembly as well. The second
 activity is the completion of the purchase of equipment for the National Metrology Laboratory. Most of the equipment has been delivered, installed, and
 tested. A portion of the equipment ($60K worth of the total $400K) will arrive in customs on December 23 and must still be installed and tested prior
 to December 31. The construction of the new laboratory, financed with government funds, will be completed in 2015 and the equipment will be
 transferred and reinstalled with technical assistance from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology or the German National Institute for
 Science and Technology.

 The targets for both outcome indicators have been achieved and exceeded. Over 380 matching grant beneficiary MSMEs have introduced new products
 and processes, exceeding the goal of 80 firms. The time needed to register a business in Managua is 13 days, as measured by the latest Doing
 Business report, exceeding the target of 27 days. The PIU currently measures the time needed to register a business at 7 days, given reforms
 implemented since DB collected information. Of the project's 30 intermediate indicators, including 18 subindicators, 27 have achieved their targets and,
 of those, 20 have exceeded their targets.

 The PIU has also measured additional results and impacts that are not covered in the indicators. For example, the reforms to the Commercial Registry
 and the one-stop-shop for business start-up saw significant increases in number of transactions they are able to complete and in revenue generated.
 The number of transactions in the Commercial Registry doubled from about 6,000 to about 12,000 from 2010 to 2014. The one-stop-shop saw an
 increase in revenue from about US$20K to US$130K over the same period.The new systems in the Intellectual Property Registry contributed to an
 increase in the number of trademarks registered per year from 3K in 2010 to more than 10K in 2014. The efficiency of the new systems allowed staff to
 participate in more training events targeting MSMEs, from 4 in 2010 to 36 in 2014, which contributed to the number of MSMEs registering their brands
 from 26 in 2010 to 1,200 in 2014. Additionally, the matching grants have led to the creation of over 1,000 full-time jobs in MSMEs.

         Comments
         The target has been achieved and exceeded, as measured by the 2015 Doing Business report. The target is to reduce the time needed to
         register a business by 30%, which would be an end-target of 27 days (the end target has been corrected from prior ISRs). It is expected
         that further reductions in time will be reported in the next DB report since further reforms have been implemented since DB collection for the
         2015 report. The PIU measures the current time to register a business at 7 days.

         The matching grants component is reaching completion and has achieved and surpassed most of its targets. The third round has reached
         459 firms. The PIU is concluding follow-up monitoring and evaluation visits to beneficiaries of the third round. As such, it is possible that the
         final indicators will be slightly different than those reported here.

               The targets of reducing 30 percent the time needed to obtain a business license and construction permit in Leon, Rivas, Matagalpa,
               Bluefields, Puerto Cabezas, Chinandega, Masaya, and Granada were achieved and exceeded in many cases. The technical assistance,
               training, and equipment provided by the Project helped these municipalities improve their processes by not only reducing the processing
               time but also by contributing to increases in their tax revenue. For instance, in Rivas the tax revenue increased about 50 percent the last
               year, from US$3.9 million in 2013 to US$5.8 million in 2014. Likewise, in Leon the tax revenue increased about 60 percent during the last
               year, from US$1.2 million in 2013 to US$1.9 million in 2014. In the case of Leon, the Subnational Doing Business in Central America and
               the Dominican Republic 2015 report ranks the city number one in the region for the dealing with construction permits indicator. It is
               important to mention that the experience of these municipalities will be shared between them and with other municipalities in a
               “municipality-to-municipality knowledge exchange”, the first event will be organized in Leon in December 2014 with Project support.

               Comments
               The Ministry of Health (MINSA) targets were achieved and exceeded. The time needed to obtain health permits was reduced more than 50
               percent, from a baseline of 180 days to 78 days in 2014. Likewise, the time needed to obtain food permits decreased more than 30 percent,
               from a baseline of 15 days to 10 days in 2014. In addition, with the support of the Project, MINSA improved and automatized its processes
               by implementing a new system, which will be able to connect with other systems in Central America. Since September 2014 MINSA has
               processed through the new system about 180 new health and food permits and now is able to obtain detailed and updated data about its
               users (e.g. firm size, sector, location, etc.).

               The Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade (MIFIC) is coordinating the development of a new Commercial Code and its validation
               process (The current Commercial Code is from 1914). The first draft version has been validated at the national level with the participation of
               representatives from the private sector, civil society, academia, NGOs, and from the judicial, legislative (including the National Assembly),
               and executive powers. A technical team from the Bank has also provided inputs to the first version of the document. In addition, MIFIC
               facilitated access on its website to anyone interested in reviewing and providing comments. The final version of the new Commercial Code
               is expected to be finalized and sent to the President’s Office the 3rd week of December. After that, it is expected that the new Commercial
               Code will presented to the National Assembly.

               target by 4 months. As a result, the number of registered trademarks per year has tripled from about 3,000 in 2010 to more than 10,000 in
               2014. Likewise, revenue generated from the trademark fee services also tripled from around $400,000 in 2010 to more than $1.2 million in
               2014. Moreover, the number of training events to promote the importance of intellectual property targeting MSMEs went up from 4 training
               events in 2010 to 36 in 2014, which contributed to an increase in the number of MSMEs registering their brands from 26 in 2010 to 1,200 in

               The Ministry of Labor (MITRAB) target was achieved and exceed. For the first time, in 2013, MITRAB organized capacity building activities
               targeting MSMEs in order to promote health and safety practices with project support. About 500 owners and employees of 280 MSMEs
               participated. After the positive feedback received from the MSMEs, MITRAB has allocated its own budget for 2014 and 2015 to continue to
               hold these events for MSMEs.

               The indicator will not reach the target of US$5.8 million. This is because some funds were lost due to exchange rate differences and
               a small amount was transferred to support implementation of the grants with the project's extension. Additionally, this amount does
               not match with what shows as "allocated" in client connection, since there were further exchange rate losses since the grants were
               disbursed.

               Currently, the PIU is concluding the implementation of the third round of matching grants, and working with the 459 firms that have been
               selected as beneficiaries of the round. This indicator and ones below may be refined and may change slightly as the PIU concludes its
               monitoring and evaluation visits to the beneficiary firms of the third round of matching grants.
