                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This report fulfills the requirement of completing an ISR after a restructuring. Additionally, it summarizes the results of the June 2013 mission.

                         The second amendment to the project’s legal agreement was approved by the Country Director on July 16, 2013 and counter-signed by the Client on July 30. The restructuring
                         process took longer than expected in part due to its complexity and because the Client and the Bank agreed to incorporate an extension to the project's closing date to December 31,

                         2014. The request letter for the extension was received on July 4, 2013.

                         In addition to the closing date extension, the restructuring incorporates: (1) changes in the institutional arrangements of this project due to a government reorganization and (2)
                         revisions to the project description. The institutional arrangements will allow the new Ministry of Family, Community, Cooperative, and Associative Economy (MEFC) to co-execute the

                         project. The project description was revised to: (1) remove references to Component 3 (Increased Access to Financial Services for MSMEs), which was never launched; and (2)
                         clarify the description of some activities in Component 1 (Support to the Business Climate).

                         Among the clarifications to Component 1 were the inclusion of language related to supporting the National Metrology Laboratory. The project will not be supporting the construction of
                         the laboratory since the second parcel of land designated for this activity is no longer available. The Government has agreed to finance the construction from its own resources and
                         the project will still provide equipment for the Laboratory. A decision on the part of the Client and the Bank is needed on what the $1.2 million assigned to the construction will be used
                         for.

                         The project's indicators were also updated with this restructuring. This ISR includes the new indicators.

                         During the June 2013 mission, the team found that the project continues to produce positive results. The pace of implementation in the matching grants activity continues to be
                         satisfactory and the project is complying with the established deadlines for the third round. Results for the matching grants include increased sales, full-time employees, and the
                         introduction of new products and processes for firms that received matching grants. Business climate activities are also mostly complying with the established timeframes. Results for
                         the business climate activities are expected primarily in the last year of implementation.

                         The mission team expressed concern that the transfer process of half the project to MEFC could hurt the pace of implementation. The PIU has identified the steps necessary to
                         ensure a smooth transfer and it is expected that the team will physically move on August 19, 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A second amendment to the project’s legal agreement was approved by the Country Director on July 16, 2013 and counter-signed by the Client on July 30. The restructuring
                         incorporates: (1) changes in the institutional arrangements of this project due to a government reorganization and (2) revisions to the project description. The institutional
                         arrangements will allow the new Ministry of Family, Community, Cooperative, and Associative Economy (MEFC) to co-execute the project. The project description was revised to: (1)
                         remove references to Component 3 (Increased Access to Financial Services for MSMEs), which was never launched; and (2) clarify the description of some activities in Component 1
                         (Support to the Business Climate).

                         The restructuring also incorporates a one year extension of the closing date to December 2014. The extension is justified based on the following criteria: the development objective

                         remains achievable, the performance of the recipient is satisfactory, and the Bank and recipient have agreed on actions that will be undertaken to complete the Project. Specifically,
                         the extension will allow additional time to complete the matching grants activity and the Commerce Code revision, which are underway.
