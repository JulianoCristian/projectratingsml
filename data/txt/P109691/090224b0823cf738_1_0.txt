                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This report fulfills the requirement of completing an ISR after a restructuring. Additionally, it summarizes the results of the November 2013 mission.

                         During the November 2013 mission, the team reviewed the results and pace of implementation of the project. The team found that the project continues to produce positive results.
                         The pace of implementation in the matching grants activity continues to be satisfactory and the project is complying with the established deadlines for the third round. Results for the

                         matching grants include increased sales and number of full-time employees, and the introduction of new products and processes for recipient firms. Business climate activities are
                         also complying with the established timeframes. The component is finally producing results, including decreases in times for obtaining permits and licenses.

                         More specifically, of the project's two project development indicators, the target for one has been achieved and exceeded, while progress has been made on the other. Of the

                         project's 28 intermediate indicators, including 15 subindicators, 9 have exceeded their targets and 3 have achieved their targets. Of the rest, most are on track to achieve their targets.
                         Additionally, the pace of implementation continues to be strong. Approximately 68% of the loan has been disbursed and the project is on track to disburse the rest.

                         During the mission and thereafter, government counterparts expressed an interest in a new project to continue some of the activities of this project and to address other business
                         climate and enterprise development issues. More specifically, the activities of the business climate component have identified several other areas where significant improvements are
                         possible. The Bank team is working with their government counterparts to develop a proposal for potential activities to discuss with the Ministry of Finance and Bank management.

                         The team also reviewed the status of the transfer and any pending issues. With the amendment signed in July 2013, approximately half of the project was transferred to the Ministry
                         of Family, Community, Cooperative, and Associative Economy (MEFC). The team found that the transfer process was relatively smooth and that high levels of involvement and
                         commitment from the Government was critical. It was noted during the mission that communication between the two executing ministries could be improved. A new Minister was
                         recently appointed in MEFC. The team will request a meeting with her during their April mission to ensure her support of the project's activities.

                         With the July 2013 amendment, the Government and Bank agreed that the project would not support the construction of the National Metrology Laboratory and the Government will
                         pay for this construction from its own resources. For this reason, approximately US$1.2 million was canceled from the project in December 2013. The project is still financing the
                         purchase of equipment for this laboratory. Additionally, during the mission, the Government requested a reallocation of loan proceeds among the project categories to facilitate
                         implementation during the last year. A simple restructuring was processed in February 2014 to complete this reallocation.

                         With the July 2013 amendment, the Government and Bank agreed that the project would not support the construction of the National Metrology Laboratory and the Government will
                         pay for this construction from its own resources. For this reason, approximately US$1.2 million was canceled from the project in December 2013. The project is still financing the
                         purchase of equipment for this laboratory. Additionally, during the mission, the Government requested a reallocation of loan proceeds among the project categories to facilitate
                         implementation during the last year. A simple restructuring was processed in February 2014 to complete this reallocation.

                         Given that the project is in the last year of implementation, the Bank team will work with the Government to begin closing procedures and to ensure evaluation requirements are
                         fulfilled.
