Nicaragua were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: technical assistance at the application\n            stage leads to greater beneficiary satisfaction and success\n            of matching grants programs. Firms led by women and\n            indigenous people, as well as other marginalized groups, are\n            often those that lack the time and capacity to complete the\n            application process and moreover, understand the needs of\n            their own business in order to improve.  Given the mixed\n            results seen thus far in matching grants programs supported\n            by the WBG, it is important to invest in a rigorous impact\n            evaluation at the start of a matching grants program in\n            order to claim attribution to the project for impacts such\n            as job creation and productivity gains. The results of such\n            an evaluation can serve as a useful input to government\n            policies on future matching grants programs, and lessons\n            learned for the WBG in its future operations of such\n            programs. The establishment of a Steering Committee within\n            the counterpart government can enhance the efficiency of\n            project implementation. Such a committee serves as a\n            platform and mediating body among sometimes competing or\n            unfocused interests within a government and with other stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2015-05-27T01:51:01Z"}
