                         This report summarizes the results of the April 2014 mission and progress made thereafter.

                         During the April 2014 mission, the team reviewed the results and pace of implementation of the project. The team found that the project continues to produce positive results. The

                         established in those plans. Approximately 83% of the loan has been disbursed, including almost US$2 million between April and June 2014.

                         Of the project's two project development indicators, the target for one has been achieved and exceeded, while progress has been made on the other. Of the project's 28 intermediate

                         Given that the project is in its last year of implementation, during the April mission, the Bank team presented to the counterparts the requirements and expectations related to
                         evaluating the work and providing inputs to the Completion Report.
