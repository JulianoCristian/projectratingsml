Structural Adjustment Project\n            will be the second to support the implementation of the\n            Government's comprehensive program of structural\n            adjustment. This more intensive phase of the program is\n            outlined in the Economic Policy Declaration of the\n            Government to the Bank. The principal aim of this program of\n            basic policy changes is to promote sustainable growth and\n            increase public savings in the medium term. To achieve these\n            objectives detailed action programs will be implemented over\n            the next twelve months to: (a) further improve public\n            finance management and investment policy; (b) rehabilitate\n            parastatal enterprises and improve their management; (c)\n            make additional improvements to the agricultural incentive\n            system; (d) promote the resumption of industrial growth and\n            improve the structure of Ivorian industry through reducing\n            the excessive levels of protection and removing distortions\n            in industrial incentives; and (e) substantially reform\n            housing policy through reducing public subsidies, improving\n            private savings mobilization, and inducing a structural\n            shift in housing investment from the public to the private\n            sector. The foreign exchange provided by the loan will be\n            used to finance essential imports."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
