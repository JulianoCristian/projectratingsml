         des Travaux d'Interet Public contre le Sous-Emploi\n            (AGETIP) activities in secondary cities; b) the development\n            of pilot activities to test the feasibility of AGETIP's\n            approach in other areas; c) the organization of training for\n            the municipalities and the small and micro enterprises\n            engaged in project implementation; and d) to make AGETIP a\n            sustainable agency covering its operating costs on a fee\n            basis.  Project components are : 1) the continuation and\n            expansion of AGETIP's public works program of public\n            facility and infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance\n            in urban areas; 2) a program of 3 pilot activities which\n            include: i) application of AGETIP procedures to the\n            development and management of municipal revenue-earning\n            infrastructure; ii) a program to improve efficiency of\n            procurement of goods; and iii) the development and testing\n            of AGETIP-type mechanisms to support rural investments; and\n            3) a training and studies component.  The third component\n            will support: a training program for local engineering\n            firms; a monitoring component for project progress; a study\n            and selective audit of the Public Investment Program; and\n            technical assistance to assess the feasibility of\n            establishing a mutual guarantee company for small contractors."}, "docdt": "1992-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
