and d) to make AGETIP a\n            sustainable agency covering its operating costs on a fee\n            basis.  Project components are : 1) the continuation and\n            expansion of AGETIP's public works program of public\n            facility and infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance\n            in urban areas; 2) a program of 3 pilot activities which\n            include: i) application of AGETIP procedures to the\n            development and management of municipal revenue-earning\n            infrastructure; ii) a program to improve efficiency of\n            procurement of goods; and iii) the development and testing\n            of AGETIP-type mechanisms to support rural investments; and\n            3) a training and studies component.
