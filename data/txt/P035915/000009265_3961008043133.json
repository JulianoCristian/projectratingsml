to rehabilitate\n            transport and urban infrastructure; and 3) to efficiently\n            execute works by private small- and medium-sized enterprises\n            by delegating contract management to an AGETIP-type agency\n            (public works executing agency). To achieve these\n            objectives, the project will support development and\n            implementation of a sector-specific policy framework and\n            three investment components. The policy agenda is designed:\n            a) to increase sector resource mobilization and efficiency\n            of resource use; b) to futher strengthen the institutional\n            environemnt and disengage the Government from public\n            enterprises in the transport sector; c) to improve the\n            management of road rehabilitation and maintenance; d) to\n            promote the use of private sector; and e) to increase the\n            efficiency and competitiveness of the contracting of works.\n            The three investment components include: transport\n            infrastructure rehabilitation, urban infrastructure\n            rehabilitation, and capacity building programs."}, "docdt": "1995-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
