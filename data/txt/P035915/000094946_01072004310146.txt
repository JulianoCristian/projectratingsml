3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project objectives, as stated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), were to assist the Borrower
in: (i) improving the management of economic and social urban infrastructure; (ii) rehabilitating transport



and urban infrastructure; and (iii) increasing the efficiency of private and small- and medium-sized
enterprises to carry out works within the transport and urban infrastructure sectors.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable.
3.3 Original Components:
The project as described in the DCA consisted of the following:
Component A: Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program of the Priority Network of Roads and Ports
(US$14.7 million or 49 percent of base costs)
1. Rehabilitation of about 150 kms of roads, including the construction of necessary engineering
structures, such as service bays, inverts, culverts, and small bridges.
2. Periodic maintenance of about 90 kms of roads through, inter alia, pavement sacrification, grading and
shoulder regravelling, and small engineering structures.
3. Routine maintenance of the road network through selective interventions, including cleaning ditches,
filling potholes, regravelling dirt roads, grass clearance from shoulders, and installation of wet set
barriers.
4. Rehabilitation of the Bubaque and Cacheu ports, including rehabilitation of the quay, berthing
structures and storage facilities.
Component B: Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program (US$10.5 million or
35 percent of base costs)
A. Water and Sanitation:
1. Rehabilitation of the water distribution primary network (including the replacement of about 7 km of
leaking main water pipes) and water storage; connecting and extending approximately 2.4 km of
200-250 mm water pipes; and strengthening about 4.5 km of piping.
2. Rehabilitation of earth and concrete drainage, including the rehabilitation of four outlets, clearing
existing and new earth and concrete drainage.
3. Implementation of a pilot program intended to develop adapted and sustainable methods for solid waste
collection and disposal.
B. Street Paving and Drainage:
Carrying out a street improvement program in Bissau and seven secondary market towns (Buba, Bissora,
Canchungo, Farim, Bafatu, Gabu and Catio), including street paving for motorized and non-motorized
traffic, repairs of sidewalks and culverts, and construction of neighborhood access streets and intersections.
C. Small Urban Infrastructure:
1. Constructing and rehabilitating small economic and social infrastructures; such as primary schools,
basic health centers, neighborhood markets, butcheries and small terminals for inter-city transport.
2. Carrying out strategic studies to improve investment planning and maintenance of social infrastructure
in urban areas.
Component C: Capacity Building Program in Sector Management and Planning (US$4.1 million or
13 percent of base costs)
1. Institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Social Infrastructure (MSI) through, inter alia, carrying
out studies on: (i) traffic; (ii) Road Fund administration and management; and (iii) future sectoral
- 2 -



operations, carrying out in-service and short-tern training programs for staff, providing technical
advisory services, office equipment acquisition (including computers and materials), vehicles and
rehabilitation of existing MSI facilities.
2. Carrying out short-term  workshops on business administration, financial management, work
organization and labor intensive techniques for contractors, architects and engineers taking part in the
execution of the project.
3. Strengthening municipalities capacity, neighborhood and user associations to secure minimum funding
or participation for maintenance of existing urban infrastructure, through information programs and
technical advisory services to assist in preparing feasibility studies and technical project proposals.
4. Institutional strengthening of AGEOPPE through, inter alia, the acquisition of goods (including office
equipment, computers and vehicles) and providing technical advisory services.
3.4 Revised Components:
Not Applicable.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry is considered unsatisfactory. On the one hand, project objectives were in line with Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) priorities of February 1993 and the Government's Letter of Sector Development
Policy of May 1995. They were clearly stated in the SAR and did not lead to any ambiguity during
implementation. By appraisal, the Government had taken steps to demonstrate its readiness for the project
by reducing the number of public sector staff, particularly, through the privatization of public enterprises
and road maintenance brigades. The Government also agreed to establish an AGETIP-type agency
(AGEOPPE) and delegate contract management to it. AGEOPPE was successfully created prior to
negotiations and a draft statute and Manual of Procedures (MOP) were prepared. Being a new agency, the
project included a program of technical assistance for capacity strengthening of AGEOPPE. Project
preparation was financed by a Japanese Trust Fund and a PPF. The preparation team completed several
key activities, including (a) inventory of subprojects for the first year's portfolio; (b) selection of pilot
works to be contracted after negotiations; and (c) preparation of the 1995-99 rehabilitation and
maintenance program of the roads priority network.
On the other hand, the number of policy changes was ambitious. The project expected total disengagement
of the Government from direct involvement in road, water and air transport during the life of the project.
While some reforms were initiated or completed prior to project effectiveness, there were a few that proved
to be overly demanding and complex for the Government and were not completed within the timeframe
intended. For example, the country was unable to attract serious investors to its air and water transport
industries during the project. Another problem is that the project team failed to secure donor commitment
for 30 percent of project costs, as planned at the beginning of the project. While cofmancing "was expected
to be confirmed before credit effectiveness" (SAR p. 25), the project became effective even though the
cofmancing arrangement was not pinned down.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Overall the project outcome is rated unsatisfactory.
Improve the management of economic and social urban infrastructure:
The outcome of this objective is mixed. On the one hand, the Ministry of Social Infrastructure (MSI)
- 3 -



succeeded in streamlining its activities and surrendering execution of public works to AGEOPPE during the
early part of the project. This allowed the MSI to focus on key policy-setting activities. MSI's most
significant achievement was setting up a sector development policy and a sector specific policy matrix that
allowed it to guide and control sector activities. However, execution remains weak, as discussed in Section
4.5. Its staff were also trained.  Unfortunately, MSI headquarters, including project assets, such as
vehicles and office equipment, were completely destroyed by the civil war. While MSI is operating in
temporary facilities, its effectiveness is seriously constrained by inadequate logistics.
Rehabilitate transport and urban inffrastructure:
The outcome of this objective is also mixed. Many roads were successfully rehabilitated and maintained:
114 km of paved roads and 112 km of dirt roads were rehabilitated, and successful periodic maintenance
was carried out on 17 km of paved road and 24 km of dirt road. Some of these achievements exceeded SAR
expectations (see Section 4.2). Routine maintenance activities were carried out during 1996, 1998 and
2000, which alleviated transport bottlenecks and vehicle maintenance costs for a short period of time. The
two ports slated for rehabilitation under the project were successfully rehabilitated. Similarly, most streets,
particularly in Bissau central, were improved through paving, provision of sidewalks, repair of culverts,
and drainage, for example. The problem, however, is that roads deteriorated badly as a result of the civil
war, heavy rains, and continued lack of maintenance, which increased transportation costs and worsened
transport bottlenecks, particularly with respect to access to poor areas.
The Government did not succeed in refomning and managing the Road Fund as set out in the project. A
delay in carrying out a study to reorganize the Road Fund (i.e. setting up payment mechanisms and
accountability) contributed to the first project suspension (Section 5). Once the suspension was lifted, there
were further delays in adopting the recommendations of the Road Fund study; hence, covenanted amounts
were not channeled into a dedicated Road Fund account to be used primarily to pay the project counterpart
funds and for road maintenance.
The Government was slow in carrying out reforms related to the liquidation/privatization of Transport
Aero de Guinea-Bissau (TAGB) and Empresa Publica de Transportes Rodoviarias e Fluvais
(RODOFLUVIAL) in the air and maritime sub-sectors. While liquidation did occur, the country could not
attract private investors, nor did the project provide support for the next phase of the privatization process.
The program for rehabilitation and improvement of the water supply distribution system was not executed.
Similarly, health centers and markets were not rehabilitated as had been envisaged in the project. These
components were designed to be financed by other donors. As the project did not succeed in attracting
donors, they could not be implemented as planned.
Increase the efficiency of private and small- and medium-sized enterprises to carry out works within the
transport and urban infrastructure sectors:
This objective has been partially met. In compliance with the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the
Government provided funds, facilities, services and other needed resources to establish AGEOPPE and
delegated to it the necessary powers to procure goods and services.  The Government produced and
implemented an action plan. There were difficulties with the Manual of Procedures (MOP) and application
of the Bank's procurement guidelines.  These were addressed late in the project, including a complete
revision of the MOP for all AGETIP operations throughout West Africa and training on procurement
issues conducted by Bank staff. A discussion of procurement problems is provided in Section 5.3.
Local private enterprises were successfully used for periodic and routine road maintenance, instead of the
former inefficient force account method. The project provided employment to over 720 road maintenance
- 4 -



laborers during implementation. As described below, local skill capacity was enhanced to execute contract
work, which was satisfactory. From March 1996 to March 2000, AGEOPPE successfully organized 23
training programs in the form of seminars, workshops, and courses for its staff, Government (particularly
the MSI), consultants and contractors. These programs were implemented over a total of 202 training days
(an average of 50 training days per year) and were attended by over 510 participants. In the field of
construction, about 115 work contracts were prepared, and 98 of them awarded (mostly to local
contractors) through local competitive bidding and sole selection.
In the field of consultant services, one of the project objectives was to generate a market for the emergence
of small- and medium-sized consulting finns, while the number of employees at the MSI was supposed to
be reduced. This did not materialize, as the country's crisis situation was not conducive to developing a
real private sector in Guinea-Bissau, and the solution adopted by AGEOPPE was to distribute contracts to
small firms owned by active civil servants. As this practice is not allowed in IDA-financed projects, most
consultant contracts under the project were declared misprocurement cases (see Section 5.3).
4.2 Outputs by components:
An evaluation of the achievement of objectives and outputs by project components is presented in the
matrix in Annex 8.
As indicated in the Annex, the project succeeded in meeting and/or exceeding SAR expectations in the
rehabilitation of roads (component Al) and the improvement of two ports (component A4). A total of 114
km of roads were paved (as against the planned 74 kIn); similarly, 112 km of dirt roads were rehabilitated
(compared with the planned 76 kIn). Work on the ports was satisfactorily completed in September 1999.
Periodic road maintenance (component A2. 1) was satisfactorily done, although the completed work was
about 30 percent of SAR expectation. Finally, capacity building in sector management and planning
(component C) was satisfactorily done.
By mid-1998, routine maintenance was carried out on about 47 percent of roads targeted at appraisal.
Maintenance work was interrupted by the civil war and, unfortunately, it never resumed to the pre-war
level because of continued failure to use the Road Fund as agreed.
The water supply and sanitation component was not implemented as designed (as indicated in Section 4.1
above). Instead, 11 boreholes were sunk to provide emergency relief Investments in social infrastructure
rehabilitation (health centers, slaughter houses, markets and small tenninals for inter-city transport) were
also not carried out. Because of the project's failure to secure extemal donor funding, as intended at the
start of the project, about 30 percent of the project remained unfunded.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
While a detailed ex-ante economic rate of return (ERR) was not done for the entire project, analyses were
done for the rehabilitation and maintenance program of the priority network of roads, which account for
over 50 percent of project investments. The SAR estimated that ERRs for road repair and maintenance
ranged from 20 to 61 percent, with an average of 38 percent based on the standard user cost-savings
methodology, but the SAR did not provide details on the economic evaluation. Economic benefits were
also expected from a reduction of vehicle operating costs (SAR estimates 40 to 45 percent).  At
completion, it is noted that most works have been done as planned, but were negatively impacted by the
combined effects of the war, heavy rains and lack of maintenance. Additionally, traffic data collection that
might have been done during project execution was destroyed during the war. The basic traffic data for
- 5-



measuring the actual economic impact of the road component of the project is therefore not available.
While some investments may have positive ERRs, overall, there is no apparent reduction in vehicle
operating costs as a result of the project.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Because of the varied nature of the project's investments, a financial rate of return calculation was not
included in the SAR.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Overall, the institutional development impact of the project in the road sub-sector is modest. Sector
management and planning remains weak at the central level. Instruments for road maintenance planning
have not been developed efficiently. The Road Fund has been created, but it continues to finance general
budgetary activities of the Government rather than being solely used for road maintenance. Procedures are
not transparent and work supervision is not up to standard. Technical assistance has been provided, but the
project has failed to develop a real private sector for consultant services (see Section 5.3).
AGEOPPE was successfully created under the project and survived the civil war. In the context of Guinea
Bissau, it constitutes the main reference for public works, construction and urbanization sectors, since MSI
has been further weakened by complete destruction of its headquarters and disappearance of almost all of
its files and equipment. However, AGEOPPE still does not have an adequate contract management system,
which needs to be urgently addressed, since AGEOPPE will be responsible for managing the civil works
components of Bank-financed projects. AGEOPPE is currently supervising the civil works component
under an ongoing National Health Development Program (Cr. 3010). A detailed action plan was
recommended by the final IDA supervision mission to improve AGEOPPE's contract management
capacity.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The implementation period was marked by very high inflation and local currency erosion, which made it
difficult for the Governmuent to meet its agreed counterpart funding obligation.
Eleven months of political conflict and civil war (June 1998 to May 1999) led to the second suspension of
the project (June 1998 to August 1999). The Bank placed the country in non-accrual status as of
December 2, 1998. While the accrual status was restored on May 28, 1999 following the Government's
clearance of its arrears to IDA, suspension on this Credit was not lifted until the Government removed
project implementation constraints. The physical impact of the war on the project includes:
*   Total destruction of the MSI building, which had been rehabilitated by the project and equipped with
computers and other office equipment. Five new vehicles purchased under the project were either
destroyed or stolen during that period. Although AGEOPPE's office was spared during the war, it lost
some project assets (vehicles, computers and motorcycles).
*   Most contractors lost materials and equipment, and a few went bankrupt and were unable to continue
their contracts after the war. In most cases, AGEOPPE was unable to recover advanced payments
made to contractors who became bankrupt as their bank guaranties were not honored on the basis of
force majeure.
-6 -



*   The conflict broke out at a time when most road contractors had already started construction with a
view to completing works prior to the start of the rainy season.   When the rains started in
August/September, roads were washed away and made worse than pre-construction conditions. Most
contracts, subsequently, had to be regrouped into lots and were retendered and re-awarded.
Donors were expected to provide about 30 percent of the project costs. This did not materialize, and
implementation of the project, as designed, was substantially affected.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government defaulted on three DCA provisions, which led to the first Credit suspension in April 1997.
These include: (a) carrying out a study and implementing an action plan (no later than June 30, 1996) to
privatize or liquidate TAGB; (b) carrying out a study and implementing an action plan to reform the Road
Fund no later than December 31, 1996 (including the promotion of road users' participation in managing
the Road Fund); and (c) agreeing to pay counterpart funds of US$555,000 in 1996 and US$580,000 in
1997. It is noted that the suspension was lifted in June 1997 when prescribed conditions were met,
including partial payment of counterpart funds.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control.
AGEOPPE did not use agreed procedures with regard to procurement of works and consultant services. A
procurement audit, done by an independent auditor in September 2000, pointed out many cases of
non-compliance in contract award with regard to either the DCA or AGEOPPE's MOP. Some of these
civil works contracts were given the Bank's no-objection, and because of this, a decision was taken not to
declare misprocurement for civil works.
Regarding consultant services, AGEOPPE allowed the use of civil servants as contractors, which in part
stems from the scarcity of skilled manpower for the prescribed work. In any event, this apparent conflict of
interest did not support the project's objective of improving the skills and competitiveness of contractors
and encouraging the formation of indigenous consulting firms while reducing the size of civil service staff.
As the use of civil servants as consultants is not allowed in Bank-financed projects, and taking into account
that contracts were awarded on a sole source basis without IDA prior review and no-objection, the
consultant contracts under review were considered as having been misprocured. As a result, the
Government has been asked to reimburse the related funds representing a total amount of US$92,925.
Following the technical audit, an Action Plan was prepared for implementing improved procurement
procedures by AGEOPPE.
The MOP was revised and standardized in 2000 for adaptation and use by all AGETIPs. AGEOPPE has'
completely and formally adopted the new MOP, a copy of which was sent, to the Bank after a joint
Bank-AGEOPPE review in January 2001.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total project cost was estimated at US$33.5 million to be financed by: IDA (US$22.0 million or 60
percent of total costs); the Government (US$2.5 million or 7 percent); and donors (US$9.0 million or 27
percent). Because firm commitments were not obtained from donors, a reduced project was executed
without their contribution.
Disbursements were suspended twice for a total of 14 months. The Credit was fully disbursed. IDA
- 7 -



disbursements were satisfactory, starting with greater momentum than planned for cumulative years 1996
and 1997, but this slowed in line with the country's difficulties.

The Government was expected to provide a total of US$2.5 million by making 6 monthly installments of
US$625,000 to the project account. Throughout the 5-year project implementation, the Government paid
only 36 percent, or US$901,300 of its obligations. No payments were made during the project's extension
to December 31, 2000. The Government, therefore, did not meet its commitments, as required by the DCA.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of this project is not likely for two major reasons.
First, the policy setting body, MSI, is unable to function effectively. Logistical equipment and vehicles
procured under the project (on behalf of MSI) were destroyed by the civil war, which also destroyed the
MSI building. While MSI operations have resumed in temporary facilities, logistical support is lacking and
its ability to function in a meaningful way is therefore compromised. The country has asked for assistance
to rehabilitate some of the roads and facilities destroyed by the war.
Second, the Government's commitment to the Road Fund continues to be lacking.  At appraisal, the
Government agreed to a study to reorganize the Road Fund. The study recommended that a dedicated
account be set up and used solely for routine road maintenance. This has not been done and Road Fund
revenues are still being channeled into a general central Government account. It was agreed at the time of
project appraisal to accrue a total of US$5.5 million (current US$) over the period 1995 to 2000; however,
based on the information provided by the Government, only 16 percent (or US$0.9 million) was accrued in
the Road Fund. It is noted that the major portion (about 70 percent) of the physical investments was used
for road rehabilitation and maintenance and necessary training to develop capacity for contractors and
communities to play a role in roads and other social infrastructure maintenance. Sustainability of these
investments relies primarily on setting up proper mechanisms for channeling Road Fund revenues into road
maintenance. Roads are already deteriorating and trained contractors are not being fully utilized.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
AGEOPPE was-created to execute the project and carry out maintenance and other project infrastructure
investments. As such, the project dealt with the agency in charge of regular operations. With respect to its
continued operations, it appears that in spite of the effects of the war and limited recurrent financing,
AGEOPPE continues to operate with some degree of success. AGEOPPE was able to resume work on the
project after the war ended (in spite of the Govemment's inability to provide needed funds).   Since
AGEOPPE is improving its capacity to work in this area, it will continue to be a focal point for this

investment and future projects in this sector. The Bank will no longer finance recurrent AGEOPPE costs.
AGEOPPE will finance its operations from a percentage (or fee) of investment costs for project
components it will be executing.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.] Lending:
Project preparation is rated unsatisfactory. On the one hand, the project design took into consideration the
experience of lessons learned from five previous operations in Guinea Bissau, which led to the project's
focus on a limited number of strategic objectives and the inclusion of an AGETIP-type agency to enable
more efficient procurement, contracting and payment procedures. The project's objectives were closely
aligned with the Government's objectives and action plan, as detailed in the Government's Letter of Sector
Development Policy, and the Bank's project team worked closely with the Government's team to ensure
project readiness (see Section 7.4). On the other hand, some of the policy changes required by the project
were overly ambitious and difficult to attain during project implementation (see Section 3.5). Additionally,
the project team failed to confirmn donor funding by effectiveness, as intended in the SAR.
7.2 Supervision:
Project supervision is rated highly unsatisfactory because of the following: (i) procurement problems were
not addressed adequately and in a timely manner, even though the execution agency was very new and
inexperienced. The Bank did not adequately provide assistance during supervision. This led to the
identification (by a technical audit) of cases of misprocurement, as discussed in Section 5.3 above.
Normally, deviations picked up by the technical audit should have been addressed during the course of a
normal supervision; (ii) supervision missions never included a Bank Procurement Specialist, even though
this was planned in the SAR; and (iii) the Bank gave no objections on civil works contracts, which were not
procured using the Bank's normal procurement procedures.
The mid-term review was initially scheduled for 1997, but had to be postponed by 12 months. It finally
took place in 1999, the year of the original credit closing date. Had the original date been kept, a full
review of the country and project situation could have been done and corrective measures taken in a timely
manner with respect to the aforementioned procurement deviations.
On the other hand, the supervision team successfully addressed early implementation problems with respect
to compliance with agreed policies, which led to increased exchanges with Government and finally to
decisions to suspend the Credit twice. The support given to the country, especially immediately after the
civil war, is commendable as it ensured that the project was revived inmmediately following the war and
continued to its completion.
In terms of supervision missions, the Bank could not follow the supervision plan in the SAR because of
country difficulties. Three missions were planned in 1998, but only one was done, most likely due to the
war; similarly, only one mission was done in 1997. The Credit closing date was extended by one year to
December 2000, and four supervision missions were conducted during that year. The Bank showed
leniency and sympathy by taking immediate action to support the re-activation of the project despite poor
response in counterpart funding, perhaps in an attempt to support the country during a very difficult
post-conflict period.

7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
On the basis of the above, the Bank's performance is rated as unsatisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during project preparation is rated as satisfactory as it articulated its
objectives for the sector in a Letter of Sector Development Policy and also met needed conditions for
project effectiveness, including setting up a new agency (within a relatively short time) to expedite project
execution.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's implementation performance is rated as unsatisfactory.
The Government started well by meeting the agreed conditions for project effectiveness within a short time.
The Government also established a sector policy on transport and urban infrastructure, which helped the
project to a good start. However, within one year, the Government began defaulting on some DCA
covenants, which led to the first suspension of disbursement for a period of four months.
In order to support the Government's ability to provide counterpart funds, the project funded a study to
effectively set up a Road Fund mechanism. The Government also rehabilitated support facilities and
trained staff with the aim of strengthening operations and management of the Road Fund. In spite of these
initial efforts, the Government persistently failed to comply with the project requirement that the Road
Fund be earmarked for the project's counterpart fund and for road maintenance. As a result, the
Government paid only 36 percent of its required contribution to total costs, and road maintenance is not
being done. Future funding of road maintenance is also in jeopardy.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
AGEOPPE's overall performance is rated as satisfactory. It is noted that, in the context of Guinea-Bissau,
AGEOPPE is an asset when compared to the capacity of other Government agencies. Although
AGEOPPE was a new and relatively inexperienced agency, it succeeded in disbursing all project funds as
intended. AGEOPPE is expected to survive and continue functioning in an improved manner following its
recent adoption (in January 2001) of a revised MOP. However, a procurement audit in September 2000,
revealed major issues with respect to civil works and consultant contracts (see section 5.3), which were not
managed appropriately by the new agency.  The latter did not get the required quality assistance
(supervision) to help it perform its duties adequately in this area.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
- 10-



The following lessons are derived from the design and implementation of this project:
a)    Donor funding: Commitment for the provision of donor funds was expected prior to project
effectiveness. Donor funds were not secured and 30 percent of the project could not be implemented. This
experience reconfirms the importance of ensuring that firm commitments from all sources of funding
necessary for successful completion of the project exist prior to signing or effectiveness.
b)     The Road Fund: The Fund was created, but the Govemrnent did not put in place institutional
mechanisms to make it operate as it should. There was no adequate system for work planning, neither was
there a system for transferring funds from the central Government. If collection procedures had been put
into place and effectively followed, the Fund would have been able to fully finance road maintenance. The
experience suggests that: (i) necessary mechanisms and procedures should have been clearly accepted and
put in place prior to Credit negotiations or effectiveness; and (ii) when a Government is not fully committed
to following through, then the whole approach should be reconsidered.
c)    AGEOPPE: AGEOPPE was created in a short timeframe just prior to Credit negotiations. It
worked relatively effectively, but it deviated from the MOP and World Bank procurement guidelines.
Procurement is a central issue in the supervision of a project, but it was not treated as such. The lesson
from this project's experience is that for new AGETIP-type agencies, Bank supervision teams need to
remain close to the client during the first years of project execution in order to avoid problems, such as
misprocurement, which were caught by a technical audit toward the end of the project. At least one
procurement audit should have been done after the first year for a newly created project implementation
agency.
d)     One general recommendation is that in a project such as this, with two suspensions followed by a
war, the Bank should have done a re-appraisal of the project at the end of the conflict. Based on the
evidence in the files, the project was just restarted without change. The project should have been
restructured using an emergency approach, and instead of focussing on policy reforms, funding should have
been moved to emergency maintenance. This approach could have put the country in a stronger position to
seek follow-on sector funding and resume sector policy dialogue.
9. Partner Comments
