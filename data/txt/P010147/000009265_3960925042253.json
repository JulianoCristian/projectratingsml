The Bank relationships with the Government of\n            Nepal, local government and the Project Authority have been\n            good. Consistent International Development Association (IDA)\n            attention to the project contributed to its success. The\n            project achieved its goals even though the physical targets\n            were revised during project implementation due to changes in\n            both the scope of the project and the procurement mode for\n            the main civil works contract. The weaknesses identified in\n            project implementation were: (a) lack of structured\n            incentives for farmers to be more involved in the project\n            cycle from an early stage; for example, formation of\n            effective WUGs and construction of field channels by farmer\n            groups were less effective before a timely and reliable\n            water supply was provided, and (b) inadequate project\n            preparation as evidenced by the mapping error and lack of a\n            realistic assessment of the relative feasibility of Local\n            Competitive Bidding (LCB) and International Competitive\n            Bidding (ICB) civil works contracts. The lessons derived\n            from this experience have been incorporated in the\n            formulation of the follow-on project."}, "docdt": "1990-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
