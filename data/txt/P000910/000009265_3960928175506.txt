MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR AN URBAN II PPOJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SOR 53.7 million (US$70.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a second
urban project. Cofinancing amounting to SDR 7.5 million (US$9.8 million
equivalent) is being sought.
2.        Background:  Over the past 20 years the urban sector in Ghana
has been characterized by disintegrating infrastructure and services,
neglected revenue bases and weak institutions. Housing is scarce,
dilapidated, deteriorating and, by international standards, extremely
expensive. Also, the housing market is one of the most distorted and
inefficient in the world. Conservative estimates indicate that about
US$300 million equivalent would be required just to rehabilitate essential
infrastructure and services in the five largest towns 1/, to say nothing of
the cost of addressing development needs, housing rehabilitation,
institutional reform or human resource development. Cofditions in the
cities will have to be reversed if they are to maximize their contribution
to economic recovery. Poor infrastructure and services and weak local
government institutions impose heavy costs on economic activity and drain
national resources. Poor and expensive housing, and weak housing
institutions create serious indirect problems for domestic resource
mobilization and the efficiency of government expenditure.
3.        The Government of Ghana (GOG) clearly recognizes these problems
and, as part of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP), began taking measures
to reverse urban decline, encourage greater local government autonomy, and
reduce local government's reliance on the national budget. The Association
supported these efforts through a US$25 million credit for the Accra
District Rehabilitation Project (ADRP) and a US$10.6 million credit for the
Priority Works Project (PWP). The latter focussed on alleviating
unemployment and poverty as part of the Program of Action to Mitigate the
Social Cost of Adjustment (PAMSCAD). ADRP has been successful, and PWP,
after a slow start, is now showing positive results. But GOG's potentially
most far reaching move to date has been the implementation of its
decentralization program. This involved the creation of 45 new local
governments (bringing the total to 110), and the granting of wide powers to
local authorities. In addition, GOG has now placed housing very high on
its agenda for immediate action.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement:  The project is part of a long-
term strategy to restructure the local government and housing sectors in
Ghana. This restructuring is a 10-15 year process and only IDA is equipped
I/ Accra, Kumuasi, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi and TamAle.



to assist Ghana with such a task. Under ADRP, IDA has had considerable
success in assisting GOG to rehabilitate urban infrastructure and build
local government technical and financial capacity. In both these projects
IDA played a pivotal role and broke new ground. However, the urban and
housing problems are complex, and continued Bank support would be critical
for consolidating the gains made so far, and for tackling the hitherto
neglected problems which retard the efficient development of the urban
sector.
5.        Proiect Oblectives:  The project has two quite distinct and
separable components, Local Government Sector Rehabilitation and Housing
Sector Refo-m. The primary objectives of the Local Government Sector
Rehabilita,ion component are:  to help rehabilitate and improve essential
infrastructure, services and environmental systems; and to strengthen the
technical, financial and managerial capacity of local government. Efforts
will focus on Accra, Kumasi, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi and Tamale, as well as
on the Ministry of Local Government (MLG). The primary objectives of the
Housing Sector Reform component are to help to initiate fundamental reform
of the housing parastatals and the housing finance system; begin to relieve
the acute shortage of affordable houses; improve the environmental
conditions and provide essential infrastructure and service for the urban
poor; and strengthen the Ministry of Works and Housing. A secondary
objective of the project is to strengthen environmental management and
monitoring. It should be noted that although sector rehabilitation and
reform objectives are being pursued, disbursements would be against
specific investments.
6.        Proiect Description:  The project includes the following
componentss
Part A - Local Government Sector Rehabilitation (LGSR): (a)
Infrastructure and Environmental Systems Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Works--roads, drains, sewerage, markets, and
environmental sanitation; (b) Municipal Revenue Mobilization --
financial management and property revaluation and tax reform;
(c) Land Admin4stration -- mapping and pilot land adjudication sub-
project; (d) ML_ Training Program Development and Project Management
Support (technical assistance, equipment, materials, training, for
sector and project studies, and for ope-ational and management
support for project agencies and for the Environmental Protection
Council).
Part B - Housing Sector Reform (HSR): (a) Urban Upgrading Works; (b)
Housing Consolidation Studies (completion/divestment studies for
uncompleted GOG-owned urits); (c) Institutional Reform
(commercialization/privatization) of Housing Parastatals; (d) a line
of credit for a pilot Housing Finance Sub-project (establishment of a
Home Finance Company (HFC) and initiation of an indexed housing
finance system that will provide mortgages for about 2,000 new sales
units and conversion of 1,000 parastatal - owned rental units to
sales); and (e) technical assistance, training, vehicles, equipment
and operational support for sector reform and project management.



- 3 -
The infrastructure and environmental systems, municipal revenue
mobilization, urban upgrading and housing consolidation components are the
extensions of initiatives begun under ADRP and PWP. Wowever, the proposed
land administration, local government sector support, housing sector
institutional reform. and housing finance components are new.
7.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$100.4 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$63.5 million equivalent
(632). A breakdown of costs and financing plan are show in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown at Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are given in
schedules C and D respectively, and relevant maps are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8331-GE dated May 9, 1990, is also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions:  During negotiations agreements were reached on
actions to implement the property revaluation and revenue mobilization
component, and to strengthen MLG and city technical departments iucludings
(a) the steps necessary to meet the revenue and expenditure targets in each
of the years 1991-96; (b) annual joint reviews by ILO, each project city,
and IDA of progress made and steps required to meet revenue and expenditure
targets, and to strengthen municipal financial and engineering management;
and (c) establishment of the Local Government Project Support Unit (LGPSU)
and Training Support Unit (TSU) by February 1, 1991. The following
agreements were reached on the pilot housing finance component: (a) the
terms and conditions of the Merchant Bank's management agreement vith UPC;
(b) the types of units to be built; (c) the terms and conditions for
financing HPC, including bond issues and purchases; (d) the terms and
conditions of OSI participation; (e) the terms and conditions of NFC and
OSI mortgage financing; (f) the terms and conditions for procurement and
disbursement and the operation of the HFC special account; (g) the term.
and conditions of BOG financial supervision of HPC; and (h) annual joint
reviews by GOG (HFIC) and IDA of WYC's and OSI's performance. Finally,
agreements were reached on the details of the parastatal reform component,
including annual joint reviews by GOG (HYIC) and IDA of the progress, and
on actions to review and strengthen the foreclosure laws during the first
two years of the project in order to make it feasible for legally
constituted financial institutions to expeditiously recover on bad debts.
The following would be conditions of effectivenesss (a) execution of a
Financing Agreement by GOG and NFC; (b) execution of the HWC management
agreemen, with the MBG; tc) the submission to the Bank by GOG of the
detailed financial projections, and operational guidelines for EYC; and (d)
execution by MWH of agreements with consultants to undertake studies to
restructure the housing parastatals.
9.        Justification and Risks:  By strengthening the local government
and housing sectors, and by improving vital urban infrastructure and
services, the project will support the ERP, strengthen the urban economy
and the financial system, improve the efficiency of land and housing
markets, improve the living conditions of the urban poor, improve access by
moderate households to affordable housing, create employment and relieve
poverty. There are several significant sets of risks, however. There is
the general risk that project size and complexity may overtax GOG's
implementation capacity and ability to provide counterpart funds on a



- 4 -
timely basis. This risk was successfully managed In the Accra project.
Urban II, while more complex, should not present much greater risks since
implementation capacity was developed under ADR? and Wruld be even further
developed under the project through training and technical assistance.
10.       Apart from the general risks outlined above, the Pilot Housing
Finance sub-project presents specific risks.   First, is the risk that
pressures may be brought to bear on GM to raise the proposed modest
housing standards. Existing expectations are high and COG may pay a
political price for introducing lower, even though more realistic
standards. Second, if the proposed indexation system is not carefully
managed it can be politically manipulated to provide large implicit
subsidies rather than a sustainable source of finance. Third, legal and
political difficulties with foreclosures could result in significant
financial losses to the system.  Partly because of this risk the hcssing
finance component is being developed on a pilot basis. Also, specific
comuitments were sought and obtained from COG prior to negotiations. Thesa
include, Lnter all*, a Housing Policy Statement indicating GoG's commitment
to the proposed standards and to the institutional and financial
arrangements for the establishment of the pilot housing finance component.
The Housing Policy Statement also includes an undert&king to review and
strengthen the foreclosure laws during the first two years of the project.
The private sector role in the development of the housing finance system
should also limit the political risks. Finally, risks would be addressed
through extensive country dialogue and the careful calibration and
scheduling of proposed reforms. Given the urge y which GOG now places on
housing and their recent actions to begin restructuring the housing
parastatals, the prospects for success are good.
