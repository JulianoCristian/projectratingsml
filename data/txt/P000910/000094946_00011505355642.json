The performance\n            of the Bank was satisfactory, with full collaboration with\n            the Borrower, whose performance was very satisfactory, for,\n            measures were taken to encourage local government authority,\n            and decrease reliance on the national budget. Key lessons\n            include: 1) multi-sector projects, involving various\n            implementing agencies, will succeed through institutional\n            support mechanisms, particularly in the absence of adequate\n            monitoring by the lead Ministry, as in this case, whose\n            success was, largely due to the supporting infrastructure\n            within the implementing unit; 2) the success of the housing\n            finance system is due to strong leadership, who ensured that\n            housing, titling and financing were in accordance with the\n            design - adapted to local conditions, management, loan\n            mechanisms, and foreclosure laws; 3) while large civil\n            contracts succeed, partly, if considerable time and effort\n            is devoted to negotiating claims by the contractors, the\n            services of claim specialists, may facilitate the stress on\n            performance, substantially; 4) strengthening municipal\n            capacity was key to project sustainability; however,\n            capacity building may be affected if transfer of trained\n            staff is constant; 5) co-financing should be identified at\n            project preparation to ensure timely loan effectiveness;\n            and, 6) the need exists for a development framework,\n            particularly a strategy for fiscal decentralization."}, "docdt": "2000-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
