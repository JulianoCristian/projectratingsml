The Borrower was\n            concerned about its foreign exchange risk in borrowing from\n            the Bank, and was able to secure several grants to cover a\n            substantial part of the needed foreign exchange. Prior to\n            cancellation, the project also suffered initial delays due\n            to the Bank not receiving adequate external debt data, a\n            condition of loan signing. This was resolved in May 1989,\n            but the legal documents were never signed. The Ministry of\n            Economy and International Cooperation and the Ministry of\n            Finance caused other delays during 1989."}, "docdt": "1997-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
