PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SECOND ALEXANDRIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(Loan 2993-EGT)
Background and Project Scope
1.   In September 1988, the World Bank Group approved a loan of US$36 million
(Ln. 2993-EGT) to the Alexandria Water General Authority (AWGA) with the Government of
Egypt (GOE) as guarantor to finance the Second Alexandria Water Supply Project. The project
was cancelled more than a year later at the request of the Government and the legal documents
were never signed.
2.    The Project was designed to: (i) improve the water distribution in AWGA's network by
rehabilitating and strengthening Alexandria water distribution system, optimizing system
operation, and investigating and correcting the causes of unaccounted for water; (ii) improve
AWGA's operation, maintenance and metering practices through technical assistance and
manpower development; and (iii) improve AWGA's capital structure and financial performance
by promoting appropriate pricing policies and greater operating efficiency.
3.    The loan was to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of rehabilitating and
strengthening the Alexandria water distribution system, and of improving operation,
management and metering practices. The Project consisted of: (i) the rehabilitation of about 450
km of secondary water distribution pipelines up to 300 mm in diameter and replacement of
associated house connections; (ii) the supply and installation of about 50 km of main
transmission pipelines with a diameter of 600 mm and above, the construction of water storage
reservoirs with a capacity of about 100,000 m3, and associated pumping stations; (iii) the
provision of operational equipment and water meters; (iv) assistance of experts for construction
supervision; (v) engineering studies covering project planning and preparation, operation and
maintenance, and system planning and operation; and (vi) on-the-job training seminars for
AWGA's staff in areas of planning, operation, maintenance, project management, and
construction supervision.
Project Cost and Financing Plan
4.    The project was to be implemented over an eight-year period. Its estimated cost was
US$102.5 million, which included about US$12.5 million of duties on imported pipes and equipment.
The foreign exchange component amounted US$64 million or 62 percent of the total cost. The Bank
was to finance about 35 percent of the project cost and the remaining 65 percent by National
Investment Bank (38 percent), Italy (22 percent) and GTZ of Germany (5 percent). The
breakdown of costs and the financing plan is attached. The Bank was to finance 56 percent of

the total foreign exchange component for: (i) selected operational equipment and materials; (ii)
civil works; (iii) experts' services for construction supervision.
Loan Signing/Effectiveness
5.   Initial delays were due to the Bank not receiving adequate external debt data, a condition
of loan signing. This was resolved in May 1989. The Ministry of Economy and International
Cooperation (MOEIC) also encountered difficulty in obtaining the agreement of the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) to the capital restructuring of the AWGA as agreed during negotiations.
Although the problem was resolved in July 1989, MOEIC decided to delay signing until late
September of that year, immediately before the return of the People's Assembly from summer
recess, to minimize commitment charges. Signing of agreements between AWGA and the two
cofinanciers (Italian Government and GTZ) was a condition of effectiveness.
Reasons for Cancellation
6.    On January 2, 1990, GOE informed the Bank of its decision not to proceed with the
project and that Bank's participation in financing the project was not needed. Concerned at its
foreign exchange risk in borrowing from the Bank, the Borrower (AWGA) was able to secure
several grants to cover a substantial part of the needed foreign exchange. Also, most of the
goods required by the project were available in the local market (though at higher cost than under
ICB).
Lessons Learned
7.    The main lesson learned from the project is that attempting to pursue the implementation
of a project in the absence of clear Government commitment to seek Bank financing is unlikely
to be successful. In this case, a decision should have been taken early to terminate project
processing.
