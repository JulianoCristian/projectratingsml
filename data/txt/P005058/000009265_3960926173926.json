The proposed\n            project consists of: (i) the rehabilitation of secondary\n            water distribution pipelines and replacement of associated\n            house connections; (ii) the supply and installation of water\n            main transmission pipelines and construction of water\n            storage reservoirs and associated pumping stations; and\n            (iii) the provision of parts, equipment, and other materials\n            to improve operations and reduce the level of unaccounted\n            for water. It further entails: (iv) assistance of experts\n            for construction supervision; (v) engineering studies for\n            both system and project planning and preparation; and (vi)\n            on-the-job training and training seminars."}, "docdt": "1988-08-24T00:00:00Z"}
