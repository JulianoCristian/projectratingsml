LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      The Alexandria Water General Authority (AWGA).
Guarantor:     The Arab Republic of Egypt.
Loan Amount:  US$36.0 million equivalent.
Terms:         Twenty years, including five years grace at the standard
variable interest rate. AWGA will bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Project
Description:    The objectives of the proposed project are to improve AWGA's
water distribution, its operation, maintenance and metering
practices, and its capital structure and financial
performance. The proposed project consists of: (i) the
rehabilitation of secondary water distribution pipelines and
replacement of associated house connections; (ii) the supply
and installation of water main transmission pipelines and the
construction of water storage reservoirs and associated pumping
stations; (iii) the provision of tools, automotive equipment,
consumer meters, flow and pressure recorders for main
transmission lines, spare parts, laboratory equipment,
computers and other materials to improve operations and reduce
the level of unaccounted for water; (iv) assistance of experts
for construction supervision; (v) engineering studies for
project planning and preparation, operation and maintenance,
and system planning and operation; and (vi) on-the-job training
and training seminars for AWGA's staff in areas of planning,
operation maintenance, project management, and construction
supervision.
Benefits       The proposed network rehabilitation and leak detection programs
and Risks:     will save substantial quantities of water; the comprehensive
technical assistance and training program will foster
managerial efficiency and contribute to AWGA's overall
institutional development; and other measures will improve
AWGA's capital structure and financial performance. By 1996,
the proposed project will benefit about four million people,
including one million poor. There is little risk that the
major objectives of the Project will not be met. The project
technology is simple and should pose no difficulty, while the
technical assistance component is comprehensive and has the
full commitment of AWGA and the Government.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SECOND ALEXANDRIA WATER SU'PPLY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
L. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Country Background
1.01     Egypt has an area of about one million square kilometers and, except
for the Nile river delta and the coastal strip along the Mediterranean Sea, is
practically rainless. It is estimated that Egypt's current population of
about 47 million will grow at a rate of about 2.6% per annum and :.iil reach
about 66 million in the year 2000. About 30 million inhabitants, or 65% of
the country's present population is concentrated in Cairo, the Suez Canal
Cities and the Nile Delta which occupy less than 5% of the country's total
surface area. Cairo is the capital and largest city. The total population of
greater Cairo is about 12.0 million. Alexandria, the second largest urban
center, has about 2.9 million inhabitants. The rate of urban population
growth is about 3.6% per annum. At this rate, the urban population is
projected to increase from 21 million or 47% of total population in 1984 to
about 37 million or 56% of the population in 2000.
Water Resources
1.02     Egypt's main water source is the Nile River, which supplies
approximately 55 billion cubic meters of water each year. Due to population
growth, industrial development and agricultural expansion, the demand for
water is increasing rapidly, and water resource management has become
increasingly important. This is particularly so at present since the flow in
the Nile has recently been well below the long-term average and is expected to
reach only about 49 billion cubic meters in 1988. A Water Master Plan for
Egypt is being prepared with financing from UNDP and USAID, with the Bank as
executing agent in cooperation with the Ministry of Irrigation. This Master
Plan is expected to provide the Government with the necessary guidance to
optimize the development and use of the nation's water resources, and to
reinforce the country's planning capacity. In the case of potable water,
which currently uses about five percent of total resources, the key issues are
water quality and delivery of adequate and timely quantities to the consumer.
1.03     Potable water is obtained from wells and from the Nile River and
irrigation canals. South of Cairo, groundwater is usually free from salinitv
and, although it sometimes contains high proportions of iron and manganese, it
normally requires little treatment other than disinfection by chlorination.
North of Cairo and the Fayoum Depression, it is generally brackish and needs
blending with fresh surface water. In the coastal area of the Nile Delta



-2-
groundwater is unsuitable for drinking purposes, and communities depend on
surtace water from irrigation canals and the Nile River. Such surface waters
require elaborate treatment and disinfection and often necessitate long
transmission pipelines to reach demand centers.
WaterSUDDlY
1.04    About 90X of Egypt's population live in areas served by public water
supplies. The remaining population obtains its water from local sources such
as canals, the Nile River or private and often polluted wells. In general,
public water supplies are inadequate and often *i asafe and inconvetuient.  As a
result, about 27Z of the total population, including 442 of those located in
rural areas rely wholly or in part on non-public, and often highly polluted
water sources.
t.05    Separate water authorities serve Greater Cairo and Alexandria, while
the Suez Caaal Authority supplies Port Said, Ismailia and Suez. Elsewhere,
the housing directorates of the governorates iperate regional water systems
aid small community well systems, and some 15 large towns operate their own
municipal systems.
1.36    About 80Z of the population of Greater Cairo and 99% of the population
of Alexandria are served by house connections, the remainder by public
standpipes, while in provincial Egypt, anywhere between 40% and 80X of the
urtan and only 5% of the rural population are served by house connections.
1.0'    Water supply is inadequate throughout provincial Egypt due to
instfficient water treatment capacity, and undersized, old and corroded
distribution systems. Supply is rarely available 24 hours a day in the urban
area; and much less in the rural areas. The quality of the water reaching
consnmers is often below acceptable standards. Recent average water
prodtction has been estimated at 76 lcd, and average consumption at less than
40 lcd, indicating that unaccounted for water has averaged around 50% of
production.
Sewer, ige and Sanitation
1.08    About 702 of Egypt's urban population either have access to a public
wastewater disposal system or use septic tanks or soakaways. The remainder,
composed mostly of public standpipe users, rely on dry disposal methods. In
genera., rural communities lack piped sewerage facilities and are provided
with v.ults or soakaways for sullage disposal. In other cases, sullage water
is emptied onto the streets. Only a small proportion of the houses in rural
areas hive pit latrines, and frequently defecation is carried out in the
fields ir in farm sheds. In the settlements where there are mosques, ablution
facilities and toilets, serviced by septic tanks, are usually provided.
1.09    Some 18 municipal sewerage systems operate throughout Egypt, the two
largest being those of Cairo and Alexandria. Another seven systems are under
constru:tion and 13 are in the planning stage. In addition, in 13 Nile Delta
towns wiere the water table is high, groundwater lowering schemes have been



3
constructed for the dual purpose of drainage and wasLewater collection, a
practice which is being discontinued in favor of conventional sewerage
systems.  The Alexandria General Organization for Sewerage and Sanitary
Drainage is currently implementing major improvements to the Alexandria sewage
collection system to cope with present and projected effluent flows.
Health Aspects
1.10    Limited access to potable water and lack of proper sanitation
facilities, particularly in the crowded poor urban districts and the rural
areas, have led to high incidences of parasitic and infectious diseases in
Egypt. Typhoid/paratyphoid and infectious hepatitis are endemic, and reported
cases recently ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 per year for infectious
hepatitis. The potential risk of contracting water-borne and water-related
diseases is very high because of the general lack of sanitation facilities and
the ease of obtaining untreated contaminated water from nearby irrigation
canals and private shallow wells, which many of the people have to rely on
either entirely or to supplement inadequate public water supply.
Sector Organization
1.11    The Water Supply and Sewerage sector was reorganized in April 1981,
when under Presidential Decree No. 197 the National Organization for Potable
Water and Sanitary Drainage (NOPWASD) was created. The new organizetion was
given broad responsibilities to formulate policies for potable water supply
and sanitation, to plan at the national level and to provide guidance to the
governorates for the development and operation of potable water supply and
sanitary drainage systems. NOPWASD does not, however, have jurisdiction over
the urban governorates (including Alexandria) which had their own water supply
authorities prior to 1981 (para. 1.05). NOPWASD reports to the Ministry of
Construction, New Communities and Public Utilities.
1.12    It is the Government's intention to decentralize sector planning,
decision making, and project implementation, as well as the responsibility for
systems operation and management. These responsibilities are being gradually
taken over by the governorates. It is expected, however, that at least in the
medium-term the governorates of provincial Egypt will continue to rely heavily
on NOPWASD for assistance in project planning and implementation. It is also
estimated that the governorates will be unable to raise the necessary funds
for the substantial investments needed, and that some of these funds will be
provided by the Government. Currently all financing is arranged by the
Government and all major investments require Government approval. These
practices are expected to continue. Decree No. 197, mentioned above, left the
governorates free to decide how they would carry out their new
responsibilities in the sector. The Government is now considering adding
sewerage to the responsibilities of the water companies which have been or
will be established by the governorates.



-4-
Sector Development Objectives
1.13    Ultimately the Government aims to provide an acceptable level of water
supply and sanitation service within the means of tihe population. The major
deficiencies of the water supply and sewerage sector in the provincial areas
of Egypt have been identified as: (i) fragmentation of responsibility for
operations; (ii) lack of planning at regional and local levels; (iii)
inadequate investment levels; (iv) low tariffs and poor cost recovery; (v)
shortage of dedicated managers and skilled staff primarily due to very low
salary levels; and (vi) poor operating and maintenance practices, primarily
due to shortage of operating funds and lack of trained and motivated staff,
resulting in badly deteriorated systems in urgent need of rehabilitation.
Similar problems also exist in the urban areas where there is a need to
strengthen institutions, improve financial viability through appropriate cost
recovery policies, and to rehabilitate and upgrade systems to improve services
and reduce unaccounted-for water to acceptable levels. Sectoral development
strategy is, therefore, oriented toward resolving these deficiencies.
Bank's Past Involvement in the Sector
1.14    The Bank became first involved in Egypt's water supply subsector in
1977 when it approved Loan 1369-EGT to assist in the financing of a water
supply project in Alexandria. This pro,ect was satisfactorily completed in
19851'. Also in 1977, a study of Egypt's water supply and sewerage sector
was conducted by the World Health Organization/World Bank Cooperative Program
which identified sector deficiencies and provided specific recommendations on
strategies (para. 1.13). This study was followed by a water supply
feasibility study, financed by Credit S-20, to review the priority for water
supply development throughout provincial Egypt, physical and institutional
requirements and funding needs and to prepare water supply projects in the
Beheira and Kafr El Sheik Governorates. The Bank is participating in the
financing of a water supply project in the Governorate of Beheira with IDA
Credit 1156-EGT approved in 1981. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) is
helping to finance a similar project in Kafr El Sheik. The Beheira Water
Supply Project is contributing to institution building and it is intended to
be used as a model to address the sector development needs of provincial
Egypt. In October 1983, as part of the Bank's strategy to assist the
Government in provincial Egypt, the Bank approved Engineering Loan 2352-EGT
to: (i) study the physical and institutional needs for improving water supply
services in the Governorates of Daqahliya and Damietta and for improving
sewerage and sanitation services in these two governorates and in the
Governorate of Beheira; (ii) prepare detailed designs of identified projects;
and (iii) provide assistance to implement proposals for institutional
development. Pa,t (i) of this project is now complete however, the Government
decided recently  o proceed with parts (ii) and (iii) with its own local
consulting resources and requested cancellation of the unused portion of this
loan.
Lessons Learned
1.15    The Bank Group's experience in the water supply sector indicates
general project implementation slippage due to delays in contract award and
I'  PPAR No. 6792 dated May 20, 1987.



- 5 -
slow execution of works by public sector construction companies. The Beheira
Provincial Potable Water Supply Project (Cr. 1156-EGT) incurred additional
delays because the detailed engineering designs were prepared only after the
start of project implementation. These delays have inter-alia affected the
ability of the Beheira Water Company to obtain tariff increases as the Beheira
Local Council has been reluctant to grant increases in the absence of tangible
service improvement. The fir3t Alexandria Water Supply Project (Ln. 1369-EGT)
demonstrates the need to address the question of unaccounted for water and to
design and include in prospective projects effective programs for its
reduction. It has also become apparent that the efficiency with which sector
entities operate and maintain their facilities should be increased. These
issues are being addressed in the ongoing Beheira Provincial Potable Water
Supply Project (Cr. 1156-EGT) as well as in the proposed Project.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.16    Egypt's existing water supply infrastructure is old, under-dimensioned
and often under-maintained. System water losses ara excessive, and cost
recovery low. The magnitude of required investments and funding have been
exacerbated by fast increasing population and rapid urbanization. The
Government's recent policies in the hater sector aim at greater efficiency in
meeting demand through a number of measures including realistic pricing of
service. Its sector objectives are: (i) to improve productivity and the
quality of service through increased capacity utilization and the introduction
of preventive maintenance; (ii) to encourage water conservation through
appropriate pricing; and (iii) to strengthen sector institutions. The Bank
can assist the Government to pursue these objectives by giving policy advice
on technical, financial and institutional aspects of sec-or operation and
development while providing and helping to secure much needed foreign currency
funding for water system expansion and rehabilitation.
II. PROJECT AREA, SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND
Background
2.01    Alexandria is the second largest urban agglomeration in Egypt.  It
extends over 25 kilometers along a narrow strip of Mediterranean coastline
west of the Nile river delta. It is the country's principal seaport, an
important industrial center and a busy holiday resort with excellent highway
and railroad connections and an airline service to Cairo. Its climate is
equable with temperatures ranging between 15°C and 25°C and annual
rainfalls between 150 and 200 mm. At the November 1986 census, the population
living within city limits numbered 2.9 million. At the current growth rate,
Alexandria's population is projected to reach 4.0 million by the year 2000.
2.02    The City of Alexandria's rapid population growth and density increase,
like those of other Egyptian urban areas, have not been accompanied with
commensurate development of urban infrastructure. The implementation of the
Master Development Plan prepared by the Housing Directorate of the
Governorate, for the period extending to the year 2000 has stagnated because
of lack of resources and insufficient control over the city's development.
There is a severe shortage of dwellings for the low and medium income level



population, and all urban services including transport, water supply, sewage
collection and disposal, and solid waste management need improvement.
Present Service Area and Facilities
2.03    AWGA's service area covers the entire Governorate of Alexandria and
part of the Mersa Matruh Governorate some 300 kilometers to the West and part
of the Beheira Governorate about 70 kilometers to the South, where it supplies
about 2,900,000, 210,000, and 160,000 domestic consumers, respectively. In
addition it supplies water to industry, tourism, and shipping in the
Alexandria area.
2.04    The rated capacity of six existing treatment plants increased from
830,000 m3/day to about 1,500,000 m3/day as a result of the rehabilitation
and expansion carried out under Bank Loan 1369-EGT. Additional treatment
capacity currently under construction will bring the total to about 2,500,000
m3/day, which -- given the measures included in the proposed project to
reduce unaccounted for water, strengthen operation and maintenance, and
improve cost recovery (paras. 3.04 and 5.05) -- should be sufficient to meet
demand until the year 2005. The distribution network, including ongoing
upgrading works, consists of about 3,400 kilometers of pipes, 28 booster
pumping stations, and 15 water storage reservoirs with a total capacity of
about 220,000 cubic meters. Detailed description of the water supply system
is presented in Annex I.
2.05    In FY87, approximately 520 million m3 of water were produced, about
265 million m3 were sold, and 255 million m3 or about 49% of the water
produced, were unaccounted-for. There are about 340,000 connections of which
about 99% are metered. The development of the water distribution system has
not kept pace with the increase in population density in some areas where the
size of existing pipes no longer suffice to carry the volume of water needed
to satisfy the o.emand. Furthermore, part of the network is very old and
suffers from widespread corrosion and tuberculation, a major cause of
unaccounted for water and one which has been aggravated by higher system
pressure resulting from increased production.
Proiected Population
2.06    In the period 1987 to 2006, the populations served in each of the
Alexai.dria, Beheira and Matruh Governorates are projected to grow at average
annual rates of about 2.6%, 3.3X, and 4.9% respectively.  AWGA's overall
population served would grow at an average of about 2.8% per year. These
projections are summarized below:
Year      Alexandria      Beheira        Matruh          Total
1987      2,900,000       210,000       160,000       3,270,000
1991      3,200,000       250,000       220,000       3,670,000
1996      3,620,000       290,000       270,000       4,180,000
2001      4,100,000       340,000       330,000       4,760,000
2006      4,750,000       390,000       400,000       5,540,000

In addition to local residents, the Alexandria area receives tourists during
the sumer months. Last summer, these were estimated at about 500,000. They
are projected to reach about 875,000 by the year 2005. These population
figures are based on projections prepared by the Central Agency for Public
Mobilization and Statistics. They take into account land availability and
industrial and holiday resort development potential.
ProMected Water Consumnption and Production
2.07     Per capita domestic water sales in the project area are projected to
increase at an average rate of 2.7Z per annum from their present level of 137
lcd to 194 lcd in the year 2000. This increase is expected to be brought
about by a continuation of the historical overall increase in consumption and
more accurate billing of water actually consumed. The water sales projections
are based on the assumption that corrective actions which will take place as a
result of the comprehensive technical assistance program included in the
project (para. 3.04) will reduce unaccounted foc water from its currently
estimated level of 492 to about 252 of water produced by the year 2000. Total
domestic water sales are thus expected to increase from their present level of
164 million m3 per year to 328 million m3 per year in the year 2000. The
current outlook is that the general character of the city will not change
materially in the foreseeable future and that domestic and non-domestic water
sales will continue to increase at about the same rate. On this basis,
non-domestic water sales are expected to increase from their present level of
102 million m3 per year to 204 million m3 per year by Lhe year 2000.  Thus
the total water consumption would reach 532 million m3 by that year.
Projected population, water production, water sales and unaccounted for water
appear in Annex 2, while a graphic comparison of water production and sales is
given in Annex 3.
m. THE PROJECT
Project Origin
3.01     The project concept was first discussed with AWGA in August 1984.
AWGA had identified areas where distribution network extensions were needed,
sections of the distribution system where pipes were old and records indicated
they were excessively corroded and tuberculated, and areas with low pressures
due to inadequate size of distribution pipes. AWGA was also concerned with
the excessive level of unaccounted for water (para. 2.05).  Project
preparation proceeded rapidly with the assistance of consultants. The studies
which followed identified the need for network reinforcement, strategic
interconnections between production facilities, additional transmission
pipelines, and replacement of corroded, tuberculated and undersized
;         distribution network.  AWGA also prepared designs and tender documents for
distribution system improvements. Finally, a comprehensive technical
assistance component including various engineering studies and the
investigation and correction of unaccounted for water was formulated. The
project was thus appraised in April 1985. Processing of the project was held
up, however, pending resolution of two issues. First, the Government was
unwilling at the time to arrange for the conversion into equity of some US$196



- 8 -
million equivalent which AWGA owed to the National Investment Bank of Egypt.
It was also reluctant to borrow Bank money for the technical assistance
component then estimated to cost close to US$5 million equivalent.
Eventually, in mid-1987, the Government and the Bank arrived at a mutually
acceptable alternative to gradually improve AWGA's debt/equity position
(paras. 5.05 and 5.06), and concessionary financing was identified for the
technical component. In view of the time elapsed, data had to be updated, and
a new appraisal was carried out in November 1987.
3.02     During project preparation, World Bank missions reviewed AWGA's
studies of the water distribution system and the proposed recommendations for
its improvement. The German Aid Agency, GTZ, also liaised with a Bank mission
to develop a program of technical assistance to improve AWGA's planning and
operational efficiency.
Project Objectives
3.03     The objectives of the Project are: (i) to improve water distribution
in AWGA's network by rehabilitating and strengthening the water distribution
system, optimizing system operation, and investigating and correcting the
causes of unaccounted for water; (ii) to improve AWGA's operation, maintenance
and metering practices through technical assistance and manpower development;
and (iii) to improve AWGA's capital structure and financial performance
through appropriate pricing policies and greater operating efficiency.
Project Description
3.04     The project consists of the following components:
(i)    the rehabilitation of about 450 km of secondary water
distribution pipelines up to 300 mm in diameter, and replacement
of associated house connections;
(ii)    the supply and installation of about 50 km of water main
transmission pipelines with a diameter of 600 mm and above, the
construction of water storage reservoirs with a capacity of
about 100,000 m3, and associated pumping stations;
(iii)    the provision of tools, automotive equipment, consumer meters,
flow and pressure recorders for main transmission lines, spare
parts, laboratory equipment, computers and other materials to
improve operations and reduce the level of unaccounted for water;
(iv)    assistance of experts for construction supervision;
(v)    engineering studies covering project planning and preparation,
operation and maintenance, and system planning and operation; and
(vi)    on-the-job training and training seminars for AWGA's staff in
areas of planning, operation maintenance, project management,
and construction supervision.

Project Cost
3.05     The total project cost is estimated at US$102.5 million (LE 428.6
million), with a foreign exchange component of US$64.0 million (LE 257.7
million) or about 622 of the total cost. Identifiable taxes and duties amount
to about US$12.5 million or about 12X of the total cost. The estimated cost

3.06     The base costs are expressed in January 1988 prices.  They were
calculated on the basis of recent quotations for the supply of similar
equipment and materials, and on tender prices for civil work in Alexandria
updated to January 1988. Physical contingencies of 10% were added to the base
cost of rehabilitation and extension works. Finally, price contingencies were
added to the sum of base costs and physical contingencies at the following
rates:

The project costs and associated expenditures during the project implementation
period are estimated at LE 684.4 million. Of this amount, LE 220.1 million or
322 would be financed by internally generated funds, LE 132.6 million, or l9S
by grants from the Government, GTZ and Italy, and LE 331.7 million, or 492 by
borrowings from the National Investment Bank of Egypt, and the Bank.
3.09     The foreign exchange component of the project would be provided
entirely by the proposed Bank Loan, and grants from Italy and GTZ. The
Government of Italy has agreed to provide about US$22.5 million equivalent to
finance the rehabilitation of secondary distribution system pipelines and main
transmission pipelines in the Gabbary district of Alexandria. The German Aid
Agency, GTZ, has also agreed to provide about US$5.5 million equivalent to
finance a comprehensive technical assistance program (Annex 6) and related
operational equipment. The proposed Bank Loan would provide the remainder of
the foreign exchange requirements. AWGA would carry the foreign exchange
risk. Signing of the Co-Financiers Agreements would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Loan. During negotiations, AWGA agreed to take
all actions required on its part to ensure that each year its annual budget is
adequate to meet the estimated annual expenditures under the Project and to
promptly inform the Bank in conjunction with the annual review of its
financial projections (para. 5.06) in the event such budget would not be
sufficient to meet the expenditures of the year under review. The packaging
and funding of the foreign exchange component of the proposed project appears
at Annex 7 and is summarized below:

Project Implementation
3.10     AWGA will be responsible for project implementation.  For this
purpose, a project implementation team will be headed up by the Vice Chairman
for Financial and Administrative Affairs, assisted by the Vice Chairman for
Revenues and Customer Affairs, the Manager of the Planning Department, the
Manager of the Research Department and the Project Manager. During
negotiations, AWGA agreed to contract experts to assist in the supervision of
construction and to assign to such experts the necessary counterpart staff by
March 31, 1989.  It also agreed to ensure the assignment, by the end of 1988,



- 12 -
of the experts required to assist in the implementation of the first phase of
institutional development (para. 3.04 [vl), to keep the Bank informed of
progress in the assignments carried out by such experts and of plans,
including the time schedules, for the implementation of the second phase of
the institutional development component. To a large extent the need for
rehabilitation of AWGA's system stems from past inadequate maintenance.
During negotiations AWGA agreed to ensure the adequate staffing and equipping
of its maintenance divisions by December 31, 1988. An Implementation Program
which includes these and other actions aimed at institutional improvements
appears at Annex 8. Project implementation is expected to start towards the
end of 1988 and to be completed by December 31, 1995. A project
implementation schedule is given at Annex 9.
Land Acquisition
3.11     Pipeline routing will follow public rights-of-way and already
acquired easements, and therefore no land acquisition is needed. Reservoirs
and pumping stations will be located on land already available to AWGA.
Procurement
3.12     The main works to be partly financed from the Bank Loan will be
divided into ten contracts for the supply of pipes and materials, and numerous
small contracts for the laying of pipes and other civil works. The project
elements financed by Italy for the supply and laying of pipelines would be
grouped in a single contract. The procurement arrangements for the project
are as follows:

with Bank Guidelines or procurement under bilateral aid according to
cofinanciers procedures, and "FA" covers work by AWGA force account.
3.13     Contracts for the supply of pipes, fittings and operational equipment
will be procured through ICB. The manufacturing of pipes and fittings is well
developed in Egypt. For such goods, local suppliers are expected to win about
601 of all contracts awarded through ICB. The contracts for the supply of
pipes will be grouped as far as practicable in order to attract international
competition. For this type of contract, minimum individual grouping of
US$500,000 will be retained. In addition, the project as a whole will be
advertised internationally so that interested foreign firms will have the time
and opportunity to participate in the bidding process. For bid evaluation
purposes, qualified domestic manufacturers would receive a preference of 15%
of the CIF price or the prevailing import duty, whichever is lower. Exemption
from the general restriction on import of certain goods, including pipes and
water meters, (Decree No. 333) has already been obtained for the project.
3.14     Operational equipment and goods costing less than US$200,000 per
contract may be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB).
Quotations from potential suppliers will be sought in accordance with Bank
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans. Since the value of the



- 14 -
individual contracts is small the LIB procedure is appropriate. International
and local shopping will be permitted for the procurement of goods costing up
to US$20,000 for the same reason. The value of items procured through LIB and
shopping procedures outlined above will not exceed US$2 million in aggregate.
The construction of reservoirs, pumping stations, and civil works for the
rehabilitation of the distribution system and the laying of transmission
pipelines will be procured in accordance with Local Competitive Bidding
procedures (LCB). This procurement method will be optimal considering the
size and dispersal of works both in terms of time and location. Recent
experience with International Competitive Bidding (ICB) shows that only the
firms represented in Egypt have submitted bids for similar types of civil
works contracts. The total value of the eight contracts procured through LCB
will be about US$20.1 million or about 202 of the total project cost, and at
the agreed disbursement percentage (para. 3.16), about 17% of the proposed
Loan. In order to avoid disturbances in day-to-day operations, small works
relating to pipeline repair works and connections, valued at about US$0.3
million, will be carried out by force account and financed by AWGA.
Employment of consultants financed by the bank loan will be in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Documents for all Bank
financed contracts expected to cost US$200,000 or more will be reviewed by the
Bank prior to inviting tenders. For Bank financed contracts expected to cost
less than US$200,000, AWGA will furnish the Bank with copies of the contracts,
together with the analyses of the respective bids and decisions for award.
Procurement financed under bilateral aid will be in accordance with the
cofinanciers' procedures.
3.15     Local competitive bidding procedures are generally consistent with
the need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the project. There
are, however, a few procedures which are inconsistent with Bank procurement
guidelines and others which require clarification. The procedures and
proposals to improve them are detailed in Annex 10. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that all LCB will be done in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
Disbursement
3.16     The proposed Bank loan of US$ 36.0 million equivalent would be
disbursed against the cost of project components as follows:

3.17     The estimated quarterly disbursements of the Bank loan are given in
Annex 11. These are based on the proposed construction schedule and
approximate the standard disbursement profile for specific investment loans to
Egypt, except that they lag slightly in early years due to the concentration
of bilateral financing during this period. Disbursements are expected to be
completed a year after project completion (para. 3.10). The Closing Date of
the proposed loan would thus be December 31, 1996.
3.18     In order to ensure ready access to foreign exchange, during
negotiations AWGA agreed to open and maintain a Special Account in the
National Bank of Egypt in which the Bank upon request from AWGA will deposit
funds up to an Authorized Allocation of US$2.0 million. The Special Account
will be replenished against withdrawal applications of at least US$500,000
equivalent at monthly intervals or, as appropriate, when the undisbursed
balance of the Account is equal to about 50 percent of the Authorized
Allocation. All disbursements under the project would be made against
standard documentation except for contracts below US$20,000 which would be
claimed under Statement of Expenditure procedures (SOE). All SOE will be made
available for examination by Bank supervision missions. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that the Special Account and the SOEs would be audited in
conjunction with the annual audit of AWGA's accounts (para. 4.14).

TV. THE BORROWER
G.eral
4 01     The project will be carried out by the Alexandria Water General
Autthority (AWGA), the borrower. AWGA was founded in 1879 as a limited
co.mpany. A fully Egyptian management replaced the former British management in
IS54. The then existing company was nationalized in 1961, and became a
General Authority in 1968. AWGA is responsible for the provision of potable
wa-er in the Alexandria Governorate and parts of the Beheira and the Matruh
Gov-rnorates (para. 2.03).
MaCement and Organization
4.02     AWGA has a twelve-member Board of Directors composed of four of its
senior managers, its Chairman and three of its four Vice-Chairmen, four
representavives of the Alexandria Governorate, one representative of the
Beheira Govwrnorate, two members of the High Public Health Institute of the
University of Alexandria and one of its former chairmen.  The Board approves
AWCA's budget., financial statements, investment plans, and major contract
awards.
4.03     A management team composed of the Chairman, four Vice-Chairmen and
several General Managers and Managers heading up specialized activities
conduct the day-to-day operations of the Authority. Functional
responsibilitie£ are grouped under the four Vice-Chairmen: Technical Affairs,
Production and Distribution, Revenues and Customers' Affairs, and Finance and
Administration. Planning, design and construction as well as procurement,
finance and general administration are centralized at headquarters in
Alexandria, while production, distribution, billing, collection and customer
relations are carried out at the ten branches located throughout AWGA's
territory. The current organization works well. The latest Organization
Chart appears at Annex 12.
Staffimg and Traiing
4.04     AWGA is adequately staffed with suitably qualified personnel at the
management and supervisory levels. Such staff are generally recruited through
public advertisement, although new graduate engineers are obtained through the
Ministry of Labor. AWGA has no difficulty in recruiting and retaining these
staff. Its overall staff turnover is relatively low, although it continues to
loose qualified technical staff to the private sector due to the prevailing
low level of remuneration in the public sector. It presently has a total of
4,037 employees, or about 12.4 per 1000 connections, which is higher than
average for entities with a similar volume of activities. The preE'ont level
of staffing, however, represents a noteworthy improvement over a year ago when
there were about 13.3 employees per 1000 connections. Further productivity
gains are expected and the future level of staffing is expected to reach about
10.4 employees per 1000 connections by 1998.



- 17 -
4.05     All new engineers upon joining AWGA spend one full year at the High
Public Health Institute of the University of Alexandria to acquaint themselves
with the bacteriological, and general health related aspects of the water
supply industry. Last year a total of 102 of AWGA's middle management staff
also received management training in the Government's Central Organization for
Administration and Organization in Alexandria. Courses last from two to four
weeks. A wide variety of staff including engineers, chemists, lawyers,
accountants, personnel officers, and others participated. In addition, 14
technicians received training in industrial security, accident prevention,
etc., at the Workmen's Cultural Organization of the local Labor Trade Union.
The training of the technical staff has been carried out entirely on the job.
AWGA is aware of the need for an off-the-job training program but must await
the setting-up of the facilities which are being considered for the sector as
a whole under NOPWASD. In the meantime, it relies largely on its on-the-job
training program which gives satisfactory results but places extra demands on
its management and supervisory staff.
4.06     Training under the project will focus first on operation and
maintenance as determined in the early stage of the technical assistance to be
financed by GTZ, and second on construction supervision hy associating experts
with the Egyptian Managers. It will consist of on-the-job training and an
associated structured series of seminars related to all aspects of operation,
maintenance and construction supervision (Annex 6). The technical and
managerial capability of AWGA's personnel would thus be considerably upgraded
during the project implementation.
Accounts, BilMing, Collection. Receivables, and Payables
4.07     AWGA's accounts are maintained in accordance with Egyptian National
Accounting System. At present, the general accounts are kept manually, while
the payroll, store records and billing are computerized. In addition to the
general accounts, budgeting and cost accounting systems are in operation.
However, as pointed out in the reports of the independent auditors, although
all fixed assets are recorded in the general ledger, no subsidiary records are
kept. Such records are essential for internal control and planning purposes.
AWGA has initiated action starting with vehicles and buildings. The most
difficult part - the identification and recording of the production,
transmission and distribution facilities - remains to be done. This is an
enormous task which will require the participation of appropriate staff on a
full-time basis until it is completed. During negotiations, AWGA agreed to
establish a working group and to prepare a plan of action for recording its
fixed assets by June 30, 1989 and to complete the implementation of such plan
by December 31, 1995. The proposed technical assistance with system mapping
(Annex 6) will be an essential part of this activity. This undertaking forms
part of the Implementation Program which appears at Annex 8.
4.08     AWGA's management information system readily generates the
information needed for the effective management of a public utility. However,
mechanization of the budgeting, costing, and general accounting functions
remains to be done. This is part of an existing contract with the computer
firm which carried out the computerization of the payroll, billing, and



- 18 -
stores.  Programs have already been prepared for the budgeting and g neral
accounting applications and costing would be obtained as a by-product of the
other applications. AWGA has been reluctant to proceed because it feared that
its equipment would not have the necessary capacity. The supplier of the
equipment, however, has recently confirmed that all applications can be
performed on the equipment. AWGA is currently operating its computer center
with two shifts, the second part-time. It appears that all of the work
contemplated could be accomplished with two full shifts, and AWGA intends to
proceed with implementation of the remaining applications.
4.09     The existing computer equipment is estimated to have a remaining
useful life of some two to three years, and it would be advisable to make
provision now for the acquisition of a new computer. The cost of such
equipment, including peripherals, is currently estimated at about US$100,000.
With the current state of technology, the conversion of programs, should that
prove necessary, would pose no problems. Bids should be called by July 31,
1989, so that the new equipment would get on stream during fiscal year 1990
(para. 3.04 (iii)). During negotiation, AWGA agreed to implement the
remainder of its office computerization in accordance with a plan which will
include the acquisition of the necessary computer by the end of the year 1989
and the completion of such computerization by July 31, 1990. This
understanding forms part of the Implementation Program which appears at
Annex 8.
4.10     About 99% of AWGA's customers are metered, but many meters are out of
order. The proposed project provides for their systematic replacement.
Meters are read and bills issued every two months on a cyclical basis.
Roughly 95% of the bills are collected by a team of collectors who are
independent from the meter readers. The remaining 5% is collected at the
various branch offices. All basic documents are prepared at the branches avd
processed centrally on AWGA's computer in Alexandria. The existing billing
and collection arrangements are satisfactory.
4.11     As of the end of fiscal year 1987, AWGA's total receivables
represented the equivalent of 6.0 months of revenues. Domestic, commercial
and industrial accounts represented about 3.1 months of revenues, an
improvement over the 3.3 months of outstanding accounts a year ago. This
collection performance is comparable to that of similar entities in the
region. However, the collection from government entities and institutions
with government-dependent budgets has been deteriorating, reaching a level of
18.9 months of related sales at the end of 1987. Arrears stem essentially
from chronic under-budgeting, a situation which was exacerbated recently by
the Government's request that public entities reduce their operating
expenses. Their budgets were reduced but, as there has been no commensurate
reduction in their water consumption, arrears have increased. For its part,
AWGA has taken the measures normally expected in similar circumstances. It
has advised both the Government and the entities concerned of their level of
consumption and the applicable tariffs. A special committee composed of three
of AWGA's staff and four of the Ministry of Finance's staff has also been
established to advise the Government on ways to reduce arrears. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that AWGA will in conjunction with the



- 19 -
Government prepare an action plan by December 31, 1989, which will provide for
the payment by June 30, 1991, of amounts overdue more than four months at that
time for water services rendered by AWGA to agencies of the Government,
including amounts due by the Government for service to the Western Desert
(para. 4.12). These agreements form part of the Implementation Program which
appears at Annex 8.
4.12     At the request of the Government, AWGA provides water at great
distances in the Western Desert area outside the Alexandria Governorate. Over
the years, tariffs for that area have been insufficient to cover costs. In
1987 for instance, tariffs covered only about 30Z of operating costs. Under
Loan 1369-EGT, the Government had agreed to compensate AWGA each year for the
difference between costs and revenues. AWGA has billed the Government for
this difference on the Lasis of an audited income statement for that region.
However, it has not been systematically paid. At the end of 1987, some LE
16.6 million remained unpaid. During negotiations, agreement was reached on
settling these arrears as indicated in para. 4.11 above.
4.13     As of the end of June 1987, AWGA's accounts payable included some LE
33.8 million of interests payable to the National Investment Bank of which
more than LE 20 million was over due. This arose out of the cash shortfall
resulting from Government arrears (paras. 4.11 and 4.12). During
negotiations, AWGA agreed to include in its 1989-90 annual budget amounts
sufficient to settle, by June 30, 1990, overdue payments in respect of
principal and interest on its debt with the National Investment Bank. This
undertaking forms apart of the Implementation Program which appears at Annex 8.
Audit
4.14     AWGA's accounts are audited by the Egyptian Central Organization for
Accounting and Audit, a competent entity acceptable to the Bank. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that AWGA will have its accounts and
financial statements audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
and will forward to the Bank such statements and the auditor's report within
six months after the end of its fiscal year.
Insurance
4.15     AWGA carries adequate insurance against the risks of theft, fire, the
operation of vehicles, and misappropriation by cashiers and collectors. Other
third-party liabilities which could arise from property damage through water
leakage are self-insured, a practice which has proved adequate in the past.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance and Present Position
5.01     AWGA's income statements, balance sheets, sources and applications of
funds statements and the underlying assumptions used in their preparation
appear at Annex 13 through 16.



- 20 -
5.02     In the early 1970's, unaccounted-for water was about 30% of water
produced. In the years that followed, an aging water supply system and
insufficient maintenance combined to raise unaccounted-for water to about 50%
of water produced, the present level. Faced with rising water demand, AWGA
chose to expand its production capacity. The financing of the new facilities,
largely with borrowings from the National Investment Bank without direct
equity contribution from the Government, rapidly increased AWGA's debt and
de'' service burden.  Recent years have also witnessed high inflation,
currently still around 20%. Tariffs were increased but, while average
revenues per m3 went up by about 14.5% per year during 1985-87, total
revenues faile4  m. catch up with rising costs.  In that period, AWGA's
revenues covr<! *l.-1y about 70% of its combined operating expenses (other than
depreciation) an  lebt service.  Without addition to its equity from either
outside contribuL.ons or retained earnings, its debt to equity ratio also
deteriorated. It reached about 85:15 at the end of 1985.
5.03     In the period 1985-87, AWGA's totdl number of consumers increased by
about 5.8% per year, its water sales volume by 6.2%, and its total revenues by
22.0%. In the same period, its operating and maintenance expenses increased
by only 17.5%, but depreciation increased by 30.2%, resulting in small losses
before interest. In each of these three years, depreciation was insufficient
to cover the total debt service, and only in the last two years did it cover
interest charges. However, as the Government started to service part of
AWGA's debt and to convert the funds so provided into equity, AWGA's capital
structure began to improve.   At the end of 1987, its debt to equity ratio was
72:28.
Tariffs
5.04     The area of Egypt where the bulk of the population lives has an
adequate quantity of water at relatively low cost. Nonetheless, only a
portion of the cost of providing water has been recovered. Substantial
operating subsidies are involved, Although the recovery performance varies
considerably among water entities. In May 1985, the Cabinet's Committee for
High Policies, Economic and Financial Affairs endorsed a cost recovery policy
aimed at gradually increasing the percentage of recovery from about 35% of
operating expenses and maintenance in 1985 to 100% in 1991. Then, in December
1987, the Committee issued a schedule of recommended annual tariff levels for
the period January 1, 1988 through June 30, 1992 (Annex 17). While actual
tariff action must still be approved by the Local Councils, the Committee's
recommendations are expected to have a favorable impact on the level of cost
recovery in the sector.
5.05     In recent years AWGA's revenues have been insufficient to cover its
operating expenses other than depreciation and debt service, and its revenue
shortfall has been compensated under a 1985 decree which called for the.
Government to service AWGA's debt to the National Investment Bank. In 1986,
the funds so provided were converted into equity. With minor exceptions, the
Committee's recommended tariff schedule for the fiscal year commencing July 1,
1988, was approved for Greater Alexandria by the Alexandria Local Council.
However, while the new tariffs are expected to generate total revenues about
20% higher than in the previous year, they will still not enable AWGA to cover
all of its obligations. For this reason, AWGA has asked the Government for



- 21 -
further assistance until its network has been substantially rehabilitated
around the end of fiscal year 1992. Afterwards, such contributions should be
reduced so that after 1996 AWGA's revenues cover its entire operating expenses
(other than depreciation) and debt service. During negotiations, the
Government agreed to provide funds to cover 100l of AWGA's entire debt service
to the National Investment Bank in the period 1989 to 1991, 75X in the period
1992 to 1995, and 25X in 1996, or such other dates as the Government and the
Bank may otherwise agree, and that such funds will be transferred to AWGA as
equity. This will represent a transfer of LE 212.6 million to AWGA's equity
or about 181 of its funds requirements which is considered reasonable.
5.06     Based on the above assumption it is estimated that increases in
revenue of 201 in July 1989 and 1990, 15% in July 1992, 101 in July 1994 and
1995, 201 in July 1996, and 101 in July 1998 will be required to fully cover
the combined total of AWGA's operating expenses, other than depreciation, and
debt service not financed by the Government. The proposed recovery level and
the tariff adjustments it implies are considered reasonable in the current
Egyptian context, including the forecast inflation level. Agreement was
reached during negotiations that AWGA will take the necessary measures,
including adjustmerts of its charges, so that its total revenues cover its
operating and maintenance expenses, working capital requirements and its debt
service to the extent not financed by the Government. Agreement was also
reached during negotiations that AWGA will at least three months before the
start of each of its fiscal years provide IBRD for review, a copy of its
budget for that year and its financial projections for the following two years
as well as a copy of its tariff request for the budget year.
AWGA's Financing Plan
5.07     In the 1989-98 period, AWGA's total funds requirement and sources
would be as follows:

- 22 -
5.08     Capital expenditures during the project implementation period would
consist of the proposed project (682 of total), and ongoing and customer-
financed projects (222 of total), and interest capitalized during construction
(10X of total). No new project is foreseen. The Government equity
contributions would result exclusively from servicing the National Investment
Bank's debt (para. 5.05). The proposed IBRD loan equivalent to LE 163.3
million (US$36.0 million) would finance part of the foreign currency
requirements of the proposed project. Italy would provide the remainder of
the project's foreign currency financing requirement in an amount equivalent
to LE 78.2 million (US$22.5 rmillion). The GTZ grant of LE 18.7 million (DM9
million) would finance the project's studies, training and equipment related
to system maintenance. The National Investment Bank's loans would cover all
local currency requirements not financed by internal cash generation for the
proposed and other ongoing projects. Fidally, AWGA will provide LE 481.4
million (US$87.1 million) of its total funds requirements from internally
generated funds.
Future Finncial Outlook
5.09     The financial projections are based on reasonable implementation
schedules.  They reflect the Government's desire to improve the efficiency and
cost recovery of the water supply sector. They include a realistic level of
maintenance and take into account some productivity gains.
5.10     In assessing AWGA's future financial performance, account must also
be taken of the local inflation level which is estimated at an average of
about 14.92 per year in the period 1989-98. This is reflected to various
degrees in the cost of investments and their financing as well as in the
expense level throughout the forecast period.
5.11     In the period 1989-98, operating expenses (other than depreciation)
are expected to increase by an average of 13.1% per year, i.e., at a rate
somewhat lower than the inflation level. This reflects the productivity gains
expected to be incurred during project implementation. Debt service before
financing by Government would grow at an average of about 9.9% due to a mix of
old and new loans. In the same period, fixed assets in operation would grow
at an average of 12.2X, the long-term debt at 5.0% and the equity at 20.41
while the debt to equity ratio would gradually decrease from 77:23 in 1988 to
45:55 in 1998.
5.12     Because of the expected assistance of the Government in servicing
AWGA's debt, a standard debt service coverage covenant would not be
appropriate for AWGA. However, during negotiations, agreement was reached
that AWGA would not, during the project implementation period, undertake major
investments (US$2 million equivalent or more) other than those already
underway or included in the proposed project without prior consultation with
the Bank.
Monitorui System
5.13     During negotiations, AWGA agreed (i) to monitor the achievements of
it technical, financial and managerial objectives in accordance with the
indicators which appear at Annex 18; (ii) to provide the Bank annually with



- 23 -
the result of such monitoring and to exchange views with the Bank as to the
actions to be taken to achieve such objectives; and (iii) to prepare and
furnish to the Bank for its review and comments, quarterly reports on progress
in the implementation of the project.
5.14     Within six months following the closing date of the loan, AWGA will
prepare and submit to the Bank a completion report on the execution and
initial operation of the project, the cost and the benefits derived or to be
derived from it, the performance and fulfillment by the Government, AWGA and
IBRD of their respective obligations under the Guarantee Agreement and the
Loan Agreement, and the accomplishment of the objectives described in the IBRD
Loan Agreement.
Vl. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Environmental Impact and Health Benefits
6.01     While significant improvements have been made in the overall
availability of water, the present water supply service in the project area is
far from satisfactory. A large part of the system is old, and undersized and
in need of frequent repair (para. 2.05). In older and poorer sections of the
city, major leaks in the system exacerbate the difficult living conditions and
pose serious threats to foundations of buildings in the area. Trunk line
sizes are inadequate and water pressures are low in many parts of the city and
are likely to deteriorate further with population growth. There is a danger
that negative pressures will cause groundwater polluted with sewage to seep
into the water distribution system due to low operating pressures in some
densely populated areas. The project will rectify this situation by improving
the distribution system to be able to supply sufficient quantities of water at
adequate pressures thus reducing the risks to health and improving the
environmental conditions particularly in the poorer sections of the
community. The amount of waste water will increase as a result of the
project. However, a wastewater collection system currently under construction
will be in operation before completion of the project. Existing sea outfalls
will be disconnected, and eventually replaced by an appropriate disposal
method which is under study with USAID financing. The new sewage collection
and disposal system has been sized to cope with the projected flows which will
result from the project.
Least-Cost Solution
6.02     Several alternative distribution network reinforcing schemes were
studied. Field water flows and pressure data for the study were obtained by
AWGA's staff. These alternatives took into account feasible pipe routings
choosing streets of sufficient width to accommodate the pipe sizes being
considered. Water consumption records were divided by AWGA districts.
Efforts were made to correlate census districts with those of AWGA.
6.03     Repair records and AWGA's experience in the various areas were used
to evaluate suitable pipe materials and recommended protective coatings or

requirements and materials. Field observations of construction methods and a
review of corresponding specifications and contractual documents provided a
basis for preparing documents and for identifying construction supervision
requirements.
6.04     In those areas of the city, particularly within the old town, where
streets are narrow and building foundations may be shallow and of questionable
stability, hand excavation and use of stronger pipe material, such as ductile
iron pipe, will be required to prevent damage to structures during
construction or due to leakage resulting from pipe breaks. However, in those
areas with stable soil conditions, plastic or asbestos cement pipe would
provide the least-cost alternative. Tender documents will provide for
alternative pipe proposals in these areas.
Economic Analysis
6.05     The project aims to improve water distribution in the project area by
optimizing operating efficiencies through reduced leakage and by investigating
and correcting the causes of unaccounted-for water. A variety of benefits are
associated with the provision of a reliable and convenient water supply. The
more important among them are the health, social and economic well being of
the population being served. The proposed project will also facilitate
development of the city as a center of economic activity and help create and
expand employment opportunities. These benefits, however, cannot be
meaningfully quantified. Quantifiable benefits of the project will be the
incremental volume of water sold due to improved distribution, metering and
billing practices and savings in operating cost as a result of leakage
control. Construction of additional headworks would also be delayed by about
six years. The internal rate of return calculated using incremental water
sales as a minimum measure of these benefits would be about 12%.
Inpact on the Poor
6.06     The proposed water distribution network rehabilitation will benefit
the poorer districts of the city where pipe lines are old, undersized and
corroded or tuberculated. Due to low system pressure, water service to these
areas is inadequate to meet the needs of the present population. It is
estimated that in the town center alone there are about 640,000 inhabitants of
which about 250,000 have incomes below the poverty threshold; and in the
remaining districts of the city, where water distribution improvements will be
implemented, a considerable number of families below or close to the poverty
threshold will benefit from the improved level of service. It is estimated
that about 321 of the total population live under the threshold poverty level,
and about 362 of the project cost will go towards improving the water services
to these people. The present tariff structure for domestic use provides for
adequate consumption at low cost. The water consumption of the low income
group average about 12 m3 per month per household of 5 persons (80 lcd).
Assuming that the income of the poorest segment of the population is equal to
the urban poverty threshold (LE 40 per month for a family of 5), the total
monthly payment for water supply services in 1996 when the project's physical
components will have been implemented, will be about LE 0.54 in real terms or
slightly over 12 of the monthly income of the low income group which is
reasonable.

6.07     The project will  nable supplementary Bank assistance to AWGA in
reinforcing and strengthening its institutional capabilities started under
Loan 1369-EGT. Bank participation in this project is essential and timely
because AWGA is in urgent need of assistance to rationalize and optimize the
use of the water provided under the previous project (Loan 1369-EGT). The
project will provide a continuing opportunity to develop the technical and
financial management capabilities of AWGA's staff through association with
consultants conducting the technical assistance, construction supervision, and
technology transfer components of the project (Annex 6).
P'ro3eot Rid
6.08     There is little risk that the major objectives of the Project will
not be met. First, the design and implementation of the infrastructure
components are not complex, and are expected to pose no difficulty. Second,
the technical assistance component is comprehensive and well prepared, and may
be expected to improve AWGA's overall operating efficiency. Third, the
Government financial assistance in the early stage of project implementation
and its new water tariff policy should enable AWGA to regain a more balanced
capital structure an attain a reasonable level of financial performance.
Finally, expert assistance in the supervision of project implementation,
regular Bank supervision, and close monitoring of AWGA's key performance
indicators will help to minimize project risks.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Agreements having been reached on the issues presented in Chapters
III through V of this report, and subject to the condition of effectiveness
set forth in paragraph 3.09, the project is suitable for an IBRD Loan of
US$36.0 million to the Alexandria Water General Authority with the guarantee
of the Arab Republic of Egypt for a term of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace at the standard variable interest rate.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SECOND ALEXANDRIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
THE ALEXANDRIA WATER SUPPLY FACILI
1.       AWGA was founded in 1879 as a limited company, and operated under
British management until 1954, when a wholly Egyptian management took it
over. AWGA was nationalized in 1961 and acquired its General Authority status
in 1968, with the responsibility for the provision of potable water in the
Alexandria Governorate and parts of the Beheira and Matruh Governorates.
Source of Water
2.       AWGA's raw water supply is obtained from two main canals, the
Mahmoudia and the Noubaria, which are fed by the Rosetta branch of the River
Nile in the delta area. These canals, in addition to supplying human needs
provide water for irrigation and industry and function as important transport
links. Practically the whole of Egypt's water needs are supplied by the Nile
and a large part of its electric energy requirements is produced at the Aswan
High Dam where discharges to lower Egypt are now regulated. With the
construction of the dam, the characteristics of the river water have changed
appreciably with the amount of suspended solids having dropped by as much as
80 Z. The reduction in colloidal matter has not been wholly beneficial from
the aspect of domestic water supply as the raw water shows some color,
variable turbidity and an algae problem that was hitherto absent. The latter
problem is due to the increased clarification which takes place in the High
Dam Reservoir allowing deeper sunlight penetration thereby promoting algae
growth. Now algae is always present in the AWGA's raw water supply with
maximum proliferation in summer.  The Nile water is ba.sically of good quality
although it is subject to occasional peaks of faecal contamination in some
places. Nevertheless, the raw water quality is suitable for treatment to
potable water standards with typical physical/chemical indicators as shown:
Typical Raw Water Quality                 Parts Per Million (mg/l)
Turbidity, (T.U.)                                      64-131

Total Solids                                            309
Ammonia (Free)                                       0.47-0.28
Ammonia (Albuminoid)                                 0.40-0.47
Oxygen Consumed from KMnO4                           1.60-2.30
pH value                                             7.9

3.       The raw water is free from excessive levels of iron, zinc, lead,
manganese, copper, etc., or other potentially harmful substances. The
fluoride contents varies from 0.6-0.7 parts per million However, toxic
chemicals have been detected at some places in the river and canals. The
source of these chemicals are factory effluents, agricultural fertilizer, and
weed killers and molluscicides used in canals.
4.       The multi-use primary canals are the responsibility of the Ministry
of Works and Water Resources but AWGA has abstraction rights for its present
and future production needs. AWGA also owns and operates a 16 km long private
supply canal with an intake upstream on the Mahmoudia Canal which becomes
increasingly polluted towards its termination in Alexandria. This private
canal has a carrying capacity of about 1,200,000 m3/day and supplies raw
water to the Manshia, Rond Point and Forn El Geraya treatment plants. Short
canals within the perimeter of the waterworks are also used as settling basins
occasionally with ferric chloride as coagulant and pre-chlorination for algae
control.
Water Treatment Plants
5.       There are six water filtration plants in Alexandria, namely Maamoura,
Siouf, Rond Point, Manshia, Forn El Geraya and Marriout. Their locations are
shown in the attached Map (IBRD Map 18988-R). With the ongoing plant
expansions, these facilities will increase AWGA's production capacity to about
2,480,000 cubic meters per day. The respective plant capacities are listed
below:
Nominal Capacity            Supply
Plant                  (M3/day)                Source
Maamoura                  260,000             Montazah Canal
Siouf                     680,000             Mahmoudia Canal
Rond Point                795,000             AWGA's Canal
Manshia                   380,000             AWGA's Canal
Forn El Geraya             50,000             AWGA's Canal
Marriout                  315,000             Noubaria Canal
Total                2,480,000
6.       All plants operate on the same principle of chemically assisted
clarification followed by rapid gravity filtration. The clarification process
depends on the use of aluminum sulphate sometimes aided by polyelectrolytes
when algae is abundant. Filters are cleaned and backwashed with filtered
water. The washing process also includes air blown into the media helping to
loosen trapped fine solids. In general, each filter unit is washed once a day



- 28 -                       ANNEX I
Page 3 of 4
but the frequency and duration of washing are governed by the quality of the
clarified water processed, which in turn is subject to seasonal variations in
the quality of the raw water.
7.       Filtration is followed by chlorination and storage to allow
sufficient contact time for disinfection before water is pumped to consumers.
Regular sampling and testing both in the Public Health Laboratories and in
AWGA's laboratories show that bacterial quality is generally satisfactory.
Chemical analysis are carried out daily to ensure the mineral content of
treated water is within accepted national and international drinking water
standards.
Storage and Pumping Facilities
8.       Practically all of AWGA's clear water storage is at ground level with
about 110,000 m3 capacity located at the water treatment plants. The
remaining storage reservoirs with a total capacity of about 110,000 m3, are
located throughout the city and provided with booster pumping stations. Some
of these storage facilities operate continuously. They are used to supply
consumers located at higher levels by means of repumping.
9.       In addition to the 16 booster pumping stations in Alexandria, there
are 12 booster pumping facilities, each provided with storage reservoirs of
about 4000 m3, which are used to service the Western desert area to the city
of Mersa Matruh, about 300 km west of Alexandria in the Matruh Governorate.
10.      Analysis of transmission main capacity shows that there is inadequate
transmission to deliver the volumes of water which will be treated when plant
expansions have been completed. Because of space constraints in the
rights-of-way of some pipelines, replacement of smaller transmission lines
with larger diameter pipes will be necessary to increase the carrying capacity
from treatment plants to the distribution network. An existing 600 mm
diameter asbestos cement main carrier from Manshia waterworks to Gabbary area
along the Agricultural road has been abandoned due to excessive leakage at the
joints.
11.      Since there is no elevated storage in Alexandria, the continuity of
water pressure and supply throughout the network is dependent on continuous
pumping from the source stations. The power for pumping is generally taken
from the public electricity supply which is prone to interruptions. Standby
diesel engine power, up to 80% of normal power requirements, is provided at
each station so that some pumping can be continued during periods of power
failure. Safeguards to be adopted are the construction of strategic
interconnections between stations to provide back-up service in the event of
power failure at any supply source and construction of additional storage and
pumping facilities.
Disbribution Network
12.      Parts of AWGA's distribution network date back to 1879; as a result,
much of the network in the older part of the city is 80 to 100 years old. It



- 29 -                       ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 4
was constructed when buildings were only one or two stories high and water
usage was in any case small. The very small pipes laid at that time, even if
in good condition, would now be inadequate to meet the modern needs of
high-rise city buildings and the increased per capita water demand.
13.      Furthermore, the flows in this old network are now seriously impeded
by excessive tuberculation and leakage of the pipes and service connections.
The growth in water demand, particularly in the last two decades, has also
contributed to the deficiencies in the system.
14.      The water distribution network consists of about 3400 km of piping
ranging in diameter from main carriers of 1000 mm to secondary distribution
lines of 40 mm. AWGA also owns and operates two non-potable water systems. A
fire protection system, which consists of about 46 km of raw water mains is
used for the protect-on of indus.rial areas in the central part of the city.
An irrigation system which consists of about 50 km of distribut,ion piping is
used primarily to irrigate private and public gardens.
15.      The potable water distribution system consists, for the most part, of
cast iron pipes (in the old sectors of the city) and ductile iron pipes (main
carriers). However, there are some main pipelines and secondary network
piping of asbestos cement with Gibault joints and some of plastic. Also there
are a few main carriers made of pre-stressed reinforced concrete . Service
connections, particularly in the old areas, consist of a combination of lead
and galvanized steel pipes. Approximately 99% of the service connections are
metered. In many places, individual consumer meters as well as a master water
meter on the main service line are found when all the individual service lines
within a single building are not metered.
16.      The distribution system is operated under a single pressure which, by
law, is set at least at 30 meters above mean sea level. There are, however,
three small areas at higher elevations, which operate at higher pressures and
are isolated from the rest of the network by closed valves. Pressure in these
areas is maintained by booster pumping. The daytime pressure is maintained in
parts of the network by means of boosting from balanning ground storage tanks
which fill at night when demands are lower. Pressure readings taken at
strategic places of the network at various times of day and night during the
winter and summer months, have revealed several areas with low pressures
(about 0-5 meters gauge pressure). This situation is undesirable as it
increases the danger of pollution of the drinking water supply. Several
corrective measures have been considered by AWGA to improve distribution
pressures. These measures include: (i) reinforcement of the distribution
network by installing larger diameter main loops; (ii) replacement of
undersized and tuberculated piping; (iii) provision of additional main
carriers from water treatment plants to strategic places in the network; and
(iv) location and repair of leaks.

system monitoring, planning and operation. Organize and conduct a structured
series of seminars on all aspects of the work to coincide with the studies
which will form a case study. Check the results of technology transfer and
provide certificates of achievement to relevant personnel.
Part D - Assistance with Project Management and Construction Supervision
22.      Provide assistance to A'WGA in project management and construction
supervision to ensure an adequate standard of construction is achieved, while
at the same time providing a structured program to develop AWGA personnel by
on-the-job training and seminars related to current activities in the field
and office.
23.      Assist AWGA with the preparation of tender documents as required.
24.      It is proposed that experts (inspectors and field supervisors) be
phased out after two years,and field engineers and a senior inspector after
three years, with the exception of one senior engineer and one assistant who
will be required for the duration of construction work. During this time
prior to phasing out they will supervise jointly and be jointly responsible
with AWGA counterpart personnel and develop the capabilities of those AWGA
personnel to be able to continue their duties alone. During this time they
will jointly approve relevant components of the work.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SECOND ALEXANDRIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
INCOME STATEMENTS
1. Water Production
Water production will grow by an average of only about 2.32 per year
between 1989 and 1998, reflecting the efficiency gains expected from program
to reduce unaccounted-for water from 492 to 28S.
2. Sales Volumes
Sales volume will increase by an average of 5.9% per year to meet
population growth of 3.02 per year and an increase in per capita consumption
from 229 lcd in 1989 to 305 lcd by 1998.
3. Revenues
Revenues are based on above volumes at average 1987 revenues plus the
necessary increments to cover beginning with fiscal year 1989:
(i)    all expenses other than depreciation and interests; and
(ii)    all debt service other than financed by Government.
Government to service all National Investment Bank loans in the period 1989 to
1991, 75X in the period 1992 to 1995 and 25% in 1996. Afterwards, AWGA would
finance its entire operating and maintenance expenses and debt service out of
its revenues.
4. Expenses
(a)      Salaries and Wages.  Staff have been roughly grouped as (i)
technical, which vary with volume of water produced; (ii) meter readers,
collectors, etc., which vary with number of connections; and (iii)
administrative and other personnel which are expected to increase by a small
annual increment. This resulted in total staff moving from 4037 in 1987 to
5081 in 1998, i.e., an average annual growth of 2.11. The number of staff was



-52 -                          ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 3
then multiplied by the 1987 average wage rate. To this was added an estimated
1.5% each year for statutory grade progress plus an increase to reflect the
cost of living at about half projected local inflation every two years.
(b)      Power, Fuel and Chemicals.  These have been subject to price control
in the past. However, these controls are expected to be eliminated
gradually. Consequently, the 1987 level was adjusted on the basis of the
forecast water production growth plus 35% for power and fuel in 1989 and
gradual increases equivalent to half the average of the local and foreign
projected inflation afterwards.
(c)      Maintenance was projected 50% on the basis of production and 50% on
the basis of connections. Full local inflation was then added.
(d)      Depreciation was calculated at an average rate of 4.5% of gross fixed
assets in operation at the beginning of each year. Individual rates are:
Buildings                      2.5%
Machinery and Equipment        7.5%
Pipes                          3.0%
Water Meters                  15.0%
Vehicles and Barges           20.0%
Furniture                     10.0%
Capitalized Interests, etc.  20.0%
About 4.2% of the total depreciation is deemed to relate to fixed
assets which have been completely depreciated and on which half the normal
rate is allowed. This part of the depreciation is credited to a reserve "for
rising costs" which forms part of AWGA's equity.
Sources and Applications of Funds
5.       Government is to continue financing AWGA's debt to the National
Investment Bank as detailed in para. 3 above.
6.       The National Investment Bank is to provide AWGA each year with local
cost financing not otherwise provided by internal cash generation.  This is a
standing practice. Loans are to be made at the beginning of each year at an
interest rate of 8% with a 3-year grace period on principal and a 12-year
repayment period.
7.       The proposed IBRD loan of LE 163.3 million would be at standard Bank
terms, i.e., variable interest (7.72% in the financial projections) and 3/4%
commitment charge for a period of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period.
The conversion factors derived from the ratios of estimated foreign and local
inflation each year divided by the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of

Page 3 of 3
appraisal, i.e. LE 1.00 equals US$.4545, yield an amount of US$36.0 million.
AWGA would assume the foreign exchange risk.
8.       The GTZ proposed grant of UM 9 million is equivalent to LE 18.7
million, while the proposed grant of It L 12.0 billion from Italy is
equivalent to LE 78.2 million.
9.       Customer contributions stem from the works executed by AWGA and paid
for entirely by the customers. The amount of these works is charged to fixed
assets and depreciated.  The counterpart appears in the reserves in the equity
portion of the balance sheet.
10.      Interests are capitalized during construction.  Likewise the exchange
losses arising out of the repayment of the existing IBRD Loan 1369-EGT are
capitalized. Both are amortized at 202 per year.
Balane Sheets
11.      Cash has been estimated on the basis that it will not fall below the
equivalent of two to three months of casf operating expenses. However, this
level would not be maintained in 1990 and 1991 when AWGA is expected to clear
up its arrears (para. 15).
12.      Tt has hen ass-med that thc Government would take action to reabsorb
the arrears of its Ministries as well as the entities with Government-
dependent budgets by fiscal year 1991. Total receivables are projected to
gradually go down to about 4 months of sales.
13.      Inventories have been estimated at 3.52 of gross fixed assets in
operation.
14.      Other debit accounts include mainly unpaid compensation for sales to
the Western Desert. It is expected the Government will settle its arrears by
June 30, 1991.
15.      Payables include interest payable on the National Investment Bank
loans. Arrears of some LE 20 million to be settled by AWGA by June 30, 1990.
