skilled craftsmen, contribute to reducing\n            regional inequalities by decentralizing related training\n            facilities, and support local industrial development.\n            Specifically, the project would supply engineers and higher\n            technicians in mechanical engineering, workshop instructors\n            for an expanded network of vocational training centers, and\n            technical/workshop teachers for the civil engineering\n            technology sections of a new network of technicums. The loan\n            would finance the foreign exchange cost of: (a)\n            architectural design, construction, furniture and equipment;\n            (b) 62 man-years of technical assistance for key expatriate\n            staff for the start up of the project institutes; (c) 128\n            man-years of fellowships to train Algerian staff abroad to\n            replace the expatriate staff; and (d) 7.5 man-years of\n            short-term consultants to prepare studies on the development\n            of (i) a network of training centers and a national\n            institute of rural maintenance trades; (ii) a system of\n            educational radio and television for vocational training;\n            and (iii) a national institute for pedagogical research on\n            vocational training."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
