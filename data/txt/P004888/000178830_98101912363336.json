Algeria\n            will help to alleviate acute manpower shortages of high and\n            middle-level technicians and skilled craftsmen, contribute\n            to reducing regional inequalities by decentralizing related\n            training facilities, and support local industrial\n            development. Specifically, the project would supply\n            engineers and higher technicians in mechanical engineering,\n            workshop instructors for an expanded network of vocational\n            training centers, and technical/workshop teachers for the\n            civil engineering technology sections of a new network of\n            technicums. The loan would finance the foreign exchange cost\n            of: (a) architectural design, construction, furniture and\n            equipment; (b) 62 man-years of technical assistance for key\n            expatriate staff for the start up of the project institutes;\n            (c) 128 man-years of fellowships to train Algerian staff\n            abroad to replace the expatriate staff; and (d) 7.5\n            man-years of short-term consultants to prepare studies on\n            the development of (i) a network of training centers and a\n            national institute of rural maintenance trades; (ii) a\n            system of educational radio and television for vocational\n            training; and (iii) a national institute for pedagogical\n            research on vocational training."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
