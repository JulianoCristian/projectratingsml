Without\n            government commitment, it is difficult to achieve\n            development objectives. During project preparation, special\n            attention should be given to the project's content and\n            how it fits within the context of prevailing weak\n            institutional capacity and the level of political\n            volatility. The Letter of Development Policy (LDP) should\n            have been much less ambitious, and more focused, and the\n            project design should have been much simpler. Consideration\n            should be given whether an adjustment operation is the right\n            instrument for a country like Sao Tome and Principe given\n            its political volatility and weak institutional capacity.\n            The program showed an unusual phenomenon that while the\n            adjustment operation did not perform well, the Technical\n            Assistance (TA) part of the program did well. The linkage\n            between the Credit and the TA activities was not strongly\n            established at the beginning and the TA was not programmed\n            closely/in a timely manner to support the reform program\n            sufficiently. Increased supervision funding would have been\n            useful so as to undertake multisectoral and more in-depth\n            supervision. The government should ensure that capacity that\n            has already been built with the help of the project will\n            remain within MOF, and that staff, who were involved with\n            the project, are not shifted to other places. The\n            collaboration of the Bank with the IMF had a positive impact\n            on the outcome of the project."}, "docdt": "2004-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
