competitiveness, while its supporting operation, the Public\n            Resource Management Technical Assistance Project (PRMTA) was\n            designed to provide the technical support, training, and\n            equipment to implement policy measures, currently proposed\n            under the reform program supported by the PRMC. The PRMTA\n            will also implement sectoral, sub-sectoral, and specific\n            studies, namely, through the financing of a study fund for\n            these, and/or simulation models, required for the\n            preparation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and,\n            will develop an agenda for macroeconomic, and sectoral\n            policy reforms. The operations will benefit the\n            implementation of tariff reforms, ensuring a harmonious\n            development of the revised tariff system, with the common\n            tariff of the Central African Economic and Monetary\n            Community, and the Western African Economic and Monetary\n            Union. In turn, private investments flows and improved\n            resource mobilization, will impact economic diversification,\n            and external trade, thereby enhancing productivity of public\n            resources. However, the proposed agenda may face resistance,\n            and social unrest, and, other risks are posed by low\n            institutional capacity, limited donor commitment, and a weak\n            private sector, although the Government is committed to\n            outweigh these risks."}, "docdt": "2000-10-06T00:00:00Z"}
