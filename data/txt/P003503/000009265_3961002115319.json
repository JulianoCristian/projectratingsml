iii) continue the effort to transfer the\n            appropriate advanced technology in plant design and project\n            management for 600 MW thermal power units; iv) provide\n            technical assistance to Shandong Provincial Electric Power\n            Bureau (SPEPB) for institution building in the areas of\n            environmental planning for thermal power stations and\n            improving electricity tariff structures; and v) upgrade\n            SPEPB's capability in financial management.  Project\n            components consist of : a) the addition of two 600 MW\n            generating units to the existing Zouxian thermal power plant\n            to raise its total capacity to 2,400 MW; b) construction of\n            500 kv and 220 kv transmission lines and substations; c)\n            provision of consulting services; d) provision of technical\n            assistance to study the impact on air quality of thermal\n            power expansion programs; e) carrying out a power tariff\n            study; and f) a training program for the technical,\n            financial and management staff of SPEPB."}, "docdt": "1992-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
