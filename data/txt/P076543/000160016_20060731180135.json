The performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower are satisfactory. Lessons from the\n            project include: 1) While the project was successful in\n            raising capacity at the agency and even mounting a serious\n            outreach, marketing, export and servicing efforts, it could\n            have clearly targeted more ambitious objectives that\n            provided more hands-on training and outreach potential for\n            the country. 2) The importance of continually revisiting\n            strategic directions/sectors identified for ADA is crucial.\n            The ADA strategies focused for too long on three such\n            sectors (Electronics, Precision Engineering and IT) while\n            the actual strengths and advantages of the country clearly\n            lie in a number of other industrial and service sectors, as\n            well as on its strong network of Diaspora contacts. 3) As a\n            testing instrument, this LIL provided a clear assessment of\n            the promotion needs in the country and may be used for\n            devising new assistance tools aimed at securing sustainable\n            levels of FDI inflows and exports. 4) To become an effective\n            organization, the current strategies need to be better\n            utilized by their respective departments, and, moreover, it\n            is essential to build synergies between the activities of\n            departments through joint planning and implementation of\n            activities, client referrals and collaboration in strategic\n            areas. 5) The investor servicing effort at ADA needs to be\n            boosted by using a more integrated approach to servicing new\n            and existing clients. 6) Another important area for future\n            consideration is ADA's advocacy role, which should be\n            more strengthened as the agency strives to become a more\n            private-sector focused organization."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
