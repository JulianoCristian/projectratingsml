The infrastructure and skills development component\n            is intended to compensate staff for the incremental\n            activities under the project, by providing technical support\n            from local consultants, as well as transportation for\n            investor servicing, staff training, and, updating current\n            internet capabilities. The second component will strengthen\n            institutional capacity for investor/exporter servicing, by\n            targeting efforts to improve the quality of information,\n            and, facilitate skills, and training. The investment, and\n            export promotion and generation component, will a) build\n            ADA's professional investment promotion capacity\n            through comprehensive training, and workshops focused on\n            reaching target markets, and, b) strengthen business\n            development capacities focused on export production\n            standards, marketing capabilities, and financial systems,\n            through a substantial skills training program. Based on\n            project performance indicators, the project management\n            component will ensure appropriate monitoring criteria, and\n            evaluation plans."}, "docdt": "2002-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
