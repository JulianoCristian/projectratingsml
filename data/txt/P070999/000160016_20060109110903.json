Some\n            implications for subsequent operations are: The first year\n            of implementation demonstrated the need for continued and\n            increased support for public and financial management\n            reforms. In particular, increase efforts to strengthen and\n            build capacity in the sector ministries for budget\n            formulation, procurement, and financial management. Greater\n            realism is needed in setting targets and the timeframe.\n            Prioritize and scale up the reform process to match the\n            Government's capacity. Unpredictability in resource\n            flows seriously hampered budget execution during 2004;\n            improve predictability through better revenue forecasting. A\n            better alignment of donor disbursements with the budget\n            cycle might also help improve predictability. A firm\n            commitment is actually more relevant than the timing of the\n            disbursement; in the case of Madagascar, however, the\n            resource availability at the outset is critical in providing\n            the level of confidence and certainty needed to execute the\n            budget and avoid stop-and-go cycles."}, "docdt": "2005-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
