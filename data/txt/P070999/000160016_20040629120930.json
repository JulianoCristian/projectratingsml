PRSC 1 will support the strategic axes of good\n            governance (public expenditure management and\n            anti-corruption), and promoting human development through\n            improved service delivery in education and nutrition. In\n            addition, strengthening monitoring and evaluation will lead\n            to an enhanced accountability and results focus.  PRSC\n            's support includes assistance to the Government in\n            implementing its 2004 Priority Action Plan for public\n            expenditure management reforms. This includes the\n            preparation and submission to Parliament of the public\n            finance framework law; improved alignment of the 2004 budget\n            to the priorities of the PRSP, the reform of the Treasury,\n            simplification of expenditure management process, the\n            development and submission to Parliament of a new\n            Procurement Code, and strengthening internal controls\n            through the establishment of a General Inspectorate for\n            Finances. PRSC 1 also supports the Government's\n            anti-corruption agenda, including establishment of an\n            operational Anti- Corruption Commission and the development\n            of a national anti-corruption strategy. PRSC 1 also supports\n            Axis 3 on providing human and material security, by\n            supporting the development and implementation of the\n            Government's Education for All Agenda and service\n            delivery in nutrition. Key policy reforms have included an\n            increase in the education budget, measures to decrease\n            education costs for poor households (suppression of school\n            fees, provision of learning materials to all primary\n            students), actions to increase access for poor students\n            (through school construction, salary compensation for\n            teachers paid by parents, teacher recruitment) and\n            reinforcement of management capacity at central and\n            decentralized levels. PRSC 1 also supports policy and\n            institutional reform in the nutrition sector. The Country\n            Financial Accountability Assessment (2003) and the Country\n            Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR, 2003), and the draft\n            Public Expenditure Review (PER) provide the analytical\n            underpinnings for the public sector reform agenda supported\n            by this PRSC, and background work for the Education for All\n            underpins reforms in this area. A supporting Technical\n            Assistance Credit (Good Governance and Institutional\n            Development) approved in November 2003 will assist the\n            government in putting in place the systems to strengthen\n            budget management, and finance technical assistance and\n            capacity building needs. The credit would be disbursed in\n            one tranche at effectiveness following effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2004-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
