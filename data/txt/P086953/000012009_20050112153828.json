This will facilitate better\n            land-related investments, and more productive and\n            environmentally sustainable land use. However, and as\n            specified within the social assessment, a major project risk\n            is the political factor, namely that the project might be an\n            instrument that favors particular groups over others. This\n            Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) sets the measures to ensure\n            all groups, i.e., indigenous populations, ethnic groups, and\n            minorities, benefit from implementation of the project. The\n            National Registry Center (CNR) will be responsible for\n            implementing awareness campaigns informing on the potential\n            project benefits, as well as location of the project area,\n            and activities to be developed. This will be achieved within\n            the first project component, through media communication,\n            particularly targeting isolated rural areas. In addition,\n            under the second component, capacity building should ensure\n            that beneficiaries are aware of their rights and\n            responsibilities in terms of land tenure, including of\n            procedures and land registry costs, and legal issues. This\n            will also be the responsibility of the CNR, and of lawyers\n            who will be directly involved in capacity building. Finally,\n            under the third component, a monitoring and evaluation\n            program will be in place to process household surveys and\n            data gathered, ensure compliance with specified safeguards,\n            and provide grievance mechanisms, should conflict occur."}, "docdt": "2004-12-01T15:18:05Z"}
