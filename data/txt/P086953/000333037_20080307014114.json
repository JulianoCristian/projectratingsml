The factor leading to the cancellation of\n            the Project was the government's failure to gain\n            consensus and obtain the second and final Congressional\n            approval by a qualified (two thirds) majority required for\n            approval of external borrowing and for project\n            effectiveness. A lesson learned for the Bank is that in\n            countries such as El Salvador where loans have to be\n            ratified by a qualified majority of Congress, and the\n            Congress is deeply divided, the Bank needs to recognize that\n            loans may not be approved, despite every effort to meet with\n            opposition leaders, explain the purposes of the projects,\n            answer questions, provide information on previous\n            operations, as well as information on the macroeconomic,\n            fiscal and debt situation."}, "docdt": "2007-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
