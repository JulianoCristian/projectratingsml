This will\n            facilitate better land-related investments and more\n            productive and environmentally sustainable land use. The\n            project has the following three components: Component 1)\n            will complete land regularization within El Salvador. In the\n            context of LAP II, regularization refers to the systematic\n            and massive dissemination campaign, mapping, verification of\n            rights, delimitation of properties, resolution of field\n            conflicts, notification of results, transfer of information\n            to Property Registry and Cadastre Information System\n            (SIRyC), and legalization and/or titling of lands in areas\n            of social interest. Component 2) will improve the execution\n            of day-to-day registry and cadastre services at local level\n            (e.g., registration of titles, cadastral certificate\n            emissions). Component 3) although National Registry Center\n            (CNR) will be the sole implementing agency, it will deal\n            with various participating institutions and partners."}, "docdt": "2005-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
