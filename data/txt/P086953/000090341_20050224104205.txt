A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE
1. Country andsectorissues
Country and sector background:
Poverty and insecure land tenure in El Salvador have led to low investments in agriculture and intensive
land and real estate activities, inadequateland management, and severe environmental degradation. Over
the last 30 years various administrationsin El Salvador recognizedthat land was a serious issue affecting
long-term development but sought to address the issue solely through redistribution. The GOES
conducted a three-phased land reform in the 1980s through which it expropriated 300,000 hectares of
large farms anddistributed them to cooperatives and individual beneficiaries,benefiting550,000 families.

While most of these landswere titled, the GOES lacked an updateablesystemto record andmanage land-
related information. This resulted in a system that impeded the development of the land market and was
unableto use land-relatedinformation for planning purposes, both of which are essentialto the country's
long-term development.

To provide landowners with the necessary land security to transfer and invest in their land, in 1996 the
GOES signed a US$50 million loan (LandAdministration Project Ior LAP I) the World Bank. The         with
project's broad objectives were to: (a) regularizeland for El Salvador'sestimated 1.8 million parcels; and
(b) createand maintain an efficient, streamlined, decentralized, and financially self-sustaining nationwide
mapping, cadastre, andpropertyregistration institution-the new National Registry Center (CNR).

LAP Icontinues to advance very satisfactorily toward achieving its development objective and is
considereda best practice inthe region. Once completed in 2005, it will have (a) regularized 60% of the
parcels and transferred all properties into a new computerized parcel-basedproperty registry (SIRyC);
and (b) createdand modemizedthe CNR which is now financially sustainable and is providing efficient
and accessible services country-wide (e.g., registration times have been reduced from several months to
one week).

To complete the successful regularization of 100% of the country, the GOES now wishes to finalize this
processinthe rest of the country andisthereforeinterestedinafollow-up operation, the proposedLAPII.
The new project is expected to be effective in CY05. It would augment quantity, extend geographic
scope, and add complementary components to the successful LAP Iwhich laid the foundation for an
efficient national land administration program.

The three new complementarycomponents are the following:

           0    Extension of the concept of regularization within LAP Ito titling of urban and peri-urban
                lands of social interest' that are often home to the poorest of the poor. During LAP I,
                regularization referred to the dissemination campaign, mapping, verification of rights,
                delimitation of properties, field conflict resolution, notification of results, and transfer of
                information to SIRyC. It included registration of existing titles, although no titling activity
                was included;




'The  official rating of the Social Interest Project by ILP, an agency authorized by the State to coordinate such projects, includes
projects aimed directly or indirectly at low-income families. A project cannot be rated as being of social interestif it i s located
in:l. ForestReseves, 2. At-Risk Zones, 3. NationalParks, 4. Archeological Zones, 5. NationalHeritageSites, 6. Tourism Zones,
7. Streets, Highways, andRailways, except those declaredby Executive Decreeas being indisuseand are removed from public
use.



                                                                 1

         0   Strengthening of municipal land administration services so that (i)final beneficiaries,
             including poor people, have easy access to such services; and (ii)municipalities could better
             manage and sustaintheir development; and

         e   DeliIllitation of protected areas and cultural properties and limited demxcation of protected
             areas.

Linked GEF operation
Another important land-related issue affects El Salvador's natural resources. Specifically, the country's
globally significant ecological resources andbiodiversity are at risk, primarily due to habitat destruction.
This destruction, inturn, is associated with the lack of clear land tenure security and compoundedby El
Salvador's population density, the highest in the region. For example, virtually all of the country's 118
protected areas are under threat, with people living in and around them, and invasions (both legal and
illegal) expanding. As a result of the associated habitat destruction, El Salvador's globally significant
biological diversity is seriously threatened.

The proposed project is completing the cadastre and registry of all lands within El Salvador, including
protected areas. Building upon lessons learnedfrom the World Bank's significant regional experiencein
land administration, the project is linked with a GEF-funded project (Land Administration and Protected
Areas Consolidation) to catalyze the consolidation of key protected areas and develop a strategy for
consolidating other protected areas that is directly linked to the systematic land regularization process.
This strategy was developed from lessons learned in the region, Le., that land administration presents a
limited window of opportunity to capture and "freeze" the current state of population distribution in
protectedareas, limit allowable activities on priority ecologically sensitive lands, and develop a model for
promoting sustainable development on those lands. If these issues are well-addressed during the
systematic land regularization process, the future degradation of critical biodiversity areas can be
minimized in El Salvador and in many other countries worldwide that are grappling with these issues.
Part of this effort consists of strengthening the national protectedareas system, capturing and "freezing"
the current state of population distribution, and limitingallowable activities on ecologically sensitive and
risk-prone lands, all of which can yield tremendousconservationbenefits.

The linked full-size GEF-fundedproject would go to appraisal inor aroundAugust 2005, afterLAPI1has
been approved. This innovative approach would provide up to US$5 million in GEF grants to fund
parallel conservation-relatedactivities complementary to LAP 11, including pilot-scale activities to: (i)
demarcate strategic protected areas; (ii)  develop and implement management plans for those protected
areas; and (iii) support regularization of residents within those protected areas, subject to management
planrequirements.

Linkage To CAS. Sector Stratem, or Globamhematic Strategic Priority
The CAS for N05-FY08 also includes a LAP IIthat would support urban and rural productivity and
environmental sustainability and would address three CAS pillars: (i)    accelerating broad-based equitable
growth and increasing employment; (ii)       improving equity by building human capital and expanding
access to basic infrastructure, assets, andmarkets; and (iii) enhancing security and reducing vulnerability.
Annex 1 of this PADgives moredetail on how LAPI1would address the CAS challenges.



2. Rationale for Bank involvement
The GOES formally asked for World Bank assistance for a second phase inaletter sent by the Minister of
Finance to the World Bank in September 2003 and confirmed by a letter sent on June 8, 2004 by the
Technical Secretary of the Presidencyto the World Bank. Moreover, the President's official government



                                                    2

programmentionsexplicitly the importanceof landtenure security, modernizing the public registries and
makingthemefficient so to promotetransparencyandprivate property.

Buildingon the successfulLAPIexperience, the World Bankwould continue contributing to improving
land tenure security andlandmarkets, supportingthe CNR with a second landadministration operation.

The GOES would greatly benefit from the World Bank's competitive advantage in the region's land
issues, with over 20 years of experience in landpolicies and operations and US$500 million invested and
committed inlandprograms in Central America. It would also benefit from the World Bank's experience
in GEF activities, including GEF operations in most Central American countries and the Mesoamerican
Biological Corridor program.

Additionally, the World Bank i s preparing an ESW to measurethe impact of landadministration projects
inElSalvador, Honduras, and Bolivia(FY06). The work concerningElSalvador was completedin2004.
It concluded that LAP Ihad a very positive economic and social impact and also helped improve the
design of the LAPI1project.

Finally, the World Bank has already discussedLAP 11with other donors interestedin coordinating their
efforts, including Japan, USAID, IDB and EU. LAP 11would complement operations supportedby these
donors, including:
    0    Urbanandruraltitlingwith ongoing USAID, IDBandEUoperations;
     0   CNR strengthening, particularly where the Japanesecooperationhas already beeninvolved; and
     0   Municipal strengtheningwith an ongoing IDBoperation.


3. Higher levelobjectivesto which the project contributes
The new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for El Salvador, covering the period FYO5-08, supportsthe
three main pillars of the Government's agenda: (i)accelerating broad-based equitable growth and
increasing employment; (ii)      improving equity by building human capital and expanding access to basic
infrastructure, assets, and markets; and (iii)         enhancing security and reducing vulnerability. The CAS
recognizesthatjob creation will require robusteconomic growth anda revitalizedprivate sector. It further
clearly identifies the expansion of land administration and titling efforts as key for access to assets and
markets, andfor sustainablegrowth. The project will contribute to the three objectives of the CAS andthe
government's agenda, as outlined in the National "Pais Seguro" Program2.The project, by supporting
completion of the parcel-basedregistry and building institutional capacity to support land title transfer,
will improve the security of property rights and the performance of land markets. This will facilitate
private investmentandcreatejobs. The project will also seek to develop local land administration services
that are more equitable and accessible to the poorest, both in rural and urban areas. Furthermore, by
addressinglandadministration in northernandeasternElSalvador, an areatraditionally subjectto unclear
tenure regimes, site of the former civil conflict, and home to the poorest segment of the population, LAP
IIwilldirectlyimprovethelivelihoodsofthosemostinneed.

As already mentioned, the proposed partially blended GEF project would complement the IBRD-
financed LAP 11 and improve its development objective in the area of nature conservation and
consolidationof protectedandecologically sensitiveareas.




  This program, coveringthe period 2004-2009, identifies 16"areas of action," including security and equity, access to markets,
transparency andaccountability,competitiveness,developmentof SMEs,andenvironmentallyand socially sustainable
development.

  B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION
  1. Lendinginstrument
  The GOES officially requestedIBRD support for a LAPIIthrough a SIL. This project is included in the
  new CAS and is perfectly in line with the new Official Government Program. This US$55.8 million
  project, including a US$40.2 million IBRD loan, will complement LAP Iand achieve the complete
  coverage of the country by consolidating a unique integrated parcel-basedregistry system that could be
  replicable region- andworld-wide.

  2. Project development objective and key indicators
  The project development objective is to improve landtenure security and landtransactions by providing
  efficient, equitable, and accessible land administration services. This will facilitate better land-related
  investmentsandmoreproductive andenvironmentally sustainablelanduse.

  Land administration services include massive, systematic land regularization (i.e.,             dissemination
  campaign, mapping, verification of rights, delimitation of properties, field conflict resolution, notification
  of results, transfer of information to SIRyC, and titling in areas of social interest) as well as day-to-day
  integrated cadastral and property registry services (e.g., individual title registration, cadastral certificate
  emissions)

  The envisagedDevelopmentIndicatorsare:
  a) CNR financial capacity to serve the loan maintained3;
  b) Percentageof new transactionsmadeinthe field registeredinto SIRyC;
  c) Costs4andlength of time of registry transactionsreduced;

Component 1:Land Regularization (US$43.5 million)
This component will complete land regularization within El Salvador. In the context of LAP 11,
regularization refers to the systematic and massive dissemination campaign, mapping, verification of
rights, delimitation of properties, resolution of field conflicts, notification of results, transfer of
                     ye, and legalization and/or titling of lands in areas of social interest. This component
will increase land tenure security through a comprehensive and highly participatory inventory of urban,
peri-urban, and rural lands, protected areas, and cultural properties, and the consolidation of an updated
and accurateparcel-basedproperty registry.

This component is dividedintothe followingsubcomponents:
1-1:Review of Legal, Regulatory,andAdministrative Frameworks
I.2: Land Regularization
1-3: Legalization and/or Titling of lands in Areas of Social Interest
1-4: Delimitationand Limited Demarcation of ProtectedAreas

The project will finance the preparation of studies and workshops, technical equipment, mapping and
cadastral field work, landinformation collection, and limited consulting services.


Component 2: Decentralization of LandAdministration Services (US$9.0 million)
The objective of this component i s to improve the execution of day-to-day registry and cadastre services
at local level (e.g., registration of titles, cadastral certificate emissions). This component will allow more
accessible and efficient land services as well as more effective maintenance of the parcel-based registry
throughout the nation. It will contribute to the better functioning of landmarkets. This i s divided into:
2-1: Consolidation of the Strengtheningof CNR's qfJices
2-2: Modernization of LandAdministration Services at Local Level

The project will finance training andtechnical assistance, institutional strengthening, technical equipment,
technology platforms, andlimited consulting services.



Component 3: Project Administration (US$3.1 million)
Although CNR will be the sole implementing agency, it will deal with various participating institutions
and partners. Therefore, specific attention must be paidto project administration so as to maximize inter-
institutional coordination and thus the project's ongoing execution. This component also includes the
project's Monitoring andEvaluation system.

The project will finance administrative, supervision, andM&Ecosts, including M&Esurveys.



4. Lessonslearned and reflected inthe project design
LAPIis considered inthe region as a best practice. CNR is now financially sustainable, a unique case in
the region. More than half of the country has been surveyed and a new, integrated parcel-based property
registration system has been implemented, reducing transaction turnover from several months to one
week. The regularization process has been highly participatory with a very well disseminated
communication campaign. Chanibita Medidor ("the Salvadoran surveyor"), the national logo for the land
regularization campaign, i s now well knownthroughout the country.

LAP 1's experience has provided many valuable lessons which are reflectedinLAP11.Ithas allowed the
Government to test the land regularization methodologies implemented in the field, apply various



                                                        6

technical land surveying standards, estimate the unit costs (by propertyhy hectare) of the overall
activities of the land survey cadastre, and register and implement a quality control program. This
experience has also allowed for organizational development, infrastructure, equipment, training
improvements, new system installation (SIRyC), and communication links that CNR has acquired
through LAPI.   LAPIhasinstitutionally strengthenedCNRstechnical andhumanresourcesareasandhas
providedit with experiencein successfullyadministeringthis type of improvements.

LAP Ihas served as an example for the design of LAP I1 as well as of various land administration
projects, not only in Central America but in otherregions as well. One example of this is the presentation
of LAP Iand its lessons learned at the Land Policy and Administration for Growth and Development
conference promoted by the World Bank and the Ministry of Rural Development in New Delhi, India
from May 27 to 28,2004.


5. Alternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection
After different project implementation alternatives were evaluated comparing the single implementation
model vs. the multi-agency implementation model, it was felt that CNR would be the right institution to
head project implementation, due to its technical capacity and performance in the execution of LAP I.
Furthermore, during consultations with different governmental and non-governmental institutions
acknowledged the institution's technological progress as well as its leading role as an agency that
producesbasic information which other entities can use for different purposes. It clearly emergedthat the
best option would be to appoint CNR as the implementingagency and the other agencies associatedwith
the project as participatingagencies.

In the area of environment, the scope of LAP I1was defined in consensus with MARN, after assessing
LAPII's scope andMAR"s priority needs, basedon its priorities. Itwas decidedthat LAP11will carry
out both the delimitation and limited demarcation of protected areas, since many of MAR"s projects
require an understandingof the boundariesof areas and a considerablepercentageof M A R " s funds are
allocated to this activity. Moreover, the delimitation carried out under LAP I1 will facilitate the
management of acomplementary GEFgrant for a properphysical demarcationby MARN.


C. IMPLEmNTATION
1. Institutional andimplementation arrangements
The institution directly responsible for project implementation is the National Registry Center. A
subsidiary agreement will be signed by the Republic of El Salvador (represented by the Ministry of
Finance) and CNR for project implementation, since CNR will handle the funds and most of the
implementationarrangements.

CNR will coordinate the various participating agencies by means of agreements that will become
effective, to the World Bank's satisfaction, before the corresponding activities begin. CNR successfully
implementedLAPIwhich i s now 100% disbursed, is about to close, andhas very satisfactorily achieved
its objectives. CNR i s a strong and financially sustainableinstitution, a unique case in the region. CNR
reimburses the loan (principal andinterest) andit generates yearly profits.

CNR is an institution with administrative and financial autonomy. It i s comprised of the National
Geographic and Cadastre Institute, the Land and Mortgage Registry, the Commercial and Intellectual
Property Registries, the Information Technology Department, and the Department of Human
Development,Administration, andFinance.




                                                  7

To administer LAP I, GOES created the UAP which i s a part of CNR. This unit very satisfactorily
                       the
administeredLAPIwith the assistance of UNDPas aprocurementandfinancial agent.

UnlikeLAPI, IIanticipatesa much stronger institutionalization of the project in its administrative,
                LAP
procurement, financial, and technical areas. UNDP will no longer be used as the procurement and
financial agent (see Annex 7). During LAP 11, CNR will directly manage financial and administrative
aspects of the project, including loan funds (see Annex 8), through the Department of Human
Development, Administration, andFinanceandthe procurementprocessthrough UACI(see Annex 7).

UAP will disappear and CNR will create a limited project coordinating unit (UCP or Unidad
Coordinadoradel Proyecto) to coordinate, monitor andevaluatethe project's activities and assure overall
project coordination both internally andexternally, with participatingagencies andthe World Bank.

Internal Coordination:
Internally, UCP will coordinatewith:
         (1) UACIstaff with regardto the procurementof goods, works and/or services;
         (2) the Department of Human Development, Administration, and Finance with regard to
             administrative andfinancial management; and
         (3) the Land and Mortgage Registry and the National Geographic and Cadastre Institute with
             regardto landregularization activities andtechnical supervision, inparticular of intemational
             landregularization contracts.

Coordination with ParticipatingAgencies:
CNR will sign cooperation agreements with each participating agency, with roles and responsibilities
clearly determined. CNR, through UCP, will coordinatewith these agencies, supportingthem with regard
to humanresourcestraining, provision of basic information, andlogistics. The participating agencies are:

         (1) ILP(component 1.3) for titlingin areas of social interest;
         (2) MARNwith regardto the delimitation and demarcationof protectedareas (component 1.4) as
             well as ISTA (component 1.4) with regard to the delimitation of protected areas stemming
             from the agrarianreform sector;
         (3) CONCULTURA (component 1.4) for the delimitation of areas of cultural value;
         (4) Municipal offices to keepcadastre databasesupdated(component 2.2).

The Project's Operational Manual will specify the duties and responsibilities of all institutions
participating in project implementation, CNR as executing agency, and the above-mentioned agencies as
participating agencies. Likewise, it will include the project's technical, legal, administrative, financial,
procurement, andmonitoring procedures.



2. Monitoringand evaluationof outcomes/results

Based on the current manual system under LAP I,CNR will implement an automated Monitoring and
Evaluation System in which UCP will be responsible for the ongoing collection, inputting, and
consolidation of data obtained from activities carried out during the execution of LAP IIin order to
measureprojectperformanceinreal time.

The new monitoring and evaluation system used under LAP I1 will assure the project's efficient
execution. It will havea subsystemto allow the administrative and financial monitoring of the project and
to generate the reports requiredby the World Bank's administrative, financial, andprocurement sections.



                                                  8

  It will haveanother subsystem that will also allow three types of indicatorsto be monitored: (a) indicators
  for physical execution (outputs) and financial execution (inputs); (b) results indicators for each
  component; and (c) outcomeindicators of project developmentobjectives (PDO).

  A baseline will be utilized for PDO outcome indicators. This will be updated in years 2 and 5 of the
  project. The primary sources of data for the other indicators will be: (i)       information from various CNR
  units (UACI, DDHAF, IGCN, RPRH); (ii) reports by contractors and UCP supervision reports, as
                                                 field
  well as those by other agencies associated with the project; and (iii)CNR's Registry and Cadastre
  Information System(SIRyC), currently operating.

  The Monitoring and Evaluation System will comply with the financial, procurement, administrative,
  monitoring and evaluation characteristics required by the World Bank as well as those of the Technical
  Secretariat of the Republic.


  3. Sustainability
  The LandAdministration Project 11(LAP 11), which is expectedto become effective in 2005, completes
  LAP Iwhich will end in mid-2005. LAP Ilaid the foundation for an efficient, self-sustainable national
  land administration program and has satisfactorily achieved its development objectives. The institutional
  framework was strengthened, the property registry andthe cadastrewere integratedin a single institution,
  and it i s now considered an institutional model for land administration that is inspiring other Latin
  American countries such as Honduras and Guatemala. In addition, CNR complies with I S 0 9000
  certification standards. With LAP11,the institutional framework will be consolidatedwith the integration
  of the administrative, financial, procurement andtechnical functions carried out untilnow by UAPunder
  LAPI.

  After a cash flow analysis of CNR for the period from 1996 to 2015, CNR's capacity to continue
  financing the modemizationprocesswas determined.A baseline scenario was developedand a sensitivity
  analysis was carried out to calculate CNR's likely surplus. An annual surplus of over US$4.0 million is
  projected, demonstrating CNR's capacity both to finance the investments and operating costs required to
  continue the modemization processinitiated under LAP I,          and its capacity to absorb a new loan. In2002
  and 2003, CNR generated a surplus of over US$5 million and with the LAP I1program it i s expectedto
  generate anincreasingsurplus between2005-2015 which will have ahighly positive fiscal impact.

   D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
   1. Economicandfinancialanalyses
   Economic benefits indicate that LAPI1is a solid investment for the country. The benefitsobtainedshould
   stem from the impact of legal security in land tenure on property prices, the banking system, and the
   streamlining of the registration process. The project i s also expected to have a partial contribution to the
   environment. The project's internal rate of return (IRR) i s 21%' with a correspondingnet present value
   (NPV)of US$32.3 million.

   A financial analysisof CNR's expectedcashflow for the period from 2005 to 2020 shows the agency's
   capacity to continue financing the niodernizationprocessand assume a new loan. A significant annual
   surplus i s projectedfor every year exceptfor 2012 and 2013 when the repaymentperiodsof LAP Iand
   LAPIIoverlap. The useof previous surpluses could help solvepossiblelimitted short-termliquidity
   problems. The role of municipalities inthe process of updating information i s highlighted, as well as the
   importanceof municipal agreementsfor CNR's financial sustainability.

   Inaddition, theproject's fiscal municipal impactwith regardto revenuecollection for servicesand
   commercialtaxes due to the availability of updatedcadastredata i s significant. Inthisregard, aUS$l5.0
   million increaseper year, nationwide, inrevenuecollection is estimated.


   2. Technical
   LAP Isuccessfully modernized CNR which i s now a financially sustainable institution that provides
   efficient land administration services nationwide. LAP II,         which extends LAP 1's geographic coverage
   and includes three new components, has a technical design perfectly appropriate for CNR's technical
   capacity.

   Additionally, the project's technical design is sound and in conformity with international standards.
   DuringLAP IIpreparation, CNR benefited from worldwide expertise and visited similar programs in
   LAC as well as inother regions (India andThailand).


                                                           10

CNR learned from LAP Iand improved the overall technical design accordingly, downscaling or
upscaling activities as reflectedinthe following two subcomponents:

        1.2: Land Regularization. LAP 11, unlike LAP Iwhich did it on a daily demand basis, includes
        immediate and systematic integration of all newly surveyed cadastralinformation in the property
        registry.

        2.2: Municipal Services. CNR intends to improve the delivery of land administration services at
        the local level through a stronger and more systematic partnership with municipalities, including
        training, technical assistance, provision of cadastral information and if necessary computer
        equipmentto the municipalities.

The project's technical design incorporatesfour success factors to sustain such an investment. First, LAP
I1will complete the nationalcoverage; second, it will guarantee the maintenanceof information; third; it
will make the best use of cutting-edge technology; and fourth, it will place specific emphasis on data
sharing.

National Coverage. Through LAP 11, national coverage will be achieved. For the first time in history, a
LAC country will have a fully computerized and comprehensiveparcel-basedproperty registry covering
urban,periurban, rural, protected, andforestedareas.

Maintenanceof Information. Legal and administrative reforms will focus on maintenanceand integration
of information, including new regulations of the cadastral law, so as to ensure the sustainability of the
investment. Partnershipswill be established with professional training entities and the Central American
Training Network on Land Administration (RECCAT or Red Centro Americana de Capacitacion en
Administracion de Tierras), since technicalproject activities are similar inthe region.

Consolidation of a More Efficient Information Technolonv Platform: The existing SIRYC will be
upgraded using cutting-edge technology to provide local land administration services through the Web.
Training and technical assistance will be provided to external users, including municipalities, surveyors,
andnotaries.

Promoting Information Sharing. Unlikeduring LAP I,       LAP11will promote cooperation betweenpublic
and private stakeholders, such as other line ministries, municipalities, surveyors, notaries, private banks,
and civil society. This will create a culture of information sharing, transparency, property rights, and
security that will benefit the final beneficiaries.

Costs: Costs for technical activities are consistent with standard costs in similar projects. In particular,
land regularization costs which represent 60% of project costs are consistent with the costs of similar
international competitive bidding for LAP I.Local costs, including supervision costs, have been
thoroughly discussedwith CNR.


3. Fiduciary
Financial:
On the basisof the assessments made, the financial managementteam concludedthat: (i) the proposed
                                                                                            as
project i s a follow-up operation, CNR has in place many of the elements to ensure adequate financial
management; (ii)there are, however, a few important differences in the financial management
arrangements proposedfor the LAPI1project. First, the entity will no longer utilize the services of UNDP



                                                   11

to manage project funds. Since the entity has successfully strengthened its capacity under the previous
project, funds will be managed directly by CNR. Second, the previous project's financial management
team will be integratedinto CNR's financial department in order to generate more efficiency and build
additional capacity within CNR, with a view to short- and medium-term benefits. These new financial
management arrangements will require CNR to implement a few additional elements in the immediate
term; and (iii) therefore, assumingthat CNR carries out the proposedaction planpresentedinAnnex 7, it
would have in place adequate financial management arrangements that meet the Bank's minimum
fiduciary requirementsto managethe proposedproject's specific financial activities.

A Special Account inU.S. dollars will be opened inthe BancoCentral de Reservato specifically manage
loan funds. At least at the beginning, the project will use transaction-baseddisbursements. Each quarter
CNR will prepare the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) to be submitted to the World Bank; and
annual project and CNR financial statements will be audited by independentauditors in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), in
accordancewith terms of reference(TORS),both acceptableto the World Bank.

Procurement:
An assessment of CNR's capacity to implement procurement actions for the project was carried out by a
procurement specialist in September 2004. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementingthe project and CNR's previousperformanceunder LAPI, the volume andcomplexity
                                                                           and
of procurement actions for the new project. The assessment concludedthat the UCP has demonstratedan
acceptable level of capacity to implement procurement and has assessedthe risk as low. It was decided
that the use of UNDP as procurement and financial agent will be discontinued. If necessary, CNR may
hire a procurementagent for specific, complex activities. Feesfor those services will not befinanced with
loan proceedsbut rather by counterpartfunds.



4. Social
A participatory social assessment for the project was carried out to: (a) identify all key stakeholderswho
should participate in decisionmaking on project design and implementation; (b) consider all of the
project's key stakeholdersin a significant and adequate manner for the design, promotion, and execution
of the project; and (c) identify the possible risks that could hinder the achievement of project objectives
andmake recommendationsto compensatefor suchrisks.

The assessment was based on such quantitative and qualitative methods as: (i)a land tenure survey; (ii)
semi-structuredinterviews; (iii) groups; and (iv) the use of secondary data such as official archives
                                  focus
and government statistics. The assessment identified project beneficiaries/stakeholders as: (i)specific
focus groups such as the very poor. These include persons still not regularized such as those in the
reformed sector, former combatantsandother persons displaced as a result of the civil war, peasants, and
those residingin marginal urbanareas-of both indigenousand mestizodescent; (ii)         CNR; (iii)
                                                                                                 municipal
offices. These institutions will be able to know how much their patrimony is in terms of land; and (iv)
civil society-the   population: urban and rural areas, following the modemization and updating of the
national cadastre system, offering users greater trust in the quality of information including the
identification of state, public, andprivate lands.

The Political Constitution of the Republic of El Salvador states that there is no discrimination for those
residing in the country's territory-an       aspect that was ratified by the signing of the 1992 Peace
Agreements in Chapultepec, Mexico. The Constitution recognizes the principle of legal equality, which
determines the exercise and enjoyment of civil rights and specifies that no discrimination may be made
based on differences of nationality, race, sex, or religion. El Salvador accepted International Labor



                                                   12

Organization (ILO) Agreement N" 107 but has not ratified ILO Agreement No169. Specifically, the
existing legislation regarding land is gender-neutral and gives women equal rights to having access to
land, regardless of the way in which such rights were acquired (i.e., by inheritance, purchase, lease,
donation, etc.).

The social assessment discovered that important decisions such as sale and mortgage are made by heads
of households(representedequally by menand women inEl Salvador) both inurban andrural areas. The
frequency of the processof decisionmakingby couples i s small (less than 5% inall homes) andcuriously
i s even lower in rural areas than in urban. There i s a significant frequency of homes in which decisions
are made by "others." In these cases, field work showed this i s due to a variety of circumstances; for
example: (i)  parents who have transferred property to their children; (ii)  landowners who are relatives
living abroad; and (iii)  owners who assign caretakers for their houses. Cases of informal caretaker
arrangementswere noted, in exchange for having a place to live. This was noted among owners living
abroad as well as those living in other parts of the country. To compensate for these imbalances,
information campaigns and project operating procedures will give equal treatment to male or female
heads of households who are undergoing the process of regularization (for example, as part of conflict
resolution activities by providing gender-sensitivetraining to staff working on regularization issues). The
project will also supervise the number and percentageof women owning parcels that are regularized or
titled.

The ChambitaMedidor program-the         name given to the processof mass regularization of the country's
lands-has    been such a success that everyone knows about it. This assessment did not evaluate the
precision and effectiveness of its work. Thus, "success" here refers to the population's degree of
knowledge. LAP I1 must be strategically disseminated, clearly showing its objectives and scope and
avoiding the creation of false expectations.It should also create regional training sessions on legal issues
related to measurement and registration in order to strengthen civil society's understandingand turn it
into a strategic ally.

Although the benefits of the land regularization process in terms of improving security have been
recognizedby the overwhelming majority of stakeholders, there is a lack of general understandingamong
both the urban and rural population, regardlessof gender, of landregistration proceduresand pitfalls. By
means of a well designed information and education campaign and with the target population well
identified,andthe active participation of all beneficiary groups, the evaluation found that the project has a
significantly positive social impact. Integrated planning will also help to conserve the environment,
support municipalities intheir urban development andlandplanning, and indirectly support private sector
investments.

The project's social impactswill be closely monitoredusingmitigation andpreventive measures adopted
to address adverse impacts. If  preventive measures are planned and detailed from the time of the project
design process, LAP I1 can become a model for the execution of land administration projects
implementedunderhighly complex institutional, legal, and social conditions.

The most important recommendationsfor mitigating and preventing adverse impacts are: (i) process the
of consultationwith potentialbeneficiariesof LAP11, carrying out Social Promotion andCivic Education;
(ii) 11mustbestrategicallydisseminated,clearlyshowingitsobjectivesandscopeandavoidingthe
     LAP
creation of false expectations; (iii) establishment of dialogue with state sectoral institutions and with
municipal offices to avoid social conflicts as much as possible; and (iii)     reviewing the possibility of
establishing an agreement with CONCULTURA to provide maps, charts, and photographs that will
contributeto the nation's patrimony.




                                                  13

As the project includes specific activities that will benefit indigenouspeoples, a participatory Indigenous
Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) was prepared. This IPDP addresses specific issues related to the
consultation, capacity building, and participation of indigenous groups through the project.



5. Environment
The environmental assessment carried out for the project noted a range of potential positive
environmental impacts related primarily to land use. On balance, the proposedproject is expected to be
highly positive from an environmental standpoint, since it will generate geographical and environmental
information that contribute to the improved management of protected areas and sites of cultural value.
Additionally, the project will directly contribute to the long-term sustainability of protected areas and
cultural patrimony sites through the delineation of all known sites in the country, as well as the gross
demarcationof three priority protectedareas and delimitation of three priority cultural patrimony sites (to
be selectedby MAFNandCONCULTURA], respectively).

Landregularization, cadastre, and registry servicesmay also induce a series of behavioral changes among
urban and rural landholders with regard to the environment. Based on an evaluation of those changes
under the project's soon-to-be completed first phase, these impacts are negligible. However any adverse
impacts on behavior will be more than compensated by the environmental benefits of strengthened
protectedareas, natural habitats, andcultural sites. (See Annex 10).

Additionally, CNR will sign agreements with both MARN and CONCULTURA to ensure their active
participation in the delimitation of natural habitats and cultural property. The data and information
collected by the project and provided to these agencies will enable them to consolidate the protection of
naturalhabitatsandcultural property.

Inthe case of cultural patrimony sites, it shouldbenotedthat the project procedureshavebeendeveloped
to ensure that any property information included in CNR's registry does not preclude the long-term
conservation of those areas. Specifically, in the case that culturally significant sites are identified during
or after project cadastre activities, the registry always allows for parcel records to be "marginalized," i.e.,
the presence of cultural finds can be directly noted in the registry. In such cases, CONCULTURA is
directly notified to allow it to make an official determination of the importance of and protection
warrantedfor those sites.

Finally, it i s important to mention that the project i s being prepared with a complementary partially
blended GEF project. The GEF project-a pilot-aims          to catalyze the consolidation of two key protected
areas and develop a strategy for consolidating other protected areas that i s directly linked to the
systematic land regularization process. This builds upon the lessons learned from the World Bank's
significant regional experiencein land administration. The Bank is currently supporting land projects in
all but two Central American countries (Costa Rica and Belize are also addressing landissues, but with
D B support), in addition to a large and growing land portfolio in Mexico and South America. Land
administration presents a limited window of opportunity to capture and "freeze" the current state of
population distribution in protected areas, limit allowable activities on priority ecologically sensitive
lands, and develop a model for promoting sustainabledevelopment on those lands. As such, the linked
projects are intentionally designedto forward the conservationof critical naturalhabitatsinElSalvador.

The safeguardscreeningcategory of the project is S2.

The project i s classified as a Category B, requiringsome type of Environmental Analysis (EA) but not a
full-scale Environmental Impact Assessment. In accordance with OP 4.01, an EA was conducted by
national and international experts during the summer of 2004. The EA identifies potential direct and
indirect impacts associated with the project, and concludes that the project's potential negative
environmental impacts are limited and far outweighed by the project's positive environmental impacts.
The EA findings andrecommendationswere incorporatedinto the project design to significantly enhance
the project's environmentaloutcomes.

The project's EA also found that the project does not trigger the Involuntary Resettlement policy (OP
4.12), as no resettlement or restriction in access to resources will result from project activities.
Specifically, the project will only identify and demarcateprotected areas at a gross scale, and no project
activities will yield any restriction in access to resources for people living in and near protected areas.
Consolidation and management of pilot protectedareas will be addressed, financed, and analyzedunder a
GEF-financedprojectbeing developedinparallel with this project.

The project triggers OD 4.20 (Indigenous People) as indigenous peoples are potential project
beneficiaries. To comply with OD 4.20, an IPDP has been prepared. Drawing upon informed
participation, the IPDP aims to ensure that indigenous peoples are not adversely affected by the project
andthat they receiveculturally compatiblebenefits.

The project triggers OPN 11.03 as the project area is known to support culturally valuable sites and
artifacts. However, there will be no legalization and/or titling of lands supporting these culturally
important materials.Inaddition, there are plans to maintainCONCULTURA's active participation during
project developmentin order to anticipateactions prior to field work involving the delimitation of cultural
property. Work on cultural patrimony will be carried out jointly with CONCULTURA, and support will
be given in attachingclauses to titles of lands which have cultural value, as the Law specifies, as well as
in coordinating indigenous education campaigns to make it possible to efficiently coordinate project
efforts, creatingsynergieswith regardto the delimitation of cultural property.

The projectdoes not require any exception from IBRDpolicies.The project meetsthe regionalcriteria for
readiness for implementation. The fiduciary arrangements are inplace. All key project staff and
consultants have been mobilized (most were part of the existingLAPIstaff). Adequate monitoring and
evaluation capacity is already inplace. The EnvironmentalAnalysis andthe IPDPwere disclosed inthe

                      Annex 1:Country and Sector or ProgramBackground
                            ELSALVADOR: LandAdministrationI1
Country and sector background:
Poverty and insecure land tenure in El Salvador have led to low investments in agriculture and in
intensive land and real estate activities, inadequate land management, and severe environmental
degradation. Over the last 30 years various administrations in El Salvador recognized that land was a
serious issue affecting long-term development but sought to address the issue solely through
redistribution. The GOES conducted a three-phased land reform in the 1980s through which it
expropriated 300,000 hectares of large farms and distributed them to cooperatives and individual
beneficiaries, benefiting 550,000 families.

While most of these lands were titled, the GOES lacked an updateablesystemto record and manageland-
related information. This resultedin a system that impeded the development of the land market and was
unable to use land-relatedinformation for planning purposes, both of which are essentialto the country's
long-term development.

To provide landowners with the necessary land security to transfer and invest in their land, in 1996 the
GOES signeda US$50 million loan (Land Administration Project Ior LAPI)with the World Bank whose
broadobjectiveswere to: (a) regularizelandfor El Salvador's estimated 1.8 million parcels; and (b) create
and maintainan efficient, streamlined, decentralized, and financially self-sustainingnationwide mapping,
cadastre, andproperty registration institution-the new National Registry Center (CNR).

LAP Icontinues to advance very satisfactorily toward achieving its development objective and i s
considereda best practice inthe region. Once completedin 2005, it will have: (a) regularized 60% of the
parcels and transferred all properties into a new computerized parcel-basedproperty registry (SIRyC);
and(b) createdandmodernizedCNR which is now financially sustainableand is providing more efficient
and accessible services countrywide (e.g., registration times have been reduced from several months to
one week).

To complete the successful regularization of 100% of the country, the GOES now wishes to finalize this
process inthe rest of the country andis thereforeinterestedina follow-up operation, the proposedLAP11.
The new project is expected to be effective in CY05. It would augment quantity, extend geographic
 scope, and add complementary components to the successful LAP Iwhich laid the foundation for an
efficient national land administration program.

 Thethree new complementary componentsare:

              - Extendingthe concept of regularization within LAPIto limited legalization and/or titling
                of urbanandperi-urbanlands of social interestwhich are often hometo the poorest of the
                poor. During LAP I,regularization referred to the dissemination campaign, mapping,
                verification of rights, delimitation of properties, field conflict resolution, notification of
                results, and transfer of information to SIRyC. It included registration of existing titles,
                althoughno legalization and/or titlingactivity was included;
              -  Strengthening of municipal land administration services so that: (i)final beneficiaries,
                 including poor people, have easy access to such services; and (ii)       municipalities can
                better manage and sustaintheir development; and
              - Delimitation of protected areas and cultural properties and limited demarcation of
                protectedareas.

Linked GEF operation
Another important land-relatedissue affects El Salvador's natural resources. Specifically, the country's
globally significant ecological resources andbiodiversity are at risk, primarily due to habitat destruction.
T h i s destruction, in turn, i s associated with the lack of clear landtenure security and i s compoundedby El
Salvador's population density, which, with Haiti, is the highestinthe region. For example, vi
the country's 118 protected areas are under threat, with people living in and around them, and invasions
(both legal and illegal) expanding. As aresult of the associated habitat destruction, El Salvador's globally
significant biological diversity is seriously threatened.

The proposed project is completing the cadastre and registry of all lands within El Salvador, including
protectedareas. Building upon lessons learned from the World Bank's significant regional experiencein
landadministration, the project is linked with a GEF-funded project (LandAdministration andProtected
Areas Consolidation) to catalyze the consolidation of key protected areas and develop a strategy for
consolidating other protected areas that is directly linked to the systematic land regularization process.
This strategywas developedfrom lessonslearnedinthe region, i.e., landadministration presents alimited
window of opportunity to capture and "freeze" the current state of population distribution in protected
areas, limit allowable activities on priority ecologically sensitive lands, and develop a model for
promoting sustainable development on those lands. If these issues are well addressed during the
systematic landregularization process, future degradationof critical biodiversity areas can be minimized
inElSalvador andmany othercountriesworldwide that are grappling with theseissues. Partof thiseffort
includes strengthening the national protectedareas system, capturing and "freezing" the current state of
population distribution, and limiting allowable activities on ecologically sensitive and risk-prone lands,
all of which can yield tremendousconservationbenefits.

The linked full-size GEF-funded project would go to appraisal in or around August 2005, after LAP II
has been approved. This innovative approach would provide up to US$5 million in GEF grants to fund
parallel conservation-related activities complementary to LAP 11, including pilot-scale activities to: (i)
demarcate strategic protected areas; (ii) and implement management plans for those protected
                                                develop
areas; and(iii)   support regularizationof residents within those protectedareas, subject to the requirements
of the management plans.

Linkage To CAS,Sector Stratem, or GobaUThematicStrategic Pnontv
The CAS for FY05-FY08 also includes a LAP 11which would support urban and rural productivity and
environmental sustainability and address three new CAS pillars: (i)          accelerating broad-based equitable
growth and increasing employment; (ii)           improving equity by building human capital and expanding
accessto basic infrastructure, assets, andmarkets; and (iii)      enhancingsecurity and reducingvulnerability.

Linkage to acceleratingbroad-based equitablegrowth and increasing employment
By supporting completion of the parcelbasedregistry and buildinginstitutional capacity to support land
title transfer, the project will improve the security of property rights and the performanceof land markets.
This will facilitate private investment and createjobs. LAP I1will also support activities aimed at raising
the productivity of small- and medium-scalefarmers by improvingnatural resourcemanagementabilities
and landtenure security. It will provide incentives to better land-related investments and improve land
productivity.

Specifically, CNR plays a key role in market development and service delivery to beneficiaries since it
provides: (a) security and fluidity of land transactions through a computerized (Internet-assisted) and
decentralized parcel-basedregistry (CNR' s transaction turnaround has been reduced from months to a
week); (b) security of private business through a modem commercial registry; (c) security of intellectual
property rights through a modern intellectual property registry. CNR therefore plays a key role in growth

and competitiveness since it improves the country's investment climate by providing investment security
and transparencyof market information.

Linkage to improving equity by building human capital and expandingaccess to basic infrastructure,
assets, and markets
By addressing land administration in northern and eastern El Salvador-an         area traditionally subject to
unclear tenure regimes, the site of the former civil conflict, and home to the poorest segment of the
population-LAP 11will directly improve the livelihoods of those most inneed.

The project will also seek to develop local land administration services that are more equitable and
accessibleto the poorestinruralandurbanareas. Studieshave shownthat giving secure property rights to
landthey already possess can greatly increasethe net wealth of poor people. (See Klaus Deininger, 2002.
World Bank Policy ResearchReporton "Land Policiesfor Growth andPoverty Reduction.")

Linkage to enhancing security and reducing vulnerability
The project will address severaldimensions of security. As mentioned, it will address land administration
issues in northern and eastern El Salvador-an       area traditionally subject to unclear tenure regimes and
site of the former civil conflict. The project will also reducethe timeframe for establishingthe real estate
cadastre and improve service standards for registering property transactions. These improvements, along
with public awareness campaigns and citizen surveys, will help to increase transparency and public
confidence inthe registration of property transactions.

Together with the partially blendedGEF cofinancing preparedinparallel, the project will also address the
current need to strengthen capacity in environmental and disaster management, as described above. The
topographical and cadastral data collected through the LAP I,LAP 11and GEF projects will be a key
input for natural resourcesmanagement, disaster mitigation and prevention (eg, hazard mapping), and
for identifying the best available risk-free areas in which to resettle the population in the aftermath of
naturaldisasters(for example, the CNR played a central role inthe aftermathof the 2001earthquakes).

                          ELSALVADOR: LandAdministrationI1

The project development objective is to improve land tenure security and land transactions
through the provision of efficient, equitable, and accessibleland administration services. This will
facilitate better land-related investments and more productive and environmentally sustainable
landuse.

Land administration services include massive, systematic land regularization (Le., dissemination
campaign, mapping, verification of rights, delimitation of properties, field conflict resolution,
notification of results, transfer of information to SIRyC, and limited titling in areas of social
interest) as well as day-to-day integratedcadastralandproperty registry services (eg, individual
title registration,issuance of cadastralcertificates).

As already mentioned, the proposedpartially blendedGEFproject would complementthe IBRD-
financed LAP 11and improve its development objective in terms of nature conservation and
consolidationof protectedandecologically sensitive areas.

The envisagedDevelopmentIndicators are:
f )  CNR financial capacity to serve the loan maintained;
g) Percentage of new transactionsmade inthe field registeredinto SIRyC;
h) Costs andlength of time ofregistry transactionsreduced;
i) KnowledgeandutilizationofCNR'slandservicesincreased;and
j) UsersatisfactionwithCNRcadastreandregistry servicesimproved.

Project Components
The project will have three components: (i) Regularization; (ii)
                                                   Land                      Decentralization of Land
Administration Services; and(iii)   Project Administration.

Component 1: LandRegularization(US$43.5 million)
This component will complete the regularization for the entire country. Regularization in this
project context refers to the massive and systematic dissemination campaign, mapping,
verification of rights, delimitation of properties, field conflict resolution, notification of results,
and transfer of information to SIRyC. It also includes legalization and/or titling of lands in areas
of social interest.

This componentincludes:

 I.1: Reviewof Legal, Regulatory, andAdministrative Frameworks
This component includes short-term reforms needed to implement project activities efficiently
and effectively and support to longer-term reforms to continuously improve the national land
administrationsystem.

              1. Prior to project start-up, it is very important to adjust the legal, regulatory, and/or
              administrative framework to be able to: (i)   ensure the integration of registrykadastre
              information (one-to-one linkage betweenparcel and title) collected duringLAPIand
              LAP11;and(ii) thisinformation updatedinthe longterm.
                              keep

              2. Duringproject execution, support will be given to the implementation of reforms
              that enable ongoing improvement in the performances of institutions providing land



                                                    25

             administration and regularization services, to ensure that such services are provided
             inanefficient, decentralized,accessible, fluid, andsimple manner.

1.       Inthe first phase, prior to the execution of LAP 11, CNR will proceedto formulate a
regulation on the implementation of the current CadastreLaw, in order to regulate the execution
and maintenance of the physical-legal cadastre integrated with the registry. This regulation will
establish the framework under which activities will be carried out to link, maintain, and integrate
registry and cadastre information, to the degree permitted by the Law. Mechanisms will be
included so that in future registry transactions, cadastre data from the new computerizedsystem
will prevail over old data. This Regulationwill be issuedby the Executive Branch.

The sameMinistry will also be incharge of issuingthe executivedecrees andagreements needed
to support the execution of activities contemplated by this regulation and needed for project
execution.

Duringthis same phase, CNR will formulate andsign the CooperationandExecutionAgreements
needed to launch the project's various components, with public entities that have the legal
authority to coordinate the legalization and or titling activities (ILP), or to execute specific
activities inthe field of environmentandcultural heritage (MARN, ISTA, andCONCULTURA).

Finally, although not a condition for the launching of activities, CNR will support the preparation
of the Regulation for the Implementation of Legislative Decree N"462 which establishesCNR's
administrative and operational autonomy, for the purpose of developing and strengthening the
regulationsthat grant CNR the authority to regulate the servicesitprovides.

2.       Inthe secondphase, to be carried out during the execution of LAP11, CNR will provide
technical assistance to support the improvement of the country's legal, regulatory, and
administrative frameworks relatedto property rights and landadministration, so as to ensure that
         .
CNR andother entities involved inthe provision of such services are able to:

         .   Provide more efficient, decentralized, accessible, and fluid registration and cadastre
             services; and
             Provide adequatelegal solutionsto landirregularities.

During this second step CNR will carry out consultation, dissemination, and public awareness
activities related to the regulatory changes referred to above and will provide training and hold
workshopson the regulatory changes proposed.

CNR will sign the agreements needed for the provision and maintenance of cadastre-registry
services to municipalities. In conjunction with the private sector, it will also promote the
establishment of a roster of qualified topographers (eg, based on the principles of the
International Federationof Surveyors-FIG) to facilitate the provision of quality cadastre services
at local level.

1.2: Land Regularization
This subcomponent includes cartographic and field activities as well as greater integration of
parcel-basedfield data in the Landand Mortgage Registry and the National Cadastre. LAP Ihas
covered six departments (60% of parcels) while LAP11is expected to cover the eight remaining
departments(40% of parcels).

                                                                    LAP I:L 2 million pan:els.
                                           (rural maps
                                           only)

 ktivities include:
     0   Preparation of basic cartography for cadastre surveys (digital mapping for the
         departments of Cuscatliin, Chalatenango, San Miguel, Usuluth, Cabaiias, La Unibn,
         Morazh, andSan Vicente).
     0   Verification of rights and delimitation of properties: disseminationcampaign, analysis of
         existing cadastral and registry information, field surveys, field conflict resolution,
         notification and consultation of results, and integration in SIRyC for the departments of
         Cuscatlh, Chalatenango, San Miguel, UsulutAn, Cabaiias, La Unibn, San Vicente, and
         Morazh.
     0   Transfer (Conversion and Linkage): Defined as the transfer of registry data in folio
         personal (property register kept by name of registrantlowner), folio real (paper record
         keptby parcel, andmechanizedrecords of the RegisalIand I1system), to SIRyC, linking
         them with cadastre data in order to have a one-to-one link between the register and the
         graph of the parcel. The transfer and linkage will be carried out for the following 11
         departments: Cuscatlh, Chalatenango, San Miguel, Usuluth, Cabaiias, La Unidn,
         Morazh, La Paz, San Vicente, San Salvador, and La Libertad. The linkage with respect
         to Sonsonate, Ahuachaph, and Santa Ana will be completed (conversion already
         completedinthese three departments).

In those parcels adjacent to the coastline, rivers and lake, the parcel will be surveyed in
accordancewith the physical boundary and will incorporate information inthe physical cadastre
and registry without changing the parcel's legal status. Under the legal, regulatory and
administrative framework component, the study of the issue of coastline, rivers and lake
definition will be taken into account, sincethe country legal procedure for such a definition. This
i s a very important issuebecause, by law, beaches are for public use.

No activities will becarriedout inareas where the boundaryi s not demarcated.Inareas where the
boundary is not demarcated, property rights and parcel limits will not be verified and delimited
within 500 metersof the boundaryrepresentedinthe official documents andcartography.


                                                  27

1.3:Legalization andor titling of lands in Areas of Social Interest
Unlike in the first phase, one of the activities of the project's second phase is the titling of a
selected group of lands for the purpose of benefiting low-income social levels to give them legal
security over their lands. CNR will provide support to legalization and/or titling programs in
urbanor semi urbanareas where ownership or goodfaithpossessionis demonstratedby formal or
informal documents, in order to formalize andrecordtheminthe registry.

Incoordination with the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency, CNR will define the areas to be
titled. Most of these areas will be locatedin poorer municipalities, according to a poverty map
published by the FISDL. This will be the principal selection criterion. In addition, within these
municipalities, priority will be given to areas with other social programs (e.g., the housing
program financed by IDB) to increase impact through synergies. This will be done in agreement
with STP's socialprogramcoordinationunit.

There will be no titling activities in areas considered critical or non-critical natural habitats,
forests, or areas of cultural value and/or under dispute. No legaliaztion and/or titling will be
carried out on private property in which the owner acquires such ownership by means of
mechanisms such as acquisitive prescription, since there may or may not be knowledge of the
property belonging to a third party, even if he/she wishes to become an owner and acts as an
owner.

CNR will carry out titling activities with the support of ILP, adecentralizedentity associatedwith
the Presidency of the Republic, with its own technical characteristicsand adequate procedures to
ensure the coordination and technical supervision of such activities. The process will begin by
using current legislation, with the simplified mechanismsthat ILP uses for such cases. ILP has
considerableexperienceinthis. (See Annex 6.)

CNR will define the cadastre and registry status of areas to be legalized and/or titled, and give the
basic data to ILP. ILP will preparethe TORSfor the hiringof notaries who will carry out titling
services, and ILP will be in charge of controlling their quality until they are registeredby CNR.
Notaries will be selectedin accordancewith World Bankrules andCNR requirements. CNR pays
notaries directly with the approval of their work by ILP. Information will be published in
newspapers as a part of the legalization/titling process, which will be coordinated by ILP. The
final step i s the registration of titles in CNR through a unit identified by CNR with lengthy
experiencein social legalization and/or titling programs.

To ensuretitlingwithin the project period, CNR will provide logistical support to ILPwith regard
to physical and human resources to comply with necessary requirements. CNR will carry out
ongoing supervision of ILP's work and at all times will have the authority to determine the
appropriateactionsthat ILPshouldtake to comply with agreedtargets.

I.4: Delimitation andLimited Demarcation of ProtectedAreas
This subcomponent will deal with various land regularization activities within El Salvador's
protectedareas andmangroves.

Specific activities will include the delimitation of boundaries of declared areas of the National
ProtectedAreas System and of mangroves. This activity, besides directly benefiting MARNby
geographicallyunderstandingthe area's boundaries, will assist inthe processof transferring lands
stemmingfrom the SalvadoranInstitute for Agrarian Transformation (ISTA) to the State andthen
to MARN.


                                                 28

A MARN expert would accompany CNR staff carrying out the delimitation. First, he/she will
participate in the analysis of existing registry, cartographic, and cadastre data on the zone. Then
he/she will carry out a field inspection, and once in the field thejoint delimitation will be carried
out in a participatory manner, usingtechnical procedures agreed upon by CNR and MARN and
describedinthe operationalmanual.

In addition, the project will make a rough demarcation of the following three protectednatural
areas which havebeendefined inconjunction with MARNandhaveno internal or externaltenure
conflicts. This demarcation will include marking strategic points in order to easily locate the
boundariesof selectedareas.

Moreover, CNR will work incoordination with CONCULTURA to delimitthree priority cultural
sites which have no internal or external tenure conflicts. For other culturally significant sites,
CNR's SIRyC will permit their "marginalization," which means that a specific notations will be
made in the Landand Mortgage Registry to parcels containing a piece of cultural value so as to
protectthat piece.

As mentionedpreviously, the loan will be complementedby a GEFproject which will financethe
demarcation of protected areas and mangroves, possible management plans within various
selected areas, andregularization of tenure within these areas.


Component2: Decentralization of LandAdministration Services (US$9.0 million)

The objective of this component is to improve the execution of day-to-day registry and cadastre
services at local level. It will allow accessiblelandservicesas well as moreeffective maintenance
of the parcel-basedregistry throughout the nation.

This component includes:

2.I: Consolidationof the Strengtheningof CNR's m c e s
This subcomponent will strengthenthe capacity of CNR's departmental offices and other local
offices to provide local services including registration of sales, inheritance, mortgages, etc. as
well as re-measurementsor preparationof cadastreplans.

This subcomponent will include the institutional improvements needed to make services more
accessibleto end-users. This component will also deal with the use of information technology,
including web-based services to improve service execution at a highly local and decentralized
level.

Training campaigns will be carried out in order to create a culture of registry rights and of how
the cadastre i s an important input for property registration, in which different sectors will be
involved: notaries, lawyers, indigenous peoples, peasants, and others. This will be supported by
CNR's institutional publicity campaign for project dissemination.

Partnershipsand exchange with similar projectsin the region, as well as regional entities for land
administrationcapacitybuilding, will be supportedin order to createcomplementary synergies on
the same topic.

Support will be given to I S 0 standard 9000 inthe National Geographic andCadastreInstitute and
in the LandandMortgage Registry. CNR's Boardhas already approvedthe implementation plan.


                                                  29

2.2: Modernization of LandAdministration Servicesat local level
This subcomponent will strengthen the ability of municipalities to provide maintenance of
cadastre data and of land administration services. This i s an important subcomponent because
although municipalities are key partnersof CNR for the maintenanceof the parcel-basedproperty
registry, they havenot been sufficiently strengthenedunder LAPI.

Municipalities will be strengthened in terms of utilizing data to update their cadastre database in
order to provide andor update their revenue base and better understand and administer their
resources. This will also make them more efficient or allow them to expand the services they
provide andto support the cadastrein order to updateit.

CNR will promote agreements for the purpose of strengthening municipal offices, as was done
under LAPI(eight agreements were signed), with greater coverage and scope, so that municipal
offices may become self-sufficient in the use of technological tools. They will receive cadastral
datafromthe field survey andinexchange will support CNR's cadastre maintenanceefforts.

Inaddition, to facilitate andpromotethe sharing of spatialinformation amonglocal stakeholders,
CNR, particularly through workshops and technical meetings, will promote a pilot program in
one department where CNR already has detailed up to date information, with the objective of
defining and evaluating protocols for the sharing of data as well as standard data and metadata
models in order to simplifying data sharing. This pilot program will not include regularization
activities already included inother components.

The principal participants in this pilot program will be the municipalities of this department and
the institutions that will actively participate in LAP 11as well as VMVDU in charge, together
with MARNand CNR, of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. If this pilot program works
well inthe department, it may be extendedthroughout the country within another operation.


Component 3: Project Administration (US$3.1 million)
Although CNR will be the sole implementing agency, it will deal with various participating
institutions andpartners. Therefore, specific attention must be paidto project administration so as
to maximize inter-institutional coordination and thus the project's ongoing execution. This
component includes the project's Monitoring and Evaluation system. It will also include
necessary audit servicesand studies relatedto landadministration and other aspects of sustainable
development.

                          Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements
                          ELSALVADOR: LandAdministrationI1

The institution directly responsiblefor project implementationis the National Registry Center. A
subsidiary agreementwill be signed by the Republic of El Salvador (representedby the Ministry
of Finance) and CNR for project implementation as CNR will handle the funds and most of the
implementation arrangements.

CNR will coordinatethe various participating agencies by means of agreements that will become
effective, to the World Bank`s satisfaction, before the corresponding activities begin. CNR
successfully implemented LAP Iwhich is now 100%disbursed, is about to close, and has very
satisfactorily achievedits objectives. CNR is a strong, financially sustainableinstitution, a unique
case inthe region. CNR reimbursesthe loan (principal andinterest) andgenerates yearly profits.

The National Registry Center was created by Executive Decree No62 dated December 5, 1994,
publishedinOfficialGazetteNo227, Volume No325 datedDecember7, 1994, as a Decentralized
Unit assigned to the Ministry of Justice. In June 1999, CNR, under Executive Decree No6,
became aunit assigned to the Ministry of Economy.

Under Legislative Decree N" 462 of 1995, CNR was constituted as a public institution with
administrativeandfinancial autonomy, blending the GeneralBureau of Registries, the RealEstate
and Mortgage Registry, the Social Registry of Properties, the National Geographic and Cadastre
Institute and the Commercial Registry, thereby consolidating registry functions in only one
institution.

CNR i s an institution with financial and administrative autonomy and related to the Executive
Branchthroughthe Ministry of Economy.

CNR's higher-level managementis in charge of a Board comprised of six members: Minister of
Economy, Vice-Minister of Commerce and Industry, Vice-Minister of Finance, Vice-Minister of
Housing andUrban Development, an appointee of the Federation of Lawyers' Associations, and
an appointeeof Civil Engineering andArchitectural unions (Salvadoran Association of Engineers
andArchitects-ASIA). The Minister of Economyis the Director-President,andinhisher absence
the Vice-Minister of Commerce and Industry.

CNR's administration is the responsibility of an Executive Director appointedby the Presidentof
the Republic. CNR's activities basically consist of regulating and developing registry, cadastre,
cartographic, and geographic activities-onstitutional      activities considered to be of national
interest as they assure legal security on property andor citizen rights.

CNR's organizational structure basically consists of the Executive Office under which are the
Human Development, Administration and Financial Department; the Land and Mortgage
Registry; the National Geographic and Cadastre Institute; the Intellectual Property Registry; the
CommercialRegistry; andthe Department of Information Technology.

To administer LAP I,the GOES created the UAP which is a part of CNR. This unit very
satisfactorily administered LAP Iwith the assistance of UNDP as a procurement and financial
agent.

Unlike LAP I,LAP I1 antici.pates a much stronger institutionalization of the project in its
administrative, procurement, financial, and technical areas. UNDP will no longer be used as the

                                                 32

procurement and financial agent. (See Annex 7.) During LAP 11, CNR will directly manage the
project's financial and administrative aspects, including loan funds (see Annex S), through the
Department of Human Development, Administration, and Finance) and the procurement process
through UACI (see Annex 7).

UAP will disappear and CNR will create a limited project coordinating unit (UCP or Unidad
Coordinadoradel Proyecto) to coordinate, monitor andevaluatethe project's activities and assure
overall project coordination both internally and externally, with participating agencies and the
World Bank.

Internal coordination
Internally, UCPwill coordinatewith:
         (i)UACIstaff with regardto the procurementof goods, works, and/or services;
         (ii) DepartmentofHumanDevelopment,Administration, andFinancewithregardto
            the
         administrative andfinancial management; and
         (iii) LandandMortgageRegistryandtheNationalGeographicandCadastreInstitute
             the
         with regard to land regularization activities and technical supervision, in particular of
         international landregularizationcontracts.

Administrative andFinancialFunctions
For Phase 11of the Land Administration Project, it i s expectedthat administrative and financial
staff currently in UAP will join CNR' s Administrative and Financial Management Department.
As a result of the analyses made and due to the similarity of functions among areas of work, it
was concludedthat there is no obstacle to achieving a smooth integration of staff of both Units
into one unit, Le., CNR's Financial and Administrative ManagementDepartment, beginningJuly
1,2005.

CNR's Financial and Administrative Management Department, in terms of financial matters,
consists of three entities: (a) Treasury, (b) Accounting, and (c) Budget. UAP's Financial Unit is
comprisedinthe same manner. Thus, on this basisthe transition proposal would basically be that
for Phase11each personinUAP's Financial area would becomepart of each area of work, as the
case may be, of the Financial area of CNRs Administrative and Financial Management
Department,under the coordinationofthe chief of each area.

ProcurementFunctions:
With regard to UAP staff currently working in the area of procurement, for the process of
procuring works, goods and services as well as in the respective payment process, since the
Institutional ProcurementandContracting Unit (UACI) has an organizational structure comprised
solely of staff with experienceinpurchasingunder the State ProcurementLaw, it i s proposedthat
the three persons in UAP with experience in purchasingunder World Bank proceduresfully join
UACI, forming a new department and/or Unit,beginning July 1,2005, to deal in an exclusive and
permanent manner with World Bank procurement. To strengthen UACI in matters of
procurement using World Bank resources, two new positions are being considered (1 engineer
and 1 assistant) under the Procurement Plan for LAPII, in order to improve and complete the
Unit's technicalskills.

Technical Activities:
UCP will have technical coordinators in charge of overall international contract management.
They will coordinate with staff of the Land and Mortgage Registry and the National Geographic
and Cadastre Institute in charge o f (i)   providing contractors with necessary input information
(e.g., old cadastralmaps); and (ii) technically controlling the contractors' work (e.g., validation of
maps producedby private contractors).

                                                 33

External coordination
CNR will sign cooperation agreements with each participating agency, with roles and
responsibilities clearly determined. CNR, through UCP, will coordinate with these agencies,
supporting them with regard to human resources training, provision of basic information, and
logistics. The participating agenciesare:

         (i)P(Component1.3)fortitlinginareasofsocialinterest;
            E
         (ii) withregardtothedelimitationofprotectedareas(Component1.4)andISTA
             MARN
         (Component 1.4) with regard to the delimitation of protected areas stemming from the
         agrarianreform sector;
         (iii)CONCULTURA (Component 1.4) for the delimitation and protection of areas of
         cultural value; and
         (iv) Municipal offices to keepcadastre databases updated(Component 2.2).

For Component 1.3: Titling inAreas of Social Interest
As described in Annex 4, properties will be titled with the support of notaries and lawyers
selected competitively and contracted by CNR. Titling will be supervised by the Liberty and
ProgressInstitute (ILP), which was createdby Legislative DecreeN" 16 datedFebruary 26, 1991,
andi s subordinateto the Presidency of the Republic.

ILP has a good inter-institutional relationship with CNR. Its mission is to promote, seek,
facilitate, and assure resources for property legalization and/or titling and to streamline their
recording in the property registry, as well as to assist disadvantaged families and resolve the
problem of legal insecurity under which thousands of Salvadoran families live. ILP has been
successfully incharge of the El Salvador Puis de Propieturios Program, LandTransfer Program,
and Rural Legal Security Program, among others, through which tens of thousands of titles have
beenissuedand registered.

CNR will provide the necessary logistical support andtrainingto ILP so that the agency can carry
out its supervisionand coordination tasks in a timely and satisfactory manner. For its part, CNR
will hire notariesto carry out the titling processunder ILP supervision and give legal security to
those holding rights for which transactions are submitted to its offices for registration, and
publicize the actions of users.

For Component 1.4: Delimitation andLimitedDemarcation of ProtectedAreas
CNR will work with MARN,which was createdby Executive DecreeN"27 datedMay 16, 1997,
published in Official Gazette No88, Volume 335 that same day and year. It i s in charge of the
protection, restoration, development, and use of natural resources. It is also in charge of
formulating, planning, andexecuting Governmentpolicies regardingthe environment and natural
resources, as well as of directing, controlling, and enforcing such areas, together with their
promotion and development. ISTA is in charge of the delimitation of protected areas stemming
from the agrarian reform sector. Since the participation of these two actors is key, CNR will
provide the necessary logistical support andtraining to ensure that they can perform their tasks in
atimely and satisfactorymanner.

With regard to delimitation, MARN will provide the locations of protected natural areas and
information on mangroves in order to prepare a prior study jointly with CNR. In addition, CNR
will coordinate the review process, when necessary assisting a delegation comprised of MARN,
ISTA, and CNR to carry out a ajoint delimitation in the field. Once CNR has the cadastre map
with its respectivequality control, it will deliver the map to MARN and ISTA in protected areas,
and to MARNin mangroves.

                                                 34

For demarcation,MARNwill locatethree areas. CNR will hire the company inchargeof physical
demarcationin accordancewith MARNrequirementsand once the latter approves the work CNR
will proceedto issue payment.

CNR, in coordination with CONCULTURA, will carry out the delimitation of three areas of
cultural value. CONCULTURA will choosethree areas. CNR will hirethe company in charge of
delimitation in accordancewith CONCULTURA requirements and once the latter approves the
work CNR will proceedto issue payment.

CONCULTURA was created by Executive Decree W 55 dated September 20, 1990. It is a
decentralized unit of the Ministry of Education, and its purpose i s to aid in compliance with
culturally-related duties that were once the responsibility of the National Bureau of Culture. Its
principal objective is to research, conserve, develop, promote, and disseminate culture and
appreciation of the arts. Its functions include coordinating all State agencies that participate in El
Salvador's cultural affairs, and developing the processes of conserving, protecting, restoring, and
preservingnatural andcultural heritage.

Furthermore, for other culturally significant sites,         CNR' s     SIRyC will permit their
"marginalization," which means that a specific notation can be made in the property registry to
parcelscontaining a pieceof cultural value so as to protect that piece.

For Component2.2: Modernization of LandAdministration Servicesat local level
Individual agreements will be signedwith each municipality. DuringLAPI,        CNR saw the needto
find a mechanism to keep cadastre data updated. It found the solution of working with local
governments that are closer to the territory they administer. At the same time, some
municipalities approachedCNR dueto their needfor geographicinformation.

CNR has signed agreements with eight municipalities: Sonzacate, Santo Domingo, Atiquizaya,
San Marcos, Alep'a, San Juan Opico, Ahuachaph, and San Salvador. These agreements are
working satisfactorily.

Under LAP 11, CNR will promote the signing of a larger number of agreements with different
municipalities, for the purpose of keeping cadastre information updated while providing
municipalities with the tools to improve their revenue collection base and better understandthe
resources they are administering.

CNR andthe municipality agree to cooperate with each other, under the scope of their respective
legaljurisdictions, to utilize andmaintainthe cadastre datathey have available.

CNR provides the municipality with the following data: cadastre map, topographic map, and list
of landowners. It also provides training on the use, utilization, and management of cadastre
information, and it will periodically inform the municipality about changes that have occurred
andincorporatethosethat the municipality informs it about.

For its part, the municipality will periodically inform CNR about changes that have occurred in
the data contained in cadastre outputs, about which it has knowledge through the exercise of its
legal authority, particularly with regard to changes in parcels. The municipality also agrees to
include within its organization a mechanism to receive, process, and maintain the cadastre
information resultingfrom the agreement.



                                                 35

For ComDonent 2.2: Pilot Project
No official agreement will be needed since the pilot is based on technical collaboration between
various stakeholders willing to agree on common technical standards and protocols to facilitate
data sharing and maintenance. In any case, CNR will finance and remain responsible for the
coordination of the pilot project.

Summary ConclusionofFinancialManagementAssessment.
On the basis of the assessmentsperformed, the financial management team presentsthe following
conclusions:

    (i)     As the proposed project is a follow-up operation, CNR has in place many of the
            elementsneededto ensure adequatefinancial management.

    (ii)    There are however, a few important differences in the financial management
            arrangements proposed for the LAP IIproject. First, the entity will no longer utilize
           the services of UNDP to manage project funds. Since the entity has successfully
            strengthened its capacity under the previous project, project funds will be managed
            directly by CNR. Second, the previous project's financial managementteam will be
            integratedinto CNR's financial department, in order to generate more efficiency and
            build additional capacity within CNR, with a view to short- and medium-term
            benefits. These new financial management arrangements will require CNR to
            implement a few additional elementsinthe immediateterm.

    (iii)   Therefore, assuming that CNR carries out the proposedaction plan presentedin this
            assessment, it would have in place adequate financial managementarrangementsthat
            meet the Bank`s minimum fiduciary requirements to manage the specific financial
            activities of the proposedproject.

Standard requirementdagreements.It was agreed that: (i) Special Account denominatedin
                                                              a
U.S. dollars will be opened in the Banco Central de Reservato specifically manage loan funds;
(ii)at leastat the beginning, the project will usetransaction-baseddisbursements; (iii)each
quarter CNR will preparethe Financial Monitoring Reports (Fh4Rs) to be submittedto the World
Bank; and (iv) annual project and CNR financial statements will be audited in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Federation of Accountants
(IFAC), by independent auditors, and in accordance with terms of reference (TORS), both
acceptableto the World Bank.

ImplementingEntities
The executing agency for the proposed project will be CNR ("Centro Nacional de Registros").
CNR was created on December 5, 1994 by an Executive Decree, as an institution with
administrative and financial autonomy. Project implementation will be carried out by CNR
through a ProjectCoordinating Unit(UCP) located within CNR. The UCP will be responsiblefor
coordinating project activities and include minimal staff (a coordinator, a procurement officer, a
financial management officer and an assistant). It i s envisioned that the project's financial
management team will be integrated within CNR's financial department, with direct linkage to
the UCP. CNR will have overall financial and accountingresponsibility for the proposedproject,
including: (i)maintenance of accounting records; (ii)processing of disbursements; (iii)
preparation of project financial statements in accordance with World Bank guidelines; (iv)
management of bank accounts; (v) managementof financial information systems; (vi) preparation
and submission of quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs); and (vii) preparation and
submissionof withdrawal applications.

Staffing
As indicated above, CNR will create a Project Coordinating Unit (UCP) to managethe proposed
project. However, unlike Phase Iof the program, the project's financial management aspects will
be integrated within the entity's financial management department in order to strengthen
institutional financial management capacity. Since the proposed project is a follow-up operation,
the financial staff of the UAP (administrative unit for the LAP Iproject), including the
Accountant, Treasury Officer, and Budget Officer, will continue with the secondproject, but will
be integrated into the CNR, as shown below.

Flow of Funds
The flow of funds for the proposed project calls for project funds to be channeled through a
Special Account denominated in USD to be established by the Ministry of Finance in Banco
Central de Reserva.

In addition to the Special Account in Banco Central de Reserva, in order to facilitate project
disbursements, CNR will have an account to manage counterpart funds and a clearing account,
which will receive transfer of funds from the Special Account in USD to cover the portion of
payments eligible for IBRD financing and from the Counterpart Account to cover the portion of
payments eligible for Government financing at the time of payment to suppliers.

Therefore, as eligible expenditures are incurred, CNR will withdraw the amount to be financed by
IBRDfrom the Special Account in USD in accordance with the financing percentage agreed. It
will also withdraw the counterpart portion of the payment from the Counterpart Account. Both
withdrawals will be deposited into a clearing account from which payments to vendors will be
issued (requiring only one check).

Project Flow of Funds

Special Account. To facilitate disbursement against eligible expenditures, the Ministry of
Financewill establishin Banco Central de Reserva, a Special Account in US dollars under terms
and conditions acceptable to the World Bank. The World Bank will, upon request, make an
authorized allocation of US$ 2.0 million. Applications for the replenishment of the SA will be
submitted monthly (or when 30% of the initial deposit has been utilized, which ever occurs
earlier). The replenishmentapplication would be supported by the necessary documentation, the
SA bank statement andareconciliation of this bank statement.

Accounting and Reporting
Segregation of Duties. CNR's and UCP's organizational structures and established procedures
support an adequate segregation of procurement, payment, and recording activities. The
authorization to execute a transaction will be the main responsibility of the Project Coordinator
and/or Technical Officers. Procurement activities will be the main responsibility of the UACI
(CNR's procurement unit). The recording of the transaction will be the main responsibility of
CNR's accountingunit.

Budgeting. A budget is usually prepared at the beginning of each year. The borrower will be
responsible for compiling a comprehensivebudget for the project. Typically, the annual budget
would include:

    0    An annual work plan classified by major goals/objectives, including physical and
         financial programs; and
    0    A budget (broken down at least quarterly), specifying detailed expenditures by major
         component, category, and source of funds.

Payment and Operation of Bank Accounts. CNR, through the project financial unit, will be
responsiblefor project disbursement to vendors. The processi s expectedto be as follows:

     0   The Project Coordinator andProcurementOfficer review the invoice (generally against a
         PO or contract) andreview necessaryapprovalsfrom the Technical Officers;
     0   The approvedinvoice andpaymentrequest is receivedby the Accountant for processing;

                                                39

    0    The Accountant reviewsthe information andpreparesacheck request;
    0    The check request is submitted to Treasury for processing (including authorized
         signatures);
    0    Once the authorizedsignatureshave been obtained, the check is delivered to the vendor;
         and
    0    Documentation is filed appropriately and the transaction recorded into the computerized
         accountingsystem.

Bank account reconciliations will be prepared at CNR, through the project financial unit, on a
monthly basis.

Information Technology (IT) Systems. Project funds will be captured in the integrated financial
management system (SAFI) utilized by CNR. However, there will be a need for the
implementation of a basic financial system for the purposes of aggregating information from
SAFI on a component basis (for financial monitoring to the Bank) and preparing withdrawal
applications on the basis of disbursement categories. This system is currently under preparation
and should be ready by the effectiveness date. The system should also include a module for
procurement andphysical monitoring.

Safeguard over Assets. Assets acquired using project funds will be in the custody of the
respective organizations. The accounting system allows for tracking of assets purchased.
Therefore, the asset register will be kept within CNRs accounting system. The amounts in the
register will be reconciled monthly against the respective account balances. At least one annual
physical inspection of the assets will be undertaken by CNR staff, preferably with the
participation of externalauditors.

internal Audit. CNR has an internal audit department which i s responsible for auditing CNR's
activities. Therefore, reviews of project transactions fall under the purview of the internal audit
department. This department usually evaluates the preparation of project financial statements,
administrative systems, andaccountingtransactions. The project has one internal auditor assigned
to the review of financial systems. In addition, for this project, the use of external independent
auditors (as described below) will contribute to ensuring that the resources are used for the
intendedpurpose.

Reporting. The borrower will be responsible for producing the Financial Monitoring Reports
(Fh4Rs) on a quarterly basis, to be submitted to the Bank only for monitoring purposes. The
FMRswill includea narrativeoutlining the project status for the quarter, the project's sources and
uses of funds, a report presentingexpenditures by subcomponent, a physical progress report, a
procurement status report, and a procurement table. FMRs should be submitted to the Bank no
later than45 days after the endof the reporting period.

The annual financial statements will include the project's sources and uses of funds, a report
presentingexpenditures by subcomponents, the schedule of SOEs presentedduring the year, and
a reconciliation of the SpecialAccount. These reports will be preparedby the borrower and made
availableto the auditors after the end of the Borrower's fiscal year.

CNR will create a financial management procedures manual as part of the operational manual.
The operationalmanualwill clearly establishfinancial management policies andprocedures.

Audit Arrangements
The annual audited project financial statements will be provided to the Bank within six months
after the endof eachfiscal year and also at the closing of the project. In addition, because CNR is

                                                40

an autonomous, revenue-earning entity, it will be required to provide annual audited financial
statements. CNR will also be required to provide its audited financial statements to the Bank
within six months after the end of its fiscal year. The contract for the audit awarded during the
first year of project implementation may be extended from year to year with the same auditor,
subject to satisfactoryperformance.The cost of the audit will befinancedfrom project resources.

The World Bank's audit policy, as documented in "Guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and
Auditing for World Bank-Financed Projects," will be applicable to the project. This means a
single audit opinion covering: (i) financial statements, (ii) account statements, and
                                     project                           special
(iii)adequacy of supportingdocumentationmaintainedby CNR inrespectof expenditures
claimed for reimbursementvia SOE proceduresand eligibility of such expenditures for financing
under the respectiveLoan Agreement will be required, in addition to the audit opinion on CNR's
financial statements.

Inadditionto the audit opinions presentedabove, the auditors mustpresent the managementletter
covering: (i) weaknesses notedby the auditors in the project's internal control systems; (ii)  cases
of application of inappropriate accounting policies and practices; (iii)     issues regarding general
compliance with broad covenants; and (iv) any other matters that the auditors feel should be
brought to the borrower's attention.

Disbursement Arrangements
Withdrawal from the loan will made, at least at the beginning, using transaction-based
disbursement procedures. (The SOE method will be utilized for a period of six months to one
year to enable the testing of the new system for the preparation of FMRs.) The SOE thresholds
will be consistentwith the procurementpriorreview thresholds. All supportingdocumentationfor
payments using SOE procedures and other payments in general for project activities will be
retainedby CNR for audit purposesandmade availablefor the Bank's supervision.

RetroactiveFinancing
The Bank would finance up to a maximum of US$4.0 million for eligible expenditures incurred
after March 15,2005 but not morethan one year from signing.

 Supervision Plan. During project implementation, the Bank will review the project's financial
 management arrangements in two principal ways: (i)                 reviewing the project's quarterly financial
 management reports, CNR's periodic financial information, annual audited financial statements,
 and the auditor's management letter; and (ii) the Bank's missions, review the project's
                                                          during
 financial management arrangements to ensure compliance with Bank requirements. Accredited
 financial management specialists will assist inthe supervision process

                            Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
1.General

Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultantsby World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the
provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description of various items under
different expenditure categories i s presentedbelow. For each contractto be financed by the Loan,
the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the needfor prequalification,
estimatedcosts, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and
the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
institutional capacity.

Procurement of Works: Works under this project will be procured using the Bank's Standard
BiddingDocuments(SBD) for allICB andNational SBD agreed with the Bank.

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project will include vehicles, computers,
printers, office equipment, communication equipment, GPS, furniture, hardwareand softwarefor
photogrammetric,geodesic, and mapping equipment, graphic computers, topographic equipment,
satellite images, etc. To the extent possiblecontracts will be grouped inbiddingpackages of more
than US$250,000 and procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures
usingBank-issued StandardBiddingDocuments. Contractswith values below this thresholdper
contract may be procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures with standard
bidding documents agreed by the Bank. Contracts for goods that cannot be grouped `in larger
bidding packages and estimated to cost below US$50,000 per contract may be procured using
Shopping (National and International) procedures based on a model request for quotations
satisfactory to the Bank. For purchases of photogrammetric equipment and hardware, instead of
ICB Limited International Bidding may be used in view of the specialized equipment and very
few manufacturers.

Procurement of Non-Consulting Services: Technical services under the project amount to
approximately US$33.7 million. These include land regularization activities covering areas such
as geodesy andmapping, field data acquisition, and quality control activities. Landregularization
contracts typically combine physical activities (i.e., aerial photography, satellite imagery, and/or
field surveys) with complex logistics, legal tasks, and social actions (Le., analysisof existing land
information, resolution of land-related conflicts, and social campaigns to secure residents' and
local communities' cooperation.). A decisionhas beenmadeto prepare customizeddocuments for
this area by adaptingthe Procurementof Works, smaller contracts, standard documents, and the
draft services (non consulting) document to the peculiarities of land projects. Work i s underway
and it is expected that before effectiveness, the project will have an approved document in this
area. Non-consulting services also include Transfer (Conversion and Linkage): defined as the
transfer of all registry data infolio personal (property register kept by name of registrandowner),
folio real (paper record kept by parcel), and mechanizedrecords of the RegisalIand I1system, to
SIRyC, linking them with cadastre data in order to have a one-to-one link between the register
and the graph of the parcel. Contracts for technical services estimated to cost US$l million or
more will be procured following ICB procedures. Contracts estimated to cost between
US$lOO,O00 and US$l million may be procured following NCB procedures. Contracts estimated
to cost below US$lOO,OOO may beprocuredunder lump-sumfixed contracts awardedon the basis
of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written
invitation.


                                                 43

Selection of Consultants: Consulting services from firms and individuals required for the project
include impact evaluation studies, financial and procurement audits, advisory services from
individual consultants on land administration services, supervision, mapping, legal framework,
landregularization andtitling, supervisionandmonitoring of data transfer andlinkage, UCP staff,
etc.

Operational Costs: Operationalcosts have been identified in the procurement plan. These costs
havebeen reviewed andfound acceptableto the Bank.

B. Assessment ofthe agency's capacity to implement procurement
Procurement activities will be carried out by CNR (Centro Nacional de Registros) under the
coordination of a Project Coordinating Unit (UCP or Unidad Coordinadoradel Proyecto), located
within CNR. CNR was created on December 5, 1994by an executive decree, as a decentralized
institution with administrative and financial autonomy. Although the UCP will be responsiblefor
coordinating the activities of the project, it has been decided that to promote institutional
strengthening, the project procurement function will be integrated within the organizational
structure of CNR. The procurement team that was part of LAP I,consisting of a procurement
officer andtwo assistants, will be integrated within the procurement unit of CNR (UACI), with a
direct link to the UCP. The Project Operational Manual will include, in addition to the
procurement procedures, the SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well as model
contractsfor works and goods procured.

An assessment of CNR's capacity to implement procurement actions for the project was carried
out by Luis Prada, procurement specialist, in September 2004. The assessment reviewed the
organizational structure for implementing the project, CNR's previous performanceunder LAPI,
the volume and complexity of procurement actions for the new project as well as the new
arrangements for the project procurement function and staff being integrated in CNR's relevant
centralprocurementunit (UACI). As a result, a decision has been madeto discontinue the use of
UNDP as procurement agent. Having demonstrated that it has achieved an acceptable level of
capacity to implement procurement, CNR will carry out through UACI all procurement actions
except for large contracts (ICB > US$1 million). In this case, CNR will negotiate with a
procurement agent in order to obtain its support for these specific activities. The cost of the
procurementagent services will be coveredby counterpartfunds.

The overall project riskfor procurementi s low.

C. ProcurementPlan
The Borrower developedaProcurementPlanfor project implementation which provides the basis
for the procurementmethods. The Borrower andthe Project Team agreed on this plan on January

I.EconomicCosts

The costs usedin the economic analysisare those costs which beardirectly on landregularization andthe
functioning of the land registration system. These costs include land regularization activities,
descentralization of land administration services, project administration, and operating costs after the
completion of the investment phase. As shown in Annex 5 on Project Costs, the costs with contigencies
total US$ 55.8 million, of which US$ 39.4 million are for land regularization, US$ 8.7 million for the
decentralization of land administration services, and US$ 4.3 million for project management. These
costs are treatedas a flow over the six years of the project. Operatingcosts after the investment-phaseare
expected not to exceed US$ 200,000 per year and they are accrued over the next 14 years. Using a
discountrate of 12%, these costs havea net presentvalue of US$38.4 million.

11.EconomicBenefits
Benefits are estimatedin four dimensions: a) impact on property value; b) impact on banking system; c)
streamlining of registration process and d) environmental benefits. This annex discusses each of these
types of benefits. For evaluating the cost-benefit ratio of the project only direct benefits, financial
benefits, and streamlining of registration process are used. Accruing benefits over a 20 year period and
using a discount rate of 12%, these benefits have a net present value of US$70.7 million. Environmental
benefits are discussedqualitative.

Impact of the RegularizationProcess on Property Values

Increasedproperty value due to regularization i s a summary indicator of the capitalized value of three
major types of benefits associated with land regularization: improved investment and environmental
conservation incentives, marketability, and ability to use the land as collateral for loans. Estimating the
magnitudes of these expectedincreases is a complex problem for a national program. Property values are
influenced by a wide rangeof factors-location,    access to public services, size, value of construction,use
of the property-each of which interacts with tenure status. Controlling for these factors, the difference in
value between similar regularized and unregularized properties i s a good indicator of the economic
benefit of regularization. The additional value increment associated with regularization of tenure is
estimated, basedon empirical examination of propertieswhich havebeenregularizedunder LAPI.

The premiumfor landregularization can be interpretedfrom estimating a basic linear regressionmodel of
property value (P=f(x)+e where x is a set of explanatory variables). The hypothesisinvestigatedis that the



                                                     46

degree of land tenure security has a positive, significant impact on the property value at the time of
purchasehale. One of the explanatory variables i s an indicator of regularized land tenure. Other two
explanatory variables are included as control variables. These variables are one compound indicator for
education and one explanatory indicator for rural areas5 The reduced form property value function i s
estimated at the following linear equation:

               Value of Property =Bo     +B,(Regularization) +B2(Education) +B3(Rural) +e

The results of the model are as follow:


Coefficient                    41.54                    6.98                   -0.59                    -0.30
StandardError                   2.81                   0.78                    -1.66                    -4.81
N=41, R2=.40, and adjusted R2=.35

The model predicts an additional property value at the time of sale/purchase attributable to regulation of
17%: This increase inproperty value i s calculated for the average property prices in the new departments
and it is multiplied by the number of properties to be regularized under LAP 11. The total increment in
property value i s of approximately US$161.4 million. If we assume that 3.3% of these properties are sold
annually, then the resulting annual financial benefit i s approximately US$ 5.4 million. The projection
assumes that the total benefit is distributedevenly over a 20-year period, beginning the second year of the
Project.

* This number is calculated as the estimate number o f parcels 30% (the estimated percentage o f non-concordant
parcels) 70% (the estimated percentage o f non-concordant parcels that will be regularized under LAP11).


Impact on the Banking System

When a financial institution approves a loan, the corresponding amount i s reserved untilthe mortgage i s
recorded in RPRH. During that period, the financial institution incurs an opportunity expense in
unrealized investments. According to RPRH, the average time to record a document i s five weeks. In


 The analysis was basedon data available in SIRyC and on municipalpoverty indicators available through the
website of the Social Investment and Local Development Fund(FISDL). The sample size is 41 observations.
 These percentageis calculated by dividing the coefficient for the regularization variable by the coefficient for the
constant.


                                                        47

Phase I1of the project, the period is expected to be reducedto seven working days: a savings of about 30
days.

In 2003, the total value of mortgages issued nationwide was $1.5 billion. The annual average passive
interest rate in 2003 was 3.24%' resulting in an annual financial opportunity cost of $4.1 million ($1.5
billion x 3.24% x (301365)).

Streamlining of Registration Process

The project will have a positive impact on response time and on the number of visits that CNR clients
must maketo follow up on the registry process. The experienceinthe Sonsonate Registryduring PhaseI
of the LandAdministration Project i s indicative of the impact that canbe expectedas aresult of PhaseII.

According to RPRH, from 1996-2000the average response time per document in the Sonsonate Registry
was one month if the document did not modify property lines and two months if it did (because in such
case the cadastre intervened). The average responsetime before the project to registerdocumentswas five
weeks. Currently, responsetime is eight working days.

prior to the modernizationprocess, the average number of visits that Registry clients madeuntilthey were
given the registereddocument was 3 to 4 (3.5 on average). Experience in the departments of Santa Ana
and Ahuachaph indicatesthat one of the consequences of a reduction in response time is a reduction in
the number of follow-up visits that clients have to make. According to RPRH, in the department of
Sonsonatethe number of visits requiredfor each registration hasbeenreducedto 1or 2 (1.5 on average).

Supposingthat each visit requires an average of two hours, and assigningan economic value of $4.0 per
hour, the annual savings would be 1.5 visits x 2 hours x the annual number of submissions to RPRH.
Excluding the departments that were terminated during Phase Iof the project (Sonsonate, Ahuachaph,
and Santa Ana), RPRH's average annual demand from 1998-2004 is around 263,400 submissions.
Supposingthat this average level of demands is maintainedover the coming years, this implies an average
annualeconomic savingof around$3.2 million (263,400 x1.5 x 2).

One of the project's activities will be to transfer registration to SIRyC and to make an alpha-geo link, so
that parcels surveyedin Year t of the project until Year t+l should be transferredto SIRyC and linked. In
the benefits projection it is assumed that the impact will be perceived starting in Year t+2. Thus, it is
assumed that the annual average benefit of $3.2 million will be perceived beginning in the sixth year of
the project.To generatethe projection of the flow of benefits correspondingto clients' savingsinterms of
time and expenses during Years 1to 5, the cumulative percentage of progress was applied, assuming a
two-year gap betweenexecutionandthe generationof benefits.

111.NetPresentValue of NetEconomicBenefitsandInternal RateofReturn

The NPV of net economic benefits i s calculatedtakinginto consideration direct benefits from land price
increase as well as benefits from the impacts on the banking sector, and streamlining of services. The
discount rate used for the analysis if 12%. The total of economic benefits i s US$ 70.8 million and direct
costs from the project is US$38.4 million. The NPV of net economic benefits i s US$ 32.4 million andthe
project's internal rate of economic returns is 21%.

Environmental Impact of Regularization Process

The project is expected to have two positive environmental impacts due to an improvement in legal
security over land: (i)through the introduction of soil conservationmeasuresinagricultural lands; and (ii)
through the reduction of natural resources degradation in protected areas demarcatedand marked out by
the project. With regardto agricultural lands, legal security over landis expectedto bringabout a change
inthe producer's timeline, causinghimto adopt along-term strategy with regardto the productivity of his
parcel and creating the basis to achieve greater acceptance of the adoption of conservation-oriented
practices and investments in soil conservation works. Through such practices and works, especially in
areas of erosion, an increaseis expectedin soil productivity as well as areductionin the required amount
of agrochemical products. Consequently, higher yields, reduced production costs, and a reduction in or
elimination of the soil erosionrate are expected.With regardto protectedareas, delimitation and marking
activities are expectedto contribute to production inthese areas.

111.FinancialAnalysis

A cash flow analysis of the CNR was carried out for the 1996-2015 period to determine the agency's
capacity to continue financing the modernization process and assume a new project loan. A baseline
scenario was developed and a sensitivity analysis was made to calculate the CNR's likely surplus. The
results are shownbelow inFigure 1.
Figure1:Probable Surplus of the CNR




               2005 2006  2007 2008   2009 2010  2011  2012  2013  2014 2015




                                                    49

The scenario is a Bank loan of US$40.2 million and a counterpart contribution of US$ 15.6 million for
the execution of a 6-year project, with a 6-year grace period and a repayment period of 15 years. The
analysis shows that the CNR i s capable of financing the loan and the counterpart contribution. Before the
repayment period of LAP 11,which begins at the end of 2011, a surplus between US$4 and US$5 million
are expected every year. No surplus and likely a very limited deficit is projectedfor years 2012 and 2013
respectively, because this i s the time when the repayment periods of LAP Iand LAPI1overlap. To solve
possible short-term liquidity problems duringthe deficit years, it i s recommended to use the surpluses of
previous years. After 2013, and during the repayment period of LAP 11until 2020, an average surplus
between US$3 and US$5 million i s expected. After that the surplus will increase significantly up to US$
10million, causing a very positivefiscal impact for the government.

IV. Fiscal Analysis

One of the spheres of the project's impact i s at municipal level, where cadastre information is expected to
have a positive impact on the capacity to collect fees for municipal services and taxes.

To estimate the project's impact on fee collection, an analysis i s made of the incremental incomes of a
small, selected sampling of municipalities that are using cadastre data to identify those residential and
commercial properties which receive municipal services. Based on the data collected, the average per
capita incremental collection is calculated, dividing the average incremental amount of fees and taxes by
the averageurbanpopulation. The estimated averageper capita incrementalcollection i s US$8.27.

To calculate the impact at national level, the averageper capita incrementalcollection i s multiplied by the
relative urban population in the rest of the country. It i s estimated that the government will receive US$
15 million each year from the collection of fees and taxes. US$ 4.6 million alone will come from San
Salvador.

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.011
As a Category B project, preparation activities included an environmental analysis (EA) of the project's
potential positive and negative effects. The EA, conducted by a team of international and national
consultants, found the project's environmental impacts to be overwhelmingly positive. The
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) included in the EA recommendedseveral ways to enhance the
project's positive impacts, as well as specific mitigation measures to offset the negative impacts. Rather
than comprising a stand-alone component, the EMP's recommendations and mitigation measures have
been incorporatedinto the project design.

The following sectiondescribesthe key potential impactsidentified in the EA.

Positive Environmental Effects
Protected Areas Delimitation and Demarcation: The project will both delineate all protected areas
within the project's area of coverage and demarcate at a gross scale three priority protected areas. The
delineation and demarcation will be done in conjunction with MARN.Likewise, M A N will select the
three priority protectedareasto be demarcated.

The conservation impact of these activities i s overwhelmingly positive, as a key limiting factor to
consolidation of ElSalvador's protectedareas system(Sistemade Areas Naturales Protegidas, or S A " )
is lack of detailed geographic information (cadastre, orthophotography, aerial photographs that LAP 11
will acquire nationwide), thus preventing the establishment of clear boundaries. This lack of clarity has
ledto invasion by settlers, encroachment anderroneouslegalization or titling within parkboundaries.The
project's contribution to clarifying these boundaries represents a significant improvement for
conservationinElSalvador.

Transfer of Title for StateLands: The project will facilitate the transfer of titles for protectedareas to
MARNfrom other state agencies (ISTA).This is asignificant helpto MARN, which untilnow has
struggled with an extremelycumbersomeandcomplicatedtitle transfer process.

Biodiversity Information: Project-collected data on land use, forest cover, and human settlements will
provide MARN with the tools to develop management plans for protected areas. This is considered a
significant contributionto environmentalconservationandmanagement.

Cultural Property: The project will delimitate three priority cultural heritage areas, as identified by
CONCULTURA, thereby contributing to the long-term conservation of these areas. Additionally, project
procedures call for identification of unknown cultural sites (such as ruins) during project cadastre
activities. If culturally significant sites are identified through this process (or any time after project field
activities are completed), these parcels can be annotated in the property register maintained by CNR
("marginalizcidn"), thereby notifying CONCULTURA of the find and ensuring that any future land
transactions will be made with full knowledge of the parcel's importance.

Potential Negative Environmental Effects
Legalization and/or Titling of Areas at Risk for Natural Disasters: El Salvador-the              most densely
populated country in Latin America-           i s highly prone to natural disasters, including earthquakes,
hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions. Inorder to prevent the titling of parcels inrisk-prone areas, the project




                                                        51

will screen lands to be titled under Component 1.3 against highrisk areas and prohibit any titling activity
in such areas.

Invasion of Protected Areas: The potential exists that encroachmentsin protected areas could increase
inthe short termprior to the arrival of projectcadastreteams. To that end, the EAevaluatedthe impact of
LAPIandfound there was no evidencelinkingthe project's landadministration activities (which do not
include regularization of persons living in protected areas) with protectedarea encroachment. However,
the project' s communication strategy will include specific messages designed to minimize false
expectations of persons currently living on state lands (protected areas and mangroves), explicitly to
preventthe short-termexpansionof encroachment.

EA Consultationand Dissemination
Three consultationswere held regardingthe project's design and impacts. The first two-day consultation
was held from July 15 to 16, 2004 and attendedby over 160 peoplefrom a wide variety of government,
NGOs, andcivil society organizations.Basedon the main findings of this consultation, the project design
was revisedandpresentedat a one-day consultationheld on October 15,2004 andattendedby 65 people.

Finally, the EA was publicly consulted on December 13, 2004, at the Hotel Radisson in San Salvador.
The consultation was attended by 52 representatives from government (CONCULTURA, MARN) and
civil society, includingindigenousandenvironmentalNGOs.

In accordancewith IBRD's policy on Disclosureof Information (BP 17.50), copies of the Environmental
Assessment Report, in Spanish, are available for public viewing at CNR's UPP office (1" Calle Poniente
and45 Av. Nte. # 2310, San Salvador) and on CNR's website (www.cnr.g;ob.sv) before appraisal. It was
also sent to the IBRD's Infoshop beforeappraisal.

Natural Habitats(OP 4.04)
The EA evaluated the project's potential to trigger OP 4.04, and determined that the project would not
significantly affect critical or non-critical naturalhabitats.Specifically, as the project i s not granting rights
in critical natural habitats, the EA found that project activities will not negatively impact these areas.
Rather, as notedabove, the project will result in significant positive conservationimpact to these areas.

Cultural Property(OPN 11.031
The project triggers OPN 11.03 as project activities include delineation of three cultural heritage sites, as
identified by CONCULTURA. This will contribute to their long-term conservation. As noted above,
project procedureshave been developedto ensure that in case project activities find evidence of cultural
property on private lands, that information will be forwarded to CONCULTURA. Moreover, those
parcels (and any other parcels discovered to contain culturally significant resources at any future point)
can be annotated in the property register maintained by CNR (`"arginaZizaci6n "), thereby notifying
CONCULTURA of the find and ensuring that any future land transactions will be made with full
knowledge of the parcel's importance.

Involuntary Resettlement(OP 4.12)
The EA evaluated the project's potential to trigger OP 4.12 and determined that the project would not
result in the physical displacement of any persons. Additionally, while the project will be collecting
information and delimiting and demarcating protected areas, the project will not result in any change in
the use of resources for persons living in or near those areas. Consequently, the project does not trigger
OP4.12.




                                                      52

IndigenousPeoples(OD 4.20)
As project beneficiariesinclude indigenouspeoples, the project triggers OD 4.20, and the client prepared
an IndigenousPeoples Development Plan (IPDP). The IPDP was based on numerous consultations with
national indigenous organizations and local indigenous communities. The key findings of the IPDP were
that indigenous beneficiaries do not face substantially different issues regarding land than other poor
campesinos. Both groups suffer from lack of clarity on property rights and poor capacity to secure land
tenure. Consequently, the IPDP sets forth actions to be included within the project to provide legal
assistance and training to indigenous beneficiaries, as well as monitoring provisions to ensure that
indigenous communities are well servedby the project. The monitoring will be conductedby CNR which
i s consideredto havestrongcapacity inthis area.

In accordance with IBRD's policy on Disclosure of Information (BP 17.50), copies of the IPDP, in
Spanish, are available for public viewing at CNR's UPP office (1"Calle Ponienteand45 Av. Nte. # 2310,
