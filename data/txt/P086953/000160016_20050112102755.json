Among potential\n            negative impacts are the following:  1) El Salvador-the most\n            densely populated country in Latin America- is highly prone\n            to natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, and\n            volcanoes. In order to prevent the titling of parcels in\n            risk-prone areas, the project will screen lands to be titled\n            in risk areas and prohibit any titling activity in such\n            areas.  2) There is no evidence linking the project's\n            land administration activities (which do not include\n            regularization of persons living in protected areas) with\n            protected area encroachment. However, the project's\n            communication strategy will include specific messages so as\n            to minimize false expectations of persons currently living\n            on state lands (protected areas and mangroves), explicitly\n            to prevent short-term encroachment expansion. 3) Project\n            procedures have been developed to ensure that in case\n            project activities find evidence of cultural property on\n            private lands, that information will be forwarded to CONCULTURA."}, "docdt": "2005-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
