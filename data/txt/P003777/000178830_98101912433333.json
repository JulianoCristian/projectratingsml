will\n            launch a land development program along the Trans-Sumatera\n            highway by resettling about 30,000 families from\n            impoverished areas of Java and Bali, as well as from\n            Sumatera, on four sites in the province of Jambi in\n            Sumatera. It will also upgrade the conditions of 4,000\n            transmigrant families who were recently settled in the same\n            area. The project will provide physical infrastructure, land\n            clearing, agricultural inputs and services, community\n            facilities and technical assistance. The project will create\n            30,000 new farms, open up upland food crop production on\n            36,000 ha and increase crop production and another 4,800 ha,\n            directly benefitting some 34,000 farm families or 170,000\n            people. At full project development, per capita farm income\n            is estimated at $125 compared with incomes of potential\n            transmigrants and existing settlers of about $35."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
