In\n            accordance with the European Union (EU) laws and regulation,\n            Polish legislation on the environment stipulates there is no\n            requirement for an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for\n            individual sub-projects financed by the Bank loan.\n            Nevertheless, Polish law includes provisions on mandatory\n            control of environmental risks to soil, land, air, water\n            resources, noise emissions, and other, which may result from\n            implementation of project activities. The Environmental\n            Mitigation Measures Matrix presented in this report\n            identifies possible negative impacts on environment, lists\n            the regulatory controls and technical guidance applicable in\n            roads sector interventions in Poland, specifies the\n            mitigation measures inherent in these controls, and a\n            summary of the monitoring and reporting measures. Upon\n            area-specific conditions, construction contracts for\n            sub-projects defined as type \"B\" projects, will\n            refer to specific measures such as prevention of tree\n            cutting and runoff control, and specify mandatory\n            requirements set by standards and guidelines. In all cases\n            the contractors are responsible to observe applicable\n            national laws, and are subject to monitoring by\n            Environmental Inspectorates during works implementation.\n            Project location shall consider potential environmental\n            adversity, taking into account: existing land use, relative\n            abundance, quality and regenerative capacity of natural\n            resources in the area, values of natural environment and\n            landscape, conditions of the local land-use plans, having\n            regard, in particular, to: wetlands; coastal zones; mountain\n            and forest areas; protected areas, including the protection\n            zones of water intakes and protection areas of\n            surface-waters ponds; special protection areas because of\n            existing fauna and flora and natural habitats; areas in\n            which the environmental quality standards have already been\n            exceeded; populated areas; and, landscapes of historical,\n            cultural or archaeological significance. All construction\n            works will be subject to a screening criteria, and approval\n            of Subproject checklists (attached), to verify environmental\n            category, potential environmental adversity, and the\n            mitigation measures, if any, required in each case. Overall,\n            mitigation reinforces the need for appropriate drainage\n            systems; vegetation propagation; maintenance practices to\n            reflect the current standards; wastewater treatment and\n            groundwater protection; measures to minimize air pollution,\n            e.g., water spraying on construction areas; traffic safety\n            regulations; and, noise abatement measures."}, "docdt": "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
