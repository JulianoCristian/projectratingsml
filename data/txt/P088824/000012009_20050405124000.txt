Introduction
 
Financial support of the World Bank
’s loan to road maintenance and rehabilitation program prepared by 
GDDKiA within the framework of the budget 2005 constitutes one component of the Second Road 
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RM&R II). The RM&R II project is a repeater of a similar project 
implemented during 2004.  Other than Bank and State budget funds are provided by European Commission 
and European Investment Bank.  
 
For the period beyond 2005 the GDDKiA investment program is expected to be well balanced between 
maintenance/rehabilitation, strengthening and reconstruction of existing roads, and new construction of 
motorways and expressways.  The government and other donors will provide co-financing for the full range 
of RM&R activities; the World Bank funds will be used to finance sub-projects following Polish 
Maintenance & Improvement Standards No. 1- No. 9
1
which are to be classified as category “B” and “C” 
sub-projects accordingly definitions of World Bank's Environmental Assessment formulated by OP/BP 4.01.   
 
Polish law, harmonized with the EU Directive on environmental assessment prior to Poland joining EU on 
May 1, 2004
2
,
does not require preparation of report on EIA for individual sub-projects financed by the 
World Bank loan. Nevertheless, Polish law includes provisions on mandatory control of environmental risks 
to soil, land, air, water resources, noise emissions, and other, which may result from implementation of 
RM&R activities. The Environmental Mitigation Measures Matrix presented in part 4 of this Chapter 
identifies
 
possible negative impacts on environment, lists the regulatory controls and technical guidance 
applicable in roads sector interventions in Poland, specifies the mitigation measures inherent in these 
controls, and a summary of the monitoring and reporting measures normally taken.   
 
Construction contracts to implement RM&R sub-projects (for example as defined by M&IS No. 1, 
comparable to World Bank "C" type projects) do need not to include any specific measures to prevent 
pollution and protect the environment. Depending on area-specific conditions, construction contracts for 
RM&R sub-projects defined as M&IS up to No. 9 (which are comparable to World Bank "B" type projects) 
wherever  appropriate will refer to specific measures such as prevention of tree cutting and runoff control and 
specify mandatory requirements set by standards and guidelines.  In all cases the contractors are responsible 
to observe applicable national laws and are subject to monitoring by Environmental Inspectorates during 
works implementation. 
 
The project implementing agency, GDDKiA and its regional offices implementing sub-projects in their 
specific regions (voivodships), have been assessed as experienced and due diligent in specifying appropriate 
environmental controls for sub-projects, and in working with regional environmental authorities 
(representatives of state administration and local governments) with respect to project supervision. A World 
Bank desk and field ex-post audit of environmental compliance of a selected set of the representative 
previously-financed RM&R sub-projects (mostly representing M&IS No. 7 - 8) was completed in January 
2005, and a conclusion was formulated that it is satisfactory to both, the Bank and the Polish administration.   
 
The above approach is considered sufficient for conforming projects with the World Bank safeguards 
requirements.  The World Bank will continue supervision of compliance of the RM&R I and II Projects, 
including desk and field-based ex-post reviews of selected sub-projects.  It is expected that GDDKiA will

also make available to the World Bank, existing monitoring reports for sub-projects in regards with 
environmental compliance of with applicable legislation and sectoral guidance requirements. 
 
The Polish Environmental Impact Assessment System  
including the Road Sector 
The Polish Environmental Impact Assessment 
 
Under the Polish system, the 
classification of projects
 which are subject to EIA procedure 
follows the one 
adopted by the European Union
.
The relevant EU Directive describes types of projects in a very detailed 
way, very often including not only the type of project but also its size. Basically the list of projects refers to 
new developments, however modifications and upgrading are also treated as a new development under some 
conditions. 
 
In Poland, projects are classified into two different groups of projects: 
 
Group 1
 includes a list of projects, which may have 
significant impact
 on the environment, and which 
always require an EIA report
.
Group 2
 includes a list of projects, which also may have 
significant impact
 on the environment, but for 
which 
EIA report is not always required
.
A
significant number of project types listed in Group 1 is repeated in Group 2, while what makes them 
different is scale. The competent authorities are responsible for deciding whether for issuing a development 
consent they need conclusions from EIA report. In order to facilitate that process the regulation includes also 
a
set of 
screening criteria
,
which are listed below:  
 
-
project characteristics
 
(the magnitude of the project and the dimension of the occupied land, as well 
as their mutual proportions, the connections with other projects, especially multiplication of impacts, 
the use of natural resources, the production of waste, pollution and nuisances, the risk of accidents, 
having regard in particular to substances or technologies used) 
-
project location
,
considering potential environmental threats, taking into account: existing land use, 
relative abundance, quality and regenerative capacity of natural resources in the area,  values of 
natural environment and landscape, conditions of the local land-use plans, having regard, in 
particular, to: 
(a) wetlands; 
(b) coastal zones; 
(c) mountain and forest areas; 
(d) protected areas, including the protection zones of water intakes and protection areas of 
surface-waters ponds; 
(e) special protection areas because of existing fauna and flora and natural habitats; 
(f) areas in which the environmental quality standards have already been exceeded; 
(g) populated areas; 
(h) landscapes of historical, cultural or archaeological significance. 
 
-
type and magnitude of potential impact
,
in relation to the scale and siting criteria, and having 
regard in particular to:

(a) extent of the impact (geographical area and size of the affected population), 
(b) transboundary nature of the impact on the different environmental elements, 
(c) magnitude and complexity of the impact, including existing technical infrastructure, 
(d) probability of the impact, 
(e) duration, frequency and reversibility of the impact.

Environmental Assessment in the Roads Sector 
2.1 The Polish Legal Framework  
 
The Act of 10 April 2003 on Special Procedure for Construction of National Roads
 (Dz.U. of 2003 No. 
80 item 721) [hereinafter referred to as Special Roads Procedure Act] excludes - on temporary basis (until the 
end of 2007) the location and construction of certain categories of roads from generally applicable 
procedures and requirements, and establishes its own rules instead. Those special rules affect in particular 
issues related to environmental protection, including EIA, to public participation and to compulsory land 
acquisition.  
 
Most public roads are subjected to EIA several times
 in accordance with the system of ‘tiering’ applied in 
Poland. First, there is a document called “concept of the 
national land-use policy
”
which sets the scene for all 
roads, then there are governmental programs for development of roads, finally, there are regional (voivodship) 
land use plans
 setting the proposed routes for public roads. Preparation of all those strategic documents is 
obligatory and they 
all are
 
subject to SEA
.
Specific routes of public roads are also included in local land use 
plans, which - if prepared - are also subject to SEA [SEA procedure is described in the main part of this report]. 
All national roads and roads sited in cities having county status are subject to mandatory 
EIA under the 
Special Roads Procedure Act
,
while some other public roads are subject to general 
EIA scheme under 
EPLA and the Land Use Planning Act
.
2.1.1 Roads subject to special EIA procedure 
Roads subject to special EIA procedure under the Special Roads Procedure Act include motorways and 
express roads and other national roads. 
2.1.2 Roads subject to “general” EIA scheme 
General EIA scheme applies to any public road other than mentioned above which is classified as regional 
(voivodship), county (poviat) or municipal (gmina) road, has hard surface and is longer than 1 km. If it has at 
least 4 traffic lines and is longer than 10 km it belongs to Group 1 projects, i.e., those which always require 
EIA, otherwise it falls into Group 2 
–
i.e. projects which require screening. [General EIA scheme is described 
in the main part of this Report]. 
2.2 Special procedure for siting and construction of roads and institutional set-up 
 
Under the Act of 10 April 2003 on Special  Procedure for Construction of National Roads [Special Roads 
Procedure Act], the 
special rules
 of siting and construction of roads 
apply to national roads and roads 
sited in cities having county (poviat) status
 (this applies to 65 biggest agglomerations in Poland) and 
financed by such cities. Those rules replace temporarily (till the end f 2007): 
 
·
the relevant rules of the Toll Motorways Act of  27 October 1994 - in relation to siting and construction 
of toll motorways and express roads, 
·
the relevant rules of the land Use Planning Act of 27 March 2003 (Dz.U of 2003 No. 80 item 717) -  in 
relation to siting and construction of other national roads (and roads in cities with the county status). 
 
In both cases the new rules either replace or significantly reduce the application of other laws, in particular 
those regulating environmental protection, including EIA, public participation and compulsory land 
acquisition.

Environmental Protection 
Rules 
(1) Minimum 
Maintenance 
The minimum maintenance standard has been designed to 
reflect the current practice in the absence of major 
maintenance works. These include the following items 
Patching:
Repair of surface distresses such as potholing, 
wide structural cracking and ravelling. It is carried out 
annually.  
Crack Sealing:
This technique treats transverse thermal 
cracking and even wide structural cracking when limited 
in area. It is carried out annually.  
Routine Works:
Routine works include all works, which 
do not have any effect on pavement performance as 
modelled in HDM-4. These works include shoulder 
repairs and routine miscellaneous works such as 
vegetation control, road sign repairs and replacement, 
line marking, guardrail repair and replacement, etc… 
Routine works are carried out annually. An annual cost is 
specified for each road class.  
Winter Maintenance:
Winter maintenance includes all 
works carried out as part of winter maintenance such as 
salt spreading; snow removal, etc. An annual cost is 
specified for each road class. It applies to all roads. 
(2/3) Surface 
Treatment 
(Single or Double) 
To preserve the integrity of the pavement by sealing the 
carriageway in order to delay major intervention and 
renewal of the skid resistance.  
(4) Surface 
Treatment 
With Shape 
Correction 
To preserve the integrity of the pavement by sealing the 
carriageway in order to delay major intervention, 
improving roughness and renewal of the skid resistance.  
(5) Resurfacing 
by 
Overlay 
To renew surface characteristics including skid 
resistance, to improve roughness and to contribute 
towards the overall pavement strength. Overlay by 
surfacing included thickness between 30 and 50mm and 
were applied over a roughness values varying from 3 to 5 
IRI and low rutting level.
 
According to the Polish law 
(Construction Law Article 29, 
pt.12) for standards (1) 
through (8), which are 
classified as rebuilding and 
reconditioning, construction 
permit is not required. Thus 
development of 
Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) is not 
required as well.

The construction permit requires also agreements with other authorities (e.g. fire prevention) under other than environmental 
regulations which are not covered by this report

Rules 
(6) Strengthening 
by Overlay 
 
To strengthen pavements, which have reached or soon to 
reach the critical stage (poor or fair roughness condition), 
improve roughness and renew surface characteristics.   
Strengthening by overlay concerned the application of 
multi-layer overlays (two or three layers) varying from a 
thickness of 80 to 270 mm applied over a range of 
roughness values varying from 4 to 9 IRI.  
 
(7) Strengthening 
by 
Mill and Replace 
To strengthen pavements, which have reached or soon to 
reach the critical stage (poor or fair rutting condition), 
improve roughness and renew surface characteristics.    It 
is achieved by removing the distressed top asphalt layer 
(s) and replacing it (them) with a new (or recycled) 
asphalt of similar thickness but with better structural 
characteristics. This standard was applied over a range of 
rutting varying from 10 to 35 mm. 
 
(8) Strengthening 
by 
Reconstruction 
 
To reconstruct pavements, which have reached the failure 
stage (poor roughness condition). Reconstruction is 
achieved through removal of the old pavement structure 
down to the subbase course and replacing it with a new 
(or recycled) pavement structure with high strength. 
Pavement structures varied according to road class and 
were applied over a range of roughness values carrying 
from 8 to 11 IRI 
 
(9) 
Widening to 7 m 
To increase the narrow roads to a minimum standard road 
width of 7 metres. This standard is applicable to Main 
roads with 6 metre or less width.  
(10) 
2 Lanes addition to 
Single Carriageways 
To add two lanes to a single 2-lane carriageway (not 
dualisation) in order to increase capacity.  This 
improvement standard is applied over a wide range of 
volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly 
applied to Trunk and Main roads, which are not dual yet.  
(11) 
1 Lane addition to 
Dual Carriageways 
To add 1 lane to either sides of a dual two-lane 
carriageway in order to increase capacity.  This 
improvement standard is applied over a wide range of 
volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly 
applied to Motorways, Expressways, and Trunk Roads 
with Dual Carriageways.  
(12) 
2 Lanes addition to 
Dual Carriageways 
To add 2 lane to either sides of a dual two-lane 
carriageway in order to increase capacity.  This 
improvement standard is applied over a wide range of 
volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly 
applied to Motorways, Expressways, and Trunk Roads 
with Dual Carriageways. 
(13) Reconstruct 
to 
Expressway Single 
Carriageway 
To upgrade GP roads to Expressway single carriageway 
standard. This improvement standard is applied over a 
wide range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 
1
According to the Polish law, 
for standards (9) through (14), 
construction permit is not 
required if road improvement 
works are carried out within 
the right of way of such a 
road. In such a case 
development of EIA is not 
required.  
Construction permit is 
required by law if road 
improvement works exceed 
the right of way of such a 
road. Than the EIA is 
developed accordingly 
requirements set by the 
provisions of The Act of 10 
April
 
2003 on Special  
Procedure for Construction of 
National
 
Roads, Annex II

Second Roads Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project  
Supported by the World Bank Loan 
Ministry of Infrastructure 
February 14
th
 2005 
 
Summary of Minutes of the Meeting 
 
1. 
Summary of Discussions and Conclusions 
 
More than 40 organizations representing environmental NGOs, civic society NGOs, academic circles and 
business community were invited and received the basic information about the project (Project Information 
Document, Integrated Safeguard Datasheet and Environmental Chapter of the Project Operations Manual) 
with request for comments and opinions. In addition all the basic project information documents were 
published on Internet by GDDKiA and WB. 
The program of the meeting comprised presentations of the project context, approach, activities and 
environmental issues involved and encouraged open discussion on the presented topics.  
Representatives of the Ministry of Infrastructure, GDDKiA, World Bank and several NGOs (mostly 
environmental) were present at the meeting along with the French Embassy representative and 
representatives of the business community.The meeting was moderated by Ms Skwiecinska and independent 
expert in social consultations and public relations.  
The meeting was opened by representatives of GDDKiA (Mr Bilski) and the World Bank (Mr Czapski). 
Then three presentations were made by representatives of the Ministry of Infrastructure (Mr Waszkiewicz) 
and GDDKiA (Mr Bilski and Ms Byrka). 
Subsequent short discussions focused on: 
1. NGOs need to be informed about the whole road construction investment plans for the next years 
regardless of the financing source; GDDKiA confirmed their willingness to organize an event aimed at such 
presentations and discussions with NGOs in April 2005. 
2. NGOs need information on those rehabilitation sub-components of the WB project that are falling under 9-
14 construction standards; GDDKiA declared that they will provide such list of projects falling under 
standard 9 (including road widening), since in practice only few sections of roads may fall under this 
standard. Higher standards are not applicable to the works funded through the above project. 
3. New Law on Environment Protection and social consultations procedures proposed in this law. It is 
expected to be applied to all construction/investment projects, replacing in this regard some simplified 
solutions currently in force introduced by the existing Law on Road Investments 
No particular comments nor objections were voiced in regard to presented Second Road Rehabilitation and 
Maintenance project supported by the World Bank, neither to its concept/activities nor environmental 
aspects.
