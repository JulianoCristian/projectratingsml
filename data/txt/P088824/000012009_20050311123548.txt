country's development effort. Closer economic integration and access to structural funds
constitute a unique opportunity for further development. In that context, the Bank has just
outlined a new framework for cooperation with Poland, embedded in a Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) document, which will be discussed by the Board together with this loan. The
World Bank and the Government see a need for the Bank to maintain a significant operational
program over the next few years in Poland in those sectors where it can add value, leverage,
promote and endorse needed reforms. Although Poland's per capita income i s approaching the
threshold which could initiate the process leading to eventual graduation from World Bank
borrower status, there is still an agenda of important reforms in areas in which the Bank has
been, and continues to be the key technical partner and where Bank operational activity
including, in some cases modest financing can add value from the perspective of the client,
including among others the road sector.
The CPS entails an evolution in the relationship to a partnership for development in which the
Bank continues to support the Governmentwith a full set o f instrumentsto tackle elements o f the
remaining agenda, and in which Poland increasingly contributes with the lessons o f its
experience for broader dissemination by the Bank to other member countries. To fulfill its role in
this partnership the Bank will need to increase its flexibility and responsiveness in a manner
consistent with the priorities and recommendations of the Bank's Middle Income Countries Task
Force and those contained in the Framework for World Bank Support to the EUNew Member
Countries o f Central and EasternEurope.
The new approach i s based on a flexible framework inwhich broadpriorities are defined for the
entire period and specific activities are agreed on a yearly basis in a manner consistent with the
Polish planning and budgetingcycle. It includes a single lending scenario inwhich the size and
composition o f the Bank's program are assessed annually on the basis o f demand from Poland
for the Bank's services and the evolution o f Poland's macroeconomic framework under its
commitments inthe context o f the Stability and GrowthPact o fthe EU.
Overall Poland is a creditworthy borrower and has good access to sovereign credit with a rating
o f BBB+. Additionally, constitutional debt restrictions put an effective limit to any fiscal and
economic policy irresponsibility. The Government continues efforts to consolidate public
finances.
The overall economic situation and outlook have generally improved since the time o f the last
CAS. Output growth accelerated rapidly, inflation remained low, and the external current
account remained strong. At the same time, however, the fiscal balance weakened further and
unemployment remained stubbornly high. Table 1 below contains key economic indicators for
the period.

GDP growth rebounded to 5.4% in 2004 (up from 1% on 2001, 1.4% in 2002, and 3.8% in
2003). This acceleration signals the end o f the first marked economic cycle inPoland since the
beginning o f transition. Growth originated in a rapid expansion o f exports (linked partly to EU
accession, but also to efficiency gains), and growing private consumption, while fixed
investment only began recovering in 2004. Inflation remained low and relatively stable; it
declined to less than 1% in 2003, but increased in 2004 on the back o f EU-accession effects

(adjustments o f indirect taxes etc.) and the surge in oil and other commodity prices. However,
second round effects appeared to be contained as monetary conditions were tightened both
through a hike in interest rates and through appreciation o f the zloty. Further, wage pressures
were held incheck by the persisting slack inthe labor market. The current account deficit stayed
at a very low and safe level, helped by a healthy increase in exports and muted investment
demand. External debt at 47% o f GDP poses limited risks.

 The fiscal position continued to deteriorate, but strong output growth and renewed fiscal reform
 efforts in2004 arrested the negative dynamics. While the general government deficit reached 7%
 of GDP in 2004, this was lower than budgeted on the back o f strong revenue growth despite a
 lowering o f the corporate tax rate. Further, the expected rise inthe public debt-to-GDP ratio was
 contained through appreciation o f the zloty, and the ratio at end-2004 o f less than 52% o f GDP

was well below the 55% o f GDP limit specified in the Public Finance Act.' In early 2004 the
Government adopted a comprehensive fiscal reform plan (the Hausner Plan) aimed at both
rationalizing social transfers and certain other spending programs, and broadening the revenue
base. The measures included in the Plan, if fully implemented, would reduce the fiscal deficit by
about 2 percentage points o f GDP (on an annual basis) by 2007. While about one-half o f the
targeted savings have been assured, key measures relating to both the farmer's pension system
(KRUS) and disability pensions remain on the agenda.

Link to Poland's Development Agenda. The overriding objective o f Poland's development
agenda is to put the economy on a path o f high and sustainable growth, through improved
competitiveness of firms and regions, to contribute to the recovery o f employment and promote
strong social cohesion in order to reach 2/3 o f the EU average income per capita by 2013. This
strategy recognizes the need to manage the economy prudently in order to increase employment
and reduce poverty, converge, in the medium to long-term, to average European income levels,
and meet the requirements for the adoption o f the Euro. The CPS proposes a framework with
three key priorities to address these challenges. Thefirst is to meet the conditions required for
adoption o f the Euro, which Poland seeks to achieve by 2009. The Maastricht criteria require
prudent economic management and, specifically, puttinglimits on the fiscal deficit, public debt,
inflation, interest rates and exchange rate fluctuations. A second challenge is to converge to
European income levels and be fully competitive in European and world markets. As Poland
does so, it will need to implement structural reforms to improve labor and capital mobility,
improve further the business environment, as well as the infrastructure, and deepen public
administration reform. The third challenge is to increase employment and reduce poverty. Inthe
case o f Poland, increasing employment will have a direct and immediate impact in reducing
poverty given the strong correlation between the two. To this end labor market reforms are
needed, and SME development needs to be revitalized. Separately, lack o f the right type o f
education i s a key factor for the ability to find andhold ajob, and thus to staying out o f poverty.
There is also a need to revisit the system o f social transfers for better targeting as there is
evidence that it provides a disincentive to more active participation inthe labor market.

2. Rationale for Bank Involvement

While it is clear that other institutions, notably the EU, EIB and EBl2D- are likely to be longer-
term partners for financing Poland's road network, their ability to help is still constrained by
Poland's still weak institutional capacity to develop and implement a large program o f high
priority road investments. The World Bank has drafted its partnership strategy around Poland's
development priorities. In particular, Bank supported roads programs have focused on the
institutional restructuring o f the sector with the aim o f improving its planning and
implementation capacity, and on the financing o f the sector to tackle the large maintenance
backlog and the large new investments required for expansion. Some progress has been made
with the creation o f a single roads agency (GDDKiA) and with the creation o f the Roads Fund,
which is financed with a surcharge on fuel. Several additional challenges remain, including the
need to: (i)   improve GDDKiA's investment planning capacity so as to impact the quality and
timing o f project implementation; (ii) intemal capacity for prioritization and selection o f
                                               build
investments on the basis o f economic criteria using modem programmatic tools; (iii)                      eradicate


'Oncethis  threshold is exceeded (inyear t), the budget for the following year (t+2) mustbe consistent with
containing the debt-to-GDP ratio to below the levelprevailinginyear t.

the large road maintenance backlog; and (iv) institutionalize a framework for private sector
involvement inthe financing of roads through concessionsor Public-Private Partnership (PPP).

Request for     World Bank Assistance. The proposed Second Roads Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Project (RM&R 11) is a "repeater" o f the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Project (RM&R) under implementation since March 2004. It follows Government's request to
the Bank to provide a multi-year - 350 million - phased financial support for a medium-term
program of policy reforms and capacity/institutional building, aimed at increasing the pace o f
road network modernization, strengthening roadpublic expenditure management and improving
governance. The Government is steadily pursuing its agenda, to which the Bank i s responding
through three specific loans, in the respective amounts of 100 million or US126 million
equivalent for the first one (RM&R project under implementation), 100 million or US$130.5
million equivalent for the proposed RM&R I1project, and the remaining 150 million or about
US$195 million to follow inFY2006.

Borrower Ownership and Commitment. Improvement of the national roads network remains
one o f the highest priorities for the Government. The Government has accelerated its efforts to
implement the ModernizationAction Plan (MAP) o f the General Directorate for NationalRoads
and Motonvays (GDDKiA), initiated under the RM&R project. These efforts are supported
jointly with the EIB. The EIB's Priority Roads Framework Project, to cover the period through
2009, consists o f a pooling o f funds coming from EIB loans (500 million), World Bank loans
(350 million), and Government budget (200 million). The first tranche o f the EIB loan was
negotiatedinearly December 2004, o fwhich 10 million will be disbursedin2005 as part o fthe
GDDKiA's expenditure plan for road maintenance and rehabilitation supported by the Bank
through RM&R 11. The Government's plans are clear, the commitment i s strong, and the
complementary external support i sjointly orchestrated.

The proposed project continues the series of innovative operations to support a Sector Wide
Approach (SWAP), whose primary goals would be to: (i)support the development o f
institutional capacity in road transport sector; (ii)
                                                    help Poland address key sector policy issues
aimed at strengthening public expenditure management and improving govemance; and (iii)
provide funding for road maintenance and rehabilitation in a way that would allow for an
adequate balance between maintenance o f existing assets and new investment supported by the
EUandother internationalfinancing institutions.

3. Higher LevelObjectivesto whichthe ProjectContributes

Acceleration o f investment ininfkastructure is crucial to fulfill Poland's development agenda and
meet the challenges still ahead. A modem and well-developed communication network i s a key
element o f the general investment climate, which in turn determines a country's potential to
foster a sustainableprivate sector-led growth. InPolandthe inadequate, decapitalized, unsafe and
congestedroadinfrastructure is increasingly recognized as a mainbottleneck to growth. Through
hightransport costs, it precludes opportunities to further exploit economies of scale. It is also
believed to contribute to regional disparities as, in Poland, regional income and unemployment
levels are strongly correlated with road density. Access to a reliable transportation network is a
precondition of having a competitive economy, both at regional and national levels. With the
lowest ratio o f roads in good condition in the region, Poland i s already losing a fair amount o f
foreign direct investments to its better equipped neighbors. The issue i s also linked to the


                                                 4

composition of public expenditures. Relative to its comparator countries, Polandexpenditures on
current consumption are high, while public investmentis neglected.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. LendingInstrument

Theproposed100 million loan (about US130.5 million equivalent) is a repeater o fthe RM&R
loan signed in2004, and draws on the experience and lessons learned during its implementation.
It will be a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) structured to hrther support the rehabilitation, and
maintenance of economic, social, and institutional roads infi-astructure, as well as to finance the
proposed GDDKiA Management Information System (MIS). While the loan is essentially
devoted to financing physical investment related to roads maintenance and rehabilitation, it
continues to provide support for the improvement of the institutional capacity o f the GDDKiA.
Under project Component A (Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation) World Bank funds will be
pooled with those from the national budget and the EIB, while Component B (Management
Information System) will be implementedusing World Bank standard fiduciary arrangements.

The loan funds would be disbursed through the National Bank of Poland account, and would
support GDDKiA's maintenance and rehabilitation program for the period 2005-2006. In order
to facilitate the use o f the funds, it will continue to rely on the Government's capacity and
system. These have proved to operate satisfactorily duringimplementation o f the RM&R project,
and the use o f ex-post rather than ex-ante reviews has not compromised quality, efficiency, and
accountability, or the Bank's fiduciary responsibilities.

A follow-up (third) operationo fsimilarnature andconcept is foreseen for 2006.

Table 2 below summarizes the project content and total cost of about US$210.5 million, o f
which the Bank would contribute up to US$130.5 million or 62 percent, to be disbursed over
three years (2005-2007).

2. ProgramObjective and Phases

The current program will continue to support the Government's five-year (2002-2005)
development programof the national road network, originally estimated to cost PLN36.8 billion
(about US$9 billion) The 2004-2005 program supported by the Roads Maintenance and
Rehabilitation (RM&R) project has contributed to the improvement o f about 9 percent o f the
national road network. There is further need to accelerate the program to benefit Polish society,
and to comply with the EU standards. The program will further improve the effectiveness o f
Poland's national road rehabilitation and maintenance systems, particularly dimensions o f
quality, efficiency, road safety, financial viability, androaduser satisfaction.

The proposed loan is the second6 o f a series of up to three loans aiming at assisting the
Government in its effort to improve the overall quality o f its national roads network, including
traffic  safety, and strengthening the capacity o f the GDDKiA. Total World Bank financing
would amount to a maximum o f 350 million. Annex 1provides an overview o f the road sector
inPoland.

3. Project Development Objective and Key Indicators

The objective o f the project is to continue improving the effectiveness o f Poland's national road
rehabilitation and maintenance systems by: (i)          further increasingthe percentage o f national roads
ingood condition, (ii)     establishing reliable and stable funding for the national road maintenance
and rehabilitation network, and (iii)        improving the capacity within the GDDKiA to operate
efficiently and effectively. These objectives form part o f the Letter o f Sector Development
Policy endorsed by the Government on February 24, 2004 (Annex 1). The achievement o f the
project development objective will be confirmed using the following key indicators: (i)            adoption
and continued use of improved road maintenance and rehabilitation practices within GDDKiA;
(ii)  evidence of use o f a coherent six-year rolling roads expenditure program together with an
adequately balanced maintenancehnvestment program; (iii)             significant increase inthe percentage
of the road network in good condition when compared with pre-project conditions; and (iv)
evidence of high road user satisfaction following rehabilitation or maintenance operations when
users are polled, both about the quality o f the completed sections and the inconveniences
associated with the rehabilitation or maintenance processes. The table below details the project
monitoring indicators, including the results expected at the end o f the project. The indicators

4. ProjectComponents

The loan amounts to about 100 million (about US$130.5 million equivalent) and includes two
components: (a) financial support to the road maintenance and rehabilitation program (about
US$125.5 million) - in line with the draft budget framework prepared by GDDKiA for 2005.
The financing scheme and implementation arrangements will be similar to the ones applied
under RM&R project; and (b) implementation of GDDKiA Management Information System
(MIS) (about US$5 million) -inline with the revised MAP(February 2005) andthe Strategy for
a Comprehensive Information Technology System approvedbythe GDDKiA inFebruary2004.

(a) TheRoad Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program hasbeenpreparedby GDDKiA within
the framework o f the budget for 2005. The national budget funds allocated to road maintenance
and rehabilitation will be pooled with the resources provided by the Bank and EIB loans, to be
used for reducing the existing road maintenance and rehabilitation backlog. The Bank team
received a list of 123 contracts to be executed in 16 regional branches o f GDDKiA. Annex 4
provides details on the content o f the road expenditure program that amounts to PLN 7 billion
(equivalent to US$2.3 billion) for the year 2005. The National budget funds allocated to road
maintenance and rehabilitation, pooled with the resource provided by the IBRD and EIB loans
amounts to PLN0.7 billion equivalent or about US$205.5million. The proceeds o f the loans will
provide additional resources to essentially tackle the current road maintenance and rehabilitation
backlog. The purpose o f this financial support i s to maintain a right balance between
maintenance/rehabilitation, strengthening and reconstruction o f existing roads, and with new
construction o fmotorways and expressways.

(b) GDDKiA Management Information System (MIS). A specific risk identified under the
RM&R project was the lack of a modem MIS within the organization, which would integrate
financial-accounting information with the contract data including planning and physical
measures. Therefore, the GDDKiA Modernization Action Plan included the design o f a modem
MIS.A part ofthetask was completed inFebruary,2004 whenthe Strategy for aComprehensive
InformationTechnology System was approved by the GDDKiA based on a study prepared by a


  Monitoredunder the current RM&R project, and being updated in2005.

local consultant. GDDKtA with support from the local consultants is now developing the second
phase o f the task - a review o f the IT infrastructure, a fimctional review, and an analysis of
processes and workflow.

The RM&R I1project will support the implementationo f a modern management and information
system (MIS) within GDDKiA, that will properly integrate all data necessary to efficiently carry
out GDDKiA's activities (including technical, financial, human resources and contract related
data) and support all core functions anddecision-making processes o f GDDKiA.

5. Lessons Learned andReflected inthe Project Design

Since the beginning o f ~ O ' S ,the European Union has been very active in providing grant
assistance, mainly in the form o f program PHARE and pre-accession instrument ISPA (510
million). During this period, the Polish road sector has been supported by three main
international financial institutions: European Investment Bank (EIB) - in the total amount of
1.85 billion, the European Bank o f Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) - 45 million,
and the World Bank, which made a transport loan with a road component and three road loans
for a total O ~ U S W ~ million'.

Past projects financed by the World Bank, in addition to their focus on road rehabilitation-
modernization and maintenance,              also included construction o f bypasses, road safety
improvement, andblack spots elimination. All physical investmentswere successfully completed
with works widely distributed throughout the country, incompliance with World Bank fiduciary
and safeguards requirements. The civil works contracts enabled a recently commercialized
domestic construction industry to modernize its technology and to strengthen its managerial,
administrative and commercial practices. Through technical assistance, the modernization o f the
national roads administration was initiated, and most o f the new private consulting firms as well
as local construction sector professionals benefited from training courses on preparation o f bids
and on the management and administration o f enterprises. A Road Data Bank was created to
support management o f the national roads and facilitate training activities. The recent experience
with the RM&R project was very positive interms o f execution o f civil works contracts, with a
record number o f 164 contracts implemented in a six months period. At the same time the local
contractors have become too stretched; experience showed that the bidding process should start
early in January to allow contract execution to start as early as April. Institutional reforms have
taken a longer time to take-off, but under the new management o f GDDKiA, the modernization
process o f the Polish RoadAdministration has beenreactivated.

The experience from past operations may be characterized as globally positive. The RM&R I1
project will benefit from further simplification in financial management and progress reporting.
While the objectives o f the projects were achieved in full, there is still scope for further
improvement to address some o f the GDDKiA's internal specific issues including information
management, accounting, planning, and contract management. In addition to the revised
Modernization Action Plan (MAP)' - to be implemented under the on-going RM&R project -
these issues are beingaddressed inthe MIScomponent.


* The first road project was completed in 2000; the second project was completed satisfactorily inDecember 2004;
the RM&Rproject is progressing at high speed with 93% o f disbursement completed inless than one year.
 A revised draft MAP is includedunder Technical Annex 1.

                                                        8

Progress has also been registered in road safety. The National Road Safety Program, operating
since 2001, provides an orientation for road safety policy and guidance for concrete actions.
Important provisions have been made to the national legislation on road safety to further
strengthen the road safety structure and enhance its operational basis. Poland has been provided
with a nationwideroad safety framework comprising a central coordination body and 16regional
branches. Another important aspect i s the increasedinvolvement of the private sector andNGOs,
mainly within the framework o f Polish GRSP Committee. An increasedcontributionto national
road safety efforts has been noticed and the insurance sector also plays a role inthis. There is a
slow but steady progress inraising social awareness o f road hazards and increasing the public's
recognition o f road safety measures, especially against excessive speed and alcohol impairment.
The number o f road crash victims has been decliningduringthe last four years, despite a steady
growth in car ownership. The number o f fatalities has shown the fastest decline, followed by a
slight drop in injuries and crash figures. InApril 2004, by signing the European Road Safety
Charter, Poland endorsed the European Community's road safety goals. Shortly following EU
accession, inMay 2004, the countrywide speed limit o f 50 km/hwithin built-upareas was passed
bythe Parliament.

6. AlternativesConsideredandReasons for Rejection

The proposed operation has been designed as a "repeater" o f the on-going RM&R project. It
applies the same principles of strong reliance on country systems (fiduciary and safeguards), that
have already increasedthe effectiveness o fthe project andprogram.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. PartnershipArrangements

The technical assistance provided by the Bank under the ongoing RM&R project continues to
help shape the Government program and institutional reforms in GDDKiA. These are fully
supported by the EBRD, EIB and the EU. The Polish Government and the World Bank have
maintained regular contact with representatives o f these agencies, to keep them informed and to
consult them on program preparation. The EIB in particular is keen in pursuing the reforms
supported by the Bankinthe road sector, inparticular inincreasing Poland's capacity to planand
implement large programs of high priority road investments. The EIB supported project on
Priority Road Infrastructure I1 includes financing from EIB (500 million), the World Bank
(350 million"), and the Government (200 million) for a program through 2009 that would
help eliminatingthe maintenance andrehabilitation backlog. With ongoing assistanceand advice
provided by the Bank to the Road Fund, disbursementsfrom it have improved. The possibilities
o f usingthe Fundto float bonds and acquire other forms o f credit, as well as channeling EIB and
other donor funds through it, are beingexploredjointly withthe Government.

2. Institutionaland ImplementationArrangements

Overall Project Management. The M o Ithrough its Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established
under the on-going RM&R project will be responsible for overall project management and
coordination, in close cooperation with the staff o f GDDKiA. The latter will be the final project
beneficiary. GDDGA has developed significant capacity in preparation and management o f


loIncluding the on-goingRM&R loan, the proposedRM&R11, andanewRM&RI11inFY06.

                                                 9

biddingdocuments, incash flow calculations and payments, andwith the advice o fits respective
experts it proves capable o f successfully implementing the proposed project. GDDKiA would be
responsible for all procurement under the project.

Flow of Funds. There will be one Special Account for the project. The Special Account will be
opened by MoF inNational Banko f Poland or a commercial bank acceptable to the World Bank.
Loan funds will flow from the World Bank to the Special Account and then be converted into
PLNandpooled with other government funds inthe central budget account. The funds will then
be made available to M o I and GDDKiA as budget transfers. The GDDKiA will report monthly
to M o I on its use o f the funds in accordance with normal budget reporting procedures. Advance
disbursements amounting to 95 percent o f the total loan will be made at effectiveness (expected
inMay) andinAugust 2005 to cover expensesprogrammedinthe roadrehabilitation component
by the GDDKiA for a 12-month time period. The reconciliation o f expenditures will be carried
out annually for the road rehabilitation component, and quarterly for the M I S component. The
applications will be supported by Summary Statements o f Expenditures (part o f FMRs) showing
types o f expenditures with applied disbursement percentages and Reconciliation o f the Special
Account. Full documentation in respect o f project expenditures will be kept by GDDKiA and
verified by auditors on an annual basis.

3. Monitoringand Evaluationof Outcomes/Results

Project progress reports would be prepared by M o I on an annual basis and submitted for the
Bank's review. The progress reports will focus on results rather than providing process related
information. Therefore, the reports will list all the relevant activities carried out under the
project, including but not limited to: (i)  progress made in the implementation o f the GDDKiA
MAP; (ii) maintenance and rehabilitation contracts executed during the period; (iii)
             roads
progress made inthe implementation o f the MIS; and (iv) promotion o f PPPs inthe road sector.
To monitor the progress o f the project, a set o f performance monitoring indicators has been
defined (Annex 3) to be followed and complied with and an annual meeting will take place
between the Polish authorities and the Bankprior to, or around February 28 of each year, starting
in2006.

4. Sustainability

The project will seek sustainability through:
    0    Carrying out the road maintenance and rehabilitationprogram as developed by GDDKiA
        with the assistanceo fthe HDM-4System, bothat headquarters andregional offices;
    0    Increased capacity within GDDKiA for planning and managing national roads
         expenditure programs;
    0    Improved efficiency inimplementing the overall national roads expenditure program; and
    0    Secure fundingmechanisms for roadmaintenance and safety.

5. CriticalRisks and PossibleControversial Aspects

Risks. The proposed project is considered as a moderate risk operation. The main risk remains
GDDKiA's capacity to carry-out the institutional refoims specified in the MAP. Close
monitoring o f the progress made in the implementation o f the GDDKiA's MAP, during
supervision o fthe RM&R I1project, will be carried out to mitigate this risk.


                                                 10

The lack o f a modem Management Information System (MIS) was identified as a specific risk
during preparation o f the RM&R project and was partially addressed through carrying-out the
design for such MIS. The RM&R I1follows-up on the results o f the design, and will finance the
acquisition and implementation start-up o fthe MIS.

Controversial Aspects. Taking into consideration the strong support from Polish citizens to
benefit from an improved and safer road network, and due to the fact that the proposed project is
essentially focusing on road maintenance and rehabilitation, thus limiting the potential
environmental and social negative impact, there are no controversial aspects foreseen during the
implementation of the project. The successful public seminar held inJanuary 2004, duringwhich
the Government strategy for national roads was presented and debated thoroughly with local
NGOs, will be repeated inApril, 2005.

        accordance with the Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators, the progress achieved in the
        implementation o fthe Project duringthe preceding calendar year.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. EconomicandFinancialAnalyses

All o fthe national road sections under considerationfor the present project have a classification
according to SOSN technical condition o f pavement "D". The assumption o f this criterion will
assure the proper selection o f contracts. Every road maintenance andor rehabilitation contract
would guarantee a minimal economic rate o f retum (ERR) averaging 25 percent, well above the
economic cost o f capital inPoland, estimated at 12 percent. A summarized economic analysis o f
some typical maintenanceh-ehabilitationworks contracts recently carried out is given inAnnex 9.
The project would also provide other benefits that are difficult to quantify, such as improvingthe
organization and finding mechanism o froadmaintenance.

2. Technical

No major technical issues are expected. GDDKiA has an excellent capacity inroad engineering
and operations, and the designs o f the various investments proposedunder the project are fully
compliant with existing intemational standards. GDDIGA has long experience with the Bank, as
it has successfully implemented three IBRD financed projects during the past decade, o f which
the latest (RM&R project, approved inMarch 2004) at high speed, and quality acceptable to the
Bank.There should therefore be no major technical issues for this project other thanto continue
the monitoring and control at the design and implementation stages.

3. Fiduciary

Fiduciary ResponsibiZity. The Bank will continue to rely substantially on the Borrower's
systems when implementing the proposed operation; during the preparation o f the RM&R
project an independent review o f the Public Procurement Law and its amendments was carried-
out andprovided the Bankwith the necessary fiduciary assurance.

Procurement. In terms o f public procurement, the Polish law has been amended in order to
satisfy its international obligations on accession to the EU. Whilst the EU directives have
borrowed many concepts from accepted international procurement practices, their overriding
objective o f market integration sometimes sits uncomfortably with these more general principles
and often applies them for different purposes. These will needto be adapted under this project in
the following two areas: (i) the purpose o f using national competitive bidding procedure, no
                             for
merit point based evaluation will be carried out; and (ii) offer" will be defined as "lowest
                                                            "best
evaluated bid". These two exceptions to the Polish Public procurement Law are reflected in the
loan agreement.




                                                12

Financial Management Assessment. The financial management assessment o f GDDIOA was
completed during the appraisal o f RM&R project, in February 2004. The financial management
arrangements o f the RM&R I1repeater project remain acceptable to the World Bank.

Disbursement. There will be one Special Account for the project. The Special Account will be
opened by the MoF in the National Bank o f Poland or a commercial bank acceptable to the
World Bank. Loan funds will flow from the World Bank to the Special Account and then be
converted into PLN and pooled with other government funds in the central budget account. The
funds will then be made available to the M o I and GDDKiA in the form o f budget transfers.
Advance disbursements amounting to 95 percent o f the total loan will be made at effectiveness
(expected in May) and in August 2005 to cover expenses programmed in road rehabilitation
component by the GDDKiA for a 12-month time period. The reconciliation o f expenditures will
be carried out annually for the road rehabilitation component, and quarterly for the M I S
component. The application for payment to reimburse retroactive expenditures incurred prior the
loan signing but not earlier than January 1, 2005 shall be sent to the World Bank separately and
will be reimbursed inthe currency o f the expenditures. The other applications with documented
expenditures will be supported by Summary Statements o f Expenditures (part o f FMRs) showing
types o f expenditures with applied disbursement percentages and Reconciliation o f the Special
Account. Counterpart funds will not be calculated on a transaction-by-transaction basis, but will
be represented by the national budget funds allocated to GDDKiA for the national roads network
expenditure program financially supported by the Bank/MoF loan. Fulldocumentation inrespect
o fproject expenditures will be kept by GDDKiA and the M o I andwill be audited annually.

Auditing Arrangements. The Audit o f the project financial statement will be perfonned by an
auditor and inaccordance with TOR acceptable to the World Bank. The audit shall be carried out
inaccordance with INTOSAIAuditing Standards or InternationalStandards onAuditing and the
TOR acceptable to the World Bank. During project preparation the World Bank informed the
Polish counterparts that the Polish Supreme Audit Institution, the Najwyzsza Izba Kontorli
(NIK),would alsobeacceptable to the WorldBank.

4. Social

Poverty Category. The specific focus of this loan is not on the poor and it does not meet the
criteria for being classified as a "poverty-focused operation". However, it supports Government
policy to improve the country's road network, and make road transport more effective and safer.
Improved road transport networks and services are also expected to attract foreign and local
investors to do business across the country and not only around largest cities. This, in tum, is
expected to contribute to more evenly distributed economic growth and reduce regional
disparities. Reliable transport services facilitate access to schools, health andjob markets. Road
works also generate substantial employment. It is estimated that the first Bank financed road
project in Poland generated directly about 10,800 job-years and further employment in the
material and transport sector (estimated at 4,000 job-years). While this impact was temporary,
the proposed loan will support more stable and continuous funding for the sector, which should
provide longer employment opportunities.

Participatory Elements. Preparation o f the project took place during an intense public debate on
the current condition and the future o f the Polish road sector. Therefore, throughout the project
preparation process, the Government has been heavily involved in explaining the pros and cons
of various models proposed for road rehabilitation and investment financing to the public

                                                  13

(particularly the introduction o f vignettes vs. fuel price increases). These efforts, involving
meetings and consultations and bilateral contacts with the relevant parliamentary committees,
NGOs, various professional associations, media, resulted in high degree o f public awareness
regarding the Government's determination to focus on road transport sector and the need to
mobilize resources for this purpose. Inthis context, the Government also made intensive use o f
the MoI'swebsite where the key documents, including the Environmental Impact Assessment
report, were made public and interested parties could direct their queries and concerns. In
January 2004, the GoP convened a seminar with key Polish ecological NGOs to seek their
feedback regarding the report and, more broadly, the Government's mid-term strategy in regard
to the transport sector. A workshop regarding the role o f civic society organizations intransport
infiastructure investments is scheduled for April 2005. In addition, inthe summer o f 2004, GoP
launched a Social Assessment (SA) that provided feedback inter-alia inregard to the perception
o f the road infrastructure program among the general public and professional drivers, the
willingness o f private and commercial road users to pay higher fuel prices, and their confidence
that the additional funds mobilized that way will indeed result in the improved network o f the
country's roads. The SA involved a baseline survey as well as focus groups and in-depth
interviews conducted with various stakeholders across the country. The final S A report was
received inDecember 2004.

Public I nformation Campaign. The GDDKiA is currently finalizing a draft communication
strategy in support o f the road sector reform, and developing an updated schedule o f public
communication activities for the next two calendar years. The final draft o f the strategy and the
action plan for 2005-2006 will be finalized by mid-December. In the short term, the
implementation of the strategy          envisages inter-alia strengthening o f the GDDKiA
Communication Unit and commissioning a number o f video productions on various aspects o f
the govenunent road program. The Communication Unit is currently preparing the terms o f
reference for the above assignments. In addition, as part o f its on-going interactions with the
leading Polish environmental NGOs, GDDKiA, incollaboration with the World Bank, convened
a consultation meeting on the main design characteristics o f the RM&R I1project, on February
14, 2005, and encouraged NGO and other civil society representatives to provide feedback. In
addition, the Government will organize a seminar on a broader government road and railway
transport strategy for Poland, which is likely to take place in April 2005 in Jozefow, near
Warsaw.

5. Environment

The proposed loan will not directly finance any new investment, but rather support the
modernization o f the national roads agency and development o f other institutional capacity, and
help Poland address road financing and other key sector policy issues. As a Specific Investment
Loan targeting a subprogram within the Government's road expenditure program, the project has
been rated as Financial Intermediary (FI) with possible B and C category subprojects. Duringthe
project safeguards consultation meetings it was agreed that the definition o f B and C categories
subprojects will conform with the Polish Maintenance and Improvement Standards 1to 9 (with 9
including minor road widening to standard width within existing right-of-way), and including
bridge strengthening. Although there is no sub-project intermediary (as in a social fund or a
credit line), the rationale for the FIrating for this project is that the nature o f the operation has a
lot o f similarities with those financed under such projects, i.e., many small investments that
cannot be appraised beforehand, but rather on a case by case basis. In order to ensure that the


                                                  14

project will not negatively impact the environment in any way, additional due diligence was
carried out during the preparation o f RM&R 11, to follow-up the actions undertaken earlier in
2004 for the RM&R project: (i)a description o f the proposed project has been prepared and
made available to the public; (ii)     a thematic seminar to discuss sustainability issues related to the
development o f the highway sector in Poland is planned to be held in April 2005; and (iii)                   an
update of the Operational Manual o f the RM&R project on environmental and social aspects has
been carried out, to include more specific details on environmental mitigation and monitoring
procedures. The update has beenpublished before appraisalhegotiation. The detailed description
of the current environmental legislation, including resettlement policy, was prepared in the
context o f the earlier project. The executive summary o fthese actions is inAnnex 10.

6. Safeguard Policies

Given the nature o f the interventions supported by the project, the project does not trigger any
social safeguards. However, it is quite likely that the implementation of the proposed sector
reform agenda will generate a number of social issues that will require the Borrower's careful
attention throughout the project implementation period. In this context, it is essential that the
Government builds the necessary capacity to monitor the impact of fuel price increases on the
most vulnerable social groups and poor working population groups who rely on road transport,
access and mobilityofthe poor. Inaddition, the Government will needto develop the capacity to
monitor the social impact o f the reform and deal with possible redundancies among transport
sector employees as well as in carrying out public consultations and briefings among the
concerned stakeholders.

Furthermore, while the project does not finance land acquisition, giventhe Government's resolve
to undertake significant sector investments funded inroad sector inthe future, the preparation o f
the project included an evaluation o f the legal framework and its enforcement in regard to
involuntary resettlement and land acquisition. The evaluation was conducted at the request o fthe
GoP in order to determine the degree o f compliance of the Polish law with relevant standards
pursuedby the EuropeanCommission andthe World Bank.

the Act o f 23 July 2003 on Protectionof Monuments. This new law, which replaced the old Law
o f 1962 on Cultural Heritage Protection, has reinforced the already quite strict rules concerning
protection of cultural heritage. In fact its requirements in this context, including far reaching
powers o f cultural heritage authorities (`Conservators of Monuments") in relation to planning
and development control, are often considered to be too rigid. Chance findings duringworks is
regulated by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, which is empowered to give and
recall permits for carrying out conservational, archeological and excavatory works and on terms
o f carrying out o fthese works and on qualifications of persons carrying out these works.

                 POLAND:SecondRoadMaintenance and RehabilitationProject

A. RoadSector Overview

The poor quality of the road network i s a key factor that increases the cost of doing business in Poland.
Many Polish road structures date from the central planning era when traffic volume was lower and axle
loads were lighter (most long-distance transport was by rail; and Polish roads were built for 6 to 10 ton
axle loads versus the current EUnorm o f 11.5 ton). Over the past decade the demand for road transport
has grown radicallybut increases inthe supply have not kept pace. The road network has been the victim
ofunder-investment inmaintenance, renewaland modernization.

With a recent increase inthe road expenditure it is still less than 0,5 percent of GDP, which is aroundone
third o f the needed bare minimum, compared with a minimumof about 1percent just to stop the quality
deteriorating further. It is estimated that Polish consumers spend the equivalent o f about 16 percent of
GDP on vehicle operating costs (vehicles, fuels, wages, etc.), on top of which road accidents cost society
about 2 percent o f GDP in physical damage, medical costs and lost productivity. Overall quality and
safety o f the road network falls far short o f the standards expected of an EU member state. The total
length o f the public road network inPoland i s about 377,000 km., of which 66 percent are paved. Roads
have recently beenreclassifiedinto 4 categories: (i)      national; (ii)  voivodsip; (iii) and (iv) gmina.
                                                                                            powiat;

Funding. Fundingfor road maintenance and new roads construction has not kept pace with the increase
in traffic. Despite the recent efforts supported under the RM&R project, at the end of 2004 about 26
percent o f the national network (administered by the General Directorate for Roads and Motorways -
GDDKiA) is still in poor condition and require immediate maintenance; only 46 percent are in good
condition". The total maintenance backlog i s estimated at the level o f P L N6.5 billion; immediate surface
treatment needs are at the level of PLN 2.7 billion. In addition, Poland has one of the shortest motorway
networks (530 km) and the lowest ratio o f roads in good condition among EU accession counties. Of
these, 240 kmwere builtbefore 1990.

Motorization and Traffic Growth. As in the neighboring Central European counties, the demand for
road transport has grown radically over the past decade, owing to the unprecedented growth of passenger
car ownership, and uncompetitive railways. The number o f vehicles inPolandincreased from 9 millionto
about 15 million since 1990. Annual average daily traffic on the main international corridors has doubled
during last ten years. Average traffic level on national roads is 7,000 AADT and on international roads
 11,450 AADT. Some sections however are heavily congested with a traffic level o f more than' 15,000
vehicles per day, where the construction o f motorways or expressways is highlyjustified. Due to intense

investment program in the roads sector and EU accession the traffic patterns, particularly related to
international traffic, have changed significantly since 2000 when the most recent general traffic survey
took place. The new survey is to be carried out in2005 and shall provide updated traffic data needed for
proper analysis o f roads investments and maintenance strategies.

Road Expenditures. The national roads budget, which had been very low in the first half o f the past
decade, has risenrecently to about 0.5 percent of GDP (which is still low). Expenditures over the last four
years averaged some 4.5 billion PLNp.a. (US$1.2 billion). While the amounts would be reasonable ifthe
network was in acceptable condition, the accumulated backlog of deterioration makes the need much
larger. In addition, the motonvay and expressway program - which means new construction - would
require about US$1 billion pea.at the start, possibly growing to US$3 billion p.a. after a few years.

clear that, provided they are well-chosen, investments to bring the roads up to EU standards will yield
highreturns inreducedtransport costs, improvedaccess, lesspollution and fewer accidents.

Road Revenues. Inyear 2000, the total revenue relatedto road exceeded PLN13.5 billion (equivalent to
3.75 billion), with excise duty on fuels as the main contributor. The split is as follows: (i)
                                                                                             excise duty on
fuels -PLN12.6billion; (ii)annualheavygoodsvehicletax-PLNO.4billion; (iii)licensesandpermits
for international transport - PLN0.3 billion; and (iv) excise and customs duty on vehicles PLN0.25
billion.


Only a relatively small portion o f revenues from the road sector is allocated back to roads - this mainly
concerns a share of the excise duty on fuels. In 1997, concerned about the condition o f the network, the
Parliament adoptedan act that would allocate no lessthan 30 percent of the fuel excise tax revenues to the
road sector (12 percent o f this accrues to the national roads budget and 18 percent to the local
governments for regional and urban roads). The Parliament's idea was to gradually increase this
percentage. Inpractice, this share was higher than 30 percent only in 1999 and 2000 (31.5 percent and
30.6 percent respectively). Then, becauseo fbudgetary problems, it was reducedback to 30 percent.

     Past Reforms. The Motonvay Development initiated in 1994 has not met its expected goals and its
     results are very modest. The program, started as a pure BOT system where all financing shouldhave been
     provided by private investors, generated little interest. This was due to the lack o f sufficient levels o f
     traffic to justify expensive full profile motonvays. It was later changed to a PPP system, providing for a
     large degree of state involvement. Despite this change, only 3 concessions have been awarded (one only
     to operate an existing motonvay) and no new section has been opened to traffic yet (map of existing
     concessionsis attached below). Only a modest length(about 150 km) was built with traditional sovereign
     loans from EU3 and EBRD, as well as EU grants since 1990. Because o f its lack o f success mentioned
     above, the Agency for Motonvay Construction and Operation was in March 2000 merged with the
     General Directorate of Public Roads. The new organization i s now called General Directorate o f Public
     Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA).

     In 1999, following the administrativereformofthe country, the structure ofthe public roadnetwork was
     adjusted to the new territorial structure. The length o f national roads was reduced from 46,000 km to
     18,000 km, less than 5 percent of the total network o f 370,000 km.All other roads are under regional and
     local governments. While the reclassification o f the network clarified the management and the financial
     responsibilitiesfor various classes o f roads, it also created problems for the efficient management o f the

system as a whole. Management and financing i s particularly weak at the lower levels o f regional and
local governments.

The new system of road categorization and administration i s a subject of discussion by professional
associations, at conferences and in professional magazines. The main merit o f the system i s the direct
responsibility o f local governments for roads serving their area, which allows them to formulate
development plans and programs meetingthe localneeds. One problem i s that local road systems are very
fragmented and do not form easy to maintain networks. Road administration costs are increased by the
need to support a large number of small road management units. Some experts have suggested increasing
the national network to some 25,000 km, still a substantial reduction from the original 46,000 km and
regroupingroads among lower levels of government to increase efficiency.

Pavement Condition of National Road Network. Every year the GDDKiA publishes a report on
technical condition o f national road network pa~ement'~.The Polish pavement condition assessment
system (SOSN) i s based on the compilation o f the following data: (i) cracks; (ii)longitudinal roughness;
(iii) depth;(iv)surfacecondition; and(v)skidresistance.Separateparametersofpavementtechnical

into four classes, i.e. fi-om Class A to class D.

B. KeyPolicyIssues andMainFeaturesofthe ReformProgram

The road sector in Poland i s facing three major policy issues that are currently being addressed by the
Govemment; (i) capacity o f the GDDKiA to implementan expended and ambitious road program
                 weak
duringthe comingyears; (ii)   insufficient level o fresource to finance road maintenance, rehabilitation and
investment; and (iii)poor planning capacity for both maintaining and expanding the national roads
network

1. CapacityRestructuring

Itis generally acceptedthat, although GDDKiAhas the capacity to manage the roadnetwork onthe basis
of a "business-as-usual" scenario, it does not have the capacity to implement the Government's greatly
expanded and ambitious roadprogram. The main constraints on capacity include lengthy compulsory land
acquisition procedures and staff constraints within GDDKiA to plan, prepare and manage the road
contracts. To address these weaknesses, the Govemment submitted two transport Bills to Parliament in
2002. One focused on simplifying the procedures for land expropriation and for obtaining location and
construction permits, while still respecting the environment. The other focused on introduction o f an
additional road charge (vignette), and on creating a new road agency able to operate along commercial
lines. The first Bill was passedby Parliament and is now effective. The second Bill was not accepted by
Parliament and the problems of GDDKiA's staffing constraints remain. The lack o f institutional capacity
within GDDKiA affects usage o f EU pre-accession funds (ISPA) and funds made available to Poland
upon accession.

                                                      21

Furthermore, if such funds are not used in a timely fashion, they will be lost. The need to create the
required capacity to prepare and implement a greatly enhanced road improvement program i s therefore
critical. To carry out this program the Government is currently strengthening the efficiency o f GDDKiA;
the main mechanism i s the MAP supported by the RM&R project, followed by the implementation o f the
M I Sproposedto b e carried-out under the proposed RM&R 11operation.

2. Funding

The newRoadFundI4hasbeen effective since mid 2004 and is expected to collected about 200 in 2004.
It is expected to generate about 250 million per year (i.e., it would raise the national funds channeledto
national roads from about 500 million to 750 million per year). In addition, although it represents a
form of earmarking, it differs from regular earmarlung, since the arrangements are budget neutral (i.e., the
fuel charge i s an additional tax that does not abstract revenues away from other sectors). The fuel charge
i s thus more like a road tariff than a tax. In the longer term, it should therefore be possible to pass
legislation to combine the fuel charge with the earmarked fuel excise taxes allocated for national roads
(12 percent of the overall fuel excise tax), to designate it as the "road tariff," to adjust it in fbture
independently from the fuel excise tax rate, and to manage the proceeds proactively to strengthen
financial discipline. The Bank o f the NationalEconomy (BGK) manages the Fundunder the direction o f a
FirstDeputyPresident. Disbursements fromthe roadfundhave improvedandit is expected that about 60-
70 percent o f the funds will have been committed by the end of 2004. The Fund i s also exploring the
possibility o f usingthe proceeds to float bonds and acquire other forms o f credit. Its management i s also
working on the possibility o f channeling EIB and other donor funds through the Road Fundwhich will
primarily be used to finance new investments. At the same time, a sustainable mechanism to finance the
process o f road safety improvement i s being considered inwhich 1percent o f the Fundrevenues should
be invested inroad safety projects with a highrate of retum inall sectors and administrative divisions of
the country, based on the strategy developed by the NationalRoad Safety Council.

3. Planning

An important element underpinning the Government's road improvement program is the design and
implementation o f a consistent system for setting spending priorities, based on rigorous economic criteria
based on introduction o f computerized technical, financial and economic model for simulations of roads
investment andmaintenance strategies.

The HDM-4 model prepared with support by extemal consultants as part o f the ongoing Road RM&R
project i s not yet being widely used. A preliminary analysis reveals, however, that most o f works
undertaken in2004 were in line with recommendations of HDMsystem preparedinearly 2004. GDDKiA
will introduce the model into their planning process of the regional offices by mid January 2005, and is
committed to have all its plans for rehabilitation and maintenance, at national and regional levels,
supported by HDM-4analysis starting with year 2006. When fully implementedthe system would ensure
that road spending produce value for money and will be utilized to prepare a rolling 6-year investment
program that donors and the EUcan "adopt" for purposes of supporting the road sector. The first o f such
multi-annual programs i s currently utilized for planning purposes by GDDKiA and Ministry of
Infrastructure.

As part of the comprehensive planning effort GDDKiA and M o I are currently preparing a two-year plan
for utilization of National Road Fundresources for national road network development using the results
of their HDM analysis. The list o f priority projects i s prepared based on their economic parameters and
readinessfor expedite implementation taken.

As the government of Poland is facing the need for preparation of the next EUco-financing perspective
2007-2013, the planning system introduced in GDDKiA should also contribute significantly to
 development o fthe plan inline with the general national transport infrastructure development policy.

C. LETTEROF SECTORDEVELOPMENTPOLICY

The following statement sets down the guidingprincipleswhich the Government committed to follow in
relation to its general responsibilities for the road sector and specific responsibilities for the General
Directorate for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA).

Economic and SocialDevelopment Policies

The quality of transport infrastructure is one of the most important criteria o fassessment o f the country's
socio-economical development level and a very important factor stimulating the economic development.
Poor quality o f the transport infrastructure, resulting from the investments backlog in this sector, i s a
burden for the national economy, limiting its competitiveness and economic development possibilities.
All transport modes are facing serious infrastructure investment needs.


The lack o f road network of adequate standard, appears nowadays as the critical barrier to the country
development, limiting the potential of Polish economy competitive advantages such as geographical
position and market size. The condition of Poland's roads hampers the international trade with EUand the
other neighboringcountries, and has a negative impact on foreign direct investments and mobility o f labor
force. Those negative factors result indecreasing Polish economy competitiveness and create a barrier to
the development andinnovative processesinPoland.
Ensuringof effective connections ofPolandwith EUand newmember countries throughTENis of great
importance to take advantage o f the enlargement of the Common Market

Background to the Road Sector

The existing system o f 18,036 kmnational road network - even if considered appropriate from a spatial
point of view   - doesn't provide an effective allocation o f industries and services, and doesn't ensure a
proper quality o f passenger and cargo traffic services, due to the lack o f a more complex, system of
motorways (total length o fmotorways inPoland i s 483 km) and expressways.

Dueto the poor condition ofroadnetwork, improvement o f standardsis one ofthe Poland's development
priorities. The total length o f roads accepting the load o f 11,5t/axle, being a basic European standard, i s
estimated at 928 km (only 5.1 percent of the total national roads network). As much as 30 percent o f the
national roads require an immediaterehabilitation, and additional 30 percent shouldbe rehabilitated inthe
nearest future. The main reason of the poor technical quality o f roads is the increase o f traffic movements
(doubled in the last ten years) combined with pavements standard not adjusted for the heavy trucks
movements.

Road Sector DevelopmentPolicy

The Government intends to encourage provision o f an efficient and sustainable road network capable o f
supporting the Government's national socio-economic goals. These include:

         Providing an adequate and affordable level o f access to all major centers o f social and economic
         importance;
         Providing acceptable transit routes to adjoining countries, particularly those forming part o f the
         EuropeanUnion (EU);
         Providingroad capacity and levels o f maintenance within the available resources which minimize
         overall transport costs;
         Undertalungdemand responsive maintenance to preserve key road assets;
         Promotingbetter road safety to ensure that, to the extent possible, road transport i s both safe and
         efficient; and
         Minimizingthe adverse environmental and social negative impacts ofroadtransport.


                                                      25

The above goals will be promoted through the following guidingprinciples.

MAJORGUIDINGPRINCIPLES

Road PlanningandManagement

The Government is trying that road spending to produce maximum value for money, and that the
allocated funds usedefficiently. To address these issues, the Government has therefore decided to subject
the road sector to some form o f market discipline. This will be promotedby:

        Ensuringthatthe definitionof its six-year roadimprovement programfor 2004-2009will be
        prioritized using economic criteria. The definition of the program will be defined using the
        modem computerized roadmanagement system (HDM-4) currently developed within GDDKiA.
    0   Local authorities will also be encouraged to use more rigorous criteria for setting their priorities,
        althoughthese are expected to be simpler than the methods used for nationalroads.
    0   To helppromote market discipline, road users will be recognizedas customers who are paying for
        the road services provided by GDDKiA and the other local road authorities. To ensure they can
        be heard- and are able to express what they want from the road network - the Government will
        explore ways of consulting the road users.
         Sufficient financial resource will be allocated to ensure a significant improvement of the quality
        o f the national road network through new investment, rehabilitation, reinforcement and
        maintenance. A right balance will be sought between new investment and maintenance with a
        view of the economic benefit for boththe Polisheconomy and the roads users.

ClarifyingResponsibilityfor Roads

The Ministry o f Infrastructure i s responsible for setting and overseeing implementation o f all national
transport policies, including those that apply to the road sector. Responsibility for national roads has been
assignedto GDDKiA under the Ministryo f Infrastructure, while that for local roads has been assigned to
the local authorities. Responsibility for national roads passing through urban areas are assigned to local
authorities and this often leads to varying standards and weak control o f developments within the right of
way. The Government i s aware o f this and would like to encourage local authorities to strengthen their
capacity. Detailedactions currently under consideration to address the above issuesinclude the following:


     0   Encouragingthe local authorities to undertake an audit o ftheir technical capacity;
         Based on the above review, the local authorities would be looking for their better quality work;
         and
     0   In the case of national roads passing through urban areas it would be loolung for better
         cooperation betweennational and local authorities.

Modernizationof GDDKiA

The Government accepts that the road network i s one o f the country's biggest assets. This makes the
national road network one o f the country's biggest "businesses" and, since they are a big business, they
deserve to be managed like a business. The Government has therefore decided to modernize road
management by tahng the following steps:

     0   Endorsingthe operation o fthe "user pay" principle inrelation to the existing National Road
         Fund.
     0   Taking steps to turn GDDKiA into a modern and efficient administrationresponsible and
         accountablefor the successfulimplementation of the Government policy aiming at upgrading
         its roadnetwork with a view o f a smooth integrationwithin the EU.


                                                      26

    0   To deliver on its mission, the GDDKiA would adopt sound management structures and introduce
        appropriate management information systems. They would also prepare and periodically update a
        rolling 6-year BusinessPlan, linked to their Modernization Action Plan (MAP).
    0   Based on the MAP, GDDKiA and the Ministrywould agree on an annual "contract plan" spelling
        out the annual targets, the performance measuresto be applied associatedwith the Plan.

SecuringRoadFinancingandPromotingPublicPrivatePartnershipsintheRoadSector

A National Road Fund was established within Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK) in Warsaw. The
Government is also exploring ways o f involving more private finance in the road sector and is actively
preparing its first PPP project. To further strengthen the financing o f roads, the Government i s
considering several further initiatives as follows:


    0   Establishment o f a Road Fund Consultative Council to advise the Minster on all matters
        pertainingto the financing o froads and also on the management of the National Roads Fund.
    0   The Council will undertake regular surveys of road users to establish their attitudes to the road
        program, its strengths and weaknesses, and ways it mightbe improved.
    0   The Council will also advise the Minster on any other matters that may be referred to it by the
        Minister.
    0   The Government also reiterates its commitment to supplement the revenues of the National Road
        Fund by involving private sector finance, either though loans, public-private partnerships and
        other appropriate schemes.

ImprovingRoadSafety

Road safety continues to be a problem and the Govemment, through the National Road Safety Council, i s
actively working to improve it. It will also develop its collaborating with the Global Road Safety
Partnership to build broad based support for an enhanced road safety program. In addition to these
ongoing initiatives, the Government now also intends to:

    0   Undertake road safety audits on the designs prepared for all major road schemes. Since road
        safety audits is a new subject, selected staff from GDDKiA have been trained to undertake the
        audits.

ProtectingandEnhancingthe Environment

The Government has already adoptedEnvironmentalLaw April 27,2001 (Dz.U.nr62 poz.622) to mitigate
further any negative environmentalimpactresultingfromthe implementationofitnationalroadprogram,
the Government is committedto fully comply with the following:


    0   To systematically apply the environmental Law to all qualifying projects;
    0   To apply the Law at the feasibility stage andbefore, or during, the preliminary design stage;
    0   To systematically hold selective public consultations on all qualifying schemes; and
    0   To supplement the general guidance on environmental analysis set down relating to the road
        sector.

PublicInformationPolicy

A successful implementationo fthe project and the sector reform more broadly will require the necessary
degree o f public and political support. To this end, inthe course o f project preparations, the Government
launched a Public Information Policy, obtainedby surveys with a special focus on explaining the rationale
and benefits of the sector reforms, publicizing the progress inthe modification and construction o f roads,


                                                     27

and buildingpublic confidence in the key agencies involved. The Communications Unit of the GDDKiA
i s coordinating the Policy. The unit has recently been strengthened and i s in the process o f designing a
communication strategy in support o f the reform. A wide range of activities geared towards the national
andregional media as well as other stakeholders such as Parliamentarians, municipal authorities, transport
operators, NGOs, etc. In addition, the Policy i s trying to improve information flow and coordination
across the key agencies involved inthe road sector reform.

The above guidingprinciples should give confidence that an effective and efficient road network is one of
the country's highest priorities and that the Government is willing to go to great lengths to ensure it the
road sector meets those principles.

E. UPDATEDDRAFTMODERNIZATIONACTIONPLAN

Introduction. The following draft Modemization Action Plan (MAP) outline i s a revised version of the
February 2004 document aimed at implementing modernization measures at GDDKiA including
reorganization at central and regional levels and establishment o f a management information system to
further increaseefficiency ofGDDKiA.

Strategy for Reform. The GDDKiA Strategy for reform focuses on:

     1. Organization

             Modemization of GDDKiA's organization by focusing on the key result areas i s an important
             precondition in helping GDDKiA to carry out its obligations effectively. The new
             organization will center activities on key processes      -Planning and Production (Service
             Delivery).

             Strengthening i s needed inlong term planning and in developing medium-term planning and
             preparation o f annual programs to a continuous rolling process. This calls for better base data
             for planning.

             Landacquisition i s to be moved upfront to be a part o f the planningprocess.

             Inthe productionprocess, the constructiondesign willbe includedinto contracts. Secondly,
             area-wide contracts will be introduced for maintenance and the contract period i s to be
             extended to five years. This would require inclusion o f Voivodeship roads to maintenance
             contracts.

             In general the project follow-up shall be improved. This calls for more interactionbetween
             HQ and the regional offices (ROs) to secure implementation. At the same time, the
             independency o f ROs shall be increased but the uniformity and quality o f the planning,
             production and administrativeprocessesshall be maintained.

     2. Management System

        (0   A result orientedmanagement system will be introducedto GDDKiA.GDDKiAwill develop
             a clear mission statement and decide on long term development goals. The M o I will define
             annual performance goals for GDDKiA and will sign a performance agreement with the
             General Director o f GDDKiA. Through the performance agreement GDDKiA will receive
             more independency to operate, butbe more accountable to deliver.

        (ii)ROsrolewillbelikesubsidiariesinacompany.EachdirectoroftheRO,aswellasallthree
             directors o f the key processes,shall sign a performance agreement with the General Director.

                                                     28

           The GDDKiA shall decide on performance goals for its intemal management needs based on
           the goals statedby the MoI.

      (iii)As soonasthenewmanagementsystemisinplaceandorganizational unittasklists are
           available, job descriptions are neededfor managerial and other senior staff.

      (iv) A better management information system (MIS) will be implemented to cater GDDKiA
           management with operational information needs, result management information and to
           provide sufficient information to M o I and other partners. The system shall be developed
           gradually with initial focus onplanningand production.

   3. HumanResources Development

      (i)  In order to be able to manage its tasks GDDKiA will develop its most valuable resource          -
           competent staff. There is an urgent need to improve the current salary structure in order to
           retain current specialists and to recruit new competent ones. Currently the salary budget is
           about 2 percent o f the GDDKiA's tumover, which i s far bellow the 5-10 percent level o f
           many other Europeancountries.

      (ii)InordertobringaboutflexibilitytopaybettersalariestheGDDKiAwilloutsourcecurrent
           road maintenance emergency crews to the existing maintenance contracts. Such outsourcing
            will leavemore salary space for the remainingstaff.

      (iii)Asalarybonussystemisnotforeseenatthisstage,becauseofitscomplexityandthelimited
            possibilitiesit can offer inincreasing salaries.

   4. Training Needs

In general, the GDDKiA staff has high basic education and many of them already participate in
continuous training.

      (i)   As soon as the "result management system" with annual performance agreementsis adopted
            as the management system for GDDKiA, this shall be supported by sufficient training for all
            managerial staff. The training can be organized locally.

      (ii)GDDKiAisaroadmanagementorganization,contractingoutallroadoperations.Inorderto
            leam from other's experiences in countries with similar road management approach, the
            management o f GDDKiA may consider visiting the Nordic countries         - Finland, Norway and
            Sweden, as well as the Highways Agency inEngland.

      (iii)InmanagementofEUprograms,lessonswillbedrawnfromcountriesthathavemanaged
            well various types of EU programs. M o I and GDDKiA management may consider visiting
            Ireland, Spain or Portugal.

      5. Roles o fMinistryo f Infrastructureand the National RoadFund(KFD)

M o Ihas a key role inGDDKiA's development and increating cooperative circumstance inimproving the
Polish road transport system efficiency. M o I activity i s needed to enact regulation for speeding up
planning, land acquisition, environmental decisions and procurement processes and to keep the Special
Act inforce untilsufficient changes inrelevant permanent regulations are made.

    (i)    M o I needs to articulate clearly Polish road sector policies and strategic directions and define,
           basedon the policies, keyperformance indicators for GDDKiA.

                                                     29

   (ii)  It is in the role of MoIto revise the functional classification of the road system. To manage
         traffic in an effective way the GDDKiA should have a say on the Voivodeship road network,
         same as for improving road maintenance those road should be included in road maintenance
         contracts.

   (iii) A new assessment of applicability of PPP approach and Concessions inPoland for economic
         and administrative reasons will be carried-out. The envisaged magnitude o f road financing
         would allow cheaperroadmanagement under GDDKiA direct rule than PPPor Concessions.

   (iv)  Gradually all incoming road financing, currently from nine different sources, shall be centered
         through KFD to one single source towards GDDKiA. The KFD's role will be developed
         towards a banker's approach on GDDKiAs investments, with economic analysis on the
         viability of its investments. KFD should gradually finance all types o f road management
         expenditures. Also all IF1financing disbursements should go through KFD.

   6. ImplementationTimetable

The proposed immediate actions are as follows:

        GDDKiAwill decide onitsmission statement.

        Organization will be strengthened as proposed. Especially important i s to start with the unit for
        continuousrollingplanningand the unit for annual programs andproject monitoring.

        Improvement of the staff salary system will start.

         Ministry of Infrastructure will extend the Special Act until the Construction law, Land
        development law, and Environmental law are changed.

        M o I will establish a task force to prepare enabling regulations for planning, land acquisition,
        environmentaldecisions and procurementprocess.

                POLAND: Second RoadMaintenance andRehabilitation Project

Theproject includestwo components: (i)    GDDKiAroadmaintenance andrehabilitationprogram; and (ii)
implementation of GDDKiAMIS.The total cost estimate of the project, including contingencies amounts
to US$210.5 million, o f which the World Bank would contribute up to US$130.5 million, to be pooled
with the current equivalent US$67 million funds of the national budget devoted to the road expenditure
program in 2005, and with the first tranche of the EIB's Priority Road Infrastructure I1loan o f US$13
millionequivalent.


   1. ROADMAINTENANCEAND REHABILITATIONP R O G W(US$205.5 MILLION)
The road maintenance and rehabilitation program has been prepared by GDDKiA within the framework
of the budget 2005. Table 1 below details the content o f the road expenditure program which amounts to
PLN 6 billion (equivalent to U S 2 billion). The contribution of the national budget amounts to PLN 270
million (equivalent to US$90 million), i.e. 40 percent. The other sources of funds are providedby EC and
IFIs. The National budget funds allocated to road maintenance and rehabilitation are highlighted in the
table and amounts to PLN665 million (equivalent to US$221 million). Nearly 60 percent of this amount i s
to originate from the RM&R I1loan. As showed inthe table, the proceeds of the loan will be pooled with
the funds provided under the National StateBudgetto tackle the currentroadmaintenancebacklog.

For the period beyond 2005 the proposed program is expected to be well balanced between
maintenanceh-ehabilitation, strengthening and reconstruction o f existing roads together with new
construction o f motonvays and expressways. Its financing is contemplated from both domestic and
foreign sources as shown inthe table 2 below. The Government, as well as the transport and infrastructure
committee o f the Sejm are determined to move forward with the road program as soon as possible based
on the existing laws on public roads, financing o fpublic roads and the Toll Motonvays Act.

   2. GDDKIA M I S (US5 MILLION)
A specific riskidentifiedunderthe RM&Rproject was the lack ofa modemMIS withinthe organization,
which would integrate financial-accounting information with the contract data including planning and
physical measures. Therefore, the GDDKiA Modernization Action Plan included the design o f a modern
MIS. A part o f the task was completed in February, 2004 when the Strategy for a Comprehensive
Information Technology System was approved by the GDDKiA based on a study prepared by a local
consultant. GDDKiA with support from the local consultants is now developing the second phase o f the
task -areview o fthe IT infrastructure, a functional review, and an analysis o fprocesses and workflow.

The RM&R I1project will support the implementation of a modem management and information system
(MIS) within GDDKiA,that will properly integrate all datanecessaryto efficiently carry out GDDKiA's
activities (including technical, financial, human resources ands contract related data) and support all core
functions and decision-making processes of GDDKiA. The MIS Component will be completed in about
1.5 years and will include, but not be limited to: (i)  development o f an Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) consisting of integrated modules such as planning, controlling, finances, fixed assets management,
human resources management, and project management; (ii)         development o f a system workflow for the
management of documents and information; and (iii)         procurement o f any related system supporting
equipmenthardware and software.

1. Partnership Arrangements

The technical assistance provided by Bank staff and consultants under the ongoing RM&R project
continue to help shaping the Government program and institutional reforms in GDDKiA. These are fully
supported by the EBRD, EIB and the EU. The Polish Government and the World Bank have maintained
regular contact with representatives o f these agencies, to keep them informed and to consult them on
program preparation. The EIB inparticular is keen inpursuingthe reforms supported by the Bank inthe
road sector, in particular inincreasing Poland's capacity to plan and implement a large programs of high
priority road investments. The EIB supported project on Priority Road InfrastructureI1includes financing
from EIB (500 million), the World Bank (350 milli~n'~),        and the Government (200 million) for a
program through 2009 that would help eliminating the maintenance and rehabilitation backlog. The
ongoing assistance and advice provided by the Bank to the road fund, disbursements from that fund have
improved . The possibility of using the fund to float bonds and acquire other forms o f credit, as well as
channeling ElB and other donor funds through the road fund, are being explored jointly with the
Government.

2. InstitutionalArrangements

Overall Project Management. RM&R I1project will follow the same management and implementation
arrangements used under the RM& Rproject, which have provedto be workmg well. The M o Ithrough its
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be responsible for overall project management and coordination, in
close cooperation with the staff o f GDDKiA.The latter will be the final project beneficiary. GDDKiAhas
developed significant capacity in preparation and management o f bidding documents, in cash flow
calculations and payments, and with the advice o f their respective experts (engineer and financial analyst)
they have been found capable o f successfully implementing the proposed project. M o Iwould be directly
responsible for all procurement.

3. Project CoordinationandImplementationArrangements

Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance i s the signing authority of the loan agreement. Bank loan
funds will flow from the loan account to a Special Account inthe central bank managed by the Ministry
of Finance (MoF). MoF will transfer funds to the GDDKiA in accordance with the Program Operating
Regulations agreedbetween the Bank and MoF. An advance disbursement amounting to 50 percent of the
total loan will be made at effectiveness. Once GDDKiA provides the requiredinformation for the use of
these funds, MoF will draw down the appropriate amount from the Special Account, and then submit a
replenishment application to the Bank. Counterpart funds will not be provided separately, but will be
representedby the nationalbudget funds allocated to GDDKiA for the national roads network expenditure
program financially supported bythe Bank/MoF loan.

Ministry of Infrastructure. The M o Ihas the overall coordination and quality control o fthe project whose
sole beneficiary agency is the GDDKiA. The existing Project Coordination Unit (PCU) set up in MoI,
fully staffed with competent and dedicated civil servants, and presently successfully implementing the
RM&Rproject, will beresponsible for overall project management and coordination inclose cooperation
withthe Project Monitoring Team established inGDDKiA.




  Includingthe on-going RM&R loan, the proposedRM&R 11, and a new Roads V inFY06.

GDDKiA is the central government agency responsible for national roadmanagement, and is supervised
by the MoI. GDDKiA was created by Act of Parliament in March 2002 by the merger of the previous
General Directorate o f Public Roads and Agency for Construction and Operation o f Motorways. Of
the16,600km o f national interurban roads managed by GDDKiA, about 200km are expressways and
400km are motorways. There are 3517 bridges with a total length o f 145km. GDDKiA performs the
following management functions on the interurban network: (i)      construction o f new connections; (ii)
modernization o f existing connections; (iii)maintenance o f existingnational road network; and (iii)
                                                                                                   road
protectionagainst inappropriate use.

GDDKiA is managed by a General Director. Its headquarters is organized vertically, managed by 3
deputies of the General Director. Inaddition, the administration has an Office Manager in charge with
GDDKiA's effective functioning and the human resources policies. There are 10 Departments, each
headed by a Director. Departments consist o f Divisions managed by Heads o f Division, and of
independent posts.

There are 16 Regional Offices, each with a similar organization structure to Headquarters but with
regional differences, e.g. not all the Regional Offices construct motorways. The Regional Offices
(Divisions) are not separate legal entities. They are part of GDDKiA, managed by Directors who have
personal authorization from the General Director. In each Regional Office there are 5 to 15 Regional
Maintenance Units (RMUs) - 111 in total. Each RMU comes under a manager. The main task of the
RMUismaintenance ofthe roadnetwork.

GDDKiA shall be the Implementing Agency for the RoadMaintenance and RehabilitationProgram, and
MIS.

Financial Management Arrangements

Financial Management Assessment. The assessment was carried-out inFebruary 2004 by the Financial
Management Specialist, during preparation o f the RM&R project. The update o f financial management
assessment was performed during the project preparation in November 2004, and was finalized in
February 2005. The financial management arrangementso f the Project are found acceptable to the World
Bank.

Country Issues. The latest Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Poland issued by
the Bank in 1999 recommended inter alia: (i)    assigning higher priority to reform o f internal control and
internal.audit functions; and (ii)  modernizing public sector accounting and reporting functions. These
issues will be addressed through the introduction of a new Management Information System (MIS)
integrating financial accounting information with contract data, financed by the project.

InSeptember 2003 the World Bank initiated a new CFAA for Polandto provide updated information on
public sector financial accountability arrangements and help to develop a program for reforms and
capacity buildingto improve transparency and accountability with respect to the use o f public funds. The
draft report was consulted with Ministry o f Finance and Ministry of Economy. The report followed
internal World Bank CFAA guidelines and also used the international standards, codes and laws as
benchmark for Polish Public Financial Management since EC financial regulation are relevant to Poland.
The World Bank i s planning to hold a workshop with the aim o f coming to an agreement regarding the
action planpresentedinthe report and to move on with the implementation.

Strengths & Weaknesses. The strengths that provide a basis of reliance on the project financial
management system include the experience o f M o I and GDDKiA in implementing several roads projects
co-financed with international financing institutions like the World Bank and EB. The specific weakness
identified duringthe assessment relates to the lack of a modem Management Information System (MIS)
that would integrate financial-accounting information with the contract data including planning and
physical measures. To address this risk the repeater RM&R I1will therefore finance the implementation
of a modem MIS as one o fthem main areas inthe modernization and capacity buildingo f the GDDKiA.

Staffing. The project will utilize the existing staff inMoI. GDDKiA headquarters' financial staff will be
responsible for collection and consolidation o freports from its regional branches. The GDDKiA and M o I
staff have proven experience inthe existing roads program.

Accounting Policies and Procedures. The GDDKiA, M o I accounting books and records are maintained
on modified cash basis (Le. liabilities are recorded at the date of invoice acceptance). Each GDDKiA
branch and M o Iwill record transactions intheir accountingbooks and records inaccordance with normal
accounting procedures according to PolishAccounting Regulations applicable for budgetary units.

The M o I has documented the project's financial'management arrangements in the Operational Manual
developed under the RM& Rproject and updated for the repeater project. These describe project-specific
procedures, the roles and the responsibilities o f the various financial management staff, the coding
structure in the various organizations' charts o f accounts to identify project-specific transactions, the
agreed formats of the project's FMRs with the deadline for their preparation, and the project' auditing
arrangements.



                                                      40

Reporting and Monitoring. The GDDKiA will prepare standardbudget executionreports (so-called Rb28
reports) for the road maintenance and rehabilitation component inbreakdown by branches on a monthly
basis and submit these to the M o Iand Bank within 30 days o f the end of the month. The M o Iwill prepare
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) for the entire project on quarterly basis within 45 days o f the
month-end incorporating the information submitted by the GDDKiA as well as annual Project Financial
Statements. The FMRs will be used for project monitoring and supervision; the updated, simplified
formats were agreed upon duringthe technical discussions for loannegotiation.

Internal Audit departments in the GDDKiA and M o I are relatively new and were created in 2002 as
requiredby the Law on Public Finance. The work o f the internal auditors in2002 and 2003 relatedmainly
to training, preparation of their organizational structures, formulation o f audit procedures, and the
preparation o f audit plans. In 2004 the Internal Audit Department in HQand 16 branches o f GDDKiA
performed audit reviews in selected areas. In2005 the Internal Audit will continue to review other areas
accordingto the annual plan and follow up on the recommendations arisingfrom previous audits.

External Audit. Inits role as the Polish Supreme Audit Institution, the Najwyisza Izba Kontroli (NIK)
performs an annual audit of the state budget including the funds used by the M o I and GDDKIA. As the
project's funds will flow through the normal budgetary mechanisms, the project will effectively be
audited by NIK as part o f its annual audit o f the state budget. NIK recently issued three reports on road
construction, maintenance and management which included the activities o f the GDDKiA. In these
reports NIK identified anumber of issues primarilyrelating to contract management. Accordingly, certain
procedures have already been agreed with GDDKiA immediately to strengthen contract management and
a further review o f GDDKiA's contract management systems will be undertaken as part o f the
Modernization Action Plan.

The Audit o f the project financial statement will be performed annually both by an auditor and in
accordance with TOR acceptable to the World Bank. The audit shall be carried out in accordance with
INTOSAIAuditing Standardsor International Standards on Auditingand the project financial statements
together with the auditor's report will be submitted to the Bank within six months o f the end of the each
fiscal year. The TOR acceptable to the World Bank was attached to the minutes of negotiation. The short
list of auditors will be submitted to the World Bank prior to the end o f each fiscal year, and only those
acceptedby the World Bankshall be included inthe short list. NIK would be an auditor acceptable to the
World Bank.

Information Systems. GDDKiA uses various decentralized (not integrated) computerized financial
accounting systems at each o f its 16 branches. The branches send reports produced by these systems to
GDDKiA headquarters on a monthly basis in a format prescribed by budgetary regulations. GDDKiA
headquarters then consolidates these reports ina spreadsheet.

Supervision Plan. During project implementation, the World Bank will review the project's financial
management arrangements in two main ways: (i)review the project's quarterly financial management
reports, monthly budget expenditures reports (RB 28) and the annual audit report; (ii)   implementation of
the modernization plan o f the GDDKiA, and (iii)    duringthe World Bank's missions, review the project's
financial management and disbursement arrangements to ensure compliance with the World Bank's
requirements. A Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist will participate in the supervision
process.

DisbursementArrangements

Flow of Funds. There will be one Special Account for the project. The Special Account will be opened
by the MoF in the National Bank of Poland or a commercial bank acceptable to the World Bank. The

Loan funds will flow from the World Bank to the Special Account and be then converted into PLN and
pooled with other government funds inthe central budget account. The funds will then be made available
to the M o Iand GDDKiA inthe form o fbudget transfers. The GDDKiAwill report monthly to the M o Ion
its use of the hnds in accordance with normal budget reporting procedures. Advance disbursements
amounting to 95 percent of the total loan will be made at effectiveness (expected in April/May) and in
August 2005 to cover expensesprogrammedin road rehabilitation component by the GDDKiA for a 12-
month time period. The reconciliation o f expenditures will be carried out annually for the road
rehabilitation component, and quarterly for the MIS component. The application for payment to
reimburse retroactive expenditures paidprior the loan signingbut not earlier than January 1, 2005 shallbe
sent to the World Bank separately and will be reimbursed in the currency o f the expenditures. The other
applications with documented expenditures will be supported by Summary Statement o f Expenditures
(part of FMRs) showing types o f expenditures with applied disbursement percentages and Reconciliation
of Special Account. Full documentation inrespect of project expenditures will be kept by GDDKiA and
the MoI, and will be audited annually.

The first applications will be for: (i) payment to reimburse retroactive expenditures, ifany, up to EUR 10
million paid prior the loan signingbut not earlier than January 1, 2005, ifrequested by the Government*';
(ii) advancesattheeffectiveness(expectedinAprilMay2005)andinAugust2005,respectively,and
     two
will be determined on the basis o f expenses programmed in road rehabilitation component by the
GDDKiA for a 12-month time period on the basis of reasonable plans o f expenditures for the next 6
months as included inFMRs.

 World Bank Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement are sent from the M o F M o I to the World
Bank Loan Department only for reimbursement of expenditures financed previously by the Government
(including retroactive expenditures). The payment request i s prepared on Form 1903 and authorized as for
normal Withdrawal Applications.

acceptable to the World Bank. The loanfunds will be disbursed to Special Account and then through
budget account to Mol.

The first application will be in a form of payment to reimburse retroactive expenditures (see below for
details). The second and third application will be for advances (planned in May and August 2005),
which shouldbe sufficient to cover twelve months o fplanned expenditures estimated at EUR 96 million
for the road rehabilitation component. Such high amount o f advances i s justified by the project being
implemented within the Borrower's annual fiscal budget, and simplification o f the disbursement
procedures and transaction costs within the World Bank. The MoF/MoI will request advances for the
MIScomponent to cover expendituresrequiredundertherelatedcontracts.

pooled contracting o f works under contracts not exceeding equivalent 6 million. It may also include
procurement o f goods and services related to maintenance and rehabilitation. The MIS and PPP
Components shall be implemented in a traditional way, including contracts financed from outside the
pool. They will include consultants' contracts and ICB ICT contract (s).

National Procurement Environment: During the 1990s Poland introduced a number o f laws and
regulations to support the market economy system. Indeedpassage o f a 1994 Act on Public Procurement
with later amendments made Polanda pioneer incentral and Eastern Europe insetting up a sound public
procurement system. While procurement is the responsibility o f government agencies, an independent
Office o f Public Procurement supports them in this function and provides oversight for effective
implementation o f the Act on Public Procurement. The Law has been amended on several occasions
stipulating improvement o f the public procurement system. In the beginning o f 2004, to adjust to the
requirements o f the European law and the EU Directives, the procurement law was revised and the new
Public Procurement Law was adopted. Inorder to institute single procurement, the Bank has analyzed the
acceptability o f the legal framework and implementation in the context of the new law, and with few
exceptions, defined below, found them acceptable for procurement under the RM&R component.

Implementing Agency: The Government of Poland (GoP) shall be the Borrower. Generalna Dyrekcja
Drog KrajowychiAutostrad (GDDKiA) shall conduct procurement and implement contracts as follows:

GDDKiA shallbe the ImplementingAgency for the RoadMaintenance and RehabilitationProgram, MIS
and Promotion of PPP inthe Road Sector. GDDKiA is a central organ o f the state administration and i s a
budgetary unit. It has no legal status. It reports to the Ministry o f Infrastructure and acts based on the
Statute given by the Minister of Infrastructure. GDDKiA has the headquarters and sixteen branches, each
of them carries out its responsibilitieswithin the voivodship inwhich it i s located. There are also district
offices subordinate to the branches. The procurement responsibility is split between the branches and
district office in a way that procurement below 30,000 equivalent is responsibility of the district office
while the remainingprocurement is conducted by the branches.

GDDKiA implemented parts of the Roads I1and RM&R Projects and developed significant capacity in
conducting procurement in accordance with the Bank's rules. In addition, all Project implementing
entities are well experienced in conducting procurement in accordance with the national Public
Procurement Law.




                                                    44

The Ministry o f Infrastructure shall be responsible for supervising the entire Project implementation in
accordancewith the provisions of the Loan Agreement.

PROCUREMENT RESPONSIBILITY: While the Ministry of Infrastructure shall be responsible for
supervising the entire Project implementation in accordance with the provisions o f the Loan Agreement,
GDDKiA shallbe responsible for procurement underthe Project.

RM&R Component: This component shall include procurement o f works, estimated not to exceed
equivalent 6 million, which shall be conducted through NCB defined below. Larger contracts shall be
procured through ICB following the Bank's rules stipulated in the Guidelines. It may also include

may be procured underNCB defined below, procurement o f services is subject to use o f the Bank's rules
in accordance with the Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants. Procurement of
contracts for works estimated to cost less than eq. 6 million, and goods estimated to cost less than
500,000 may be conducted by GDDKiA branches which will delegate their responsibility for
procurement up to eq. 30,000 per contract to their district offices. Procurement o f larger contracts as
well as the contracts for services, if occur, will be conducted by GDDKiA headquarters, through the
Departments and staff who developed their experience in the Bank's procurement during implementation
o f Roads I1and the RM&R projects.

M I S and PPP Components: GDDKiA headquarters shall be responsible for selection o f consultants for
implementationo f these components.

 up to 500,000 equivalent: NCB. The Implementing Agency may follow the Polish Public Procurement
 Law dated January 29,2004 permittingopen tendering, with the following exceptions:

             0      The term "Best (the most advantageous) offer" shall be understood as the lowest evaluated
                    bid selected following evaluation with use of quantifiable factors expressed in terms of
                    money.

             0      Moreover, no merit points system shall be used to evaluate bids.

on the review o f the justification providedby the GDDKiA letter dated 10-Feb-2005 the Bank will waive
eligibility restrictions applicable to Regional Road Laboratories (which, as GDDKiA subsidiaries, would
normally be ineligible to receive financing under the project in view o f paragraph 1.9 (c) of the
Consultants Guidelines), and allow for the engagement o f these laboratories to provide testing services in
the conduct ofthe roadway maintenance and rehabilitation work.

                POLAND: SecondRoad Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project


A. Framework

The project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy o fNovember 13,2002, (paragraphs
18,20,35,40 and 43), which concentrateson the removal o f infrastructure bottlenecks, on creation o f the
better condition for private sector participation ininfrastructure, and on infrastructuremodernization, as a
core part o f the strategy for successful EU integration and on economic development and improved
quality of life. Roads as well as motonvay sector policy in Poland i s set by Ministry o f Infrastructure
(MoI).

The project is based on Government's 2004-2005 Road Expenditure Program. It would be implemented
during 2005-2007 through GDDKiA. The main lesson learned from the on-going projects is the
importance o f keeping the objectives and composition o f the project simple so as not to exceed the
absorptive capacity o f GDDKiA and M o I staff; this has been taken into account in the proposed project
design which remains similar to the on going Roads I1project.

The Government has made substantial progress inadoptingmarket-based transport policies since the start
o f the economic transformation in 1990, and there are no major policy distortions that will affect project
implementation. The project will continue policy initiatives begun with technical assistance and studies
carried out under the on-going projects in the areas o f improving road maintenance, road safety, and the
system o f road user charges. The project i s expected to have a further impact in each o f these areas. The
project is also expected to encourage further privatization o froad contracting, maintenance, and planning,

The project would facilitate the activities of virtually every sector of the economy, so that benefits are
likely to be highlydispersed, as i s the case with most transport projects. The environmental impact o f the
project would also be positive (reduction of vehicle emissions, noise and reduction o f accidents through
improved national road network). GDDKiA will monitor the impact o f the project both, during
implementation with the assistance of the PMU, and thereafter, through regular traffic counts on project
roads, GDDKiA reports on road maintenance activities, and the collection o f road accident statistics by
the Traffic Police.

B. Cost-BenefitAnalysis

All of the national road sections under consideration for the present project have a classification
according to SOSN technical condition o f pavement "D". The assumption o f this criterion will assure the
proper selection o f contracts. Every road maintenance andor rehabilitation contract would guarantee a
minimal economic rate o f return (ERR) 12 percent. A summarized economic analysis o f some typical
maintenancehehabilitation works contracts recently carried out i s given below.

The project would also provide other benefits that are difficult to quantify, such as improving the
organization and funding mechanism o f road maintenance through the new National Road Fund,
promotion o f privatization through competitive procurement, and introduction o f new businesslike
approach into activities o froad administrations.

GDDKiAcarriedout the cost andbenefit analyses and clearly hasthe capacity to do thejob satisfactorily.
Every (civil works contract) economic study reviewed and verified by the appraisal mission showed
significant precision and detail. Costs and benefits were measured net o f taxes. Cost estimates included



                                                      51

physical (10 percent) and price (5 percent) contingencies. Current traffic levels were estimated based on
counts carried out by GDDKiA. Poland's increasingly high vehicle ownership rate, current high traffic
growth rate (about 5 percent per annum) and prospects for the future were provided by MoI. Traffic on
the project roads is expected to grow rapidly through 2006, when vehicle ownership would reach the
current level of EU countries. Cost savings per km on road rehabilitatiodmodemization are estimated to
US$0.05 per km (10 percent o f present vehicle operating cost) for the average light vehicle and US$0.20
per km(15 percent o f present vehicle operating cost) for the average heavy vehicle.

                  Executive Summary ofthe Comparative Study betweenPolish and
                         World Bank Guidelineson Environmental Assessment

The report provides detailed information about the Polish EA legal framework as well as insightinto the
current practice which may be used as reference for further analysis talung into account the WB actual
experience and practice insupporting specific types ofprojects inPoland.

The Polish E A legalframework comprises the Environmental Protection Law, the relevant Regulation
of the Council of Ministers, and some otherparts of legislation

The Polish EA Legal Framework is provided for mainly by the Environmental Protection Law and the
relevant Regulation o f the Council o f Ministers, however some aspects of EA are regulated also in other
parts of legislation. There are two different EA procedures: Strategic Environmental Assessment
applicable to plans, programs and policies both general and sectoral and Environmental Impact
Assessment applicable to specific development projects. The development projects subject to EIA fall in
either of two categories: Group 1, which always require EIA report or Group 2 which may require EIA
report.

All plans, programs, policies or projects which are subject to SEA or EIA are also subject to public
participation procedure. Draft documents including EA reports are made available to the public for
comments for the period o f 21 days. The submitted comments and recommendations have to be
considered by the relevant authority, who has to refer to them in the final documents, inform andjustify
how they have been addressed.

The institutional set-up o f EA i s built on two pillars: on o f them i s the competent authority who i s
responsible for the overall EA process from start to end and for taking the decision (i.e. i s the one who
would issue a development consent for a given type o f project, or adopt a given pladprogramme/policy),
and on the other one i s the consultingauthorities, who have to be consulted by the competent authority
duringthe EA process at screening and scoping stages and who should agree on conditions for issuinga
development consent at a decision makmg stage.

TheEA system is decentralized

Because decision       making,    involving authorization of particular projects or           adoption o f
plans/programs/policies i s decentralized, so is the EA system. Therefore, depending on a givenproject or
plan/program/policy and a type o f development consent being a subject to EA procedure, the competent
authority i s usually on municipal or county level; while the consulting authority is on county, voivodship
or national level.

ThePolish EA legalframework and the WorldBank safeguards considerablyoverlap


The review carriedout for the purpose o f this report demonstrates a considerable overlap o f the PolishEA
legal framework on the one hand and the World Bank procedures and policies on the other hand,
revealing at the same time certain differences inapproach and measurestaken.
    1. Both the Polish system and World Bank use different categories to qualify projects depending
         onthe extent o f their environmentalimpact.




                                                     53

        0   Polish system defines two categories: Group 1, always requiring EM, including projects
            which may have significant impact on the environment because of being large scale or in
            spite of being small scale; and Group 2, which may require EIA, including projects of
            smaller scale and whose impact depends also on the local condition o f the environment;
            Plans/programs/policiesof national or regional level which are provided for by law, always
            requiringSEA, unlessscreenednegatively.
        0   World Bank Category A, requiringfull EA, including mainly large scale developments,
            Category B - requiring EA, but with scope corresponding to the limited environmental
            impact o f the project, including mainly "small scale" developments, and Category C where
            no EA i s required.There isno separate category for programs.

   2. Inthe World Bankprocedurethe scope and requirements of EA dependon the project category.
        Inthe Polishsystem the general scope andrequirements of EIA are uniformfor all projects that
        are qualified as requiring EIA reports, i.e., all projects o f Group 1and some projects o f Group 2
        (in case o f the latter the need of an EL4 report is decided on case-by-case basis during the
        screening phase o f EM).WB program-type o f projects would be subject to SEA, however, only if
        they were of regional or national level and provided by law. In any case, though their
        "subprojects", i.e. specific investment projects would be subject to EIA procedure.

   3. The Polish requirements for the content of EA report are in all cases similar to those for the
        content for EA report of WB Category A projects. However there are some types of information
        required by WB which do not have equivalent provisions in the Polish system, though in some
        cases are partially covered: Capacity Development and Training, Implementation and Costs
        Estimates (related to Environmental Management Plan), specific requirements related to Pest
        Management Plan, description of policy, legal and administrative framework, social aspects,
        transboundary and global aspects.

    4. Public participation i s initiated at a later stage under the Polish procedure, as the initial
        consultation i s not required.

    5. Quality control is provided for in the Polish system by obligatory involvement of consulting
        authorities, public participationand EACommissions.

    6. Post-project monitoringi snot a mandatory requirement, however mightrelevant obligations may
        be included inthe development consent.

    7. The minorityrelated criteria do not have an equivalent inthe Polish system.

    8. The WB policies related to natural habitats are sufficiently reflected in the Polish legal
        framework.

Insight into the current EApractice in Poland: there is both know-how and manpower on national and
regional level which allowsfor a thorough quality review while institutional capacity at municipal and
county level requiressome strengthening

Inorder to get aninsightinto the quality ofactual EApracticeinPolandashortresearchwas carriedout
by means of a survey targeting a limitedgroup of relevant PAA representatives at all levels involved in
EA.The total of 19interviewswere heldwith 7municipalities (out of2489), 5 counties tout ofsome 373),
5 regions (out of 16) and with 2 Ministry of Environment officials. They answered 8 questions related to
the number o f EA proceedings handled with regards to different categories o f projects and to
plans/policies/programs, duration of the proceedings, number o f objections to EA reports, number of
reports referred to EA Commissions, number o f proceedings which involved comments from the public,


                                                      54

any additional requirements (e.g. o f financing institutions) taken into account, major problems
encountered inthe daily practice.

The sample taken was too limitedto be considered as representative for county and municipal levels, yet
itprovided an indicationofactual trends.

The survey revealed that on national and regonal level there is both know-how and manpower which
allows for a thorough quality review. Inthe case of major developments requiring mandatory EIA where
opinion of regional (voivodship) authorities has to be obtained it is possible to judge quality control as
adequateand reliable.

At the same time decentralization of decision-makingresultedingreat shift ofpowers andresponsibilities
to municipal (gmina) and county (poviat) levels. The bigger burden has not always been matched with
increased capacity, especially sufficiently qualified staff i s often laclung. The gap i s to some extent
matched by the involvement of consulting authorities at the screening and scoping and EA report review
stages. Nonetheless it must be admitted that with regards to developments for which the need o f EIA
report i s decided at the screening stage the practice is relatively weaker, as such developments are usually
handledby municipalities andcounties.

Public participation practice has a lot o f potential for improvement and currently very few actors o f the
EAprocedure appreciate fully the opportunities for quality control itmay provide.

Poland has a special legalframework for siting and development of national roads and roads sited in
cities having county (poviat) status, which was introduced to simplifi project developmentprocess in
the roads sector. Although itprovides lower level of environmental protection and public participation
compared to general procedure, it is generally compliant with the WB E A procedures and policies.
However, as it was adopted only in March 2003 it is too early make a judgment about its practical
impacts.

The report contains a Supplement focusing particularly on EA in the roads sector. It explains the special
EA procedure as provided for by the Special Road Procedure Act adopted in March 2003 and gives a
short review of current practice illustrated with a few recent cases. Although the special EA procedure
imposes certain limitations on public participation compared to general regulations, yet it leaves room for
the public involvement in EA proceedings, especially at the stage o f land use plans and policies
development and retains the requirement to provide the public with access to information. The provisions
relatedto compulsory land acquisition secure the rights o f the owners to extent whichremains well within
the standards appropriate for a democratic country ruledby law. However, the actual effect o f the Act on
the practice will be knownonly many months later.
