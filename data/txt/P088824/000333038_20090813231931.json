were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            mixing quick-disbursing operations with capacity building\n            risks disappointment. It was logical for the Bank to offer\n            relatively large, quick-disbursing support to a part of the\n            infrastructure that is perennially a poor cousin:\n            maintenance and rehabilitation because the new economy of\n            the enlarged European Union (EU) is very much reliant on\n            intra-EU trade and much of that trade is road-based; and\n            because mobility is a fairly high priority among consumption\n            goals in new middle income countries. However, institutional\n            change is never rapid, even in a literate, educated country,\n            especially during a period of political instability. It may\n            be tempting to the fast-disbursing elements of a project\n            will generate leverage to induce institutional change, but\n            success is far from assured. Since the first of these loans,\n            the Bank has rightly increased emphasis on results as the\n            central criterion for evaluating success and hence for\n            orienting management attention - 'what gets measured\n            gets managed' - both in the Bank and in the\n            borrower's administration. These operations, which\n            embody that policy, suggest that the key performance\n            indicators should become an integral part of the loan\n            agreement, rather than a supplementary letter which is not\n            (clearly) in the public domain, so that everyone gives them\n            more prominence in design and implementation. At the same\n            time, attention needs to be paid to ensuring consistency and\n            clarity in the definition of the indicators."}, "docdt": "2009-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
