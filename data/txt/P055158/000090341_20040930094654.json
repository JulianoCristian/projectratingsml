The lessons learned indicate that a\n            realistic assessment of the implementation capacity of the\n            Borrower to implement project activities and to use\n            Bank's procurement and financial reporting guidelines\n            would allow for a proper design of initial phases of project\n            implementation and realistic schedule. There was no\n            experience or practice in the Ministry of Education and\n            Science (MES) to share information or organize coordination\n            meetings. Every change in the composition of the members of\n            the teams involved in Project implementation causes\n            irrecoverable delays in project implementation. For many\n            civil servants assigned to implementation teams, work on\n            project execution is an additional external responsibility\n            not associated with their everyday tasks. Information\n            gathering, analysis and dissemination is essential not only\n            for the successful implementation of the project, but also\n            for the sustainability of an overall reform. It is\n            especially vital to get the participation of stakeholders in\n            introducing reform and modernization programs in countries\n            like Bulgaria, and in sectors such as education. Social and\n            organizational assessments are especially helpful in\n            understanding the issues, as there is a clear link between\n            the reluctance to reform the education system and the\n            reluctance to change governance structures of the education\n            system. In order for policy makers to track the success of a\n            reform project they need to be able to monitor the results\n            and the impact of the intervention. Programs designed to\n            support policy reforms are jeopardized by government change.\n            In retrospect, while the preparation team gave the\n            project's design a moderate rating for political risks,\n            it did not set out a clear strategy for mitigating such risks."}, "docdt": "2004-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
