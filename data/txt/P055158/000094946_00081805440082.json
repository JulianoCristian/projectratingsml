The components will:\n            1) improve the quality of teaching, and learning in general\n            education, through the introduction of new standards-based\n            curriculum, and the creation of student assessments, and\n            evaluation systems instruments. The development of a\n            demand-driven system for in-service teacher training will be\n            promoted to improve national capacity; 2) improve resource\n            management in general education, by extending the Delegated\n            Budget Program by the year 2009, by strengthening the\n            Ministry of Education and Science (MES) capacity to assist\n            municipalities in optimizing schools, and, by establishing a\n            new education management information system, to provide\n            policymakers with information on the state, and progress of\n            the education system; 3) improve resource allocation to\n            higher education institutions, through a reform process, and\n            through the establishment of a national education management\n            information systems; 4) establish a student loan program,\n            and redesign the current stipend system; 5) establish a\n            competitive teaching, and management system for higher\n            education, to improve the quality of the country's\n            higher education institutions, including their internal\n            management structures; and, 6) strengthen MES capacity\n            regarding project management, and communication, to better\n            coordinate the implementation of higher education sub-components."}, "docdt": "2000-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
