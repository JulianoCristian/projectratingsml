SU1MARY
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Sierra
Leone Electricity Corporation consisting of the expansion of the electricity
system in the capital city of Freetown and in two large towns in the Provinces.
The project is estimated to cost a total of US$4.8 million and the proposed
Bank loan would amount to US$3.9 million equivalent. The project represents
a portion of the overall expansion program of the Corporation, the total
cost of which is estimated at US$7.5 million in the period April 1968 -
March 1971, during which the project would be constructed.
ii.       The Corporation which would be the borrower, is an autonomous
statutory corporation of the Government of Sierra Leone. A previous Loan
No. 388-SL, for US$3.8 million equivalent was made in 1964 for expansion
of electric facilities in Freetown. Experience with this loan has been
satisfactory.
iii.      The project is technically sound, the estimated costs are
reasonable and the arrangements for procurement and construction are
satisfactory. The facilities to be provided are necessary to enable the
Corporation to meet the expected demands for power.
iv.       The Corporation would be a suitable borrower. Since its inception
in 1964 it has operated the electricity system efficiently, and has made
considerable progress in developing its organization, staff, management and
accounting.
v.        Although the leone was devalued in November 1967 by 14.3% the
expected return on estimated revalued net assets would average about 9%,
which exceeds the requirement of the rate covenant. The reduction in
tariffs, being considered before devaluation would no longer be justified.
The continued strong financial position of the Corporation would enable it
to waive the Government subvention for the provincial operating losses up
to 1969, initiate earlier interest payments on the 'A' loan stock, and
provide both the local currency for the project and the cost of other
capital expenditure during the construction period.
vi.       The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$3.9 million
for a period of 20 years, including a grace period of 3½ years.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Sierra Leone Electricity Corporation (SLEC) has asked the
Bank for a loan of US$3.9 million equivalent to cover the foreign exchange costs
of a project with a total cost of US$4.8 million equivalent. The project
would form part of the SLEC development program over the period April 1968 -
March 1971 which is estimated to cost a total of US$7.5 million equivalent.
1.02      The project consists of the installation of the third 6.6 MW
diesel-electric generator in the King Tom power station and expansion of
the distribution system in Freetown the capital city, and the installation
of diesel-electric generators and expansion of the distribution system in
the provincial towns of Kenema and Koidu.
1.03      This would be the second loan to SLEC.  The first, No. 388-SL,
was made in August 1964 for US$3.8 million equivalent for the construction
of the King Tom power station with two 6.6 MW units, and expansion of the
distribution system in Freetown. The project has been completed and is
operating satisfactorily.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission composed
of Messrs D. King and S.S. Scales which visited Sierra Leone in September
1967.
2. THE BORRWIER
2.01      The borrower would be the SLEC an autonomous Government corporation
established in May 1964. The Corporation replaced the Electricity Division
of the Ministry of Works. It is headed by a Board of Directors appointed
by the Minister of Works. The present Board is representative of Government
and business. Its Chairman, who was recently appointed, is a person of
considerable experience in public service.
2.02      The chief executive officer of the Corporation is the General
Manager, appointed by the Board and an ex-officio member of it. The remain-
ing principal officers are the Chief Engineer, Financial Comptroller,
Secretary and Commercial Engineer. The present General Manager has
competently filled the position since the inception of the Corporation.
The other principal positions are adequately filled. Under the provisions
of Loan 388-SL the appointment of a General Manager must be acceptable to
the Bank, and the Bank must be consulted prior to changes or appointments
to the positions of Financial Comptroller and Commercial Engineer. These
provisions would be repeated in the new loan agreement.
2.03      The management and staff of the SIEC have developed reasonably
well since the formation of the Corporation, and in general the utility
is operated efficiently. Machine accounting and centralized billing have
been successfully introduced. In the engineering sphere the SLEC continues
to depend upon its consultants, particularly with respect to future planning
and for technical advice. This arrangement has worked well. Loan 388-SL
provides that the Corporation must employ consultants for this purpose and
this provision would be repeated in the new loan agreement.



-2-
2.o4      The Corporation is divided into 8 main departments including
Finance, Internal Audit, Purchasing and Commercial Departments with
respect to administrative-financial functions; and Power Stations,
Distribution, Provincial Stations and Installations, with respect to
operational functions, The total number of employees is 1,200 including
a number of non-permanent construction employees; half are located in the
Freetown stations and headquarters and the remainder in the Provinces.
Given the widespread nature of the Corporation's operations the number of
employees is reasonable.
2.05      The headquarters' space in Freetown is not satisfactory and the
staff is dispersed over several locations, some of which are unsuitable.
The Corporation is planning to build a new headquarters in Freetown as it
is considered essential to improve the efficiency of the headquarters
establishment, including the billing, metering and accounting functions.
3. THE FACILITIES OF THE SIEC
3.01      The Corporation supplies electricity service in Freetown and in
18 provincial towns as indicated in Annex 1 and on the attached map. While
the SLEC is the main supplier of electricity service to the public, in the
provinces there are some privately owned generating installations which
supply mining operations.
3.02      The bulk of the Corporation's assets, sales and revenues are in
Freetown where in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1967 maximum demand
was 10,800 kw and sales 44.4 million kwh. The generating capacity in
Freetown totals 23.7 Mg and there is approximately 25,000 kva of distribu-
tion transformer capacity.
3.03      Under the first Bank loan the King Tom power station was
constructed with an installation of two 6.6 MW disel electric generators
and space for a third. The distribution system was expanded. The primary
distribution system is still mainly served by a 3.3 kv underground cable
network about 20 years old, largely obsolete and in poor repair. Work
has started on the conversion of this system to a modern 11 kv network.
Secondary distribution is 400/230 volt overhead.  In 1967 the 2.4 MN Guma
Valley hydroelectric station (Annex 7) commenced operation.
3.04      The installed capacity operated by the SLEC in the Provinces is
about 7,000 kw. Most of the SLEC's provincial systems, which operate as
isolated facilities, are rather primitive, employing old generating sets
of small size, supplying minimal distribution facilities.  Many of the
installations were originally built to provide essential services for
government administrative centers and government still uses a substantial
portion of the power generated. Most of them have operated at a loss due
to the light density of the load, the inefficient facilities, and the high
cost of road transported fuel. In the circumstances, and given the higher
priority assigned by the Government to other investments, expansion of
provincial facilities has been limited. However, several of the Provincial
towns have now become important from the standpoint of size and/or
commercial activity. To improve conditions in Bo, which is one of the
large towns, the Corporation has installed a new diesel power station and
improved the distribution system. The two other largest towns, Kenema and
Koidu, each with a population of about 25,000 are still supplied by
obsolete equipm-cn wIth limited generating capacity.

4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The project proposed for Bank financing represents a portion
of the overall expansion program of the SLEC during the construction
period (paragraph 4.11). It consists of the installation of a 6.6 MWJ
diesel-electric generator at the King Tom power station and the
expansion of the distribution system in Freetown; the installation of
3-1,000 kw diesel-electric generators and the expansion of the distribu-
tion system in the town of Kenema and the installation of 2 - 1,000 kw
diesel-electric generators and the expansion of the distribution system
in the town of Koidu.
King Tom Power Station
4.02      The installation of the 6.6 Ml diesel electric generating unit
at the King Tom power station would complete the station which was con-
structed under Loan 388-SL. The work would comprise foundation, generator
and auxiliary facilities only, since the building was originally completed
to house three generators. A marine type diesel-electric unit operating
at low speed, burning residual or crude oil as fuel, would be installed.
Expansion of Freetown Distribution System
4.o3      The remaining obsolete 3.3 kv underground system would be replaced
by an 11 kv underground cable system continuing the program already initi-
ated.  The existing 3,300/400 volt substations would be rebuilt for
11,000/400 volt operation and provided with new transformers and switch-
gear. Eight new substations would be constructed. Approximately 10,000
kva of new distribution transformer capacity would be installed together
with 35,000 yards of 11 kv underground circuit.
4.04      The 400/230 volt secondary distribution system would be reinforced
in a limited area, by replacing about 5 miles of overhead circuit conductor
by larger conductor. In one highly congested area, the overhead system would
be replaced by underground cable. In addition to the work covered by the
proposed Bank loan the Corporation plans further work utilizing its own
funds (paragraph 4.11)
Kenema
4.05      A new power station would be constructed incorporating 3 - 1,000 kw
medium speed diesel-electric sets generating power at 11 kv. Improvement
and expansion of the distribution system would include the construction of
about 2 miles of 11 kv circuit and a 1,000 kva substation to supply power
to the furniture factory (paragraph 6.06), the conversion of 3 miles of
3.3 kv overhead circuit to 11 kv operation, the installation of 1,500 kva
of 11,000/415 volt distribution transformers, and the construction of an
11 kv overhead line and substation to supply two small towns in the area.



-4 -
Koidu
4.o6      The generating station at Koidu would be equipped with 2 - 1,000 kw
11 kv diesel-electric generators identical to those at Kenema. Distribution
facilities would comprise 3 - 11 kv substations equipped with 300 kva
transformers, new pole-mounted 50 kva transformers, a total of 8 miles of
U kv and secondary distribution circuit, and 400 service connections. In
addition, the 11 kv overhead system would be extended three miles to a
small town.
Estimated Cost
4.07      The estimated cost of the project is given in Annex 2, and is
summarized below:
ESTIMATED COST OF PROJEcr
(Thousands of US$ equivalent)
Foreign     Local
Currency    Currency     Total
King Tom Power Station                  1,347          70       1,417
Freetown Distribution                     785         400       1,185
Kenema System                             809         194       1,003
Koidu System                              487         143         630
Engineering and Supervision               197          20         217
Contingencies                             275          73         348
Total                         3.900         900       4,800
The total cost of the project would be US$4.8 million equivalent.  The
proposed Bank loan of US$3.9 million would cover the foreign exchange cost
which represents 81% of the cost of the project. This high percentage is
due to the fact that all equipment and many materials must be imported and
because certain works were carried out under the previous loan. As the
Corporation would be undertaking additional work (paragraph 4.11), the loan
would represent about 52% of the total construction expenditures during the
period. The proceeds of the loan would not be used to reimburse expenditures
on equipment made prior to the loan.
4.08      The cost estimate was prepared by the Corporation's consultants.
It is based in part on actual costs of the King Tom station and the
distribution facilities provided under Loan 388-SL and is reasonable. A
contingency allowance of 7.5% is included in the foreign exchange estimate
and of 9.5% in the local cost estimate. These should be adequate to meet
possible increases in the costs of equipment as well as contingencies
during construction. Tn the event the entire amount of the loan is not
needed to complete the project, consideration would be given to expending
the balance on additional facilities for the distribution system secondary
network.



- 5 -
Engineering Procurement and Construction
4.09      The project was planned and designed by the Corporation's
consulting engineers, Messrs. Preece, Cardew and Rider of London, who
would also supervise construction. While major construction would be
carried out by contractors selected on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding, some of the construction, not financed by loan funds,
would be carried out by the Corporation and/or Freetown contractors for
reasons of scale and convenience. To ensure that these arrangements are
satisfactory, assurances have been received that orders for equipment
financed by the loan would not be placed until contracts or arrangements
for construction, satisfactory to the Bank, have been made.
4.10      Procurement would be on the basis of international competitive
bidding except in the case of certain minor items for which such bidding
would be impractical. It is expected that orders for the major equipment
and construction contracts would be placed in 1968. The King Tom generator
would be erected during 1969/70 and placed in service in mid-1970. The
Freetown distribution system expansion would be completed in 1970/71 as
would be the programs at Kenema and Koidu.
Other Capital Expenditures
4.11      During the period of construction of the Bank financed project,
the Corporation plans additional expenditure of US$2.7 million equivalent
including US$360,000 for distribution systems for the new housing develop-
ment at Kissy and Lumley in Freetown, US$600,000 to improve the secondary
distribution systems in a considerable area of Freetown, about US$1.5 mil-
lion to construct and furnish the new headquarters, and US$240,000 to
commence further extensions at King Tom.
5. FUTURE EXPANSION
5.01      It is expected that by 1973 the Freetown area will be in need
of additional generating capacity. There is a hydroelectric site with
a potential of 75 MW some 100 miles from Freetown, which the Corporation
considers might be a possibility for development when the load demand is
sufficiently large. Meanwhile, it plans another diesel electric station
or alternatively a conventional thermal power station as the next facility
in Freetown. The Statement of Sources and Application of Funds, Annex 7,
contains in fiscal years 1971 and 1972 an allowance for the construction
of a 30 MW thermal station on the site of the King Tom power station. They
represent only a portion of the cost as it would take two additional years
to complete the station. The decision whether to build a diesel or a
thermal station will depend in part on the experience with load growth.
5.02      Expansion of the primary distribution system in Freetown will be
continued together with completion of the work of renovating and extending
the existing secondary distribution system.



-6-
5.03      The future expansion program in the Provinces will depend on
Government policy, the availability of funds to the Government and the
Corporation, and experience with load growth. The existing Loan 388-SL
provides that before undertaking any substantial expansion of provincial
facilities the Government and Corporation will first obtain the comments
of the Bank. It is further stipulated that the Government will provide
the funds for such capital expansion. While the construction of the
proposed Provincial facilities in the present case is reasonable, the
provisions of the existing loan agreements with regard to any future provin-
cial expansion are being maintained, so that the Bank could exercise a re-
straining influence should the Government contemplate an expansion of such
facilities which did not appear warranted.
6. JUSTIFICATION OF PROJECT
6.01      Annex 3 contains the statistics of actual energy sales in Freetown
and the Provinces, and forecasts for the 5 year period ending in 1972. The
Corporation achieved an average increase of sales during the last 4 years of
about 12.0% annually.
6.02      The Corporation's consultants have made a detailed load survey in
Freetown, which has a population of about 200,000, to enable a forecast of
future demand to be prepared. The survey included estimates of demand
arising from new office and hospital buildings, and the establishment of
new industries. The latter includes a shoe factory, tyre plant, flour mill
and hotel which have been recently completed and an oil refinery, deep water
quay and quarry now under construction, the combined effect of which will be
to increase the rate of growth above its recent level. On the basis of
estimated industrial and comirercial load together with the expected increase
in domestic load, which represents a little over one third of the total, the
demand is forecast to increase at an annual rate of about 14.0% during the
5 year period, 1968-72. The estimate is reasonable.
6.03      Annex 4 shows the actual and estimated peak demand in Freetown,
the present and prospective total generator capacity, and the firm genera-
ting capacity. This latter is based on providing for the outage of one of
the 6.6 MW generators at the King Tom power station for maintenance and
repairs. The peak demand in fiscal year 1967 was 10.8 MW and is forecast
to increase to 17.1 MW, at a plant factor of 63%, by 1971, when the project
is completed. Total capacity at that time would amount to 29.8 MW and firm
capacity would amount to 23.2 N4.
6.o4      The installation of the third King Tom unit, completing the plant,
is the logical and most economic method of providing the additional capacity
required since the plant was built to accommodate it (paragraph 4.02) and it
would supply the load growth until at least 1973. The distribution facilities
which would be provided are required for normal distribution system expansion
and the replacement of obsolescent facilities. Their provision would result
in a further reduction in electricity losses as noted in paragraph 6.11.



-7-
6.05      In the Provinces load growth has generally been limited by the
inadequate capacity of the generation and distribution facilities. In both
Kenema and Koidu there are large areas without electricity supply. Because
of their increasing size and importance the Government and Corporation have
decided to provide modern electricity systems to supply those unable to
obtain power at present, to foster the development of light industry, and
to generally make an adequate supply of electricity available for the future
growth of the towns. With the provision of more efficient facilities and
the sales increases anticipated, it is expected that the two systems would
become financially profitable within two or three years of completion of the
extensions.
6.o6      In the Kenema area, which has a population of about 25,000 the
provision of new facilities would make power available to a considerable
number of potential consumers, a situation which the consultants have taken
into consideration when preparing load forecasts. In addition, in Kenema,
a furniture company which obtains about half its power requirements from the
Corporation, employing steam engine driven equipment for the remainder, would
be converted to electric power when adequa-te supply is available.  The company
also proposes to change from one shift to two shift operation, which would
increase the demand on the Corporation, and to construct a chip-board factory,
financing for which has been discussed with the International Finance Corpora-
tion. The chip-board factory would have a demand of about 350 kw and althoughk
this has not been included in the present load estimates, since plans are stil3
indefinite, it could be supplied from the proposed new SIEC facilities.
6.07      In the fiscal year 1967 the demand at Kenema was 540 kw and energy
sales amounted to 1.8 million kwh. With the provision of the facilities
planned, it is estimated that in 1971 the demand would be 1,300 kw with an
energy consumption of 4.3 million kwh. The load factor would be about 40%,
reflecting the predominantly domestic character of the load.
6.08      The town of Koidu, from which the labor force for Sierra Leone's
major diamond mining fields is drawn, has a population of about 25,000. The
use of power is severely limited by present facilities and for this reason
less than 20% of the population has electric service and the average energy
use per consumer is substantially less than at Kenema, despite the higher
incomes generally prevalent in Koidu. The demand in fiscal year 1967
increased very little over that of the previous year because of lack of
generating capacity. The distribution system is limited in scope and with
the provision of additional distribution circuits and an adequate and secure
power supply, a large number of new consumers would be supplied.
6.09      In Koidu, the demand in the fiscal year 1967 was 450 kw and energy
sales totalled 1.2 million kwh. On completion of the expansion program it is
estimated that the demand in 1971 would increase to 860 kw with energy sales
of 2.7 million kwh; the load factor would be about 35%. It is expected that
after an adequate electricity supply is available, small commercial enterprises
will be established and the load factor improved.



-8-
Losses
6.10      Power system losses have been comparatively high in past years
amounting to as much as 22% in Freetown, and 20% in the Provinces, exclusive
of power used for the supply of auxiliary services at generating stations.
They comprise line losses, losses due to defective metering and those due to
illegal connectionse With the establishment of the Corporation, inspection
and overhaul of the metering system were initiated. This work is now about
75% completed and as the result of this and of improvements to the distribu-
tion system, losses in Freetown declined to about 18% and in the Provinces to
about 16% in 1967.
6.11      It is expected that with the completion of the above programs and
especially with improvement of the Freetown distribution system, losses will
continue to decline. It is expected that by 1971 they will not exceed 15%.
7. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
7.01      The tariffs for the supply of electrical energy are set by the
Corporation and approved by the Minister of Works in accordance with the
Electricity Corporation Act 1964. The existing loan agreement requires the
Corporation to charge tariffs to produce a return of at least 8% on its
average net assets in operation.
7.02      The tariffs introduced in August 1964 were based on prudent estimates
prepared from inadequate financial records and an estimated tariff base of the
new Corporation. The resulting revenues have brought about a greater improve-
ment in the cash position than had been anticipated and also exceeded the
requirement of the rate covenant with returns averaging about 12% in 1966 and
1967 (paragraph 7.13).
7.03      Tentative estimates indicate that as a result of recent changes,
particularly the effects of the November 1967 devaluation of the leone on
the tariff base and operating expenses, the expected return on estimated
revalued net assets would be reduced to an average of about 9% which would
slightly exceed the requirements of the rate covenant. This would be satis-
factory, although a tariff reduction, as was being considered prior to devalua-
tion, would no longer be justified.
7.04      Existing rates which average about US 5.3 cents per kwh are high.
This is largely due to high losses referred to in paragraph 6.10, some old
diesel plant and obsolete distribution in Freetown, and high fuel costs, low
density of loads and primitive facilities in the provinces. It is the Govern-
ment's policy to apply uniform tariffs in Freetown and the provinces despite
the widely different conditions of supply in these areas. So as not to impose
an excessive burden on the consumers in Freetown and to avoid higher power
rates it was agreed in connection with loan No. 388-SL that:



- 9 -
(a) the Government would contribute an annual subsidy of up
to Le 70,000 towards losses in the provincial areas
except Bo;
(b) this subsidy would be included in the Corporation's net
income for purposes of computing the return required by
the rate covenant.
7.05      The arrangements made in the previous loan are satisfactory and
the rate of return covenant and agreement of the Government to provide a
subsidy are repeated in the proposed agreements. The Corporation has, how-
ever, asked that the Bank agree to a temporary waiver of this subsidy. When
the Corporation was set up, it was the Government's policy to minimize its
financial burden until it was well established. Now that the Corporation is
on a sound financial footing it is able to dispense with some of the Govern-
ment assistance. It would therefore be reasonable to waive the annual sub-
sidy for the three years to March 31, 1969. It is also reasonable to agree to
the proposals of the Corporation as set out in paragraph 7.09.
Audit
7.06      The provisions of the existing loan agreement requiring the
appointment of independent auditors satisfEactory to the Bank should be
repeated in the new agreement. In 1966 a local firm of Ayoola Amorin and
Company was replaced by Peat, Marwick, Cassleton Elliott and Company, the
West African branch of a reputable firm of public accountants. The present
arrangements are satisfactory.
Present Financial Position
7.07      Condensed Balance Sheets as at March 31, 1966 and 1967 are shown
in Annex 5. Plant transferred to the Corporation on vesting day viz
August 4, 1964,was recorded in the books at values appraised by consultants,
with subsequent additions at historical cost.
7.08      A summary of the capitalization of the Corporation at March 31,
1967 is shown below -with the conversion to the US$ equivalent at the former
exchange rate of Le 1 = US$1.40.

7.09      The 4% irredeemable Loan Stock 'Al was issued to compensate the
Government for the Freetown undertakings and the partly constructed Bo power
station in the provinces. The value of plant in excess of the amount of Stock
was represented by the creation of a capital reserve which exceeded Le 1
million on vesting day. This has been built up further with the value of
goods delivered against orders placed by Goverment beforo vosting day and paid
for by Government, capital contributions paid by consumers, and other proviicic'l
plant and materials transferred. As a condition of the previous Bank Loan, the
Government agreed this loan stock would be free of interest for 5 years to
August 1, 1969. Now that the Corporation has already achieved a strong
financial position, earlier payment of interest is planned by the Corporation
commencing from February 1, 1968, with the approval of the Bank.
7.10      The long term debt at March 31, 1967 consisted primarily of the
balance of the existing Bank Loan 388-SL. The loan agreement includes a
debt limitation covenant which is repeated in the proposed loan agreement.
Under this covenant the Corporation would not incur new debt unless its net
revenues before provision for depreciation for the fiscal year next preceding
such incurrence or for a later 12 month period ended prior to the incurrence
shall be not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service for any succeeding
fiscal year on all debt, including the debt to be incurred. The Corporation
amply meets this test for the proposed new loan.
7.11      The 5% loan stock 'B' was originally issued by the Corporation for
Le 1 million to cover the value of assets transferred from Government other
than those referred to in paragraph 7.09 and consisting of the local costs
of the civil works at King Tom power station, consumers accounts receivable,
inventories of fuel and materials, and other items of working capital. The
balance of this loan was reduced to Le 300,000 during fiscal 1968 to reduce
the arrears of electricity bills payable to the Corporation and has since
been extinguished by setting off other amounts payable by the Goverrment to
the Corporation.
Past Earnings
7.12      Income Statements for the two years ended March 31, 1966 and 1967
are summarized in Annex 6. The completion of the King Tom Power Station in
March 1965 permitted increased sales which are reflected in the 1966 accounts.
Revenues of Le 2.6 million in 1967 increased 10% over 1966. Operating
expenses of about Le 2.0 million increased by about 15% but a substantial
part of this increase was for investigations aimed at reducing system losses,
the expenses of which would not be recurrent. The returns, averaging about
12% for 1966 and 1967 are higher than had been estimated at the time of the
previous appraisal made before the Corporation was formed in August 1964. Two
factors account for the differences. First, the actual operating revenues and
expenses were both lower than those estimated and the margin was greater in
the case of operating expenses resulting in increased net operating income.
Second, the value of net plant taken over and recorded in the accounts was 12%
lower than estimated.

Future Finances
7.13      A forecast of the Sources and Application of Funds for the five
year period 1968 to 1972 is shown in Annex 7. The Government devalued the
leone by 14.3% on November 21, 1967 to the equivalent of US$1.20. This means
an increase of 16.7% in the amount of local currency necessary to purchase
U.S. dollars. This action will increase operating costs, debt service and
construction expenses. The financial projections have been modified to
assume a 16.7% increase in foreign costs, but no additional increase in
local currency costs since it is too early to formulate definite opinions.
It is, however, thought prudent to provide for a higher level of cash than
would normally be necessary (see Balance Sheet in Annex 5) to cushion possible
increases in local currency items by about 5%.
Financing Plan
7.14      The financing plan for the construction period April 1, 1968 to
March 31, 1971 is summarized below.

7.15      The total requirements of the construction period 1969-1971 of
US$7.5 million would be financed to the extent of 48% from net cash generation
including utilization of cash balances and 52% from the proposed Bank Loan. A
Bank Loan of US$3.9 million is assumed to be for a term of 20 years including
a grace period of 3½ years, and to carry a 6V interest rate, Further bor-
rowings in 1972, foUowing the Bank program, to finance future expansion have
been assumed on comparable terms.
Future Operating Results
7.16      Forecast income statements for the five years 1968-1972 are shown in
Annex 6. The 1968 rate of return is 112% after waiver of subsidy referred to
in paragraph 7.05. The 1969 return of 10,6% reflects the increased foreign
cost of operations following the leone devaluation. It has been calculated
on a rate base which has not been revalued to reflect, among other things,
the currency revaluation. For this reason the return is overstated and the
Corporation has agreed to revalue gross plant and accumulated deprectation,
to produce more realistic net plant values for the calculation of the rate
of returne Assuming that the value of the net plant in operation at March
31, 1968, is increased by as much as 16.7% and the local current costs of
operations by 5%, rates of return averaging a little below 9% are forecast.
Financial Position
7.17     Estimated Balance Sheets for the period 1968 through 1971 are
shown in Armex 5. They show a continued satisfactory position. The current
ratio of 4.9 in 1968 reducing to 2.9 by 1972 is satisfactory, Accounts
receivable at the end of March 1967 represented nearly 1 month's billings
and projections assume 33 months to 1970 and 3 months thereafter. This
level is high but the Corporation is considering improvement in its
procedures including the installation of billing machines. It is not
anticipated that results would be significant before 1971.
7.18      The long term debt/equity ratio varies from 36/64k in 1967 to
148/52 in 1971 and 1972. While long term debt reflects the increase in
foreign debt arising from devaluation, the value of equity does not reflect
any increase in plant values pending revaluation referred to in paragraph
7oJ6.
7.19      Both debt service and interest are amply covered throughout the
program. Debt service coverage (Annex 7) by internally generated funds
ranges from 4.4 times in 1967 to 3.0 times in 1972. Interest coverage
(Annex 6) by net operating income ranges from 2.8 times in 1967 to 3.8
times in 1968 and to 2.6 times in 1972.

8. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project is technically sound, the expansion proposed is
satisfactorily planned and will provide facilities necessary to meet the
expected demand for power in the next few years. Estimates of cost are
reasonable. Arrangements for procurement and construction as well as the
financing proposals are satisfactory.
8.02      The Corporation is functioning well and has made considerable
progress in improving its organization and management.
8.03      The Corporation has built up a sound financial position which
despite devaluation of the leone, enables it to waive the Government's
subvention for provincial operating losses for three years up to 1969, to
initiate earlier interest payments on the Government's 'Al loan stock than
originally agreed and at the same time provide the local currency for the
project and cost of other planned capital expenditure during the construction
period.
8.04      The project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$3.9 million equivalent
for a term of 20 years including a grace period of A½ years.
