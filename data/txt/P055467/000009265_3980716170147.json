sector-based economic growth. The Project will\n            support GOCV policy of: (a) reducing the size of the State\n            and changing its role from that of an implementor to one\n            that provides an enabling environment necessary for private\n            sector development; and (b) increasing private participation\n            in key economic sectors including utilities, trade and\n            transport, through the development of effective policy and\n            regulatory frameworks. The project components include: (a)\n            an accelerated privatization program, including support to\n            this program, support to the public enterprise staff\n            retrenchment plan, and public communication campaigns; (b) a\n            consolidated regulatory framework, including the\n            establishment of regulatory arrangements and institutions,\n            support to civil aviation regulation, support to postal and\n            telecommunication regulation, support to maritime transport\n            regulation, support to urban transport regulation, and\n            support to pharmaceuticals regulation and Consumer Product\n            Standard and Quality Control Agency; and (c) project coordination."}, "docdt": "1998-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
