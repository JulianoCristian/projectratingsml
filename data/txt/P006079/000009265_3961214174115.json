Development\n            Project for Barbados were as follows: In terms of\n            sustainability, the project is likely to maintain the\n            achievements generated as a result of policies arising from\n            the sector study and adopted by Government. The Bank's\n            performance is considered to be satisfactory overall. The\n            Borrower's performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: flexibility during implementation\n            resulted in a successful project, and should be built into\n            all projects. Future loans should permit CBB to make on the\n            spot adjustments to lending rates and project documentation\n            requirements. Projects which involve more than one\n            implementing agency require formal linkages to facilitate\n            coordination. Ongoing promotion and monitoring of the credit\n            line should be provided. Successful project implementation\n            is dependent on the amount of human resources invested in\n            management and coordination."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
