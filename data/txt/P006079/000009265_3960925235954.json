Project\n            will support the production, processing and marketing of\n            non-sugar crops with proven commercial potential.  It will\n            build on research concerning technical and economic\n            feasibility of non-sugar crops and extension efforts begun\n            under the Bank's FY82 Technical Assistance Project\n            (Loan 2115-BAR).  More specifically, the proposed project\n            will provide 67 man-months of consultants' services,\n            overseas fellowships, equipment and materials to strengthen\n            MAFF's research and extension activities and provide\n            credit funds for agro-industrial ventures.  It will also\n            provide for an agricultural sector study, involving both the\n            sugar and non-sugar subsectors, and crop diversification\n            policies.  The proposed project, over the medium to long\n            term, will lead to improvements in farmers' incomes,\n            together with gains in Barbados' balance of trade."}, "docdt": "1987-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
