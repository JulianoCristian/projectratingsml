Development Objectives  The proposed Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-5) i s the third ina second
andDescription          PRSC series designed to assist the Government o f Mozambique (GoM) to implement key
                        policy actions outlined in its 2005-2009 Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f
                        Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA I1 by its Portuguese acronym) and in the
                        Performance Assessment Framework agreed by the Government and the 19 external
                        partners that provide general budget support (GBS) to GoM. In 2008 the Government
                        announced that it will extend the PARPA I1 by one year to include 2010, thereby
                        strengthening sustainability and continuity with the next strategic document. PARPA I1
                        i s mainly focused on shared growth and on the need for decentralization. Within this
                        context, PRSC-5 i s expected to help the GoM in (a) the consolidation and deepening o f
                        the institutional reforms in the area of macroeconomic management; (b) reforms in
                        governance by supporting decentralization to enhance public investments and service
                        delivery at the provincial and district level, and by supporting public sector reform; and
                        (c) economic development by removing constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, and
                        promoting agricultural growth. The PRSC-5 also supports the implementation of the
                        Government policy response to the higher global food and fuel prices.
Benefits                The operation will help the Government to maintain macroeconomic stability while it
                        continues to pursue a reform agenda that cannot be fully financed from domestic sources.
                        The reforms should enable Mozambique to make further progress in reducing absolute
                        poverty, improving the delivery o f services and achieving the MDGs. The alignment with
                        the general budget support programs o f 18 other donors and ajoint focus onthe priorities
                        set out by the Government in its comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, and on a
                        common set o f indicators to measure progress, should help improve the resource flow
                        and improve aid effectiveness, thereby enhancing the chances o f progress towards the
                        MDGs.
Risks                   A first set o f risks is concerned with the potential for macroeconomic instability, due to
                        the sharp increase in food and fuel prices, potential spillover effects from crises in
                        neighboring countries, and the upcoming political elections in 2009. The impact o f the
                        higher food and fuel prices on the Balance o f Payments (BOP) inMozambique has been
                        mitigated by the simultaneous increase inthe price o f aluminum. The latter is expected to
                        decrease in2009, however, and may result into a higher impact on the BOP.Inaddition,
                        continued increase in oil and food prices could heighten social vulnerabilities, and
                        thereby pose a threat for the quality o f macroeconomic management. In this respect the
                        Bank i s proposing to increase the level o f budget support to contribute to the mitigation
                        response package planned by the Government, focusing on boosting agricultural
                        production. The additional support would assist the Government meet the fiscal costs o f
                        the response to the high international fuel and food prices, and the effort to mitigate the
                        impact on the most vulnerable groups. An additional set o f risks arises from potential
                        spillover effects from political crises inneighboring countries, notably in Zimbabwe and

in South Africa. Inthe latter contentious Presidential elections will take place in2009,
and there is also a possibility o f more xenophobic attacks as witnessed inmid-2008. The
Parliamentary and Presidential elections inMozambique are scheduled in late 2009 (and
municipal elections are scheduled in November 2008). Approachmg the elections, the
Government will need to resist pressures for additional spending that are not sustainable,
and prevent a reduction in the level o f revenues collection (as happened in the previous
2004 elections). The Bank team will continue to monitor the macroeconomic policy
framework and its adequacy for the provision o f budget support. Inaddition, to mitigate
the risks o f fiscal slippage due to political pressure inthe run-upto the 2009 elections, the
PRSC program (and the PAF), supports the efforts by the Government to strengthen PFM
systems (including the revenue collection systems), which increase transparency and
reduce the country's vulnerability to fiscal slippage.
A second set o f risks concerns weak administrative capacity to implement public sector
reforms and move ahead with decentralization. To mitigate this risk, the Government and
donors agreed during the April 2008 Joint Review to develop an integrated strategy for
capacity development inpublic finance management, and to strengthen the coordination
and management o freforms. InadditionIDA i s supporting the Government to implement
the second phase of the public sector reforms, which was agreed with all stakeholders,
including the development partners, and was approved by Cabinet in October 2006. To
strengthen capacity at the district level and to improve control mechanisms (auditing), the
Government has finalized its program for capacity building at the decentralized level. The
development partners, including IDA, are discussing with Government the preparation o f
a national program that is expected to deliver capacity building and oversight more
effectively.
A third set o f risks concerns a deterioration in governance that could compromise
economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts. Progress in public sector governance
has been mixed. Significant progress has been made in thereby improving transparency
and accountability by strengthening Public Financial Management systems, including in
procurement and in internal and external audit. Also there has been progress towards
improving the management o f natural resources, notably by strengthening the legal
framework regulating the fiscal regimes for mining and petroleum, and government has
recently announced its intention to adhere to the Extractive Industry Transparency
Initiative (EITI). The April 2008 Joint Review, however, noted the need to accelerate
reforms in the legal and judiciary fronts, including in implementing the anti-corruption
strategy and introducing (and enforcing) legislation to eliminate conflict o f interest for
public officials. Questions are also related to the capacity for selection, negotiation and
monitoring o f the projects and investments in order to explore the opportunities o f the
country's natural resources (minerals, petroleum, hydropower, forestry, agriculture,
among others). The mixed progress inthe area o f governance may slow down further in
the approach to Parliamentary and Presidential elections in December 2009. A
deterioration in governance could have negative effects on economic growth and
compromise poverty reduction. To mitigate this risk, IDA is increasing its activities in
the areas o f governance. Strengthening voice and accountability i s one o f the three pillars
o f the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy discussed by the Board inMay 2007. IDA
already holds an active policy dialogue with the authorities on the subject and closely
monitors developments associated with governance. At the request o f the Government,
and jointly with other partners, the Bank has provided technical assistance to the
Government on how to maximize the benefits from mega-projects and the exploitation o f
Mozambique's natural resources. In addition, the restructured Public Sector Reform
Project has a legal sector capacity building component. A further approach to enhance
accountability of the executive i s increased disclosure o f information to the public,
particularly regarding financial management. Some progress has been made through the
use o f an official internet portal o f the Government, but more effort is still required.
Also, as part o f the activities supported by the CommGAP Trust Fund in Mozambique,
IDA is working to enhance citizen's voice, strengthen media, and modernize the

                    Government's communication functions. Last but not least, IDA i s working with
                    Government to carry out a programof beneficiary surveys to increase public involvement
                    inthe monitoringofservice delivery.

1. This Program Document proposes a Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC-5) to the Republic of Mozambique for a Credit in the amount of SDR57.3
million (USD90 million equivalent) and a Grant from the Food Price Crisis
Response Trust Fund in the amount of USDlO million equivalent. The proposed
Grant is intended to support the Government response to the recent sharp increase in
global food and fuel prices. The proposed Credit is an integral part o f the Bank's strategy
to support the implementation o f Mozambique's "Second Action Plan for the Reduction
of Absolute Poverty"' (known as PAFWA I1by its Portuguese acronym), aided by the
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the Government and the nineteen
external partners (the G19)2 providing general budget support (GBS). While the PRSC
operations will provide financial support for implementing the whole PARPA, they are to
be disbursed against the upfront completion o f a number o f specific reform measures
identified in the PAF. The proposed operation i s the third in a PRSC series o f three
annual single-tranche operations to be delivered over FY07-09. A detailed description o f
the PRSC series was provided in the PRSC-3 Program Document, which was the first
operation o f this PRSC series (Republic o f Mozambique, Third Poverty Reduction
Support Credit, Report No. 37970-MZ, approved January 25, 2007). Consistent with the
programmatic approach o f the PRSC series, this document will cross-reference the earlier
program document, but will present a detailed update on the implementation o f the
program. The document will also provide an update on the macroeconomic developments
andoverall risks.

A. COUNTRYOVERVIEW

2. Mozambiquehas been a very strong performer in Africa, with rapidgrowth and
poverty reduction, as it recovers steadily from the damage of the civil war.
Following political stabilization and market-oriented reforms, and steady improvements
ininfrastructure, the economy has registered an average annual growth rate o f 8 percent
between 1996 and 2007, and incomes have risen considerably. The poverty headcount
index has fallen from 69 percent in 1996/97 to 54 percent in 2002/03. Economic

France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the
World Bank.

expansion has been made possible by overall macroeconomic stability, policy reforms
and continuing strong donor support, permitting broad-based expansion across most
sectors of the economy, and a series o f significant foreign investment projects ("mega-
projects"). As a result, Mozambique's exports increased dramatically in the late 1990s
and early 2000s, with average growth rates of 10.6 percent and 25.4 percent in 1995-1999
and 2000-2006, respectively. Most of this growth, however, was driven by exports from
mega-projects; excludingmega-projects, exports grew by 13.5 percent on average during
2000-2006. The sectors that contributed the most to economic growth were agriculture,
transport, communications andinfrastructure, notably roads.
3. Visible progress occurred in social conditions as evidence of the decline in
poverty measuredby the latest householdsurvey. Inaddition to the major reduction
in poverty, by 15.3 percentage points between 1996 and 2003,3 other social indicators
have also shown significant improvements since the mid-1990s (Table 1):

2008/09.

4. Despite the promising progress, significant challenges remain. The country
remains poor ($380 per capita income in 2007), infrastructure is inadequate, and social
indicators are low. While Mozambique has been very successful in achieving a major
reduction inpoverty, by 15.3 percentage points between 1996 and 2003, nevertheless the
south region o f the country has experienced an increase inpoverty rates, especially inthe
city o f Maputo and the surrounding province. Adult literacy rates are low (approximately
47 percent), and life expectancy at birthremains very low (42 years). Despite economic
growth, malnutrition has worsened in Mozambique between 1997 and 2006, with the
malnutrition rate among children under the age o f five rising from 36 to 46 per cent
(FAO, June 2008). The country also relies heavily on foreign aid, which makes up about
half o f its overall budget. Additionally, the impact o f HIV/AIDS and malaria on the
population has serious consequences. Malaria alone accounts for 35 percent o f deaths
among children below five years o f age, 60 percent o f admissions inpediatric wards, and
40 percent o f overall outpatient consultations. It has been found that in Sub-Saharan
Africa, malaria reduces GDP growth by an estimated average o f 1.3 percent per year. As
for HIV/AIDS, current projections indicate that in 2010 the Mozambican economy will
be 14-20 percent smaller thanitwould otherwise be due to the impact o fHIV/AIDS.
5. Mozambique has made substantial progress towards achieving the poverty
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Assuming that the current trend continues,
Mozambique would be on-track to halve the population living in absolute poverty by
2015. The combined impact o f the food and fuel price rises over the past year, however,
is expected to set back some o f the progress achieved over the past 12 years, as the higher
prices are anticipated to increase the poverty headcount by 4 percentage points, mainly in
urbanareas.4 As mentioned, reducing hunger andchild malnutrition remains a challenge.
The MDG for sustainable coverage for water supply could also be met, given the rapid
improvements in the provision o f urban water supply, although significant progress is
needed to increase access to water inrural areas. There has also been substantial progress
toward other MDG targets, specifically on improving universal primary education,
gender equality and women's empowerment, reducing child mortality, and improving
maternalhealth. Nevertheless, more progress will be required to meet these MDGs, while
combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases remains a serious challenge. A detailed
discussion o f progress towards each MDG was included in the PRSC-3 Program
Document.
6. Constraints to private sector development and trade remain substantial, but
progress is being made to improve the business environment. Mozambique was
among the top five reforming countries in Sub-Saharan Africa inthe 2008 Ease o f Doing
Business rank, as reflected by an improvement in its ranking by 6 places to 134thout o f
175 ~ountries.~Mozambique i s 129th (out o f 203) on the 2007 Governance Survey


 Further, this shock will exacerbate a trend already observed by several studies over the past decade in
Mozambique (World Bank 2008). While Mozambique has beenvery successful inachieving a major
reduction inpoverty, by 15.3 percentage points between 1996 and 2003, nevertheless the south regiono f
the country has experienced an increase inpoverty rates, especially inthe city o f Maputo and the
surrounding province. Not only the numbero fpoor increased inMaputo City and Maputo Province, but the
depth and severity o fpoverty also increased.
 Mozambique was the second fastest reformer overall inthe category "Protecting Investors", where its
rankjumped 63 places from 96 to 33. Legislation dating from 1888 was replaced with a new commercial

Overall Index, surpassing the SSA and low income group averages on all four aspects o f
the index (government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule o f law, and control o f
corruption). The country's secondary school (7.1 percent, in 2005) and tertiary (1.2
percent, in 2004) enrollment rates are only a fraction o f the comparators' countries.
Mozambique i s ranked 110th out o f 150 countries on the 2007 Trade Logistics
Performance Index. Its weakest indicators are quality o f transport and IT infrastructures.
The Government's development andpoverty reduction strategy focuses on tackling many
o f these concerns.
7. Progress in public sector governance has been mixed. Significant progress has
been made in improving transparency and accountability by strengthening Public
Financial Management systems, including in procurement and in internal and external
audit. Also there has been progress towards improving the management o f natural
resources, notably by strengthening the legal framework regulating the fiscal regimes for
mining and petroleum. Inaddition, the government has recently announced its intention
to adhere to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). Progress however
remains limited in the Justice Sector and in Anti-Corruption, such that improvements in
the efficiency and transparency o f the justice system remain elusive, and corruption and
conflict-of-interest remain central issues. Also, despite some progress, implementation o f
public sector reforms program remains slow.


3. RECENT ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS                     INMOZAMBIQUE

8. Mozambique's economic growth continues to be strong. Mozambique's GDP
growth was 7 percent in 2007. Agriculture, which employs about 78 percent o f the
economically active population, contributed most to GDP during 2007 (23 percent). It
was followed by the manufacturing industry (13 percent), trade (11 percent), and
transport and communications (10 percent). The contribution o f the remaining sectors
was between 6 percent (financial services) and 1percent (extractive industries). Looking
back at the last twelve years, the growth record has been remarkable, averaging 8 percent
from 1966 to 2007, making Mozambique the fastest growing non-oil economy in Sub-
Saharan Africa. This performance has been driven by mega-project investments, buoyant
donor support, healthy agricultural growth, and foreign direct investment in services
sector.6
9. Public and private investments continue to grow. Public investment remained
stable at 13.1 percent o f GDP in 2006 and 13.2 percent in 2007. Similarly, private
investments were 7.6 percent o f GDP in 2005 and 7.8 percent in 2007.                                Foreign
investments accelerated substantially from USDl53 million in 2006 to USD427 million
in 2007 (approximately 50 percent in extractive industries, 15 percent in transport and
communications, 15 percent inagriculture, and 15 percent inmanufacturing). Further the
future volume o f investment projects is expected to remain strong. During 2007,


code that introduces stricter corporate governance rules and strengthens the rights o f minority shareholders.
Significant progress was achieved too in the category "Starting a Business" (+32 ranks), where the start-up
time for new firms fell by almost three months from an average 113 to 29 days.
  A detailed analysis on the sources o f growth in Mozambique can be found in the Country Economic
Memorandumo f 2005, Report No32615-MZ.

Mozambique registered a record USD9 billion in approved private investments, almost
entirely from planned Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). About US$1.5 billion relates to
the Government approval inmid-2007 o f the concession agreement for the exploration o f
the Moatize coal mine, and US$5.1 billion from the plans to build an oil refinery in
Nacala. An additional USD300 million derives from the approval o f 84 investment
projects, mostly in industry (29 projects, for a total o f USD178 million), transport and
communications (8 projects, for a total o fUSD6O million), and tourism (20 projects, for a
total o f USD27 million). While 2007 is likely to be above average, the level o f new
investments is expected to remain high, as several new mega-projects are in the pipeline
for the next few years.
10. Inflationwas 8.2 percent on average in 2007, and was higher than anticipated at
end-December with a year-on-year increase of 10.3 percent, mainly due to price
increases during the festive season. Average annual inflation has decreased from 13.2
inDecember2006 to 8.2 percentinDecember2007. Average inflationaccelerated during
the initial months o f 2008 reaching 10.3 percent by end-June 2008, as a result o f the
increase in fuel and food prices. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) was
contained at 5.1 percent as o f end-2007, and continued its descending trend in 2008,
reaching 3.8 percent by end-June 2008. Monetary policy continues to be prudent, and
aims to keep core inflation insingle digits.
11.Credit to the economy has continuedto grow, in parallel with improvementsin
the soundness, depth and profitability of the Mozambique financial system.
Followingthe increase o f 29 percent in2006, the 12-month rate o f growth o f credit to the
economy grew at 17 percent in2007, and i s projected to continue to expand at 26 percent
in 2008. Lending to the agriculture and rural sector, however, remains minimal. The
financial system has deepened since the banking system was restructured. Sound
financial policies and cleaned-up balance sheets have restored confidence inthe banking
sector. Capital adequacy ratios are above the minimum, and have increased further in
2007, in spite o f the increased lending, and the share o f non-performing loans decreased
further to 2.6 percent in 2007. Banks have also become more efficient, as reflected by
the continuous decline in non-interest expenses to gross income since 2004. Greater
confidence in the banking system has also led to a significant decrease in liability
dollarization and thus less financial vulnerability.
12. Fiscal performance remains good. Maintaining the positive trend o f the past few
years, revenue collections in 2007 were almost one percent higher than in 2006 (and 0.4
percent o f GDP higher than forecast), mainly led by buoyant corporate tax collection^.^
Domestically financed current expenditures were in line with the budget in 2006, but
externally financed capital expenditures were significantly below their budgeted levels.
The share o f expenditures to priority sectors was around 63 percent in 2007, which i s
below the 65 percent PARPA I1target; however, this is largely due to the lower than
anticipated externally financed investment in priority sectors. In line with these trends,
the domestic current primary surplus in 2007 was nearly 0.5 percent o f GDP higher than
programmed (under the IMFPSI), and is projected to remain positive in2008.


'Revenue  collections have increased from 13.1percent in2004 to 16.4 percent in2007.

13. Real interest rates continue to decrease. Reacting to a downward adjustment in
Treasury bill yields and softening inflation, the Bank o f Mozambique (BM) reduced
interest rates on its lending and deposit standing facilities from 17.5 to 14.5 percent, and
from 13 to 10.25 percent, respectively.* Together with the recent increase in the 12-
month inflation rate, the result has been a reduction in the real interest rate for Treasury
bills from 11at the end o f April 2007 down to 6 percent inJanuary 2008.
14.The trade balance deteriorated in 2007. After improving substantially from 11
percent in 2005 to 7.5 percent o f GDP in 2006, led by an acceleration in exports (both
mega-projects and other exports),' the trade deficit worsened to 8.7 percent in 2007,
mainly as a result o f the increase in the price o f oil. The trade deficit is expected to
deteriorate fkrther to around 13 percent o f GDP in2008, as a result o f the increased price
o f oil and grains.
15. The foreign exchange market remains stable, and reserves are at a comfortable
level. As a result o f strong exports, sustained aid inflows, and a tighter monetary policy
stance, the exchange rate appreciated slightly during 2007, while international reserves
remained at an adequate level (over 8 months o f imports, excluding mega-projects). The
Central Bank auction rate at end-July 2008 was 24.35 MT per U S D against 26.15 in
February 2007. The appreciation o f the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) was
approximately 6.5 percent.
16. There is a stable relationship with the IMF, and a Policy Support Instrument
(PSI) was approvedby the IMF's Board in June 2007. The second review o f the PSI
was successfully completed in May 2008, and confirmed that the government's
successful reform effort has produced solid growth and price stability. The review found
that performance under the PSI program has been satisfactory, reflecting prudent fiscal
and monetary policies in the context o f a flexible exchange rate regime and the
authorities' commitment to avoid monetary financing of the budget. Economic growth
was resilient to shocks and average annual inflation has decelerated despite high oil and
food import prices. However, the two end-December 2007 quantitative Assessment
Criteria on net credit to government and reserve money were missed mostly because of
unforeseen challenges, as well as one structural assessment criterion on a draft law on
excise tax on alcoholic beverages. The good performance has helped the authorities
continue their program of second-generation reforms.


C. DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

17. Mozambique faces a low risk of debt distress, as confirmed by a Debt
SustainabilityAnalysis carriedout by the Bank and the Fundin 2007, but a prudent
new borrowingpolicy remainsimportant.As a result o f the MDRI, the NPV o fpublic
external debt is estimated to be approximately halved, from about 25 percent to about 12


 The reductions were carried out intwo steps, inJune 2007 and inJanuary 2008.
 With such developments as the MOZALaluminum smelter, Mozambique's share o fmining and fuel
products inmerchandize exports has increased from about 10percent inthe late 1990sto 73.2 percent in
2005. Ofthe 84 various products exported by Mozambique in2005, aluminum accounted for 72 percent,
followed by seafood (6 percent), tobacco (4 percent), sawlogs (2 percent), and raw sugar (2 percent).

percent o f GDP in 2006.'0 Mozambique's external debt levels are expected to remain
well below their indicative thresholds for debt distress both under the baseline and under
various stress tests. Mozambique's public debt is expected to decline over the medium-
to-long term under the baseline, while the stress tests indicate that public sector debt
ratios are most vulnerable to a permanently lower GDP growth. With regards to future
borrowing, the authorities should continue to rely on concessional financing and grants to
minimize future debt service. Any non-concessional financing o f new projects ought to
be considered case by case based on economic return, impact on debt sustainability, and
potential effects on the financing decisions o f donors and concessional lenders. Also, the
authorities would still need to closely monitor any substantial scaling-up o f concessional
external borrowing and the issuance o f domestic debt to sterilize the additional liquidity
injected from increased government spending. Debt management has recently been
reorganized and consolidated within the Ministry o f Finance following international best
practices, and capacity i s being strengthened.

10  More recently, the Second Commercial DebtBuy-Back Operation for Mozambique was completed in
October 2007, entailing the cancellation o f USD153 million o f long-term commercial debt (all o f it
originated inthe 1970'sand 80's).

D. ECONOMIC     OUTLOOK

18. The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is positive, but faces risks from
continuedhigh internationalfood and oil prices, and the upcomingelections period.
The medium-term outlook is characterized by continued strong economic growth,
moderate inflation, and sustainable fiscal and external positions. The second review o f
performance under the PSI program concluded in May 2008 that the prospects for 2008
remained favorable, and that the Government i s committed to take the necessary fiscal
measures and pursue a monetary program consistent with a further reduction o f inflation.
The Government is also committed to take measures to continue to strengthen the
banking system, foster private sector development and move forward the public sector
reform. After recording an 8.5 percent growth in2006, real GDP growth was 7 percent in
2007, and is expected to be around 6.5 percent in the next three years (Table 2). The
leading sector would be agriculture, followed by wholesale and retail trade, and also
transport and communications, and construction. The Parliamentary and Presidential
elections in Mozambique are scheduled for late 2009 (and municipal elections are
scheduled for November 2008). Approaching the national elections, the Government will
need to resist pressures for additional spending that are not sustainable, and prevent a
reduction inthe level o f revenues collection (as happened in2004).
19. The increase in the international price of food and fuel is a cause of concern,
pushingmany householdsback into poverty and raising fiscal pressuresto mitigate
the effects. Nominalfood prices inMozambique increasedby 14percent over the twelve
months during July 2007 to July 2008, with the price o f key staple food commodities
increasing by as much as 35 to 110percent. Table 3 provides an overview o f the rise in
the price of rice, maize and wheat flour (the main staple food commodities) over a three
year period. In addition, gasoline prices at the pump increased by roughly 23 percent
over the same period (and by over 100 percent compared to July 2005). The surge in
prices is expected to result in higher inflation and a worsening o f the trade balance, but
overall the Government's macroeconomic policies and the comfortable level o f
international foreign exchange reserves place Mozambique in a relatively good position
to cope with these recent hikes infood and fuel prices. Average inflation was expected to
be around 7.3 percent in 2008, but it is now expected to be around 10 percent as a result
o f the higher food and fuel prices. However, core inflation (Le. excluding food and fuel)
is expected to remain around 5 percent.            Regarding the Balance o f Payments,
Mozambique i s a heavy importer of both cereals and fuel, but the increase inthe external
current account deficit will be mitigated in part by the increase in prices o f export
products (notably, aluminum). The balance is expected to be financed by an acceleration
o f aid disbursements, higher foreign direct investments, and a reduction in international
reserves (Table 4).    Further, the price o f aluminum i s expected to decrease in 2009,
resulting in a higher trade balance deficit. Probably the most significant macroeconomic
challenge o f the crisis in Mozambique relates to the fiscal cost o f the Government's
response package, which is estimated at around 1.3 percent of GDP in 2008.             The
Government has approved a policy response package which includes a series o f measures
to stimulate agricultural production and the temporary lifting o f import duties and VAT
on diesel and kerosene, and is working with development partners, including the Bank, to
expand social mitigation measures to protect the most vulnerable. About half o f this

policy package can be financed by efficiency savings and expenditure cuts in other areas
o f the budget, and the Government will therefore need to increase domestic borrowing
unless additional external financing becomes available.
20. An additional 800,000 people are expected to be pushed below the poverty line
by the combined impact of the food and fuel price rises over the ast year, raising
the poverty headcount by 4 percentage points to 58 percent.?I The impact is
especially severe in urban areas where the poverty rate is expected to increase by 8
percentage points. Most o f the negative impact is concentrated in the south o f the
country, particularly inMaputo, which is a net consumer o f food, and heavily depends on
imported rice and wheat. Food accounts for 65 and 47 percent o f total consumption in
rural and urban areas, respectively. Hence the impact o f the food price increase i s very
severe, particularly for the urban poor who purchase more than 80 percent o f their food
consumption from the market. The combined effect o f these multiple food price
increases, combined with ongoing fuel price hikes, will create severe hardships in the
population. Already in February 2008 riots erupted in Maputo and two provinces
following an attempted increase in urban transport fares, shortly after a substantial
increase inthe price o f bread.

21. The Governmentis finalizingitsresponseplanto the higherfood and fuelprices,
in collaboration with the internationalcommunity. The Government policy response
is focused on promoting economic growth as the best means to achieve poverty
alleviation, while also taking action to protect the vulnerable population from the impact
of the price shocks. At the macroeconomic level, the Government intends to allow the
pass through o f international prices o f food and fuel to the domestic economy, notably
envisaging no trade distortions or generalized subsidies, while protecting the economic
sectors most vulnerable to the increase in energy prices (notably the fisheries and
transport sectors). In terms of specific actions, the Government has approved a policy
response package which includes the temporary lifting o f import duties and VAT on
diesel and kerosene, a series of measures to stimulate agricultural production, and is
working with development partners, including the Bank, to expand social mitigation
measures to protect the most vulnerable (see details in Section V, pages 38-41,
paragraphs 80-85).

22. Work is advanced in terms of costing these measures, and the Government is
seeking additional financing. A preliminary estimate o f the additional fiscal cost o f the
response measures approved as o f end-July indicates that the additional cost in 2008 is
estimated at 1.3 percent o f GDP (USD122 million) (Table 5).12 Inorder to finance the
measures in 2008, the Government plans to: (i)                          realize expenditure savings from non-
release o f 10 percent o f the budget for recurrent expenditure (while protecting essential
programs), and the domestically financed investment expenditures, as well as introducing
more stringent measures on official's travel and communications expenses; (ii)                                        increase
domestic borr~wing;'~              and (iii)appeal to development partners to provide additional

'' Itshould be noted that this amount does not include the cost o fthe increase inthe PSA in2008, since this
measure was already part o f the 2008 budget, and the likely expansion insocial protection programs
(expected to take place with donor funding).
l3 The fiscal measuresthat the Government adopted to minimize the impact of diesel and kerosene price
increases inthe domestic economy should not affect on Government borrowing, as they were designed to
be neutral onthe budget financing requirements. However, additional funding willbe necessary to meet

financing. At present, development partnershave not committed any additional financing
to the draft proposal.
23. For the longer term, Mozambique needs to continue to implement growth-
enhancing reforms and institutionalreforms to avoid a slow down in growth in the
medium-term. Beyond the growth challenges posed by commodity inflation, there are
some internal challenges to hture growth, and it would be hazhrdous to assume a
`business as usual' rate o f 7 percent. Most o f these challengeshave beenarticulated inthe
PARPA-11, and are part o f the government program, which i s supported by this PRSC
series. Notably, the 2005 CEM identified key constraints to accelerating shared growth
inthe needfor increasedeffectiveness inpublic spending (underpinnedby improvements
in public financial management), and the implementation of reforms to improve the
climate for private sector development and foster increasesinprod~ctivity.'~The Bank is
now working on a new Country Economic Memorandum (to be completed in FY09)
which concentrates on competitiveness promotion and trade integration as vehicles for
higherproductivity growthandwealthgeneration.

             111. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM: PARPAI1

24. In September 2006, the Government formally adopted the Second Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PARPA 11).                     PARPA I1 is the operational plan for the
governments' Five-Year Program (2005-2009), and sets out a broad and ambitious
agenda o f reforms. PARPA I1builds on the experience o f PARPA I,and was prepared
through broad-basedconsultations with major stakeholders and civil society. In2008 the
Government announced that it will extend the PARPA I1by one year to include 2010,
thereby strengtheningsustainability and continuitywith the next strategic document. The
PARPA I1 structure and priorities were discussed in the Joint Staff Advisory Note
(JSAN) presented to the Board on December 19, 2006, and also included in the PRSC-3
program document, andreference i s made to that document for details.
25. The PARPA I1for the first time includes a strategic matrix of key indicators, a
joint effort by the government, donors and civil society. These indicators are
integrated into andmonitoredthrough the annual instrumentso f the Economic and Social
Plan (PES in Portuguese) and the BdPES (Ex-post Assessment o f Implementation o f the
PES), which i s submitted annually to Parliament.


the needs for the Action Plan for FoodProduction and the measures that will result from the ongoing
discussion for the area o f social protection.
l4 part ofthe
   As            2005 CEM (inChapter 6), simulations were carried out using `growth regressions'
literature comparing Mozambique's policy performance with that o f some o fthe best performers inthe
developing world, including East Asian countries. The likely growth scenarios for the future -and the
corresponding poverty scenarios -will heavily depend on the Government's role inwarding off threats to
continued growth, as well as its role inseizing new opportunities for growth. Only rapid progress incertain
key reforms, can keepthe growth rate as high as 7 or 8 percent inthe mediumterm, and continue the rapid
rate poverty reduction o f the past decade. For instance, the 2005 CEM estimates that Mozambique could
enhance its growth performance by improving its business climate to East Asian levels. Gains o fup to 1
percentage point per annum could be made by avoiding banking crises, or by improving governance, or by
reducing government nonproductive spending. Bigger gains o fup to 3 percentage points per annum could
be securedby-intime -improving infrastructure, or byraising access to secondary education.

26. The monitoring of the PARPA I1 is open to participation from the public and
representatives of Civil Society Organizations, through the work of the Poverty
Observatories. As described in the JSAN, the PARPA I1 was prepared by the
Government through broad-based consultations with major stakeholders and civil society,
in a more participatory approach than PARPA I,involving four national and ten
provincial Poverty Observatories. The work o f the Poverty Observatories i s ongoing and
their meetings provide a forum for broad public consultation to strengthen domestic
accountability in PARPA I1 implementation and monitoring. These institutional
mechanisms, however, are still in their infancy and have very limited capacity, thereby
limitingthe effectiveness o fpublic involvement.
27. While maintaining its commitment to improve quality and access to social
services, PARPA I1 recognizes that "rapid, sustainable and broad-based growth"
warrants more emphasis on the growth of the productive and private sectors. The
strategy envisages small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as the engine o f employment
generation. Rural development has a central place in the strategy. An essential role is
attributed to districts as the focus o f development. There is also a clear recognition o f the
challenges related to HIV/AIDS, with a credible strategy for accelerating the national
response to the AIDS pandemic. Overall, the priority areas for public policy to sustain
growth and poverty reduction, and improve service delivery are arranged under three
pillars:l5(i) governance; (ii) capital; and (iii)
                                   human                        economic development.

     IV. BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

A. LINKS THE COUNTRYPARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY
            TO

28. The PRSC series is a key component of the Country Partnership Strategy
approved by the Board in May 2007, and closely aligned to the Government
program. Bank support to the PARPA I1is through the Mozambique FY08-11 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS, discussed May 30, 2007).'6 As government policies and
budget are the key instruments for implementing the PARPA, the Bank is committed to
supporting and aligning with the budget process. The indicative lending scenario of the
CPS envisages programmatic support through four consecutive PRSCs, with a focus on
supporting Mozambique's efforts in increasing accountability and public voice and
fostering sustainable and broad-based growth. Inline with the government program, and
as reflected in the CPS, the program supported by the PRSC series recognizes the
centrality o f the new growth agenda and the importance o f accelerating shared growth
through infrastructure, rural and private sector development, and enhanced governance
reforms.      The PRSC series is also well aligned with the Bank's principles on
conditionality, namely (i)reinforce ownership; (ii)strengthen harmonization; (iii)
customize program to country circumstances; (iv) select only critical actions; and (v)
ensure transparency and predictability o f process (Box 1).


l5 Keyreforms inpublic financial management were treated inthe text o fPARPA I1partly underthe pillar
o f Governance, and partly under the pillar o f Economic Development. The strategic matrix and the PAF
highlighted the importance o f these reforms by creating a fourth domain: Macroeconomic Management.

29. Strengthening governance is a key objective of the interventions supported by
the PRSC series. The PRSC series is contributing to this overarching objective through
several    channels,      including (i)strengthening              the capacity,   transparency,    and
accountability o f state institutions, both at the central level by strengthening PFM
systems and at the local level through decentralization; (ii) the demand for better
                                                                        raising
governance by supporting participation and oversight by civil society, as for example
through the activities associated with the Poverty Observatories; (iii)fostering a
competitive and responsible private sector through interventions aimed at improving the
business environment and the investment climate; and (iv) contributing to strengthen
accountability overall through the process o f joint reviews that monitor progress in
implementation o f the PARPA II.17
30. Development policy lending will be complemented by investment support and
technical assistance. PRSC support will continue to coexist with investment support to
well-articulated sector programs, and with technical assistance to develop government
systems and capacities necessary for an increased reliance on them. IDA'Sinvestment
portfolio, with 16 projects, i s diverse and supports the three pillars o f the CPS. As o f June
2008, total IDA commitments were U S D 838 million. The share o f policy-based lending
inoverall IDA disbursements inFY04-07 was below 40 percent, andis projectedto stay
at around 40 percent o f annual commitments during the CPS FY08-11. The PRSC series
supports PFM and public sector reforms, embraces the new growth agenda, and supports
the Government's focus on development at the district level. These objectives are also
supported by several IDAprojects, thereby creating strong synergies.

                           WITH                                         ON
AND COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMF

31.A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between the
Government and 19 donors (G19) providing general budget support, includingthe
World Bank. This M o Uis a breakthroughindonor harmonization inMozambique. It is
based on a set o f `fundamental principles': (i)          predictability and alignment with domestic
systems; (ii)    monitoring has to be done jointly and that all "conditionality" has to be
based on the common PAF; (iii)             no separate reporting to the donors is required; (iv)
mutual accountability. Reference is made to the PRSC-3 document for details (and also
the Mozambique Program Aid Partnership website: www.pap.org.mz ).
32. Implementation of the Paris Declaration is monitored by the G19, the UN
agencies and other developmentpartners. The big challenges are to align project aid
with the national budget system, integrate it as much as possible with the government's
treasury and reporting system, and reduce the number o f Project Implementation Units.
There has been substantial progress in2006 and 2007 to bringproject aid on-budget, and
the percentage o f development aid now on-budget is estimated at above 90 percent as of
2007. As a result, the budget is increasingly becoming a meaninghl instrument for
decision-making on resource allocation, and linkingresources to results. The 2008


"  The PRSC series is well aligned with the Bank's strategy to enhance governance and anti-corruption in
client countries, as laid out in the paper entitled "Strengthening Bank Group Engagement on Governance
andAnticorruption", released inSeptember 2006.

Box 1: Alignmentbetweenthis PRSC andGoodPracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle1:ReinforceOwnership
The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's strategy to support the implementation of Mozambique's
Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA I1by its Portuguese acronym), and
the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the Government and the nineteen external partners (the
G19). PARPA I1is structured around three pillars (Governance, HumanCapital, and Economic Development) and
i s the operational plan o f the Government's Five-Year Program. The first PRSC series was successfully deployed in
2001and overall progress o f the reforms has been satisfactory as the government continues to pursue a far-reaching
reform agenda with the new government elected in December 2004 deepening reforms to reduce poverty. The
PRSC series has also been informedby significant amount o f analytical work completed over the past few years.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
Progress on the reforms is monitoredwith the aid o f the PAF. Improvedservice delivery inPARPA priority sectors,
i.e. agriculture, health, education, rural water supply, infrastructure, justice and related governance sectors, i s
monitored through Joint Sector Working Groups. Progress inachieving all the indicators contained inthe PAF is
assessed twice a year through the Joint Review in April and the Mid-Year Review in September. The sector
working groups have become a good mechanism for policy dialogue, donor harmonization, and for reaching
agreement between the Government and all the donors involved in a specific sector. Furthermore, a joint Budget
Working Group meets on a quarterly basis with the Government to monitor budget execution, particularly inthe
priority sectors.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The PRSC series is designed to focus first on key constraints in cross-cutting areas such as public financial
management and the business environment, which are the areas that provided the rationale for the prior actions o f
PRSC-3. The series then evolves to support decentralization and shared growth through the incorporation o f
triggers for PRSC-4 and PRSC-5. Inorder to reduce the transaction costs for the Government, the Bank carries out
all supervision jointly with the other donors. A Joint Review takes place each year inApril (year n).It assesses the
performance o f the government inthe previous budget year, which corresponds to the calendar year (year n-1).The
review focuses on evaluating progress with regard to the indicators defined in the PAF and makes an overall
assessment o f progress, resulting indisbursement commitments for the following year (year n+l).The second event
i s the Mid-Year Review in September. This review i s forward-looking and formalizes the agreement on the
performance indicators and targets for the following year (year n+l).Programmatic lending will be complemented
by investmentsupport. PRSC support will coexist with investment support to well-articulated sector programs, and
with technical assistance to develop government systems and capacities necessary for an increased reliance on
them.

Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achievingresultsas conditionsfor disbursement
As agreed with the development partners and the Government, and in line with the Bank move towards increased
harmonization, starting with this PRSC series (PRSC 3, 4, and 5) the Bank moved to use PRSC triggers selected
from the commonPAF usedby all G19 partners. All the prior actions and triggers o f this PRSC series are indicators
contained in the PAF and were selected because o f their criticality for achieving objectives which are consistent
with the government's own monitoring framework and to be in line with donor harmonization for general budget
support. There results framework comprises 7 prior actions for PRSC-3, 10 prior actions for PRSC-4, and 10 prior
actions for PRSC-5.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
The Bank's supervision of the PRSC series is aligned with the supervision of the joint General Budget Support
program o f the G19. Both the Joint and the Mid-Year Review are a multi-sector exercises, and Bank staff
participate inall relevant sectors. Disbursementswill be contingent on satisfactory progress towards a subset o f the
PARF'A's medium-term objectives as set out in the PAF matrix. In addition, the review process is explicitly
designed to allow announcing budget financing amount early inthe year in the budget preparation cycle and to
disburseearly inthe budget year, a principle to which the Bank adheres.

budget made fbrther progress, and most o f the externally financed projects are now
included in the budget. In terms o f next steps, in September 2007 the Government
finalized the multi-currency module to the Single Treasury Account (Conta Unica do
Tesouro, CUT) and is actively encouraging donors to put all their projects on-CUT
(which will also help ensure that the projects are on-budget).              In addition, the public
financial management reforms and procurement reforms supported by the G19 (and also
supported by this PRSC series) are expected to facilitate increased use o f country systems
byIDA andother development partners.
33. The Bank and the IMF cooperate very closely within their respectivemandates
in assisting the Government to implement the PARPA. In order to coordinate their
work programs for the next two to three years, the IMF and the World Bank teams in
Mozambique organized a one day retreat in Maputo during the first review o f the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) on November 5, 2007. The IMF leads the policy dialogue on
macroeconomic policy (including fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies), the
integrated financial management information system (SISTAFE) and tax and customs
reforms. The Bank leads the policy dialogue on public expenditure management, sector
structural reforms, reforms o f the civil service, and poverty and social impact analysis.
Areas o f close collaboration include banking supervision, financial sector issues, trade
issues, the PARPA, and external debt sustainability. The practice o f holdingjoint IMF-
IDA missions has both had synergistic benefits, and has reduced the burden on
Government o f multiple missions. Development partners are also involved in specific
policy discussions, since all stakeholders agree that many macroeconomic policy
outcomes have structural foundations that development partners can usefully support.
Even though the IMF i s not a member o f the G19 General Budget Support donors group,
the timing o f its missions is such as to be synchronized with the Joint and Mid-Year
Review process o f the G19.

  V. THE PROPOSED POVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

A. OVERALL     DESCRIPTION

34. The proposed fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-5) is the third
operation in a series of three annual operations supporting the implementationof
the PARPA II.'* design and objectives o f the PRSC series were elaborated in the
                     The
Program Document for the PRSC-3, and only a brief summary o f key aspects is provided
inthis document.
35. The PRSC series is fully harmonized within the joint donor (G19) mechanism
for the provisionof general budget support. All the prior actions and triggers o f the
PRSC series are indicators contained in the PAF (see Annex 2). IDA'Sfocus will be
geared at specific areas, which are a subset o f the PAF (which itself is a subset o f the
strategic matrix o f PARPA 11). This i s an important feature o f the proposed operations
as, by relying on the PAF, the PRSC series will remain consistent with the government's
own monitoring framework and will also be in line with donor harmonization for general

18An ICRwill be carriedout immediately after PRSC-5 to review the series, and informthe preparationof
the next PRSC series.

budget support. In addition, it also ensures that the program o f reforms supported by the
PRSC has been fully discussed with Civil Society Organizations in the preparation o f
PARPA 11, and that the monitoring o f implementation is open to participation from the
public and representatives o f Civil Society Organizations, through the work o f the
Poverty Observatories and the two Annual Reviews (see Box 1).
36. The PRSC series supports a strategic subset of objectives from the PARPA I1
resultsmatrix. As intermediate outcomes the PRSC series supports improvements in:
    (1) Macroeconomic management: Consolidate and deepen institutional reforms to
        strengthen public financial management system.
    (2) Reforms in governance: Support public sector reform, and also accelerate
        decentralizatioddeconcentration to enhance service delivery at the provincial and
        district level, and empower communities.
    (3) Economic development: Improve the business environment, by removing
        constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, andpromoting agricultural growth.
37. The PRSC-5 supports specific ongoing reforms which are part of the above
program, and also supports the Government's response to the higher food and fuel
prices. The PRSC-5 supports reforms to improve macroeconomic management by
aligning the budget with economic policy priorities expressed in the PARPA and the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), continuing the rollout o f e-SISTAFE,
strengthening the Central Revenue Authority, continuing the implementation o f the new
State procurement system, and increasing the coverage and efficiency o f internal and
external audit bodies. The reforms to improve governance focus on creating the single
registry o f State officials and civil servants, as a basis to create an integrated payroll
management system, and approving the national program o f capacity building for
decentralized planning and finance.         In terms o f economic development, the PRSC-5
supports the government's efforts to increase the amount o f road maintenance and
rehabilitation, expanding the irrigated area, and expanding the number o f farmers who
benefit from extension services, in order to increase the adoption o f new technology.
Finally, the PRSC-5 also supports the implementation o f the Government policy response
to the higher global food and fuel prices, which i s focused on increasing agricultural
production andreducing Mozambique's future vulnerability to increases infood prices.
38. The policy matrix and results framework for the PRSC series in Annex 1
presents the specific areas supported by the PRSC series. As indicated above, the
PRSC policy matrix and results framework i s a sub-set o f the PAF matrix used by the
G19.''  The prior actions have been selected based on their criticality for contributing to
achieve the PARPA-I1objectives. The criteria reflect the following two broad principles:
(i)Thetriggerentails apolicyorinstitutionalreformwhichiscriticaltoremoveakey
constraint to poverty reduction and growth (based on the findings o f existing analytical
work), or is an implementation activity o f a reform initiated earlier; (ii)     The trigger i s part
o f the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), and the assessment can be done
easily, e.g. verifying whether a law or some regulation has been approved. An additional
prior action has been introduced in PRSC-5 to reflect the Government's policy response

PRSC series (Annex 2).

to the higher food and fuel prices (see details in Section V, pages 38-41, paragraphs 80-
85).
39. The program supportedby the PRSC series has been informed by a significant
amount of analyticalwork completedover the pastfew years. A summary ofthe main
analytical studies which have informed the design o f the PRSC series was discussed in
the PRSC-3 document.20More recently, a Poverty Assessment was completed in2007, a
new CPAR and a new PEFA assessment have been carried out in2008 (see Figure 1and
Box 2, respectively), and preparation o f a new CEM, a new ICA, and a policy note on the
impact of the higher food and fuel prices, are very advanced. The policies and reforms
supported by the PRSC focus on the challenges to sustained growth and poverty
reduction inMozambique which have beenidentifiedinthe studies.


B. PLANNEDLEVEL BUDGETSUPPORTUNDERPRSC-5
                        OF

40. The program supportedby the PRSC series is progressing well, as reflected by
Mozambique's uninterruptedrecord of good economic management, the successful
completion of the Joint Review in April 2008 and the 2"d review of the IMF PSI
programin May 2008. The progress on the (PRSC and the) overall reforms program is
monitoredwith the aid o f the PAF, inthe context o f thejoint donor (G19) mechanismfor
the provision of general budget support. The Joint Review of April 2008, which was
completed inApril 2008, has carried out an evaluation o f performance during 2007. The
Joint Review concluded that overall progress with the reforms program in 2007 was
satisfactory, and that there exists a satisfactory basis for the donors to continue to give
budget support, even though the G19 continue to be concerned regarding the limited
progress in the area o f governance. Good progress was made in macroeconomic
management, and in Public Financial Management, including the strengthening o f the
MTEF process, the start of a pilot of program budgeting (in three sectors for the 2008
budget), the continued roll-out and use o f e-SISTAFE, and the implementation o f the
procurement system. Significant progress was also made in revenue collection and tax
administrations reforms, and towards the civil service salary reform. Progress was also
good in the human development sectors (health, education, water and sanitation, and
social protection), in the financial sector reforms, and in the implementation o f the road
sector program. A few areas of weak performance were also identified. Notably, further
improvements in institutional capacity will be neededto strengthen the mechanisms for
poverty monitoring and for the allocation of public resources to strategic objectives, and
also to accelerate the HIV/AIDS prevention programs.                Additional attention by the

Government will also be required to maximize the benefits from the use o f natural
resources, andto acceleratethe implementation o f the Anti-Corruption Strategy.
41. With regard to the specific program supported by the PRSC series, the
Government has fulfilled 10 out of 12 triggers, and has made good progress in the
remaining2 triggers. Table 6 shows the original triggers for PRSC-5, the final prior
actions, and explains any discrepanciesbetween the two. The table provides a summary
o f overall progress achieved compared to original expectations. A detailed sector-by-
sector discussion o f each indicator i s providedinthe next section.
42. In light of the higher IDA allocation, and to support the Government's response
to the rising food and fuel prices the size of the PRSC-5 has been increased to
USDlOO million, which also includes USDlO million from the GFRP Trust Fund.
Given the new IDA allocation, and the goal agreed inthe Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) of providing 40 percent o f the IDA allocation as Direct Budget Support, the
amount o f budget support for 2009 has been increased to USD80 million (which i s
USDlO million above the amount originally envisaged in the CPS).21 The PRSC-5 will
also disburse the USDlO million in budget support for 2008, which could not be
disbursed with PRSC-4 due to lack resources under IDA14.22 The PRSC-5 will also
disburse an additional USDlO million in budget support for 2008 that have been
approved for Mozambique under the GFRP Trust Fund to assist finance the
Government's responseto the food and fuel price crisis (see Section V).




2'For comparison, the total level o f budget support providedby the external partners to the Government
(currently known as G19, because there are 19partners) was USD287 million in2006 and USD375 million
in2007, while commitments for 2008 are USD385 million, andcommitments for 2009are USD455
million. This amount corresponds approximately to 17percent o f the annualbudget, and 30 percent o f
recurrent expenditures.
22As explained inthe PRSC-4documentation, the amount ofPRSC-4 was lower than originally plannedby
USDlOmillion, due to lack resources underIDA14. As advisedbyOPCSduringpreparationofPRSC-4,
the team is planning to disburse the balance o fbudget support for 2008 (USD10 million) with PRSC-5.

C. PROGRESSIMPLEMENTING THE REFORMPROGRAM
                  IN                                                   SUPPORTED BY THE PRSC

43. The reformprogramcontinues to be broadly on track as confirmed by the Joint
Review inApril 2008, as well as the secondreview ofthe IMF'sPSIin May 2008. As
highlighted above, and detailed in the PRSC-3 program document, the progress on the
(PRSC and the) overall reforms program is monitored with the aid o f the PAF, in the
context o f thejoint donor (G19) mechanism for the provision o f general budget support.23
Drawing on information from the Aide-Memoire o f the Joint Review o f April 2008,24this
section highlights the recent progress and future challenges inthe reform areas supported
bythe PRSC series, with a focus on the triggers for PRSC-5.

Macroeconomic Management
44. Mozambique's good macroeconomic performance has been a key element o f the
excellent growth record inthe past decade. Moving ahead there is a need to continuously
improve the use o f public expenditures, consolidate macroeconomic stability, and
strengthen public finance management.                Without improvements in these areas, the
country's highgrowth rate will be put at risk.
Improvethe budgetprocess and the use of publicexpenditures
The objective of these reforms is to strengthen the allocation of public expenditures
through the budgetpreparation and execution process. Thefocus of PRSC-3 and PRSC-
4 was on guaranteeing a minimum level of actual expendituresfor priority sectors, while
PRSC-5 supports alignment of the expenditures with the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework. The reforms have introduced the MTEF as the key framework for medium
terms Jinancial planning and resource allocations, and the Government is now in the
process of adopting a programmatic budget classijkation to allow better links between
PARPA, MTEF, and budget allocations.
45. There is needto improvethe links betweenPARPA,MTEF, and the budget, and
to ensure adequate funding for priority sectors. In line with government efforts, in
recent years there has been an improvement in the level o f budget execution, and an
increasing share o f the budget has been allocated to priority sectors, as defined in the
PARPA I1 (prior actions for PRSC-3 and PRSC-4).                     The Government has also been
strengthening the Medium term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to use it as the basis for
the sectoral budget allocations, and support programmatic implementation of PARPA 11.
In 2006 for the first time a 3-year MTEF was approved by the Council o f Ministers,
shortly before the start o f the budget preparationprocess. The MTEFpreparationprocess
has improved substantially from year to year in the past three years since its beginning,
and the MTEF is becoming increasingly important instrument for budget formulation,


23The monitoring o fprogress on the reforms i s done through the Joint Sector Working Groups, which also
include Government representatives. The assessment i s done on the basis o f the indicators contained inthe
PAF, andthrough an annual Joint Review conducted inApril. Another review inSeptember sets goals for
the subsequent year. The sector working groups have become a good mechanism for policy dialogue, donor
harmonization, and for reaching agreement between the Government and all the donors involved ina
specific sector. Furthermore, ajoint Budget Working Group meets on a quarterly basis with the
Government to monitor budget execution, particularly inthe priority sectors.
24The Aide-Memoire i s available on line at http://www.pap.org,mz/jr-08.htm


                                                - 21 -

and thereby its political standing has also increased substantially. However, the MTEF
has still not progressed to being the instrument used to facilitate strategic allocation and
operational efficiency o f resource^.^'       Partially this i s due to the lack o f clarity in the
medium term resource envelope (notably for external funding). Also, the quality o f
MTEF and budget submissions by sector ministries has been variable in the past few
years-in      most cases they are not the result o f costing and prioritization o f
programs/activities. As a result, MTEF allocation decisions and ceilings are still too soft
with not enough political clout behind them. As an initial step towards strengthening
the MTEF, the Ministry of Finance ensured that the total allocation topriority sectors
in the 2008 budget was in line with the MTEF (a triggerfor PRSC-5). It i s important to
note that the share o f the budget expected to go to priority sectors in2008 i s expected to
remain at least as in previous years, in line with the PARPA I1 targets.                      Further
strengthening of the MTEF is needed to improve future budgetary performance and
strategic resource allocation, notably by ensuring that in future the budget ceilings for
each sector are in line with the first year o f the MTEF. In order to improve the outcome
orientation o f the budget, and to better link the budget with the MTEF and the PARPA,
the Government in 2008 started a pilot of program budgeting in three sectors (public
works, agriculture and interior), and i s planning to extend the pilot to the full budget
starting in2009.
46. The Government is also making progress in other key aspects of budget
preparation and execution. Startingwith the 2008 budget, the government has adopted
functional classifiers in e-SISTAFE (and also programmatic classification in some pilot
programs), and will start using it in Budget Execution Reports for 2008 budget, which
will substantially improve the monitoring of the budget execution.                       Secondly, in
collaboration with development partners, the government has continued to improve the
information on the external component, and is making use of the ODAMoz database
(www.odamoz.org.mz). The ODAMoz now constitutes a prime information source on
commitment and disbursement in the external component o f the budget and it also
contains relevant information for the common funds (commitment and disbursement). A
challenge i s the integrationo f all donors inthe ODAMoz, so that it can offer transparent,
accessible and complete information. The government has also made progress with the
operationalization o f the multi-currency Single Treasury Account (CUT), which will
allow the projects to be entered in the CUT. The government remains committed to
improve the percentage o f external funds on-CUT, and has committed to a target o f 60
percent by end-2009. To this end, the government has elaborated an on-CUT guide, with
information on classification and reports, and several donors have started the process to
include more external funds inthe CUT.
Strengthen macroeconomic stabilitv bv improvinp revenue collection
The objective of these reforms is to raise more domestic revenue to support
Mozambique's poverty reduction programs and ultimately reduce aid dependency.
PRSC-3 supported the creation of the new Central Revenue Authority (Autoridade
Tributbria de MoCambique, ATM), PRSC-4 supported the operationalization of the ATM


25It is worth notingthat as partof the move towards integrated, long-termplanning, the PARPA I1will be
replacedthe Five Year GovernmentPlan(Progrurnu Quinquennul do Governo)whichwillbe elaboratedin
2010by the nextGovernment.

through the adoption of its Information Technology Plan, and PRSC-5 seeks to
consolidate the reform process resulting in an increase in total revenues. As a result of
the reforms, Mozambique now has a well-organized and professional revenue authority,
which is leading the effort to simplib the tax policy and legislation, improve the quality
of services to the taxpayers, and achieving notable improvements in revenue collection.
47. Macroeconomicstability and predictability is the crucial foundation for growth
and povertyreduction. As highlightedinthe 2005 CEM, the mainchallenge interms of
macroeconomic stability is on the fiscal side, and namely that revenue performance needs
to improve because the Government's spending requirements in education, health and
infrastructure will likely continue to rise, at leastpari passu with population. Inaddition,
aid as a percentage o f GDP is likely to fall from its current very highlevel o f 15 percent.
Hence it is imperative that Mozambique raise more domestic revenue to support its
poverty reduction programs and ultimately reduce aid dependency. The plan of the
PARPA-I1i s to raise revenue by 0.5 percent o f GDP annually. A critical aspect o f this
program, which is supported by the PRSC series, i s to improve the organization and
capacity of revenue institutions.
48. The Government's tax reform program aims to develop a simpler,
comprehensive, fair and balancedtaxation regime. Ingeneral the performance of the
tax reformprocess has beengood, and characterized by continuous efforts to improve the
efficiency o f the tax administration, the consolidation o f the taxes and the modernization
o f customs proceedings for trade facilitation.               As a critical part of the reforms, the
government successfully established the Central Revenue Authority (ATM), which
integrates the general administration o f taxes and customs in one single entity, and
became operational and started to function formally when its president took office in
November 2006 (PRSC-3 prior action). As part o f the reforms, the Information
Technology Plan (PDTI) for 2007-2010 o f the new Central Revenue Authority was
elaborated by end 2006 and approved in June 2007 (PRSC-4 prior action), and will
ensure the development o f an adequate system to manage and control information that
supports all taxes. Tax legislation i s also being strengthened. Following the December
2006 approval by Parliament o f new legislation on the fiscal regimes for the mining and
oil sectors, the new laws have become effective in mid-2007, and regulations have since
been approved to implement them, including model contracts. InDecember 2007, the
Parliament also approved new tax laws on Value Added Tax and Personal Income Tax.26
The new VAT Code replaces the previous Code and the dispersed enactments that
amendedit, and clarifies the list ofVAT exempt transactions and exemptions for specific



26 The new VAT Code provides an extensive list o fVAT exempt transactions and exemptions for specific
goods. Temporary exemptions on sales o f sugar, vegetable oil and soap have beenkept inplace until2010,
along with exemptions on equipment, raw materials, spare-parts and certain services supplied inconnection
with these goods. The new Personal Income Tax Code seeks to simplify the system of direct taxation on
income, and introduces a number of changes to the current rules. Inparticular, income thresholds and tax
brackets have beenupdated. A new threshold for non-taxable income has beenestablished. Annual income
o f up to 36 times the minimummonthly wage will not be taxed, which means that a greater number of low
income earners will fall inthe non-taxable income bracket. Income inexcess o f the non-taxable minimum
is still taxed at rates ranging from 10 percent to 32 percent but income thresholds for each tax bracket have
changed. The highest income tax rate o f 32 percent now applies only to income over 1.5 million Meticais.

goods. The new Personal Income Tax Code simplifies the system o f direct income
taxation, andupdates the income thresholds and tax brackets.
49. Government efforts in consolidating the tax reforms and strengthening the
management of ATM, are resulting in increased total collected revenues. Total
revenues continued to grow in 2007 reaching 16.4 percent o f GDP, which represents an
increase in revenues of almost onepercent of GDP in 2007 as compared to 2006 (and
0.4 percent of GDP higher than forecast), well above the target of 0.5percent (a
trigger for PRSC-5). This i s in line with the authorities overall program to increase
revenues by 0.5 percent o f GDP on an annual basis over the next few years. The highest
growth was in income tax (and particularly in corporate tax collections), which however
still constitutes a relatively small percentage o f total revenue. Taxes international trade
have few and low rates, and only account for 1.8 percent o f GDP (and this level is
expected to reduce further in 2008 as a result of joining SADC free trade area). Taxes
and royalties from existing `mega-projects' (which are almost exclusively related to the
exploitation o f natural resources) remain small at present, due to the favorable tax
regimes they were offered to attract the investors to Mozambique.                Now that
Mozambique has established itself as a secure location for foreign investment, the new
fiscal regimes (approved in 2007 and) applicable to all future mining and petroleum
contracts are expected to substantially increaserevenue streams for the country.
50. Given the process of regional integration in the SADC, and the inherent loss of
revenue from external trade, it will be critical to further enhance the revenue
collectionefforts. Progresswas made in2007 inthe consolidation of the structure of the
RevenueAuthority, and the improvement of operational performance was observed inthe
reduction of the levels o f fiscal evasion and fraud, and inthe process of VAT repayment
management. The priorities include the improvement o f budgeting and the accounting of
own revenue; the recuperation of accumulated tax debts; and the increase o f the revenue
from the exploitation of natural resources. Proper budgeting and VAT payment by the
Government in investment projects with external financing remains a priority, just as the
beginning functioning o f the fiscal courts and the reduction of transaction costs in the
import/export o f merchandise. With respect to the facilitation o f trade, good progress is
underway in aligning national legislation with international conventions to simplify
customs procedures, with the approval o f several regulations. Special attention is also
being given to inspections and to the strengthening of the capacity to carry out post-
clearance audits.    Additional progress i s also being made in adopting a risk-based
approach incustoms inspections.
Improvethe efficiency and effectivenessof public financialmanapement
The objective of this set of reforms is to implement thepolicies andprocedures embedded
in the SISTAFE PFM reform law. These would result in sounder budgeting practices,
tighter internal controls, more eficient cash management, more accurate accounting and
reporting and auditing compliant with international standards. One of the main steps in
this implementation process involves the setting up of an integrated electronic financial
management system (e-SISTAFE). PRSC-3 launched the software on a pilot basis,
PRSC-4 rolled out to most ministries at the central level, and PRSC-5 completes the roll
out to all Ministries at central and provincial level. As a result of these reforms,
Mozambique is now managing most of its public finances through a modern electronic


                                            - 24 -

system, paving the way for substantial improvements accountability, transparency, and
efflcien cy.
51.Improvements in public financial management are essential for continued
economic growth in Mozambique.The 2005 CEM advocates that strengthening public
financial management systems will be critical for growth in the next decade because: (i)
improved spending efficiency i s needed to achieve better service delivery, which in turn
is needed to spur growth, particularly in infrastructure, education and health;27 (ii)                 total
expenditure can no longer expand at the rate it used to, and are likely to remain at 24-25
percent o f GDP, makingit essential to secure efficiency improvements inthe future; (iii)
without steady improvement in public finance management some o f the high levels o f
donor fundingmay beput at risk.
52. The Government has embarked on a sequencedprogramof reform, and Public
financial management (PFM) systems have shown major improvements in recent
years. The 2006 PEFA assessment (published in 2006 and assessing performance in
2004) highlighted the weakest areas o f public financial management systems to be
accounting, auditing, and procurement.                  Based on the 2006 PEFA assessment, the
authorities prepared and have been implementing the medium-term `Public Financial
Management Action Plan and Budget' (PFM-APB) for 2006-2009, which has been
agreed with the donors and is financed through a multi-donor common fund. The APB is
well-structured and the proposed phasing of implementation is ambitious but feasible.
The new 2008 PEFA assessment (assessing performance in 2006) highlights that
significant improvements have been made inthe quality o f PFM during the period 2004-
2006, in particular with the implementation o f the integrated electronic financial
management system (e-SISTAFE). A summary of the findings o f the 2008 PEFA
assessment is provided inBox 2.
53. The cornerstone of the authorities' action plan to strengthen Public Financial
Management is           the implementation of the integrated electronic financial
management system (e-SISTAFE).28 Following the initial pilot in three ministries in
early 2006 (PRSC-3 prior action), the basic functionality o f e-SISTAFE (namely the
direct budget execution module) was rolled out to 22 Ministries by end-2006 (PRSC-4
prior action).      I n 2007, largely according to plan, the e-SISTAFE (direct budget
execution module) was rolled out to all remaining ministries at the central and
provincial levels (a trigger for PRSC-5).29 Further, by March 2008 e-SISTAFE was
successfully rolled out to 31 districts-or 4 districts more than initially envisaged. The
roll-out was accompanied by an extensive training program, involving 1850 users (more



27The PER 2003 found that public works are substantially (20-30 percent) more expensive inMozambique
than inthe region.
28The reforms started with the approval of a new financial management law in2001 and accompanying
regulations in2002, which set the basis both for modernaccounting procedures and for procurement
reform.
29By early 2008, e-SISTAFE hadbeenrolled-out to all 25 Ministries and 7 State Organs (out o fa total o f
32) at central and provincial level, and a total o f 544 UGEs across the whole country. The Ministries and
State Organs to which the systemwas rolled-out are now satisfactorily executing their budgets for goods
and services and capital expenditure.Payments o f salaries continue to be executed centrally by the
accounting department o f the Ministry o f Finance.

or less 6 users per cost center). Users have acquired good operational skills and are now
at a level ofbeing able to formulate requests for additional functionality.


Box 2: Summary of the findingsof the 2008 PEFA

Mozambique is one o f the first countries to have completed a series o f two successive PEFA
assessments: the first was finalized in2006 (based on complete data for the 2004 fiscal year and partial
data for 2005) whereas the second was finalized in early 2008 (based on complete data for 2006 and
partial data for 2007). These reports provide a good picture o f aggregate progress as well as o f relative
progress for each step of the budget cycle.

Between 2006 and 2008, out o f a total o f 31 indicators (including 3 indicators on donor practices), the
number o f indicators rated B and above increased from 10 to 16, while those rated C and below were
reduced from 13 to 8 (of the two indicators rated D in 2008, one pertained to the proportion o f foreign
aid that uses country systems, whereas the other was due to the lack of public expenditure tracking
surveys between 2005 and 2008). Figure 1 highlights that the areas that showed the most significant
progress included payroll, procurement and internal controls, cash management, revenue collection and
management and donor practices, whereas there was less progress on the indicators pertaining to
credibility of the budget and external oversight and a slight deterioration on reporting due to the lack of
PETS. Areas for improvement (rated D+ or below) included the oversight o f aggregate fiscal risk inthe
public sector, the effectiveness o f tax collection, the availability o f information on resources received by
service delivery units, and the scope, nature and follow-up of external audit.        This overall assessment
was confirmed by the fiscal transparency ROSC conducted in2007 by the IMF.

54. In addition to rolling out of e-SISTAFE, the Government has started critical
complementary reformsfocused towards achievingthe benefitsthat the e-SISTAFE
can deliver. Withinthe e-SISTAFEreform, one of the results with the highest impact in
terms o f improvement in Public Finance Management i s direct budget execution
(according to the sequence of commitment, verification, and payment), as this would
increase transparency, improve information on public spending and reduce the risk o f
diversion o f finds. The roll out and implementation o f e-SISTAFE in all Ministries at
central and provincial level in 2007, has allowed the transition from the previous system
o f advance payments towards a modern system o f direct budget execution. As o f 2007
budget units started to make their payments directly by bank transfer from the Single
Treasury Account, such that over 80 percent o f goods and services transactions are now
carried out live through e-SISTAFE, leading to significant benefits in terms o f internal
control and transparency. In addition, in 2007 the Government has also developed a
multicurrency module for the single treasury account (CUT), to facilitate inclusion o f all
donor-financed projects on-CUT, and donors are getting ready to bring projects on-CUT.
Further, the government started use of functional classifiers in its 2008 budget
preparation and execution, and the new classifiers will be used in Budget Execution
Reports for 2008. As mentioned above, the Government has also started a pilot o f
program budgeting inthree sectors, so as to provide detail sufficient to permit analysis o f
poverty impacts o f government spending.
55. Mozambique's fiduciary accountability has improved significantly in recent
years, but challengesremain. Inaddition to highlightingthe significant progress during
2004-2006, the 2008 PEFA report emphasizes several remaining weaknesses and
challenges, for instance, in the vigilance o f aggregate fiscal risk, and in the scope o f
follow-up actions o f external scrutiny and auditing. The main challenge i s to ensure the
sustainability o f the reforms and to realize the desired outcomes o f the reforms, in
particular through the consolidation o f the procurement reform and the deepening of the
SISTAFE reform, and through the use of the instruments of improving the strategic
allocation of resources and improvement o f the system o f internal control, financial
records and accounting, to bring about animprovement infiscal transparency.
56. Building on the main results and recommendations of the PEFA assessment, as
well as the 2007 ROSC on fiscal transparency, and the ongoing assessment of the
procurement system (CPAR), the Government intends to develop a new PFM
strategy in 2008. This PFM strategy will include an action plan, to be developed and
agreed upon during 2008, which will prioritize a series o f short and medium-term
activities, as well as structural reforms at the long term, in order to consolidate and
deepenthe developments inthe public finance management system.
Make the Stateprocurementsystemfor goods and services transparentand efficient
The objective of these reforms is to introduce and implement a new procurement system
that meets international standards of efficiency and accountability. PRSC-3 supported the
creation of     the new     central procurement      institution. PRSC-4 supports      the
operationalization of the unit. PRSC-5 supports the establishment of a monitoring system
to increase transparency and measure the effectiveness of the reforms. The new central
procurement institution (UFSA) has been quite successful in asserting itself as the central
public procurement authority through capacity-buildingprograms and by disseminating


                                            - 27 -

tools that are essential to the eficient public procurement operation (bidding documents
and manuals). Further, UFSA has established a website that provides a wealth of useful
information on the legal and regulatory framework, bidding documents, invitations to
bid, and selected statistics onpublic procurement,
57. Substantialprogresswas achievedin 2006 and 2007 inthe implementationof the
procurement reforms. Revised regulations governing procurement were approved in
December 2005 so as to promote competition and transparency. A new central
procurement institution, the FunctionalUnit o f Supervision o f Acquisition (UFSA), was
established and staffed, and became operational in 2006 (PRSC-3 prior action). A
director, staff and consultants have been appointed, and a website i s also operational at
http://www.ufsa.gov.mz (or alternatively at http://www.concursospublicos.gov.mz ). In
addition, following the identification o f 776 Units for Execution and Management o f
Acquisition (UGEAs) at central and provincial level, a first set o f 472 UGEAs had been
established (as o f end-2007). Hence, most o f the activities envisaged as part o f second
phase of implementation o f the procurement reforms have been completed (PRSC-4 prior
action).     These reforms were accompanied by a comprehensive process o f capacity
building in the application of the new procurement regulations, aimed at increasing the
number of specialized procurement technicians. Specifically around 1800 technicians
have beentrained at central, provincial, district and local municipality levels, which will
facilitate the adoption o f the new procurement system at the decentralized level. In
addition, the Government has started the development of an adequate monitoring
system to allow measurement of the performance of the reforms (a trigger for PRSC-
5jq30As part o f this effort, the donors and government have carried out an evaluation of
the national procurement systems in February 2008 based on the OECDDAC
methodology, which will provide baselines for the monitoring indicators. This exercise
was carried out as part o f the preparation o f a new Country Procurement Assessment
Review (CPAR), which is expected to be completed in late 2008, and will provide a
systematic update on the situation o f the procurement system in Mozambique and
identifynext steps inthereforms program. Figure2 provides a summarychart ofprogress
inprocurement reforms over thepast 6 years, usingthe OECDDAC methodology.
58. A few challenges remain. Firstly, there are several areas where more progress i s
needed. For instance, while most UFSA staff and consultants have been appointed, not
all key positions have yet been adequately filled. Further, while the training program
implementedby UFSA has played an important role inthe dissemination ofthe rules and
regulations o f the procurement function, the time has come to adopt a more
strategic/sustainable approach to capacity building, including professionalization o f the
procurement function through accreditation, certification, and more targeted training.
Also, the link with the key ministries through the sector specialists, as foreseen in the
UFSA regulations, has only taken place for the Ministry o f Public Works and Housing

30 Specifically, as an initial step,by end-2007 UFSA is now able to provide data to assesswhether: (i)    the
availability o f information on public purchases available from UFSA shows that at least 50% o f contracts
o f the public sector were subject to public tender inaccordance withthe current Mozambicanprocurement
legislation; (ii) information on other modalities o f contract with the duejustification inat least 90% at the
central level and 50% at the district and provincial level communicated to UFSA; (iii)    the process o f
complaints, as defined inthe current Mozambicanprocurement legislation, is operational and UFSA has
data on the process and decisions available).

(MoPWH). More efforts need to be made as significant procurement weaknesses remain
in individual sectors and ministries. Further, there have been delays in completing the
action planfor procurement reforms, the provisiono f support to the operation of UGEAs,
the elaboration o fthe plan for the strengtheninginternalcontrols, andthe elaboration of a
model to share information on procurement between provinces/districts. Secondly, there
remain various areas o f overlap with the other norms and regulations which need to be
clarified (examples: form o f inspections by the IGF and the TA, and the integration with
the SISTAFE).

Increasecoverape and efficiency of internalaudit bodies
The objective of these reforms is to increase eficiency                 and accountability by
strengthening the internal audit institution (IGF). In order to achieve this PRSC-4 and
PRSC-5 support increased capacity of the IGF to conduct audits. As a result of the
reforms the internal audit unit has expanded its capacity and is increasingly playing a
valuable role in improving the efJiciency and accountability of public jnancial
management in Mozambique.
59. The internal audit institution (IGF) has been substantially strengthened in
recent years and audit coverage is expanding. In2006 the Government recruited 54
new technicians, thus improving the inspection capacity for the coming years. Also, IGF
finalized the basic internal auditing manual.        In parallel, there has been substantial
progress inrecent years inexpanding the coverage o f auditing at all levels o f government.
The number o f audits completed by the IGF in 2006 was almost double compared to
2005, and IGF carried out almost all planned audit activities. From the total target
universe (districts and municipalities) 32 percent was audited (PRSC-4 prior action). In
2007 the Government also made a significant effort to expand the internal audit system,
such that the Government established Internal Audit Units in 25percent of all central
and provincial level bodies by end-2007, which however falls below the target of 30


                                              - 29 -

percent (a trigger for PRSC-5). While the target has not been achieved, it should be
noted that there were no operational internal audit units in 2006, and therefore progress
has been substantial.     Further, the progress has been all the more significant when
considering that: (i) IGF i s both reforming itself and structuring the internal audit
                       the
system for the whole of GOM; (ii) is substantial heterogeneity of sectoral internal
                                        there
audithspection bodies, which need to harmonized; and, (iii)       it is difficult shift from a
traditional inspection culture to an internal audit approach. In hindsight, therefore, it
seems fair to conclude that the trigger was overly ambitious.
60. Follow up of audit recommendationsis also beingmonitored. The Government in
2007 also carried out an evaluation o f the compliance on the part o f the audited entities
with the recommendations formulated by the IGF. As part o f the evaluation, the
Government has reviewed follow up on some 200 o f the most relevant recommendations
included in previous audit reports, and it found that approximately 70 percent o f these
recommendations hadbeenadopted.
61. Areas of weakness remain in the functioning of the internal control systems.
First, there are delays in the full implementation of the Subsystem for Internal Control
(SCI), including the institutionalizationof the Internal Control Units (OCI) in some State
organs. It has not been possible to realize most training activities o f the Subsystem for
Internal Control (SCI), owing to the non-availability of financial resources. In general,
the performance o f the Subsystem for Internal Control is still fairly weak, and moving
forward the elaboration and implementation o f the SCI plans should be a priority. An
effort by the SCI would pave the way for the OCIs to progressively assume the present
role of the IGF, thus allowing the IGF to concentrate on more complex audits and
coordination and counsel issues. Second, the internal monitoring and evaluation system
i s still weak and the sharing o f information between the different OCIs and the IGF i s not
well defined yet. It is necessary to develop a model for coordination, supervision and
reportingo f the activities developed by the OCIs. Third, there remains a needto improve
the links with the UTRAFE, in particular with respect to training and access to e-
SISTAFEby the auditors.
Increasecoverapeandefficiencyof externalaudit bodies
The objective of these reforms is to increase eficiency and accountability by
strengthening the external audit institution (Tribunal Administrativo, TA). In order to
achieve this PRSC-4 and PRSC-5 support increased capacity of the TA to conduct audits
and expand audit coverage. As capacity improves, the performance of the TA has been
increasing, and it is now increasingly respected as an independent and professional
watchdog ofpublic financial management.
62. Substantial progress has been made over the past few years in improving the
capacity and performance of external auditing. The number of audits realized by the
Supreme Audit Institution (TribunalAdministrativo, TA) has increased substantially over
the past few years, inparallel with its capacity:

  Year                   2003       2004      2005     2006      2007
  Number of audits        5           29       69       168       361




                                             - 30 -

The number o f audits carried out in 2006 was 168, o f which the auditors completed 115
audit reports (PRSC-4 prior action). Of these, 55 audits were carried out inthe districts,
for the first time. Inaddition, 45 audit reports were judged inthe course o f 2006, which
compares with 11 in 2005 and 4 in 2004. This is a significant improvement, as the
judgment i s the final stage o f the audit (and results in either the acquitting or the
attribution o f financial responsibility). I n 2007 the number of audits carried out by the
TA almost doubled to 361, from which the auditors completed 281 reports, widely
surpassing the target of 90financial audit reports (a trigger for PRSC-5). The good
performance inauditing was also marked by the submission o fthe Report and Opinion on
the State Accounts o f 2006 (Relatdrio e Parecer sobre a Conta Geral do Estado 2006) to
the Parliament within the term stipulated by law, as already done for the State Accounts
o f 2004 and o f 2005.31 These reports have also been made available on the web page o f
the TA (http://www.sislog.com/ta/), together with the reports and opinions for the years
2003, 2004,2005 (and2006 will be published on-line shortly). Further, a comparison o f
the audit opinions on the CGE for 2006 and 2005 with the earlier ones shows a
significant improvement in the comprehensiveness and quality o f the analysis. This is
partly due to improvements in the quality o f the CGE itself but also seems to reflect a
strengthening o f the capabilities o f the TA itself.
63. The response to the audit findings remains limited, however. The Mozambican
system empowers the TA to impose fines or to recommend corrective actions as a result
o f its departmental audits. Inpractice, however, the follow up is largely limited to future
audits by IGF and by TA specifically verify the implementation o f such
recommendations. In terms o f the audit o f the CGE, it is the Commisio Parlamentar
who recommends follow-up measures and a report on their implementation is included in
the TA's audit report (parecer) for the following year's CGE. There is thus a formal
response and follow-up to the TA's report and opinion on the CGE.
64. Significant challenges remain in improving the functioning of external audit.
Firstly, while the increase inthe number o f external audits is impressive, the scope o f the
audits remains limited, as it is estimated that they covered less than 50 percent o f total
expenditures in 2007.          In addition, it is important that action is taken to reduce the
relative delays in evaluation and judging of the audit processes, and to achieve an
acceptable pace in the completion o f audit processes. Holding people accountable and
responsible is an essential element for the creation of credibility inthe systems. It i s also
important for the TA to use the mechanisms at its disposal to impose sanctions and, when
necessary, to forward to the prosecuting authority those processes that contain indications
o f crimes committed. Inthis context, it will be important to institute a formal process for
 following up on Government's action to address the issues identified inthe audits.

 Governance
 65. Public Sector Governance continues to be an area with mixed performance and
remains a serious challenge. Despite some progress, implementation o f planned cross-
cutting public sector reforms i s slow. Government has created a Ministry for Public

31The NationalAccounts (Conta Geral do Estado, CGE) is audited each year and an audit report has
reached the NationalAssembly within 11months of the end of the period covered, and within 6 months o f
receipt of the financial statement (CGE)by TA, since 2004.

Service (Ministe'rio da Fun@o Pliblica in Portuguese language) to coordinate public
sector governance reforms and to improve impact o f the reform process.                  The
decentralization efforts of the Government are notable and much progress was made in
2006 with the introduction o f the investment budget for districts. However, concerns
remain about the implementation o f the investment budget and the lack o f appropriate
guidelines. Corruptionand conflict-of-interest remaincentral issues.
Strewthenthe institutionalcapacity of localgovernment
The objective of these reforms was to enhance the decentralization process. PRSC-3
supported the use of criteria to guide the allocation of district grants in the national
budget (PRSC-3). PRSC-4 was intended to support the preparation of a clear
decentralization strategy and a strategy for capacity building in planning andfinance at
local government level. However, the preparation of the decentralization strategy has
been delayed, and will not be completed within the timeframe of this PRSC series (and is
therefore no longer a trigger in this PRSC series). The national program for capacity
building in planning andfinance at the district level was also delayed, and has recently
been jnalized (under PRSC-5). In sum, whileprogress has been made in recent years,
theprocess towards increased decentralization has been slow and Mozambique still lacks
a coherent decentralization strategy. As a result, in light of the bottlenecks in
implementation, the objectives of this reform program will not befully met.
66. Decentralization is an explicit strategy of the Government for achieving many
PARPA I1 objectives, including its vision of the District as the 'polo de
desenvolvimento' (Pole o f Development).         As Mozambique is a diverse and large
country, the policy direction taken by Government towards decentralization can help
foster public accountability to citizens by bringing Government closer to the people.
Currently, municipalities are the only truly decentralized entities; mayors and city
councils are elected. Districts and provinces are still centrally-controlled. The gradual
empowerment o f district governments and local consultative councils aims to enhance
citizenparticipationinGovernment inrural areas while awaiting the gradualist expansion
of municipalities.
67. The introduction of district grants in 2006 marked a significant step in the
process of fiscal decentralization. In line with the effort to transform the district
governments into budget units, the Government in 2006 for the first time allocated
Investment Budgets for Local Initiatives (OIIL) to the districts. Specifically, as part of
the 2006 national budget, the government allocated MT7 million to each district
(approximately 3 percent o f the national budget in total). While there has been some
confusion over the guidelines for the use o f these funds (resulting in difficulties in the
execution), this allocation marked a significant step in the process o f fiscal
decentralization. Further the participatory approach introduced in the allocation o f the
district budgets at the local level created substantial impetus inthe expansion o f the local
councils in all districts. In the 2007 budget, the government increased the size o f the
transfers to the districts to a total o f 3.8 percent o f the national budget. Further, the
Government adjusted the allocation o f the funds to each district based on three criteria:
population, surface area o f the district and poverty index (PRSC-3 prior action). The
amount o f the district grants was increased to around 5 percent o f GDP in the 2008
budget, with the introduction of a complementary allocation for small infrastructure

                                            - 32 -

expenditures. Further sectoral deconcentration o f funds to district level i s under advanced
discussion inagriculture, health, education, andpublic works.
68. Following initial delays, the preparation of the National Decentralization
Strategy is now underway, and the preparationof the nationalprogramof capacity
buildingfor DecentralizedPlanning and Financeis fairly advanced. Options for the
formulation of the National Decentralization Policy and Strategy were elaborated in
2006, and guided the preparation o f a draft National Decentralization Policy in 2007.
The draft policy was unclear on the responsibilities o f various levels of the State, the
fiscal intergovernmental architecture, the relation between the planning/execution on the
part o f the sectors and the Local Administration.     The government has committed to
address these shortcomings as part o f a National Decentralization Strategy to be prepared
in2008 (originally a PRSC-4 trigger, but postponed to the next PRSC series inlight of
the new agreed timeline). As part o f this process inApril 2008 the Government organized
a three-day seminar on the Decentralization Strategy to consult with all relevant
stakeholders. A first draft o f the strategy is expected in late 2008. Inparallel, the new
National Program of Decentralized Planning and Finance (PDPF) document was
finalized in early 2008 (originally a PRSC-4 trigger but postponed to PRSC-5). The
program document identifies the main lines of intervention and key activities, and
includes clear objectives and sets performance indicators, with a focus on developing
capacity inplanningand PFM at the local level. The PDPF document provides the basis
for a national PDPF project, allowing for a better harmonized support to the provinces
andthe districts, to befinancedby a commonfund andthroughthe Statebudget.
Improvehumanresourcesmanagementin the public sector
The objective of these reforms is to improve thepayroll management. PRSC-4 supports
carrying out a census of the civil service and integratingpayroll management within e-
SISTAFE, and PRSC-5 supports the creation of a single registry of State ofJicials and
civil servants (Cadastro dos Funcionhrios Publicos, CAF). Thesemeasures also provide
a sound basisfor a comprehensive reform of civil service wages future PRSC series). As
a result of the reforms, Mozambique has operationalized an electronic database of all
civil servants, which can be used in the management of the civil service human resources,
and will also improve the management and transparency of the salarypayments.
69. There has been important progress in the area of civil service reforms. The
Government created the National Authority for Public Service (ANFP) in 2006, and
elevated it to Ministry o f Civil Service (MCS) in October 2007. The MCS i s responsible
for the policies related to the management of the human resources in the public sector,
control and inspection o f the public service, organization o f the public administration, as
well as the program of reforms of the public sector. As part of its activities the MFP
carried out a detailed census o f civil servants in 2007 (PRSC-4 prior action).          The
realization of the census has also allowed the creation of a single registry of State
Officials and Public Servants in 2007 (Cadastro Unico dos Funcionarios Publicos,
CAF; a trigger for PRSC-5).         The CAF i s an integrated database that allows the
development and implementation o f features that support the strategic management o f
humanresources, including the payroll. As a result, the government is now able, inreal
time, to tell how many civil servants there are, by grade and region, and ministry. The
CAF will feed into the e-SISTAFE-compatible payroll module and database already

                                            - 33 -

developed inmid-2007, so that the Ministry o f Finance can pay salaries via e-SISTAFE.
Salary payments via e-SISTAFE using the new integrated payroll management system
has started in selected institutions in 2008, and i s expected to be rolled out in 2009. This
reform will also assist the government to eliminate `ghost
70. The government plans to reform the public sector wages in 2008.                         The
Government had postponed the preparation o f the new salary policy until after the
availability o f data from census o f all civil servants in 2007, since the preparation o f a
sound salary policy is dependent on having a reliable information basis on the human
resources o f the State. The new salary policy is now under preparation, and i s expected
to be finalized inSeptember 2008.

EconomicDevelopment
71. Accelerating shared growth requires improvements in the climate for private sector
development, adequate infrastructure, improved smallholder productivity, and tackling
key challenges such as the impact o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the need to improve
significantly the management o f natural resources. This PRSC series seeks to address
some but not all o f these challenges.
Improvethe insuranceandsocial protectionsector
The objective of these reforms is to ensure the financial sustainability of the social
security system, and to ensure the adoption of best practice and transparency in the
management of the Social Security funds. Thepreparation of an actuarial study and the
elaboration of an investment strategy are supported in PRSC-5 (originally PRSC-4) and
will be implemented as part of the next PRSC series (originally PRSC-5). The study has
identifed that the social security fund is currently on an unsustainablefiscal trajectory,
and has highlighted the needfor signijkant reform in the management of INSS and the
social securityfunds, which the Government is in theprocess of addressing.
72. The government has undertaken a broad program to strengthen the social
security system in Mozambique. In order to improve the system's management and
reorganize the Social Security System (INSS), the government has revised the legal
framework for social protection, which resulted in parliamentary approval o f the new
Law on Social Protection in 2007. The Government also commissioned an actuarial
study on the Social Security System, which was completed in early 2008 (originally a
PRSC-4 trigger, butpostponed to PRSC-5). The actuarial study has highlighted that the
INSS i s not on a sustainable path, and could become bankrupt as early as 2012, thereby
constituting a substantial contingent liabilities for the government. The study makes
recommendations on required adjustments to the level o f contributions needed to cover
the services provided by the system to become viable. The actuarial study has also been
used to design a new investment strategy in2008, to ensure the adoption o f best practice
in the management of the finds. A sound investment strategy will substantially
contribute to strengthen the financial system. As part o f the reforms, the government is
also preparing a reform to regulate the private pension funds, following the approval o f
the Law on Social Protection, and to complement the reform o f the Social Security

System. A consultancy firm has been contracted to elaborate the Regulatory Decree on
the PensionFunds, and a report is expected in2008.
Improveconditionsfor roadtraffic
The objective of these reforms is to improve the quality of road infrastructure. PRSC-4
and PRSC-5 support improvements in the management of the road sector, leading to
increases in the extent of rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network. As part of
the reforms, the Government has restructured the Roads Authority and has approved the
new Road Sector Strategy (RSS 2007-2011) and the finalization of the Integrated
Program of the Road Sector (PRISE 2007-2009), which is leading to improvements in the
eficiency public investmentsand the quality of the roads network in Mozambique.
73. Infrastructure,notably roads, hasbeen identifiedas one of the top constraints to
increased private sector activity in Mozambique. In the context o f Mozambique,
where about 70 percent o f the population still lives in rural areas, shared growth is
necessarily linked to rural development. This will be complementary to the various mega-
projects inthe extractive industries sectors, where Mozambique has been very successful.
These projects attracted large foreign direct investments and created growth spurts during
the construction phase; but they are not labor intensive once completed. Therefore, labor
intensive rural and agricultural development is essential to reduce poverty. Inorder to
improve the quality o f investments in the road sector, the Government has been
reorganizing the management and strategic priorities o f the sector.
74. Good progress was made in 2006 and 2007 in the road sector. An important
milestone in2006 was the preparation o f the new Road Sector Strategy (RSS 2007-2011)
and the finalization o f the Integrated Program o f the Road Sector (PRISE 2007-2009),
which is derived from the RSS. The PRISE has a budget o f approximately U S D 1billion
over three years, which will require some effort by the Government in terms o f provision
the counterpart funds and the provision o f VAT refunds (since some o f the donors do not
accept for their project funds to pay for VAT). The PRISE foresees a common approach
to the planningandreporting o f all activities inthe roads sector, andit will require donors
to focus their funding on projects that are part o f the sector program. Inparallel with the
improvements in the management o f the sector, good progress was made in expanding
the maintenance o f the network. The overall conditions of the road network improved
in comparison to the previous years, with the percentage of roads in good condition
increasing to 64percent in 2006 (PRSC-4prior action), and to 67percent in 2007 (a
trigger for PRSC-5).33In2007, the Government also completed the restructuring o f the
Roads Authority (http://www.ane.gov.mz             ) which had started in 2006, including the
recruitment o f staff in accordance with the new organic structure o f the Roads Authority
(including the appointment o f the Director General, four Department Directors, and ten
provincial managers).
75. Challenges remain in implementingthe institutionalreforms of the road sector,
however. In terms o f next steps, the Government needs to strengthen the planning
capacity to ensure timely sourcing o f the necessary financial and humanresources, and to

improve the information sharing between the various bodies that participate in road
management and also with the development partners, under the coordination o f the Road
Fund.
Promote the construction and rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure, and
increaseaccess to agriculturaltechnolopies and extensioninformation
The objective of these reforms is to increase agricultural production by supporting
improvements in the provision of irrigation and extension services (PRSC-4 and PRSC-
S), leading to an expansion in the irrigated area, and an increase in the reach of
extension services. While agricultural production has continued to expand rapidly in the
past few years, the average yields have remained roughly constant. As a result, it is
dificult to attribute the improvements to the implementation of Government reforms and
investments in irrigation and extension services. The Government recognizes that there is
a need to accelerate the level of investments in agriculture, and is preparing a new
agricultural sector strategy.
76. The most important driver of the reduction in poverty in Mozambique over the
lastdecadewas agriculturalgrowth,as highlightedinthe 2005 CEM. Butit is expected
that growth in agriculture will start to plateau out after the post-conflict "bounce-back".
Inorder to maintain the pace of agricultural growth it will be necessary to move to
productivity enhancing methods. These will include improved farmer-relevant research,
broader dissemination o f drought-resistant varieties, the expansion o f irrigation, the
encouragement o f outgrower arrangements, the encouragement o f farmer associations,
and the exploration of new models for access to financial markets by smallholders. In
order to improve agricultural productivity, therefore, it i s critical that the Government
supports the development and expansion o f irrigation and o f extension services.
77. Agriculture grew by 8.6 percent in 2007, which is above the average GDP growth
rate of 7 percent,but additionalprogressis necessaryinimplementationof reforms.
The overall performance in improving service delivery is satisfactory, but the

    0   In order to promote the use of irrigation techniques, the government has
        undertaken substantial investments in construction and/or rehabilitation of
        irrigation systems with public funds. In 2006 the program resulted in around
        2,500 hectares benefiting from newly constructed and/or rehabilitated irrigation
        systems, paid by public funds (PRSC-4 prior action). I n 2007 the program
        resulted in around 3,500 hectares benefiting from newly constructed aniUor
        rehabilitated irrigation systems, paid by public funds, which however is below
        the target of 4,000 hectares (a trigger for PRSC-5). While this i s a substantial
        improvement, it only amounts to 88 percent of the government target inincreasing
        irrigated area in 2007.34 The lower than anticipated progress i s due to several
        constraints which have been identifiedto the rapidrehabilitationand construction
        o f irrigation infrastructure: (i)the administrative delays in processing these
        projects, partly due to their complexity; (ii) lack of quality control services for
                                                          the

        the construction o f irrigation works; (ii) high unit costs for the construction

     0  To increased reach o f the extension services the government improved the
        working conditions o f the extension agents in 2005 and 2006 agricultural season,
        by improving access to means o f transportation and increasing the number o f
        farmer's field schools, from 84 to 157. I n line with Government's efforts to
        extend the scope of the agricultural extension services, the number of farmers
        assisted by extension agents in 2007 was about 285,000, which is much above
        the government target of 222,300 (a trigger for PRSC-5).                            This increase
        corresponds to a 30 percent increase with respect to the 192,000 small-scale
        farmers assisted in2006.35 Inaddition, in2007 the government has prepared and
        approved a new extension services strategy aimed at hrther strengthening the
        effectiveness and efficiency o f public extension services.

78. Other reforms have also been pursued, includingin facilitatingthe use of land.
The effort to simplify the processing for the grantingo f "user rights" land titles (DUAT),
andthe percentage o fDUATrequests processed within the period o f 90 days (foreseen in
the LandLaw) appears to have worsened in2007, decreasing from 74 percent in 2006 to
47 percent in 2007. The main causes for the still significant delays are: the delay in the
issuing o f opinions by the entities involved in the process, and devolution o f processes
with badly formulated projects inorder to be corrected.
79. The critical importance of the agricultural sector for growth and poverty
reductionis fully recognized,and the delays in achievingresultson the groundhave
raisedconcerns at the highestlevel of government. Inaddition to the steps mentioned
above to accelerate irrigation provision and increase the reach o f extension services,
several additional steps have been taken to ensure that performance in the agricultural
sector accelerates in 2008 and 2009. The Minister o f Agriculture was twice changed by
the President during the course o f 2007, reflecting the strong attention to this sector and
the wish by the President to obtain results on the ground by introducing measures to
accelerate agricultural productivity growth. As part o f this effort, in2008 the Ministry o f
Agriculture has finalized the `Food ProductionAction Plan2008-2011',which articulates
detailed set o f policies to boost production in each o f the main agricultural food crops in
Mozambique (maize, rice, wheat, cassava, sweet potato, oilseeds, chicken, fish), and also
envisages measures to support marketing and processing o f agricultural products.36 The
Ministry o f Agriculture (MINAG) is also inthe process of finalizing the new Agricultural
Strategy Paper which will provide the framework to increase the Government's focus on
the agricultural sector. In order to implement the Food Production Action Plan (and
upcoming strategy), the Government is planning to substantially increase by 50 percent

35There was a change of the indicator used inthe PRSC-4 and the PRSC-5: the percentage o f farmers
assistedby extension services that adopted at least one new technology (trigger inPRSC-4) can only be
measured every three years; the number of farmers assisted by public extension services (trigger inPRSC-

36
5) can be measured every year.
  Among the positive measures, the provision o f highquality seed is given a highprofile, and also the
buildingo fstorage infrastructure (silos) for cereals, withprivate participation. Among the weaknesses is a
misapprehension o f the marketing issue, which underestimatesthe infrastructural constraints as a cause o f
the import o f many products (surplus areas are a long way from deficit areas).

the budget allocation to the agricultural sector in 2009 (from 4 percent o f the budget to
approximately 6 percent). Inaddition, inrecent years MINAG has been unable to retain
its staff, and has been affected by a continue loss o f trained staff to other ministries. As
part of the civil service reform to be approved in 2008, the Government is working to
harmonize civil service wages across ministries andpublic institutions, which i s expected
to eliminate this problem.
GovernmentresDonseto the higherfood and fuelmice crisis
The impact of the higher food andfuel prices in Mozambique is signipcant in terms of the
reduction in the purchasing power of vulnerable households. This has already led to
social unrest, and the government has approved a policy response package to mitigate
the negative effects and ensure social stability. As indicated above, the PRSC-5 will
provide USDlO million infunding from the GFRP Trust Fund to assist in jnancing the
Government's response to thefood andfuel price crisis, which isfocused on increasing
agricultural production and reducing Mozambique's future vulnerability to increases in
food prices.
80. The Governmentpolicy responseto the higher food and fuel prices is focused on
promoting economic growth as the best means to achieve poverty alleviation,while
also taking action to protect the vulnerable population from the impact o f the price
shocks. At the macroeconomic level, the Government intends to allow the pass through
o f international prices o f food and fuel to the domestic economy, notably envisaging no
trade distortions or generalized subsidies, while protecting the economic sectors most
vulnerable to the increase in energy prices. Interms o f specific actions, the Government
has approved a policy response package which includes the temporary lifting o f taxes on
diesel and kerosene, a series o f measures to stimulate agricultural production, and is
working with development partners, including the Bank, to expand social mitigation
measures to protect the most vulnerable.37
 81. In June 2008 the Government temporarily removedthe import duties and VAT
on diesel and import duties on kerosene. The removal o f these taxes aims to mitigate
the impact o f the higher diesel prices on the productive economic activities (notably the
 fisheries and transport sectors), by offsetting the increase in world prices since the
beginning o f the year at a cost o f 0.4 percent o f GDP until the end o f 2008. The measure
will be reviewed inDecember 2008, and may be terminated depending on the movement
inworld oil prices3*The price of gasoline didnot benefit from tax removal, and its price
was raised inJune 2008 to reflect the higher international prices.
 82. In addition, the Government intends to boost agricultural production. While
recognizing that while this i s an `emergency', the Government has opted for a sustainable
response that builds on the agricultural potential o f Mozambique (being a fertile land
 abundant country), that is to help increase agriculture production inthe short and medium
term starting from the 2008/09 production season. In this context, in June 2008 the


37 Iti s worth highlighting that import tariffs on food products are already at negligible levels.
38 The Government has agreed to carry out ajoint study with the Bank and other development partners, to
review the impact o f the reduction infuel taxes on economic activities and the incidence across households.
The study is to be completedbefore December 2008, inorder for the findings to be available at the time o f
the review, with a view to further improve the design o f this policy measure.


                                                      - 3 8 -

Government approved the Action Plan to Increase Food Production (Plano de Acqclo
Para a Produqclo de Alimentos), which articulates an aggressive push to increase
agricultural production over the 3-year period 2008-2011, and is intended to reduce
Mozambique's future vulnerability to increases in food prices (see Box 3).
Implementation o f the Action Plan has started this year through a mid-year budget
reallocation, and will be implemented more fully inthe next three years with the support
o f significant increases in the budget for agriculture. The Food Production Action Plan
envisages an increase in expenditures o f 0.5 percent o f GDP for the rest o f 2008, and
additional expenditures o f approximately 2 percent o f GDP each in2009 and 2010.
83. The Government is also working to protect the most vulnerable population from
the impact of the higher prices. To assist the poorest households to cope with the
increases inthe cost o f living, inFebruary 2008 the Government introduced a subsidy to
urban transport, in the form o f monthly lump-sumcompensation to registered-and-tax-
compliant urban transport private operators (minivans, buses), in exchange for keeping
fares constant in spite o f higher fuel prices.39 The transport operators receive the
difference between market retail price o f diesel fuel at the pump and the price of 31
meticais per liter (which was the price per liter in early February 2008; at present the
price is 35.5 meticais per liter, and the subsidy o f 4.5 meticais is equivalent to 13% o f
value o f pump price).        The subsidy to urban transport started in February 2008, and
expected to cost o f 0.15 percent o f GDP in 2008.                       In addition, in late 2007 the
Government had already approved an expansion inMozambique's main social protection
program, the Food Subsidy Program (Programa de Subsidios de Alimentos, PSA), which
provides direct cash transfers to eligible beneficiaries. The number o f PSA beneficiaries
was increased by 20 percent (to 130,000 households) and the amount of the monthly cash
transfer was increased by around 50 percent. In collaboration with the development
partners, the Government i s now exploring the possibility to expand the PSA program
further in2009, andpossibly complementing it with public works program inurbanareas.
84. The Government plans to finance these measures through a mix of expenditure
savings in other areas, increased domestic borrowing, and additional external
financing. A preliminary estimate o f the additional fiscal cost o f the response measures
approved as o f endJuly indicates that the additional cost in 2008 i s estimated at 1.3
percent o f GDP (USD122 milli~n).~'In order to finance the measures in 2008, the
Government plans to: (i)       realize expenditure savings from non-release o f 10 percent o f
the budget for recurrent expenditure (while protecting essential programs), and the
domestically financed investment expenditures, as well as introducing more stringent
measures on official's travel and communications expenses; (ii)increase domestic
borrowing; and (iii)appeal to development partners to provide additional financing.
While the fiscal measures that the Government adopted to minimize the impact o f diesel
and kerosene price increases inthe domestic economy were designed to be neutral on the


39Itshouldbe notedthat approximately 85 percent o fthe vehicles are licensedto operate inMaputo city, so
the subsidy is mostly to Maputo urbantransport operatorshsers. The subsidy (which is ineffect a lump-
sum transfer to the urban transport industry) is targeted inas far as the users of urban transport (minivans
and buses) are mainly the poorest 80 percent o f the population.
40Itshouldbe notedthat this amount does not include the cost o fthe increase inthe PSA in2008, since this
measure was already part o f the 2008 budget.

Box 3: The FoodProductionAction Plan
In June 2008 the Council of ministers approved the Action Plan to Increase Food Production (Pluno de
A q i o Pura a Produc;io de Alimentos) which articulates an aggressive push to increase agricultural
production over the 3-year period 2008-2011, and i s intended to reduce Mozambique's future vulnerability
to increases infood prices.
The document articulates set o f policies to boost production ineach of the main agricultural food crops in
Mozambique (maize, rice, wheat, cassava, sweet potato, oilseeds, chicken, fish), and also envisages
measures to support marketing and processing o f agricultural products. In its first part, the document
provides a commodity-by-commodity set o f actions geared at value-chain development, though with an
emphasis on production. For several commodities, the Action Plan draws upon various subsector strategies
preparedby the Government in recent years. Inthe second part, the document covers actions and measures
to be taken inoverarching areas further down the value-chain, andprovides aggregate budget and steps to be
taken by the GoM.
Few details are available in the document on the implementation mechanisms o f the policy measures, but
additional information has been provided by Government officials. The Action Plan places substantial
emphasis on supporting the adoption o f new technologies and the development o f agricultural services, and
includes specific annual production targets and a costing for all commodity "programs".             Among the
positive measures, the provision o f highquality seed is given a high profile, and also the building o f storage
infrastructure (silos) for cereals, with private participation. A strong area o f focus i s placed on developing
effective extension services, which, as discussed above, is an area where the Government has devoted
significant attention (and recruited additional staff) inrecent years. Also, the Action Plan is largely focused
on `traditional' food crops (rice, maize, and cassava), for which, given their widespread growing and
consumption across the country, quick results could potentially be achieved. The Action Plan adopts a
value-chain approach with actions at various elements o f the chain, though the bulk o f the actions proposed
are concentrated on the upstream elements o f the chain (i.e. production related).           The document also
recognizes that production targets cannot be achieved without strengthening agriculture service delivery
(research, finance, etc.), linking smallholders to markets, and stimulating demand for locally produced food.
While the document appears to promote an interventionist approach at various levels o f the value chain, the
implementation mechanisms for the various policies are designed in a manner which supports the
development o f markets, by contracting the delivery to the private sector in as much as possible, and
adopting a clear phasing-out strategy (such as a decreasing level o f subsidy over time). It i s also worth
highlighting that the Action Plan includes annual targets related to the implementation o f the specific policy
measures, and interms o f cultivated area and output for the specific crops, as well as cost estimates for all
proposed actions, and geographic areas where the actions proposed under the various commodity programs
are to be implemented.
The targets o f the Action Plan are ambitious and possibly underestimate implementation constraints in
Mozambique. Among the weaknesses the documents appears to underestimate the capacity constraints
faced by the Government to implementsuch an ambitious plan. The Action Plan also appears to assume the
widespread and immediate adoption o f the new technologies by farmers. There is also a lack o f analysis
regarding Mozambique's comparative advantage in the production o f non-traditional crops (such as wheat,
potatoes, and sunflower).     While non-traditional crops only account for less than 10 percent o f the total
investments envisaged under the Action Plan, it is unclear that investing in these crops would be efficient
and yield higher return relative to investing in traditional food crops or high-value crops, such as
horticulture. Inaddition, the document appears to underestimates the role o f infrastructural constraints as a
cause o f the import o f many products, given the locatiodaccess issues in a country as large as Mozambique
(surplus areas are a long way from deficit areas).
The Bank is discussing with the Government, together with development partners, to improve weaker
aspects o f the Action Plan. The Government i s discussing with development partners and is seeking
comments and suggestions on the approach and actions envisaged, as well as financial support for the Plan's
implementation. The Bank is working with government to adopt a more selective and sequential approach,
by developing a comprehensive roadmapbased on the agricultural calendar, and to assess the economic and
financial viability o f each commodity program presented, as well as the main policy measures. The Bank
and the Government also see this as a good opportunity to adopt measures focused on bringing idle
agricultural land into production.

budget financing requirements (i.e. matched by equivalent expenditure savings
elsewhere), and will not affect on Government borrowing. However, additional fimding
will be necessary to meet the needs for the Action Plan for Food Production and the
measures that will result from the ongoing discussion for the area o f social protection. At
present, development partners have not committed any additional financing to the draft
proposal.
85. To fund the implementation of the Food Production Action Plan, the
Government has already reallocated a significant amount of its budget resources
towards the agriculturalsector in 2008. In addition, the Government has decided to
substantially increase its allocation to the agricultural sector for the next 3 years, as
reflected in its Medium Term Expenditure Framework 2009-2011 (Cena'rio Fiscal de
Mbdio Prazo 2009-2011), which was approved in September 2008 (Prior Action for
PRSC-5). The Government decision to augment the allocation to the agricultural sector
for the next few years aims to ensure the sustainability o f the increased investment in
agricultural production in line with the Action Plan. The Government is also seeking
additional donor financing. The Bank is providing USDlO million from the GFRP Trust
Fundto assist finance the Government's Action Plan in2008, and has also increased the
level o f budget support in 2009. In this context, the Bank team will continue to work
with Government to refine and monitor the implementation o f the Action Plan, jointly
with the other development partners.


D. THEAGREEDPRIORACTIONSFORPRSC-5

86. The implementation of the overall program supported by PRSC series is
satisfactory. As discussed in the previous section, the progress in implementing the
program supported by the PRSC-5 has been good, with 10 out o f 12 triggers for the
proposed PRSC-5 having been met, and substantial progress achieved towards the
remaining two triggers. Overall significant progress has been achieved inpublic financial
management,       including procurement        and external auditing,        strengthening     the
management o f human resources in the public sector, and improving the conditions for
road traffic. However, PRSC supported reforms in expanding internal audit, and in
accelerating investments in agricultural irrigation have progressed slower than
anticipated.
87. The number of prior actions has been limited to ten, in order to streamline the
operation and to focus on the most critical policy and institutionalactions required
to help Government achieve the expected outcomes of its reform program. Some of
the triggers which had been identified for PRSC-5 do not focus the policy and
institutional actions that the government has implemented to achieve the outputs and
outcomes o f the PRSC-supported reforms, and have therefore been dropped in line with
OP 8.60 on Development Policy operation^.^^ As discussed above, a prior action has
been added to reflect the Government policy actions to respond to the increase in food

and fuel prices. This gives a total of ten prior actions, which is in line with best practice
on Development Policy Lendingoperations.
88. The Government of Mozambique has completed the following prior actions in
implementingthe reformagenda supportedbythe PRSC-5:
       The Ministryo f Finance has ensuredthat the total allocation to priority sectors in
       the 2008 budget is inline with the MTEF.
       The Ministryo f Finance has rolled out the basic functionality o f e-SISTAFE to 24
       ministries by end 2007.
       The Ministry of Finance has continued the implementation of new procurement
       system up to the district level by ensuring that the monitoring system is
       operational, and allows performance measurements establishing baselines for a
       monitoring system which allows performance measurements (as indicated by: (i)
       availability o f information on public purchases available from UFSA that show
       that at least 50% o f contracts o f the public sector were subject to public tender in
       accordancewith the current Mozambican procurement legislation; (ii)        information
       on other modalities o f contract with the due justification in at least 90% at the
       central level and 50% at the district and provincial level communicated to UFSA;
       (iii) processofcomplaints,asdefinedinthecurrentMozambicanprocurement
            the
       legislation, is operational and UFSA has data on the process and decisions
       available).
       The Ministry of Finance has ensured that at least 25 percent o f central and
       provincial level bodies have operational internal audit units (also referred to as
       `internal control units') in2007.
       Mozambique's Court of Accounts (Tribunal Administrativo, TA) has concluded
       its opinion of at least 90 financial audits o f Ministries and State agencies in2007.
       The Ministry of Planning and Development has approved the National Program
       for Decentralized Planning andFinance.
       The Ministry o f Civil Service has created the single registry o f State officials and
       civil servants (Cadastro Unico dosFuncionhios Publicos, CAF).
       The Social Security Institute (Instituto Nacional de SeguranCa Social, INS9 has
       completed the actuarial study andthe elaboration o f its investment strategy.
       The Ministryo fAgriculture has increasedaccess to technologies and extensionby
       ensuring that at least 222,300 small scale farmers have been assisted by public
       extension services in2007, including sub-contracting.
       The Council of Ministers has approved the Medium Term Expenditure
       Framework 2009-2011 (Cenhio Fiscal de Me`dio Prazo 2009-2011), which
       envisages an increase in the allocation to the agricultural sector to at least 6

E. LESSONS     LEARNED THENEXTPRSCSERIES
                            AND

89. A preliminary assessment of the likely outcomes achieved by the present PRSC
series is positive, as most of the outcomes set at the beginningof the series are likely
to be realized. As discussed above, significant progress has been made towards
expanding the comprehensiveness o f the budget and improving the efficiency and
effectiveness o f public financial management, though the implementation o f the e-
SISTAFE. Also substantial steps forward have been made to make the State procurement
system for goods and services more transparent and efficient, and to increase coverage
and efficiency o f internal and external audit bodies. Some steps have also been taken to
expand the role o f local government (although the institutional capacity o f local
governments remains weak), and to establish the foundations for better management o f
humanresources inthe public sector. Similarly, there is a need to continue the work to
strengthen the insurance and social protection sector. Significant steps have been made
to improve the business environment, but much more progress is required. Similarly,
good progress has also been made to improve the quality and coverage o f the road
network, by improving the institutional set up for its administration, and to expand the
availability o f irrigation, and the access to technologies and extension information.
90. The initial lessons from the PRSC series highlight the importance of
Government ownership and harmonization with other development partners, and
the needfor good analyticalwork to encompassthe politicaleconomy of reforms. In
broad terms, however, it seems that the PRSC series has focused on the right set o f
measures and begun to address key impediments to growth. The positive results o f the
PRSC series can be attributed to two main factors.                    Firstly, the strong Government
ownership o f the program supported by the PRSC, which i s directly drawn from the
PRSP. Secondly the positive impact o f the highly harmonized policy dialogue across
donors providing budget support to the Government o f Mozambique, which has
streamlined the donor dialogue with Government.                     The donor coordination system,
however, is characterized by inefficiency due to the very large number o f sector working
groups. Inaddition, keeping the design o f the PRSC within the PAF framework imposes
limitations in the selection o f performance triggers and prior actions. Hence the Bank
will continue to work with the other budget support partners to simplify and improve the
coordination process. Interms o f the areas o f the program where progress has been slow,
such as decentralization and public sector reforms, in addition to the technical
explanations provided above, there may be other underlyingreasons related for instance
to the political economy, which need to be better explored and understood. For the
future, it would be useful to have better analytical underpinnings on the political
economy underlying these reforms. These issues will be explored in more detail in the


42 The percentage allocation to the agricultural sector is to be measured as percentage of total expenditure
excluding projects. The corresponding allocation inthe 2008 budget to the agricultural sector was 4.7
percent. For comparison, the allocation to the agricultural sector as a percentage of total expenditures
(including projects) was 3.7 percent in2008.

ICR which will be carried out prior to the preparation o f the next series, in order to
incorporate the findings inthe new series.
91. The preparation of the next PRSC series is likely to start in early 2009, and to
continue the implementationof the reforms program already supported under this
series. It is expected to be a continuation o f the current series, in that it would support
the implementation o f the same PRSP in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The next series i s likely
to focus on the same policy areas, perhaps with greater emphasis on natural resources
management and supporting the EITI++ agenda. The series i s also expected to remain
within the context of the harmonized framework used by the group o f 19 donors (G19)
providing budget support to the government o f Mozambique. As such, the prior actions
and indicators for the next PRSC series will be drawn from the G19 PAF (see Annex 2),
which will be extendedto include 2010.

93. The Bank's supervision of the PRSCs is alignedwith the supervision of the joint
General Budget Support program of the G19. As discussed above, the Bank's
supervision o f the PRSCs is aligned with the supervision o f the joint General Budget
Support program o f the G19. Inorder to reducethe transaction costs for the Government,
the Bank carries out all supervision jointly with the other donors. In addition to the two
annual joint reviews, the supervision o f the PRSC i s done on a continuous basis in
harmonization with the other general budget support donors, through the monthly joint
government-donor steering committee meetings. Progress ineach sector i s monitoredby
joint government-donor sector working groups. Bank staff actively participates in these
meetings through its staff in the field offices and Washington (through missions or by
videoconference). Furthermore, the Bank participates in joint IMF-Bank missions to
monitor progress inthe macroeconomic framework. The Bank and the Fundalso monitor
jointly progress inimplementingthe PARPA-11.
94. The PRSC-5 results framework has been adjusted to monitor the
implementation of the main food crisis measure adopted by the Government. In
order to monitor whether the extra funds from the FoodPrice Crisis ResponseTrust Fund
do result intangible outcomes inthis area, the Results Framework for the PRSC-5 series
(Annex 1) has beenmodified to includetwo indicators to ensure that it adequately tracks
the implementation of the Action Plan to Increase Food Production measures towards
higherrice andmaizeproduction.
95. The Government, with technical assistance from IDA and other development
partners, is working to strengthen the monitoringsystem of the Strategic Matrix of

                                           - 44 -

PARPA-11,inthe context o f the development o f an integrated national Monitoring and
Evaluation system. Monitoring o f the PARPA I1 is carried out on the basis o f the
`Strategic Matrix' preparedinearly 2006 and included inthe PARPA I1document. Sector
working groups, including representatives o f each relevant Ministry, Ministry o f Planning
and Development, donors and technical assistance, worked to select the key PARPA I1
objectives in each sector and corresponding results indicators, actions, and output
indicators. A Quality Control Group led by the Ministry o f Planning and Development
andby the chair o f the G19 was set up to oversee finalization o f the Strategic Matrix and
identification o f key indicators. Implementation o f sector specific matrices i s expected to
be carried out by line Ministries and sector agencies, while the overall poverty
monitoring is the responsibility o f the National Statistic Institute (INE). The Bank
supports the Government's effort to ensure the timely collection and analysis o f the
Strategic Matrix indicators to be usedby the relevant agencies implementing the Strategic
Matrix: Ministry o f Planning and Development, line ministries and agencies at central,
provincial and district levels. In addition, following finalization o f the Strategic Matrix
with technical support from the Bank, inJuly 2007 the Monitoring Team within Ministry
o f Planning and Development beganpreparation o f Technical Notes for each indicator.
A national workshop involving M&E units in ministries is planned for late 2008. The
team will then prepare a working plan to define decentralized level o f responsibility in
monitoring indicators involving provincial level o f government. Once the monitoring
system i s in place, Government will focus on refining the indicators for the 2009 review
andupdate o fthe Strategic Matrix.
96. Various other activities are underway to strengthen the monitoring and
evaluation capacity of Government. Notably, the Government with support from
DANTDA has also started a training program o f government officials at central and
decentralized level in the preparation o f Log-Frame matrices and the carrying out cost-
benefit analysis o f projects and activities.


B. FIDUCIARY     ASPECTS

97. Fiduciary aspects and strengthening of the Government's own systems are key
in this operation. As indicated in the PRSC-3 document, the public financial
management system is considered reasonably adequate to support the PRSC series.
Weaknesses are found in internal control systems, the limited coverage o f the external
audit, and the high-level o f off-budget spending mainly from external project finance. An
action plan on PFM reforms (discussed above), focusing on comprehensiveness and
financial accountability system i s being implemented. The PRSC series supports
implementation o f key reforms in the action plan, in close coordination with the IMF
program. Public financial management has been improving steadily in line with
government commitment to reform, and the dialogue between the Government and the
donors has been constructive. Inthis context, it is worth noting that the Bank is moving
towards increasing the use o f country's financial management system inMozambique, on
the basis o f an assessment that was made inearly 2008.
98. The IMF concluded a safeguards assessment of the Mozambique Central Bank
in early 2008, which confirmed that the Mozambique Central Bank's control,



                                             -45 -

accounting, reporting, and auditing systems are adequate and aligned with
international standards. The assessment made recommendations to further strengthen
the governance structure o f Mozambique Central Bank, notably by opening the Central
Board and the Audit Board to independent experts from outside the Central Bank and
Ministry o f Finance. It also recommended that the Audit Board should also ensure more
systematic follow-up o f audit recommendations and the audit charter be subject o f an
external quality assurance review (peer review) in accordance with international
standards. The authorities are in the process o f implementing the action plan that was
drawn-up as a result o f the safeguards assessment. In the context of the IMF Policy
Support Instrument program, the Government has agreed to follow up on the
recommendations o f the Safeguards Assessment, and committed to implementing a series
o f measure identified as part o f the assessment.

C. DISBURSEMENT      ANDAUDITING

99. Disbursementand auditingprocedures remain the same as indicatedfor PRSC-
3. The proposed credit and grant will be disbursed following standard IDA disbursement
procedures. The credit and grant will be disbursed as a single tranche after effectiveness
and upon submission o f withdrawal applications from the Ministry o f Planning and
Development. IDA will deposit the funds in a dedicated foreign exchange account o f the
Bank o f Mozambique in Frankfurt.It is the same account which is used by other GBS
donors to transfer their GBS contributions, as specified inthe MoU. The hnds will not be
used for Excluded Expenditures in accordance with the credit and grant Agreements.
Withintwo working days, Bank o f Mozambique will credit the Metical equivalent o f the
credit and grant funds to the Transit Account o f the Ministryo f Finance dedicated to GBS
funds. The Metical equivalent funds will be transferred from the dedicated GBS Transit
Account to the Central Treasury Account inaccordance with the treasury plan and will be
used as state budget revenue and recorded in the state accounts as such.          Auditing
procedures are the same as defined in Section 10 o f the MOU signed in April 2004. A
legally registered, private and independent audit company meeting international standards
on auditing and qualifications o f the auditors assigned will perform the annual audit, and
inaccordance with the Terms o fReference contained inAnnex 7 to the MOU. The audit
costs will be met by Government. The annual audit report and the management letter
together with Management response will be submitted annually to Government as well as
to GBS donors, including the Bankno later than three months after the year end.


D. ENVIRONMENTAL,POVERTYAND SOCIALASPECTS

100.    The reforms related to roads, irrigation, and agricultural extensions are not
expectedto havesignificant environmentaleffects, becauseof the systems in placeto
manage them. The PRSC series supports policy actions that create the enabling
environment to support poverty reduction, and which by themselves do not have a direct
environmental impact. It is expected, however, that the private and public regular
investment activities which may result from such policy actions, could have stronger
impacts on the environment. The legal framework for the environment is relatively well
developed in Mozambique. The framework for environmental management in


                                             - 46 -

Mozambique is defined by the Law o f the Environment (Law no20/97), which applies to
all public and private activities that may influence environmental aspects. All activities
that may result in a significant impact on the environment are subject to an
Environmental Impact Assessment, which has to precede any issuing o f licenses and
investment activity. The Ministry for the Co-ordination o f Environmental Affairs
(MICOA) i s the main entity responsible for conducting Environmental Impact
Assessments. The capacity o f MICOA, however, i s limited due to financial andtechnical
capacity constraints, and the potential environmental impacts o f such interventions i s
analyzed and monitored by the responsible authority. For example, in the case o f the
rehabilitation and construction o f the road network, the National Roads Authority has
received institutional strengthening for environmental management under the Bank-
supported Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Program, in particular
through the social and environmental unit o f the National Roads Authority. A similar
situation prevails in the case o f the expansion o f irrigated agriculture. The Ministry o f
Agriculture has received much support - including from the Bank - to build up its
capacity to carry out EIA's. Some additional details are provided below:
101.    Roads rehabilitation and maintenance: IDA'Sproject on Roads and Bridges
Management and Maintenance Project (RBMMP) finances routine and periodic
maintenance o f the national road network through a pooled fund, while construction and
rehabilitation are funded directly by IDA investment lending. As part o f this operation,
the Bankhas already verified the government capacity to adequately address and mitigate
any environmental risks.
102.    Irrigation: Although IDA i s not presently involved in financing irrigation in
Mozambique (a project focusing on the development o f irrigation is in the pipeline for
FY09), irrigation investments are part o f the second phase o f the government's National
Agricultural Program (PROAGRI11), and is fundedby a group o f development partners.
As part o f the PROAGRI I1 a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been
carried out in order to provide the Ministry o f Agriculture (MINAG) and other
stakeholders with a tool for strategic management o f environment issues that will result in
the implementation o f PROGAGRI 11. An action plan to mitigate potential negative
impacts has been prepared as part o f the SEA. Moreover, it should be emphasized that
since the late 1990s until present, MINAG has been emphasizing small scale irrigation
projects (2 to 20ha), which are less likely to have significant environmental impacts.
103.    Extension systems and Integrated Pest Management (IPM): While the Bank is
not directly involved in supporting the agricultural extensions in Mozambique, the
relevant Government departments are aware and able to address any negative effects
related to the use o f new technologies in agricultural production. The government's
extension system supports IPM. During the PROAGRI I,an environmental unit was
created within MINAG, which pushed for the establishment o f IPM and safe use o f
pesticides. This environmental unit also trained public and private sector extension staff
on management o f pesticides. A Pilot Plan for IPMwas started and implemented, andthe
planis currently beingrevised inorder to scale up implementation.
104.    The Bank team is working to strengthen the capacity of the Government to
carry out Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA). Starting in FY09 the Bank team has started a Technical Assistance


                                            - 47 -

activity to help the government to develop and implement appropriate policies in the
areas of natural resources, environment and adaptation to climate change. Inthis context,
the Bank i s financing a stocktaking that will map forthcoming investments and policy
reforms with potential negative environmental impact, propose a typology o f possible
environmental issues linked to these investments and related policy reforms.           The
stocktaking will also identify the hture needs for Mozambique interms o f Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic EnvironmentalAssessment (SEA), the two tools
that are needed to put in place mitigation measures to address potential adverse
environmental impact related to physical investment or policy reforms in a given sector.
The activity is closely coordinated with MICOA and the G19 partners, inthe context of
the five joint sector and sub-sector working groups (environment, adaptation, fishery,
forestry, biodiversity), with a view to facilitate the coordination o f capacity building
activities to boost capacity inconducting EIAs and SEAS.
105.     Beyond the need to ensure that the environmental impacts of reform
supported by the PRSC is mitigated, the sustainable use of Mozambique's natural
resources (land, mining, fisheries, forestry, water) represents a great opportunity
for poverty reduction as well as social and economic development, and needs to be
strengthened. As outlinedinthe 2005 CEM, public revenues from natural resourcerents
could be increased from USD31 million to USD82 million per year under current
economic conditions, mostly by improving transparency and fairness in the issuing o f
licences, quotas and concessions and in the collection and use o f revenue. Sustainable
exploitation o f natural resources by communities and individuals should be promoted to
contribute directly to poverty reduction and livelihood security. Investmentsinextractive
and exploitative industries can promote further growth and economic activity through
providing markets for local goods and services as well as inputs for processing industries.
Licensing and taxation of natural resource use can provide significant revenue for
Government, which in turn, can support fbnding development and poverty reduction
programs, especially where (local and global) market demand andprices allow significant
margins. However managing these resources i s complex. While GOM legislation and
policies recognize and seek to facilitate the role of different models o f resource use for
poverty reduction and development, little attention has been given to the specific
mechanisms for: (i)access, (ii)promoting efficient use and (iii)monitoring and
compliance with existing norms. This has lead to a situation where regulations appear to
have produced unnecessarily complex procedures that create opportunities for rent
seeking and corruption, harmingboththe poor and private commercial interests. Over the
next few years IDA, in collaboration with the IMF and other development partners, will
work closely with Government to maximize the benefits from the sustainable exploitation
o f natural resource. An important step to enhance the revenue collection efforts was the
approval by the parliament inDecember 2006 o f the new laws on the fiscal regimes for
the mining and oil sectors, which have become effective inmid-2007.
106.     The poverty and social impacts of the policies supportedby the PRSC series
are expected to be positive. Analysis carried out on the impacts o f growth on poverty
reduction in Mozambique, has shown positive links, which has so far not been
accompanied by significant increases in inequality. As highlighted in the Program
Document for PRSC-3 the poverty reduction impact o f the policies supported by the
series i s expected to be significant, increasing the likelihood that Mozambique will reach


                                             - 48 -

the first Millennium Development Goal. The specific country policies supported by the
PRSC series are not expected to have significant distributional and social impacts, except
possibly positive ones arising from the irrigation investments, the expansion o f
extensions services, and the increased effectiveness o f the tax administration system (as
the tax system i s consideredto be reasonablyprogressive).
E. RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION

107.      The risks to this operation relate to: (i)the potential for macroeconomic
instability, (ii) the weak administrative capacity to implement public sector reforms and
decentralization, and (iii)deterioration in governance that could compromise economic
                                a
reforms. Details for each o f these areas are providedbelow:
108.      A first set of risks is concerned with the potential for macroeconomic
instability, due to the sharp increase in food and fuel prices, potential spillover
effects from crises in neighboringcountries, and the upcomingpoliticalelections in
2009. The impact o f the higher food and fuel prices on the Balance o f Payments (BOP)in
Mozambique has beenmitigated by the simultaneous increase inthe price o f aluminum in
2008. The latter i s expected to decrease in 2009 and may result into a higher impact on
the           Inaddition, continued increase in oil and food prices could heighten social
vulnerabilities, and thereby pose a threat for the quality o f macroeconomic management.
Inthis respect the Bank is proposing to increase the level ofbudget support to contribute
to the mitigation response package planned by the Government, focusing on the most
vulnerable people. The additional support would assist the Government meet the fiscal
costs o f the response to the high international fuel and food prices, and the effort to
mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable groups. An additional set o f risks arises from
potential spillover effects from political crises in neighboring countries, notably in
Zimbabwe and in South Africa. Inthe latter contentious Presidential elections will take
place in 2009, and there is also a possibility o f more xenophobic attacks as witnessed in
mid-2008.       The Parliamentary and Presidential elections in Mozambique are scheduled
in late 2009 (andmunicipal elections are scheduled inNovember 2008). Approaching
the elections, the Government will need to resist pressures for additional spending that
are not sustainable, and prevent a reduction in the level o f revenues collection (as
happened in the previous 2004 elections). The Bank team will continue to monitor the
macroeconomic policy framework and its adequacy for the provision o f budget support.
Inaddition, to mitigate the risks of fiscal slippage due to political pressure inthe run-up
to the 2009 elections, the PRSC program (and the PAF), supports the efforts by the
Government to strengthen PFM systems (including the revenue collection systems),
which increase transparency and reduce the country's vulnerability to fiscal slippage.




43Analysts are predicting that the price of aluminum will go down from about USD2,800 a ton inAugust
2008 to less than USD2,500 in2009. Given the high dependency o fMozambique on aluminum exports
(about 74 percent of total exports), the high and increasing current account deficit (about 8 percent of GDP,
including grants), and the high aid dependency (about 13 percent o f GDP), changes inprices of
commodities and inthe international economic and political environments could threaten economic
stability and prospects. The Bank team, incollaboration withthe IMF,will continue to monitor the
macroeconomic policy framework and its adequacy for the provision ofbudget support.


                                                    - 49 -

109.   A second set of risks concerns weak administrative capacity to implement
public sector reforms and move ahead with decentralization. To mitigate this risk,
the Government and donors agreed during the Joint Review to develop an integrated
strategy for capacity development in public finance management, and to strengthen the
coordination and management of reforms. Inaddition IDA is supporting the Government
to implement the second phase o f the public sector reforms, which (was agreed with all
stakeholders including the development partners and) was approved by Cabinet in
October 2006. To strengthen capacity at the district level and to improve control
mechanisms (auditing) the Government has finalized its program for capacity buildingat
the decentralized level. The development partners, including IDA, are now discussing
with Government the preparation o f a national program that is expected to deliver
capacity buildingand oversight more effectively.
110. A third set of risks concerns a deterioration in governance that could
compromise economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts.             . Progress in public
sector governance has been mixed.         Significant progress has been made in thereby
improving transparency       and accountability by strengthening          Public   Financial
Management systems, including in procurement and in internal and external audit. Also
there has been progress towards improving the management o f natural resources, notably
by strengthening the legal framework regulating the fiscal regimes for mining and
petroleum, and government has recently announced its intention to adhere to the
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Joint Review in April 2008,
however, noted the need to accelerate reforms in the legal andjudiciary fronts, including
in implementing the anti-corruption strategy and introducing (and enforcing) legislation
to eliminate conflict o f interest for public officials. Questions are also related to the
capacity for selection, negotiation and monitoring o f the projects and investments, in
order to explore the opportunities o f the country's natural resources (minerals, petroleum,
hydropower, forestry, agriculture, among others). For instance, the Government is in the
process o f allocating rights to three power mega-projects (coal, gas and hydro) to
combinations o f foreign firms and local partners, and it i s important that the projects are
granted in a transparent and competitive way, to ensure the maximization o f the benefits
for the communities and advantages for the country. The mixed progress in the area o f
governance may slow down further in the approach to the next Parliamentary and
Presidential elections in December 2009. A deterioration in governance could have
negative effects on economic growth and compromise poverty reduction. To mitigate this
risk, IDA is increasing its activities inthe areas o f Governance. Strengthening voice and
accountability is one o f the three pillars o f the Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy
approved by the Board in M a y 2007. IDA already holds an active policy dialogue with
the authorities on the subject and closely monitors developments associated with
governance.    At the request o f the Government, in 2008 the Bank, IMF, DFID and
Norway, fielded a technical assistance mission on how to maximize the benefits from
mega-projects, including those related to the exploitation o f natural resources.          In
addition, the restructured Public Sector Reform Project has a new legal sector capacity
building component. A further approach to enhance accountability o f the executive is
increased disclosure o f information to the public, particularly regarding financial
management. Some progress has been made through the use o f an official internet portal
o f the Government, but more effort is still required.       Also, as part o f the activities


                                            - 5 0 -

supported by the CommGAP Trust Fund in Mozambique, IDA i s working to enhance
citizen's voice, strengthen the media, and modernize the Government's communication
functions. Last but not least, IDA i s working with Government to carry out a program of
beneficiary surveys to increase public involvement inthe monitoring o f service delivery.

     IMF Completes Second Review Under the Policy Support
                      Instrument (PSI) for Mozambique


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the
second review of Mozambique's economic performance under a three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI). The Executive Board also granted a waiver of
nonobservance of two end-December 2007 quantitative assessment criteria
pertaining to base money and to net credit to the Government, as well as one
structural assessment criterion on a draft law on excise tax on alcoholic beverages.
The PSI for Mozambique was approved on June 18, 2007 (See Press Release No
07/135) to support the nation's economic reform efforts. It is aimed at consolidating
macroeconomic stability and at achieving sustained economic growth and poverty
reduction through the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies as well as
promoting structural reforms. The strategy to achieve this goal remains set in the
Mozambican authorities' national poverty reduction strategy, Plano de Ac@o para
Redu@o da Pobreza Absoluta (PARPA 11).

Following the Board's discussion on Mozambique, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Directorand Acting Chair, made the following statement:

"Mozambique's overall macroeconomic performance under the Policy Support
Instrument has been satisfactory, reflecting prudent fiscal and monetary policies in
the context of a flexible exchange rate regime and the authorities' commitment to
avoid monetary financing of the budget. Economic growth remains resilient to
shocks, and average annual inflation has decelerated despite high oil and food
import prices.

"The authorities are to be commended for the progress in improving tax
administration and public financial management. Implementation of the e-SISTAFE
(public financial administration system) has progressed well, but timely donor
financial support will be important for its completion. The causes of the 2007
shortfalls in aid disbursements will need to be addressed to allow a scaling-up of aid


                                       - 62 -

in 2008. It will be important for the government to use well-targeted and fiscally
sustainable measures to mitigate the social impact of further increases in oil and
food prices, while at the same time resisting pressures for unsustainable additional
spending related to the elections. It will also be important to ensure that the civil
servicewage and pension reforms do not compromisefiscal sustainability.

"The Bank of Mozambique has continued to strengthen its monetary policy
framework and internal audit procedures. The Treasury's commitment to provide
weekly cash-flow projections to the central bank is an important step towards better
liquiditymanagement.

"Reforms to stimulate private sector development and improve management of
Mozambique's natural resources are a high priority. It will be important to implement
the medium-termstrategic plan to improvethe business environment. Good progress
has been made in implementing the mining and petroleum fiscal regime laws. It will
be important to enhance the Ministry of Finance oversight of the fiscal terms of new
megaproject agreements. Adherence to the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiativewill help make Mozambique'sbusiness environment more transparent.

"Strengthening public governance remains a key focus of the reform agenda, and
implementationof the government's governance strategy needs to be completed in a
timely manner," Mr. Portugal said.

The IMF's framework for PSIS is designed for low-income countries that may not
need IMF financial assistance, but still seek close cooperation with the IMF in
preparation and endorsement of their policy frameworks. PSI-supported programs
are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners. This is intended to ensure
that PSI-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for
macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty.
Members' performance under a PSI is reviewed semi-annually, irrespective of the
status of the program (see Public InformationNotice No. 05/145).

6. In terns of the environment for private sector development,
   significant progresses wen: made in 2007. These progresses are
   reflected in the improvement of Mozambique ranking by 6 places to
   posithi 154 out of 178 wonomies in he 2008 Doing Business
   Survey, reflecting the gavemniem`s commitment, Mozambique was
   among the top five reforming countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
   Mozambique wm the secotid fastest reformer overall in tlle category
   "Psureuting Investors", where its rank jumped 43 places from 96 tu
   33. Legislation dahg from 1888 was repliuled with a new
   CommercialCode that introduces sxrictur corporategovernance rules
   and strengthens the rights of niinority shareholders. Significant
   progresswas achieved too inthe category "Startinga Biisiness" (+32
   ranks), whm the start-up rime for new firms fell by almost three
   months from an average I13 to 29 days. The new ConimercidCode,
   approved in 21105, and the new Code for Registry of Legal Entities,
   approved in March 2006, ximplified the procedures for business
   registration. Furthermore, the Government approved rl decree in
   September2006, whereby registmtion becomeseffecrive as soonas it
   is pblishcd 011the government's official website. As tzsult of thew
   reformsit is IWW possibleta open a husiness in 311days, compared to
   153 clays in 2005.
7. The impact of this progmss on povcvty reduetion continues to be
   significant, The lnst huusehold survey, completed in 2002/2003,
   shows that poverty incidence ( h c d on the headcount index)
   dcc'lirtcd to 54 pcrcent in 2003 (from 69.4 pcrccnt in 1997). A new
   household suivey is under preparation, and its results a-eexpectedin
   ewly 2010.
8. The Guvenimena's commitment ttr address the Millennium
   hvclriprnent Goals (MDGs) reimins strong. This is reflitctocl in the
   PARPA-11, whose key actions ut3 suirmiarjzed in a matrix, along

           Growth in agricultural production in 20017 was strong at
           around 8% hut this was partly due to the favourable climatic
           conditions. The Gwernment's strong intention is ta sustain
