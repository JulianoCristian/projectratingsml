                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would support Mexico's conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Oportunidades, which serves slightly more than 5 million poor families. About
                         70 percent of these families are in rural areas, 16 percent live in semi-urban areas, with the remaining 14 percent in urban areas. The principal Project Development
                         Objectives are: -Increase capacities in health, nutrition and education of poor families through human capital investment by promoting regular health check-ups,
                         improving health status, and raising school enrollment and attendance rates. -Build sustainable connections between Oportunidades and other social lprograms of the
                         Government of Mexico in order to improve health and educaiton outcomes for Program participants.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Additional Financing in the amount of US$ 1.250 billion for the Support to Oportunidades Project is now being implemented. As of June 2013, 5,554,461 families were
                         participating in the Program. The National Coordination developed a proposal to redesign some aspects of the Program. The redesign emphasized the following areas:(a)
                         implementation of an improved nutrition strategy; (b) promotion of linkages between the Program and possible productive and employment-related activities, in particular labor

                         achievement of better results in secondary education completion rates, including a change in the structure of educational transfers for that level and the possibility of recognizing
                         additional secondary school modalities for the purposes of the transfer; and (e) a renewed emphasis on strategies to improve coordination with the health and education sectors, as
                         well as other sectors which are likely to gain more importance in the re-design (National Employment Services, for example). The Program is also going to pilot an early child
