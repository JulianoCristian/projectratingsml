                         The proposed project would support Mexico's conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Oportunidades, which serves slightly more than 5 million poor families.

                         Development Objectives are: -Increase capacities in health, nutrition and education of poor families through human capital investment by promoting regular
                         health check-ups, improving health status, and raising school enrollment and attendance rates. -Build sustainable connections between Oportunidades and
                         other social lprograms of the Government of Mexico in order to improve health and educaiton outcomes for Program participants.
