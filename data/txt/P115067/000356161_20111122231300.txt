Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The proposed project would support Mexico's conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Oportunidades,
which serves slightly more than 5 million poor families. About 70 percent of these families are in rural
areas, 16 percent live in semi-urban areas, with the remaining 14 percent in urban areas. The principal

through human capital investment by promoting regular health check-ups, improving health status, and
raising school enrollment and attendance rates. -Build sustainable connections between Oportunidades and
other social lprograms of the Government of Mexico in order to improve health and educaiton outcomes
for Program participants.
