          satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            in a time of crisis conditional cash transfers (CCTs) can be\n            easily scaled up in coverage or generosity ensuring a\n            pro-poor targeted support in a difficult time. Households\n            can remain beneficiaries of CCTs for a very long time and\n            may need additional support to transition out of poverty,\n            particularly given the high economic and social\n            marginalization of the areas in which beneficiaries tend to\n            live. CCT programs cannot be thought of in isolation from\n            other social policies, and achieving human capital\n            accumulation goals will require adaptation of the supply of\n            social services (coverage but also quality). A rigorous\n            evaluation agenda provides legitimacy and support for CCT\n            programs as well as the evidence base to introduce changes\n            in program operation that can improve outcomes. Maintaining\n            dialogue in the absence of lending is key to keeping a place\n            at the table, and to being able to respond rapidly. The CCT\n            community of practice (COP) was instrumental for this.\n            Timely, focused, technical assistance can lead a project\n            from responsive to transformative. The direct support to\n            oportunidades was the main purpose of the project at the\n            outset. The inter-institutional collaboration with health\n            and education, while crucial for the success of the program\n            proved challenging and advanced at a slow pace. The choice\n            to use a sector investment loan (SIL) instead of development\n            policy lending (DPL) made it possible for the team to be\n            more involved in the operational details of the program and,\n            as a consequence, to provide timely technical assistance\n            (TA) that was well aligned with emerging program demands.\n            The large amount of lending and fast disbursement was\n            possible because of the existence of mature country programs\n            and systems for payment in Mexico."}, "docdt": "2014-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
