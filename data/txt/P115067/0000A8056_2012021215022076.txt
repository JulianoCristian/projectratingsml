                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would support Mexico's conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Oportunidades, which serves slightly more than 5 million poor families. About
                         70 percent of these families are in rural areas, 16 percent live in semi-urban areas, with the remaining 14 percent in urban areas. The principal Project Development
                         Objectives are: -Increase capacities in health, nutrition and education of poor families through human capital investment by promoting regular health check-ups,
                         improving health status, and raising school enrollment and attendance rates. -Build sustainable connections between Oportunidades and other social lprograms of the
                         Government of Mexico in order to improve health and educaiton outcomes for Program participants.
