                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would support Mexico's conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Oportunidades, which serves slightly more than 5 million poor families. About
                         70 percent of these families are in rural areas, 16 percent live in semi-urban areas, with the remaining 14 percent in urban areas. The principal Project Development
                         Objectives are: -Increase capacities in health, nutrition and education of poor families through human capital investment by promoting regular health check-ups,
                         improving health status, and raising school enrollment and attendance rates. -Build sustainable connections between Oportunidades and other social lprograms of the
                         Government of Mexico in order to improve health and educaiton outcomes for Program participants.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Additional Financing in the amount of US$ 1.250 billion for the Support to Oportunidades Project is now being implemented. As of December 2012, 5,845,056 families were
                         participating in the Program. The National Coordination is developing a proposal to redesign some aspects of the Program. The redesign is expected to emphasize the following
                         areas:(a) implementation of an improved nutrition strategy; (b) promotion of linkages between the Program and possible productive and employment-related activities, in particular

                         support the achievement of better results in secondary education completion rates; and (e) a renewed emphasis on strategies to improve coordination with the health and education
                         sectors, as well as other sectors which are likely to gain more importance in the re-design (National Employment Services, for example). The project is expected to disburse the
                         funds remaining well before the closing date of December 31, 2013.
