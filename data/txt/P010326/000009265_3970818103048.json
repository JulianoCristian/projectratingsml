The project only achieved some of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            modest, sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was marginally satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, the\n            importance of the legal framework for successful\n            institution-building should not be underestimated. Also, it\n            should be recognized that an appropriate legal framework\n            will not guarantee autonomy. Second, there is a need to\n            focus more on improving the municipalities'\n            implementation capacity, since they are the weakest link in\n            the chain between IDA and the ultimate project\n            beneficiaries. Third, close coordination is needed between\n            donors with overlapping interventions in a given sector,\n            particularly when the interventions of one donor may be\n            crucial to the success of another donor's project.\n            Finally, it is a mistake to only partly convert emergency\n            relief from loans into grants because of the precedent this sets."}, "docdt": "1997-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
