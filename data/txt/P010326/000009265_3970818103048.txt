MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT AND EARTHQUAKE EMERGENCY HOUSING
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(Credit 1988-NEP)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Nepal Municipal
Development and Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction Project for which a Credit of
SDR 30.9 million (equivalent to US$41.5 million at the time of appraisal) to the Kingdom of
Nepal was approved on March 14, 1989. The Credit became effective on September 14, 1989
and closed on schedule on June 30, 1996. Final disbursement took place on March 24, 1997. In
total, SDR 15,886,241.31 (equivalent to US$ 23.4 million) were disbursed. A total of SDR
15,013,758.69 was canceled in 1993, 1995 and 1997.
The ICR was prepared by a mission consisting of Mr. Sunil Mathrani, Consultant, which
visited Nepal in November 1996, and reviewed by Mr. Jean Francois Bauer, Chief, Energy and
Infrastructure Operations Division and Ms. Kazuko Uchimura, Project Adviser, Country
Department II, South Asia Region. The Borrower assisted in the preparation of the ICR by
preparing their own evaluation of the project's execution.

MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT AND EARTHQUAKE EMERGENCY HOUSING
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(Credit 1988-NEP)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    Nepal's urban population has been growing at a rapid 7 percent over the past two
decades, significantly faster than overall population growth of 2.5 percent. This trend is likely to
continue, given the limited employment opportunities in rural areas. Throughout Nepal there are
significant levels of unmet demand for urban infrastructure services. Drinking water, sanitation,
drainage and solid waste collection are all inadequate or completely absent. At the time of
project preparation, the provision of basic urban services was constrained by limited institutional
and managerial capacity, as well as scarce financial resources.
2.    A major earthquake hit eastern and central Nepal in August 1988, causing considerable
damage to private housing as well as to public infrastructure. Nearly half a million people were
rendered homeless. A housing reconstruction component was therefore appended to the already-
appraised Municipal Development Project, to facilitate rapid loan processing within the Bank.
Project Objectives
The main objectives of the Municipal Development Component of the project were to:
(a) establish, as a pilot operation, a financial intermediary to assist His Majesty's
Government of Nepal (HMGN) in providing appropriate financial support to
municipalities;
(b) provide long-term loan financing for priority social infrastructure and revenue
generating projects of municipalities to support industrial growth and to provide services
to rising urban populations; and
(c) strengthen further the financial and administrative capacity of municipalities to
prepare, implement, supervise and maintain projects.
3.    The main objectives of the Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction (EEHR)
component of the project were to:



- 11 -
(a) assist HMGN in implementing its program to reconstruct housing damaged during
the earthquake;
(b) improve construction standards and develop earthquake-resistant features for
incorporation in buildings through planning and development control regulations;
(c) provide technical assistance and training for the housing sector to address longer term
needs; and
(d) address the environmental impact relating to the excessive use of timber in buildings
and building products manufacture.
4.    Given the meager transfers to municipalities from the national budget and the absence of
any long-term funding sources for local governments, the objective of establishing a financial
intermediary to provide loans to municipalities was appropriate. Reinforcing the project
implementation capacity of the municipalities was an equally relevant goal. These objectives are
still valid today.
5.    The objective of financially assisting earthquake victims reconstruct their homes was
highly appropriate and timely. However, the other objectives of this component, although
desirable, were of lesser importance in a period of emergency reconstruction. They were of a
long-term developmental character and did not fit well with the urgency of the housing loan
program.
Implementation Experience and Results
6.    The municipal development component achieved much less than expected. Very few
sub-projects were executed during the first five years of the project from 1989 through 1994 for
reasons mentioned in Part I, paras. 14-17. As it was apparent in late 1994 that it would be
impossible to utilize the available funds before the closing date, SDR 5.51 million from the
Credit was canceled as of January 1, 1995. However, due to a major effort in the final two years,
a total of 28 sub-projects were executed, of which 24 were fully completed when the IDA credit
closed on June 30, 1996. Eleven projects were revenue-generating (bus parks, shop buildings
etc.) and the rest were social in nature, mainly storm water drainage. Detail on the sub-projects
are given in Annex 2.1 of Appendix, Borrower's Contribution. Against an estimate of SDR 8.2
million, only SDR 1.8 million (about 22 percent) were disbursed in total for this component.
7.    Achievements under the Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction Program were
better. Against an estimate of 65,000 beneficiaries nearly 53,000 households benefited from
financial assistance in the form of concessionary loans. The loan program was satisfactorily
completed in 1991. Due to the appreciation of SDR against the Nepalese Rupee savings from the
Credit allocation for this component were substantial. Against an estimate of SDR 22.7 million



- iii -
for this component, SDR 14.1 million (about 62 percent) were disbursed. The undisbursed
balance of SDR 9.33 million was canceled in October 1993.'
Major Factors Affecting Achievement
8.    The effect of the political changes in Nepal during 1990-92 had a major impact on the
project. The dissolution of Nagar Panchayats and the appointment of interim municipality
boards prior to elections in mid- 1992, disrupted the preparation and approval of loan proposals.
The initial clients of the Town Development Fund Board (TDFB), the Nagar Panchayats, were
removed from office and the interim municipality boards were reluctant to enter into loan
commitments, given their temporary status. Then the newly-elected municipalities were slow to
familiarize themselves with their new responsibilities and become fully operational. As a result,
three years were effectively lost before the Municipal Development Component of the project got
properly under way.
9.    The ability of municipalities to prepare and design project proposals, carry out the
bidding and selection process and implement projects in a timely way was (and remains) a
bottleneck that limits their absorptive capacity. This weakness hindered the ability of TDFB to
make loans to municipalities throughout the project period.
10.   The initial formation order setting up TDFB as a body governed by the provisions of the
Development Board Act (2013) did not allow it sufficient autonomy. The constraints imposed
on TDFB due to its legal status as a 'board' made it impossible for TDFB to operate in the
autonomous manner conceived of at the start of the project (Part 1, para. 19). In this respect, the
design of project was flawed.
11.   TDFB suffered from frequent changes of Executive Director (five in eight years), and
there was often political interference in staff recruitment. The erosion of its salaries due to
HMGN unwillingness to grant increases led to the loss of some good staff to better-paying
organizations and had a negative effect on the motivation of those remaining. It is presently
short of qualified staff in critical areas, but overstaffed with low-skill personnel.
Project Sustainability
12.   The sustainability of the sub-projects financed by TDFB depends on the maintenance
practices and financial health of the respective municipalities. These vary considerably from one
municipality to another. Some are better placed than others to mobilize revenues from new
sources in the future. In overall terms, the sustainability of the sub-projects is uncertain. As
regards TDFB itself, its sustainability seems likely, given the build-up in its financial resources
from interest charges and loan repayments.
I An additional SDR177, 271.16 was canceled as of March 24, 1997. Detailed data is given in Part 11, Table 4.

Bank and Borrower Performance
13.   Bank performance was satisfactory at identification, as can be seen by the appropriateness
of project objectives. However, flaws in project design (Part I, para. 19) show that it was
unsatisfactory at the preparation and appraisal stage. The size and scope of project was over-
ambitious and unrealistic, given the limited absorptive capacity of the municipalities, and use of
the newly-established and inexperienced TDFB as implementing agency. At appraisal, the Bank
does not appear to have properly understood the implications of the Development Board Act for
TDFB's autonomy. Supervision was generally satisfactory and was carried out very regularly till
1993, but was reduced thereafter to one headquarters mission per year. This was a deliberate
step arising from the decision to limit the scope of the project and wind it up on schedule (Part I,
paras. 30 and 32).
14.   Overall Borrower performance was rated as unsatisfactory. HMGN did not share the
objective of making TDFB autonomous and there was unnecessary interference in TDFB's
staffing and salary policy. Although a major share of the responsibility for the inability to lend
was due to factors outside TDFB's control, recent experience (Part I, para. 35) has shown that it
could have achieved better results earlier on. The implementation performance of the Earthquake
Housing Reconstruction Project Unit was satisfactory. However, HMGN's reversal of its policy
on aid to earthquake victims was ill-considered (Part I, paras. 22-23).
Assessment of Outcome
15.   The Municipal Development Component made a very modest contribution to improving
urban infrastructure in towns outside Kathmandu. There has also been some accumulation of
expertise in project design, appraisal and implementation within TDFB. Nevertheless, the
project outcome is judged to be unsatisfactory, because of: (i) the inability to use scarce IDA
resources during a period of pressing urban infrastructure needs; (ii) TDFB's institutional
weakness shown (Part I, paras. 19-20); and (iii) the continuing low absorptive capacity of
municipalities (Part I, para. 16).
16.   The outcome of the Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction Component is
judged to be satisfactory because about 300,000 people benefited from loans to reconstruct their
homes. The funds were disbursed rapidly and there were few cases of misuse of loans. Although
the stated objectives were met only partially, they were of lesser importance than the primary
goal of aiding people rendered homeless by the earthquake.
Future Prospects and Key Lessons
17.   Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) has recently made a grant of DM 10 million to
TDFB to enable it to continue its lending operations over the 1996-2000 period. There now
appears to be greater interest in borrowing on the part of municipalities, compared to several
years ago, but the pipeline of adequately prepared and viable proposals to be submitted for donor
funding is still thin. TDFB's ability to evolve into an urban development bank in the long-term



v -
depends on demonstrating that it is capable of improving upon the rate of disbursements
achieved during the last year of the IDA project. In addition, it will need to build up significant
financial reserves, which can only occur if the repayment by municipalities continues to be
satisfactory. Finally, the process of granting greater autonomy to TDFB (Part I, para. 41) will
also need to be taken further to enhance the influence of the municipalities.
18.   The key lessons learned from this project are:
* The importance of the legal framework for successful institution-building should not be
underestimated, but it should also be recognized that an appropriate legal framework
will not guarantee autonomy. Much depends on how the texts are interpreted and used
in practice, which in turn depends on a commitment to the principles of good
governance (Part I, para. 41).
* There is a need to focus more on improving the municipalities' implementation capacity
since they are the weakest link in the chain between IDA and the ultimate project
beneficiaries (Part I, para. 16).
*  Close coordination is needed between donors with overlapping interventions in a given
sector, particularly when the interventions of one donor may be crucial to the success of
another donor's project (Part I, para. 33).
* It is a mistake to only partly convert emergency relief from loans into grants because of
the precedent this sets. It would have been simpler and better to have offered modest
grants to all genuine victims right from the start, with top-up loans available for those
requiring larger sums for house reconstruction (Part I, para. 40).

MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT AND EARTHQUAKE EMERGENCY HOUSING
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(Credit 1988-NEP)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Background
1.    Nepal's urban population has been growing at a rapid 7 percent over the past two
decades, significantly faster than overall population growth of 2.5 percent. This trend is likely to
continue, given the limited employment opportunities in rural areas. Throughout Nepal there are
significant levels of unmet demand for urban infrastructure services. Drinking water, sanitation,
drainage and solid waste collection are all inadequate or completely absent. At the time the
project was prepared, the provision of basic urban services was constrained by limited
institutional and managerial capacity as well as scarce financial resources at both the central and
local levels. The Bank's prior involvement in urban infrastructure had been limited to water
supply and sanitation.
2.    A major earthquake hit eastern and central Nepal in August 1988, causing considerable
damage to private housing as well as to public infrastructure. Nearly half a million people were
rendered homeless. HMGN sought IDA assistance for house and school reconstruction. A
housing reconstruction component was therefore appended to the already-appraised Municipal
Development Project to facilitate rapid loan processing within the Bank. IDA assistance for
school reconstruction took the form of a self-standing project (Cr. 2047-NEP).
Statement of Objectives
3.    The main objectives of the municipal development component of the project were to:
(a) establish, as a pilot operation, a financial intermediary to assist HMGN in providing
appropriate financial support to municipalities;
(b) provide long-term loan financing for priority social infrastructure and revenue
generating projects of municipalities to support industrial growth and to provide services
to rising urban populations; and



- 2 -
(c) strengthen further the financial and administrative capacity of municipalities to
prepare, implement, supervise and maintain projects.
4.    The main objectives of the earthquake emergency housing reconstruction component of
the project were to:
(a) assist HMGN in implementing its program to reconstruct housing damaged during
the earthquake;
(b) improve construction standards and develop earthquake-resistant features for
incorporation in buildings through planning and development control regulations;
(c) provide technical assistance and training for the housing sector to address longer term
needs; and
(d) address the environmental impact relating to the excessive use of timber in buildings
and building products manufacture.
Evaluation of Objectives
5.    Given the meager transfers to municipalities from the national budget and the absence of
any long-term funding sources for local governments, the objective of establishing a financial
intermediary to provide loans to municipalities was appropriate. Reinforcing the project
implementation capacity of the municipalities was an equally relevant goal. These objectives are
still valid today.
6.    The objective of financially assisting earthquake victims reconstruct their homes was
highly appropriate and timely. However, the other objectives of this component, although
desirable, were of lesser importance in a period of emergency reconstruction. They were of a
long-term developmental character and did not fit well with the urgency of the housing loan
program.
B. ACHIEVEMENTS OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Municipal Development Component
7.    The municipal development component achieved much less than expected. Very few
sub-projects were executed during the first five years of the project from 1989 through 1994 for
reasons mentioned in paras. 14-17. As it was apparent in late 1994 that it would be impossible to
utilize the available funds before the closing date, SDR 5.51 million from the Credit was
canceled as of January 1, 1995. However, due to a major effort in the final two years, a total of
28 sub-projects were executed, of which 24 were fully completed when the IDA credit closed on
June 30, 1996. Details on the sub-projects are given in Annexes 2.1 to 2.4 of Appendix B.
Three of the four uncompleted projects require only minor expenditures as they are over 90
percent complete. Only Birgunj Municipality will have to bear a substantial amount of about



- 3 -
NRs. 13 million (about US$ 0.24 million) from its own resources to finish the remaining 30
percent of the storm water drainage project. Eleven projects were revenue-generating (bus parks,
shop buildings etc.) and the rest were social in nature, mainly storm water drainage. Against an
estimate of SDR 8.2 million, only SDR 1.8 million (about 22 percent) were disbursed in total for
this component.
8.    Repayment performance by municipalities has been satisfactory so far. As of October 27,
1996, overdue repayments on IDA-financed sub-projects represented 17 percent of total
repayments due to TDFB for these loans. Prospects for continued satisfactory performance in
this area appear to be high, given the almost non-existent alternative sources of investment funds
for municipalities. Yet at the time of project appraisal, both IDA and HMGN considered the risk
of poor repayment by municipalities to be substantial.
9.    No economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated at appraisal. The ERRs were computed
in the ICR for the seven revenue generating schemes which have been completed. They range
from 14.6 percent to 19.6 percent (Part II, Table 9).
Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction Program
10.   Achievements under the Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction Program were
better. Against an estimate of 65,000 beneficiaries nearly 53,000 households benefited from
financial assistance in the form of concessionary loans channeled through three commercial
banks. This component incorporated HMGN's preference for loan rather than grant assistance to
the affected households, even though World Bank Guidelines (OP 8.50) permit emergency relief
to be in the form of grants. The loan program was satisfactorily completed in 1991. Due to the
appreciation of SDR against the Nepalese Rupee, savings from the Credit allocation for this
component were substantial. Against an estimate of SDR 22.7 million for this component, SDR
14.1 million (about 62 percent) were disbursed. The undisbursed balance of SDR 9.33 million
was canceled in October 1993 2
11.   The number of grants allocated for latrine construction and smokeless stoves was less
than one-quarter of the appraisal estimate of 55,000 households. The low take-up rate of the
grants for the smokeless stoves and latrines was attributed to insufficient effort to raise public
awareness of the value of such facilities and the inadequate technical support from the project.
This was partly due to the lack of participation by NGOs in the promotion and training for the
construction of latrines and stoves, even though the project explicitly included funding for
support to NGOs assisting with this component. It appears that mutually satisfactory
arrangements between HMGN and NGOs could not be worked out to enable them to play a more
active role.
12.   A survey of 1 percent of loan beneficiaries (500 households) carried out in 1993 showed
that 97 percent of them used the loan to rebuild their homes. Eighty four percent built entirely

new houses because of the extent of damage to their original homes. Only a small minority
reported having received adequate guidance/training from the Project Unit in construction
techniques, although the majority incorporated some strengthening features to increase
earthquake resistance.
13.   No action was taken by the project unit to pursue the non-emergency objectives (para. 3,
(b), (c) and (d)) due to lack of interest/commitment on the part of HMGN. They were shelved at
the same time as the housing loan program was wound up in mid- 1991.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors not Subject to Government Control
14.   The effect of the political changes in Nepal during 1990-92 had a major impact on the
project. The dissolution of Nagar Panchayats and the appointment of interim municipality
boards prior to elections in mid- 1992, disrupted the preparation and approval of loan proposals.
The initial clients of the Town Development Fund Board (TDFB), the Nagar Panchayats, were
removed from office and the interim municipality boards were reluctant to enter into loan
commitments, given their temporary status. Then the newly-elected municipalities were slow to
familiarize themselves with their new responsibilities and become fully operational. As a result,
three years were effectively lost before the Municipal Development Component of the project got
properly under way.
15.   There was also a general reluctance on the part of Municipalities to borrow funds for
development works, which took substantial time and effort to overcome. The availability of
grant funds from TDFB for small projects may have made the task of convincing them to borrow
more difficult. Municipalities also resisted donor requirements regarding procurement
procedures, employment of local consultants, etc.
Municipalities' Implementation Capacity
16.   The ability of municipalities to design and prepare project proposals, carry out the
bidding and selection process and implement projects in a timely way was (and remains) a
bottleneck that limits their absorptive capacity. This weakness hindered the ability of TDFB to
make loans to the municipalities, which are also often reluctant to seek outside assistance to carry
out feasibility studies and prepare detailed designs, particularly using loan funds. However, there
has been some progress since the project was appraised eight years ago, as can be seen by the
improved rate of disbursements over the past two years.
17.   The project design envisaged that initial assistance to municipalities to prepare projects
suitable for IDA financing through TDFB would be provided by a UJNDP-financed technical
assistance project, Management Support for Urban Development (MSUD), for which the Bank
was the executing agency. According to the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR, para. 4.16), a stock of
suitable sub-projects had already been prepared and was sufficient to absorb all the IDA funds.
However, the quality of sub-projects prepared with the assistance of MSUD, often, did not meet



- 5 -
IDA appraisal standards. Considerable time and effort therefore had to be devoted to improve
these loan applications.
Technical Assistance to TDFB
18.   The project included US$ 0.9 million of expatriate technical assistance to assist the
newly-created TDFB establish operating procedures, carry out technical and financial evaluations
of project proposals from municipalities and identify training needs. This UNDP-financed
assistance was ineffective because it coincided with the period of TDFB inactivity (1990-92) due
to political factors and because of the poor integration of the three advisers into TDFB's
operations. No lasting benefit remains from their presence. No significant training of TDFB
staff appears to have taken place either, despite the clear need.
Factors Subject to Government Control
Municipal Development Component
19.  Institutional Framework The initial formation order setting up TDFB as a body
governed by the provisions of the Development Board Act (2013) did not allow it sufficient
autonomy. This may have been the simplest legal way of creating TDFB, particularly as it was
perceived as a pilot operation at that time. However, the constraints imposed on TDFB due to its
legal status as a 'board' had major long-term consequences. It made it impossible for TDFB to
operate in the autonomous manner conceived of at the start of the project. The Development
Credit Agreement (DCA) with IDA requires TDFB to keep accounts on an accrual basis, while
Boards must observe HMGN requirements to prepare accounts on a cash basis. TDFB was
prohibited from carrying forward end-of-year balances, investing funds or even operating
independent bank accounts. Even though the Municipalities were the project's main
beneficiaries, they had little influence over TDFB because they were in a minority on its board
and because their board representatives were also government-appointees. In these respects, the
design of project was flawed.
20.   TDFB Management and Staffing. TDFB suffered from frequent changes of Executive
Director (five in eight years), and there was often political interference in staff recruitment. The
erosion of its salaries due to HMGN unwillingness to grant increases led to the loss of some good
staff to better-paying organizations and had a negative effect on the motivation of those
remaining. It is presently short of qualified staff in critical areas, but overstaffed with low-skill
personnel.
21.   Competition from other donor funding. Utilization of IDA loan funds was also reduced
by greater emphasis on the grant facility and later by competition from GTZ's urban
development through local efforts project, a soft loan program, which offered more attractive
lending terms to the municipalities. However, this program was suspended in late 1993.

Earthquake Component
22.   In 1992, HMGN decided to convert housing reconstruction loans of NRs. 5,000 into
grants, and waive repayment of the first NRs. 5,000 of those with loans up to NRs. 10,000. Low-
income borrowers accounted for about 22,000 loans with a total value of NRs. 1 10 million.
Those whose loans exceeded NRs. 10,000 did not get any such concession.
23.   The repayment of the still-outstanding loans to date has been extremely poor because
those who were not granted any relief feel that they have been unfairly treated and should have at
least benefited from the waiver on their first NRs. 5,000 of borrowings. Meanwhile the interest
due but not paid has risen to a level close to the initial principal. The current stalemate is
unsatisfactory for all parties; the commercial banks continue to hold these non-performning assets
while being theoretically liable for the corresponding repayments to HMGN, the borrowers are
unable to sell the assets they used as collateral at the time of borrowing and HMGN continues to
be solicited for further concessions that the borrowers feel are inevitable.
D. SUSTAINABILITY OF PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
24.   The sustainability of the sub-projects financed by TDFB depends on the maintenance
practices and financial health of the respective Municipalities. These vary considerably from one
municipality to another, but the financial position of all the municipalities will be subject to
considerable uncertainty in the coming years, following HMGN's decision to abolish octroi
taxes. Some municipalities are better placed than others to mobilize revenues from other
sources, but in overall terms the sustainability of the sub-projects is uncertain.
25.   As regards TDFB itself, its sustainability seems likely, given the build-up in its financial
resources from interest charges and loan repayments. The KfW grant (para. 42) will assist TDFB
in accumulating further reserves. Unlike the IDA Credit which it must repay to HMGN, TDFB
is able to retain all the KfW ]oan repayments from municipalities for future relending operations.
The involvement of KfW through its supervision activities should also help to perpetuate rigor in
lending criteria and the observance of regular progress reporting.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
26.   Bank performance was satisfactory at identification, as can be seen by the appropriateness
of project objectives. However, flaws in project design (para. 19) show that it was unsatisfactory
at the preparation and appraisal stage. The project itself did not contain any explicit actions or
components to enable it to address objective (c) (para. 3) even though this was critical to the
ability of TDFB to fund projects. Instead, it initially relied on the UNDP-financed MSUD
project to help municipalities prepare project proposals and engineering designs of adequate
standard for IDA-financing. However, this arrangement does not seem to have worked
satisfactorily (para. 17).



-7 -
27.   The size and scope of project was over-ambitious and unrealistic, given the limited
absorptive capacity of the municipalities, and use of the newly-established and inexperienced
TDFB as implementing agency. It envisaged the onlending of US$1.5-2.0 million annually by
TDFB to municipalities from the second year of project implementation. According to the SAR,
(para. 2.08), this represented a five-fold increase in annual flows from HMGN to municipalities.
However, TDFB only reached this lending level in the seventh and final year of project
implementation.
28.   At the time of appraisal, the Bank does not appear to have properly understood the
implications of the Development Board Act for TDFB's autonomy. There is no reference in the
SAR to potential problems which could arise from its legal status. Yet these surfaced almost as
soon as the Credit became effective.
29.   The evaluation of project risks was weak. The SAR does not mention the risks to
successful project implementation posed by the poor implementation capacity of municipalities,
or anticipate potential problems arising from TDFB's limited autonomy.
30.   Supervision was generally satisfactory and was carried out very regularly till 1993, but
was reduced thereafter to one headquarters mission per year. This was a deliberate step arising
from the decision to limit the scope of the project and wind it up on schedule (para. 32). There
were a total of 13 supervision missions, ten of which took place prior to mid- 1993, with only
three formal missions from headquarters during the final three years of implementation.
However, during this period, Resident Mission staff were actively involved in project
monitoring. More responsibility for supervision could have been delegated to the Resident
Mission at an earlier date, given the dispersal of sub-projects all over Nepal and the need to liaise
closely with the municipalities.
31.   By mid-1993, following several ineffective attempts at piecemeal reform to the TDFB
Formation Order, Bank staff correctly concluded that improving the Board's institutional
framework would require major changes involving new legislation rather than simple
amendments to existing agreements.
32.   This assessment was one of the reasons leading to the decision in late 1993 to wind up the
project at its original closing date, having ensured that all ongoing commitments would be met.
This was achieved by stopping approvals for new sub-projects sufficiently in advance of the
closing date. An uncommitted amount of SDR 5.51 million was therefore canceled effective
January 1, 1995.
33.   Donor coordination within the project appears to have been unsatisfactory, even though
the IDA project depended on the efforts of the UNDP and GTZ financed projects, (paras. 17 and
21, respectively) to reinforce municipalities' project implementation capacities.

F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
Municipal Development
34.   Overall Borrower performance was rated as unsatisfactory. HMGN did not share the
objective of making TDFB autonomous as it tended to view TDFB as just another donor-
supported project implementation unit with a finite life, rather than as a nascent financial
institution. There was unnecessary interference in TDFB's staffing and salary policy. After an
initial equity contribution from HMGN to TDFB, which was a condition of Credit effectiveness,
HMGN never contributed the envisaged 10 percent share of civil works loans3. TDFB was
obliged to draw down HMGN's equity to meet this shortfall.
35.   TDFB's efforts to 'market' its IDA loan facility to municipalities was inadequate in the
early years of project implementation, particularly in the face of reluctance to borrow (Part I,
para. 15). Although a major share of the responsibility for the inability to lend was due to factors
outside TDFB's control, recent experience has shown that it could have achieved better results
earlier on. There was a significant improvement in TDFB's performance during the last two
years as indicated by the increase in loan approvals. Out of a total amount of NRs. 124.2 million
onlent by TDFB to municipalities, almost 70 percent was disbursed during the final twelve
months of project implementation.
Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction
36.   The implementation performance of the project unit was satisfactory. However,
HMGN's reversal of its policy on aid to earthquake victims was ill-considered. Apart from
violating a covenant of the DCA with IDA, the decision has also had undesirable consequences
because it has demotivated the remaining borrowers from repaying their loans. The decision not
to pursue the other objectives of the Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction component
also shows a lack of commitment to the longer-term developmental, dimension of natural
disasters (as opposed to emergency relief).
G. ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT OUTCOME
Municipal Development
37.   This component made a very modest contribution to improving urban infrastructure in
towns outside Kathmandu. There has also been some accumulation of expertise in project
design, appraisal and implementation within TDFB, which will assist it in carrying out the
follow-on project financed by KfW. In these respects, it is appropriate to view the project as a
pilot operation, even if the initial design was more ambitious.
3 For civil works, IDA financed 80 percent of the cost, the municipalities 10 percent and the balance
was to come from HMGN.



-9 -
38.   Nevertheless, the project outcome is judged to be unsatisfactory, because of (i) the
inability to use scarce IDA resources during a period of pressing urban infrastructure needs; (ii)
TDFB's institutional weakness (paras. 19-20); and (iii) the continuing low absorptive capacity of
municipalities (para. 16).
Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction
39.   The outcome of this component is judged to be satisfactory because about 300,000 people
benefited from loans to reconstruct their homes. The funds were disbursed rapidly and there
were few cases of misuse of loans for purposes other than house reconstruction. Although the
stated objectives were met only partially, they were of lesser importance than the primary goal of
aiding people rendered homeless by the earthquake.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
40.   Completion of the unfinished sub-projects financed by IDA will require close supervision
by TDFB. The approval of adequate funds in the budget for the current financial year by the
Birgunj Municipality Board is crucial for completion of the project before the next rainy season.
41.   Only at the end of the project in mid-1996 has there been an improvement in TDFB's
institutional framework. The new Town Development Fund Act, which was granted Royal
Assent on February 5, 1997, may free TDFB from some of the current constraints it faces due to
its status as a 'board'. It is too early to assess if the transformation of TDFB into a 'Fund' will
lead to a significant improvement in its institutional capabilities. However, even under the new
Act, the Board of the Fund will continue to be chaired by the Secretary of the Ministry of
Housing and Physical Planning (MHPP), or a Government nominee with 'special knowledge in
the field of urban development'. HMGN will continue to have the power to appoint the five
Mayors who are Board members and to approve the Fund's Rules. The fact that HMGN has
retained these critical powers over TDFB suggests that government interference is likely to
remain a problem in the future.
42.   KfW has recently made a grant of DM 10 million to TDFB to enable it to continue its
lending operations over the 1996-2000 period. However, unlike IDA, part of the KfW assistance
can be passed on to Municipalities in the form of grants for social infrastructure projects. On-
lending tenns for loans to the municipalities are similar to those of the IDA project.
43.   The momentum built up by TDFB over the last 12 months of the project needs to be
sustained if these funds are to be fully utilized. There now appears to be greater interest in
borrowing on the part of municipalities, compared to several years ago, but the pipeline of
adequately prepared and viable proposals to be submitted for donor funding is still thin.
44.   TDFB's long-termn goal is to become an urban development bank, but its ability to do so
depends on demonstrating that it is capable of improving upon the rate of disbursements
achieved during the last year of the IDA project. In addition, it will need to build up significant
financial reserves, which can only occur if the repayment by municipalities continues to be



- 10-
satisfactory. Finally, the process of granting greater autonomy to TDFB will also need to be
taken further, to enhance the influence of the municipalities.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
45.   Key lessons learned from this project are:
*   The importance of the legal framework for successful institution-building should not
be underestimated, but it should also be recognized that an appropriate legal
framework will not guarantee autonomy. Much depends on how the texts are
interpreted and used in practice, which in turn depends on a commitment to the
principles of good governance (para. 41).
*   There is a need to focus more on improving the municipalities' implementation
capacity since they are the weakest link in the chain between IDA and the ultimate
project beneficiaries (para. 16).
Close coordination is needed between donors with overlapping interventions in a
given sector, particularly when the interventions of one donor may be crucial to the
success of another donor's project (para. 33).
It is a mistake to only partly convert emergency relief from loans into grants because
of the precedent this sets. It would have been simpler and better to have offered
modest grants to all genuine victims right from the start, with top-up loans available
for those requiring larger sums for house reconstruction (para. 40).

MISSION'S AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    A World Bank mission comprising Mr. Sunil Mathrani (Economist, Consultant), visited
Nepal from 28 October to 7 November 1996, to gather data and hold discussions on
implementation of the above project. The Mission wishes to record its appreciation for the
collaboration and assistance accorded to it by all parties, and in particular by the Town
Development Fund Board (TDFB) and the Municipalities of Birgunj. Biratnagar, Bharatpur,
Dharan, Dhulikel, Hetauda and Lalitpur. This aide-memoire records the preliminary findings
and conclusions of the Mission and does not represent the official views of the World Bank
management.
2.    The Mission received a copy of the Implementation Completion Report prepared by
TDFB on the Municipal Development Component of the project. However, an ICR for the
Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Program has not yet been prepared. The Mission requested
that MHPP prepare this report and forward it to the Bank by 30th November. At a wrap-up
meeting on 7 November, Mr. P. Nepal, the Joint Secretary, \MHPP stated that the Ministry was
taking steps to have the ICR prepared rapidly. He also regretted that the Bank had decided to
end its involvement with TDFB at a time when it was showing signs of improved performance.
The Joint Secretary requested that the Bank continue to maintain links with TDFB with a view to
preparing a new lending operation in the future.
Project Objectives
3. The main objectives of the earthquake housing reconstruction component of the project were
to:
(a) assist HMG in implementing its program to reconstruct damaged housing;
(b) improve construction standards and develop earthquake-resistant features for
buildings.
4. The main objectives of the municipal development component of the project were to:
(a) establish a financial intermediary to provide financial support to municipalities;
(b) provide long-term financing for social infrastructure and revenue generating projects
of municipalities; and
(c) strengthen the financial and administrative capacity of municipalities to prepare,
implement and maintain projects.
Project Design Issues
5.    The initial formation order setting up TDFB as a body governed by the provisions of the
Development Board Act (2013) did not allow it sufficient autonomy. This may have been the
simplest legal way of creating TDFB, particularly as it was perceived as a pilot operation at that
time. However, the constraints imposed on TDFB due to its legal status as a 'board' had major
long-term consequences. It made it impossible for TDFB to operate in the autonomous manner
conceived of at the start of the project. In this respect. the design ol project was flawed. Several



- 18 -                      Appendix A
attempts at piecemeal reform to the Formation Order were attempted during project
implementation, but with little effect. Only at the end of the project has there been a
breakthrough with the approval by Parliament of a new Town Development Fund Bill, which
may free TDFB from some of the current constraints it faces due to its status as a board.
6.    The size and scope of project now appears over-ambitious and unrealistic, given the
limited absorptive capacity of the municipalities, and use of the newly-established and
inexperienced TDFB as implementing agency. It envisaged the onlending of US$ 1.5-2.0 million
annually by TDFB to municipalities from the second year of project implementation. TDFB
only reached this level in the seventh and final year of implementation.
7.    The IDA project itself did not contain any explicit actions or components to enable it to
address objective (c), even though this was critical to the ability of TDFB to fund projects.
Instead, it initially relied on the UNDP-financed MSUD project to help municipalities prepare
project proposals and engineering designs of adequate standard for IDA-financing. However,
this arrangement does not seem to have worked satisfactorily.
8.    The evaluation of project risks was also weak. The Staff Appraisal Report does not
mention the risks to successful project implementation posed by the poor implementation
capacity of municipalities, or anticipate potential problems arising from TDFB's limited
autonomy.
Implementation and Results
9.    The project consisted of two unrelated components joined together in one project. The
earthquake component was added to a purely municipal development project in September 1988
in order to facilitate rapid loan processing within the World Bank. The components remained
entirely separate and have had very different implementation histories.
Earthquake Emergency Housing Reconstruction Program
10.   About NRs. 503 million (US$ 11.8 m) was disbursed for this component which was
satisfactorily completed in 1991. Nearly 53,000 households benefited from financial assistance
in the form of concessionary loans channeled through three commercial banks. This component
incorporated HMG's preference for loan rather than grant assistance to the affected households,
even though World Bank guidelines permit emergency relief to be in the form of grants.
However, in 1992 HMG decided to convert loans of NRs. 5000 into grants, and waive repayment
of the first NRs. 5000 of those with loans up to NRs. 10,000. Low-income borrowers accounted
for about 22,000 loans with a total value of NRs. 110 million. The Mission was unable to
ascertain how many borrowers with loans of NRs. 10,000 or less were granted partial relief.
Those whose loans exceeded NRs. 10,000 did not get any concession from HMG.
11.   The repayment of the still-outstanding loans to date has been extremely poor because
those who were not granted any relief feel that they have been unfairly treated and should have at



- 19 -                       Appendix A
least benefited from the waiver on their first Rs. 5000 of borrowings. Meanwhile the interest due
but not paid has risen to a level close to the initial principal. They have lobbied HMG for total
loan forgiveness, but have not received a response. The Mission was informed that MHPP has
proposed to MOF that some additional debt relief be granted, but that this was rejected. The
current stalemate is unsatisfactory for all parties; the commercial banks continue to hold these
non-performing assets while being theoretically liable for the corresponding repayments to
HMG, the borrowers are unable to sell the assets they used as collateral at the time of borrowing
and HMG continues to be sollicited for further concessions that the borrowers feel are inevitable.
The Mission recommends that HMG take a final decision on the matter so that it can be
definitively resolved.
Municipal Development Component
12.   The municipal development component achieved much less than expected. Very few
sub-projects were executed during the first five years of the project (1989-94) for reasons
mentioned in paras. 12-16 below. As it was apparent in late 1994 that it would be impossible to
utilize the available funds before the closing date, SDR 5.5 million from the Credit was canceled
in early 1995. However, due to a major effort in the final two years, a total of 28 sub-projects
were executed of which 24 were fully completed when the IDA credit closed on 30 June 1996. A
total amount of NRs. 124.2 million was onlent by TDFB as financing for these projects. Eleven
projects were revenue-generating (bus parks, shop buildings etc.) and the rest were social in
nature (mainly storm water drainage). Three of the four uncompleted projects require only minor
expenditures as they are over 90% complete. Only Birgunj Municipality will have to bear a
substantial amount of about NRs. 1.3 crores from its own resources to finish the remaining 30%
of the storm water drainage project.
13.   Repayment performance by municipalities has been satisfactory so far. As of 27 October
1996, overdue repayments on IDA-financed sub-projects represented 17% of total repayments
due to TDFB for these loans. Prospects for continued satisfactory performance in this area
appear to be high, given the almost non-existent alternative sources of investment funds for
municipalities. At the time of project appraisal, both IDA and HMG considered the risk of poor
repayment by municipalities to be substantial.
Major factors affecting the project.
14.   The effect of the political changes in Nepal during 1990-92 had a major impact on the
project. The dissolution of Nagar Panchayats and the appointment of interim municipality
boards prior to elections in 1992, disrupted the preparation and approval of loan proposals.
TDFB's initial clients were removed from office and the interim municipality Boards were
reluctant to enter into loan committments, given their temporary status. Then the newly-elected
municipalities were slow to familiarize themselves with their new responsibilities and become
fully operational.



- 20 -                        Appendix A
15.   There was also a general reluctance on the part of Municipalities to borrow funds for
development works, which took substantial time and effort to overcome. The availability of
grant funds from TDFB for small projects may have made the task of convincing them to borrow
more difficult. Municipalities also resisted donor requirements regarding procurement
procedures, employment of local consultants etc.
16.   TDFB's efforts to 'market' its IDA loan facility to municipalities was inadequate in the
early years of project implementation. Utilisation of IDA loan funds was also reduced by greater
emphasis on the grant facility and later by competion from GTZ's soft loan program, which
offered more attractive lending terms to the municipalities. However, this program was
suspended in late 1993.
17.   TDFB suffered from frequent changes of Executive Director (5 in eight years), and the
erosion of its salaries due to inadequate increases. This led to the loss of some good staff to
better-paying organizations and had a negative effect on the motivation of those remaining. It is
presently short of qualified staff in critical areas, but overstaffed with low-skill personnel.
18.   The ability of municipalities to design, carry out bidding and selection process and
implement projects in a timely way was (and remains) a bottleneck that limits their absorptive
capacity. However, there has been some progress since the project was appraised 8 years ago, as
can be seen by the improved rate of disbursements over the past two years.
19.   Donor coordination within the project appears to have been unsatisfactory, even though
the IDA project depended on the efforts of the UNDP and GTZ (udle) projects to reinforce
municipalities' project implementation capacities.
Assessment of ProJect Outcome
20.   The project has made a very modest contribution to improving urban infrastructure in
towns outside Kathmandu. There has also been some accumulation of expertise in project
design, appraisal and implementation within TDFB, which will assist it in carrying out the
follow-on project financed by KfW. In these respects, it is appropriate to view the IDA project
as a pilot operation, even if the initial design was more ambitious.
21.   Nevertheless, the project outcome is judged to be unsatisfactory, because of (i) the
inability to use scarce IDA resources during a period of pressing urban infrastructure needs; (ii)
TDFB's institutional weakness (para 17); and (iii) the continuing low absorptive capacity of
municipalities (para. 18).
22.   It is too early to assess if the improved legal framework and the transformation of TDFB
from its current status as a 'Board' into a 'Fund' will lead to a significant improvement in its
institutional capabilities. Even under the new Bill (which is now awaiting Royal assent), the
Board of the Fund will continue to be chaired by the Secretary, MHPP and the Fund Rules have
to be approved by HMG.

Future Prospects
23.   Completion of the unfinished sub-projects financed by IDA should be closely supervised
by TDFB. The approval of adequate funds in the budget for the current financial year by the
Birgunj Municipality Board is crucial for completion of the project before the next rainy season.
24.   The amount KfW financial assistance to continue TDFB's lending operations is adequate
for the next 3 years. However, the momentum built up over the last 12 months needs to be
sustained if the funds are to be utilised during this time, particularly as municipal elections are
due within the next 6 months. There now appears to be greater interest in borrowing on the part
of municipalities, compared to several years ago, but the pipeline of adequately prepared and
viable proposals to be submitted for donor funding is still thin.
25.   TDFB's long-term goal is to become an urban development bank, but its ability to do so
depends on demonstrating that it is capable of improving upon the rate of disbursements
achieved during the last year of the IDA project. In addition, it will need to build up significant
financial reserves, which can only occur if the repayment by municipalities continues to be
satisfactory. The autonomy to be granted by HMG to TDFB under the new Act will also need to
be respected both in the letter as well as the spirit of the Act.
Key Lessons Learnt
i The importance of the legal framework for successful institution-building should not be
underestimated, but it should also be recognized that an appropriate legal framework
will not guarantee autonomy. Much depends on how the texts are interpreted and used
in practice.
* There is a need to focus more on improving the municipalities' implementation capacity
since they are the weakest link in the chain between IDA and the ultimate project
beneficiaries.
* Close coordination is needed between donors with overlapping interventions in a given
sector, particularly when the interventions of one donor may be crucial to the success of
another donor's project.

BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION REPORT
(by the Town Development Fund Board for Part A of the Project)
Part A. Municipal Development Component
A.   Evaluation Summary
1.    A credit agreement (Municipal Development and Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction
Project) had been reached between His Majesty's government of Nepal (HMGN) and
International Development Association (IDA) on 7th April 1989, Part of which (SDR 7.8
million) was to finance the "Town Development Programme". The credit was closed on June 30,
1996.
2.    A large part of the credit SDR 5.51 million was cancelled by IDA in March 1995 due to
slow disbursement of funds for various reasons in the first four years.
3.    To provide loan assistance for development of social infrastructure and revenue
generating projects in the municipalities is the main objective of the project. Only those
municipalities who can generate sufficient net income to service debt were eligible for loan.
4.    The achievement of the progress was very slow during the first four years due to the late
arrival of the external advisors from UNDP and political changes (no elected Board of
municipalities existed from 1990 to 1992). However the achievement of the project was
satisfactory thereafter.
5.    The TDFB has requested the municipalities to allocate separate budget for the operation
and management of the project. Till date the municipalities had taken proper care of the
components of the project and there seems to be no problem on the sustainability.
6.    The project during its operation was affected mainly by political changes, late arrival of
the external advisors, non-acceptablity of the initial project, municipalities lacking expertise to
initiate the project, long period of review by IDA, frequent changes in the top management
positions in the TDFB and upper limitation on the total loan amount.
7.    In totality the outcome of the project has been favourable to promote social,
environmental, technical and financial conditions of the municipalities.
B.    Background and Sources of Finance:
8.    The Town Development Fund Board (TDFB) is a financial institution administrating
grants and loans to municipalities. The TDFB was established in 1989 as a semi-autonomous
body with the overall goal of improving urban management in Nepal by providing financial
assistance to municipalities. The main objectives of the TDFB are:



- 23 -                           Appendix B
* to provide financial support to municipalities of the implementation of social
infrastructure and revenue generating projects, and
* to strengthen the technical and managerial capability of municipalities to implement
the projects.
9.    From its beginning until July 1996, the TDFB was financed by loans from the World
Bank and by grants from GTZ and 273 grant and 41 loan projects were completed at a cost of
approximately NRs. 233 million.
10.   Although the type of projects differed according to the priorities and needs of the
municipalities; the most popular ones included sanitation, environmental improvement and
revenue generating projects.
11.   To enable the TDFB to continue its support to municipalities, a new financing agreement
was concluded in December 1995 between the Federal Republic of Germany and His majesty's
Government of Nepal.
12.   Under this agreement the Federal Republic of Germany through "Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau" (KfW) has provided grant fund of DM 10 million to the TDFB for continuing
their activities until December 2000.
13.   The fund will be used for grants and loans to municipalities, as well as local consultancy
services for project studies and construction supervision. Interest and loan repayment from the
municipalities will be turned into a revolving fund by the TDFB to finance further projects.
C.   Project Objective:
14.   His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN) entered into a development credit
agreement (Municipal Development and Earthquake Emergency housing Reconstruction Project)
with the International Development Association (IDA) on 7th April 1989, part of which (SDR
7.8 million) was to finance the establishment and operation of the TDFB and provide seed loan
capital for Urban Investment Projects for municipalities.
15.   The credit was closed on June 30, 1996. Due to a number of reasons, there had been a
very slow disbursement of funds for long term loans to municipalities in the first four years of
the starting period and the credit (SDR 5.51 million) was cancelled by the IDA in March 1995.
16.   The project objective of the Town Development Fund Board (TDFB) was to provide loan
assistance available from International Development Association to all municipalities of the
Kingdom for promotion and development of social infrastructure and revenue generating
projects.



- 24 -                           Appendix B
17.   On the basis of feasibility study reports and technical documents prepared by
municipality, TDFB provided loans to the different components of social infrastructure and
revenue generating project (Annex B. 1)
18.   Only those municipalities which have demonstrated a capacity to manage their
investments and generate sufficient net income to service debt was eligible for loan from the
TDFB.
19.   Minimum loan amount for each component was NRs. 250,000 and maximum was NRs.
20 million.
20.   TDFB has provided loan upto 90% (80% from IDA credit and 10% from HMG equity in
civil works) of the estimated project cost excluding the cost of land and the municipality had to
furnish the remaining 10% as the matching fund from its own source.
D.   Achievement of the objectives:
21.   The project was started in January, 1990 eight months later due to the late arrival of the
external advisor from UNDP.
22.   By the time the external advisors arrived, the then Panchayat Political System was
abolished. The new multiparty system came in. The Board of people's representatives of
municipalities was dissolved and a temporary Board consisting of representatives from different
organizations could not make any decision to ask for loans.
23.   The elected Board consisting of people's representatives was constituted only in mid
1992 and it took several months for them to get convinced and understand the advantages of the
loan from the TDFB.
24.  It was mainly due to these reasons, the project could not pick up it momentum in the first
four years. However rapid progress was made thereafter in the investment in the urban
development programmes (Annex-B. I, B.2 and B.4)
25.   Though the TDFB was not able to utilize all the sactioned funds resulting in a large
amount being cancelled due to the slow disbursement, the progress of the project was good
enough at the later stages. The repayment of interest and principal on loan from the
municipalities seem to be good. (Annex B.4)
E.    Sustainability:
26.  In order to sustain the project, the TDFB has asked the municipalities to separate the
budget for the operation and management of the projects. Even now, when the TDFB gives
loan/grant to the municipalities from the KfW funding it still takes into consideration the
operational status of the previous projects funded by IDA.



- 25 -                            Appendix B
27.   Since most of the components of the project are directly related to the public welfare,
municipalities are pushed by the public itself to maintain the components of the project.
28.   Till date, the municipalities have taken proper care of all the components of the project
and they seem to be running satisfactorily.
F.    Major Factors affecting the project:
29.   The major factors affecting the projects were as follows:
(i)    Late arrival of the external advisors from UNDP.
The agreement was made on April 1989 and the external advisors arrived only at the
beginning of 1990, which was nearly eight months after the agreement.
As it was initial stage of TDFB and top management staffs were not experienced, neither
the external advisors could help greatly for the speedy progress of the organization nor the staffs
could get benefited by the presence of the advisors.
(ii)   Political changes.
The then Panchayat Political System was abolished in 1990. The new multiparty system
came in. The Board of people's representatives of municipalities was dissolved. It was difficult
to convince non-elected members to take loans. There was no development activity during this
interim period by municipalities.
(iii)  The municipalities were not psychologically prepared to ask and accept loan for the
development works, which is but natural in the initial stages. They were not convinced weather
they will be in position to pay interest and the principal in time.
(iv)  Initial loan projects not acceptable.
Management Support for Urban Development (MSUD) prepared projects did not fully or
sufficiently meet loan application requirements. None could be processed immediately and
nearly all of them required considerable more work to bring them upto appraisal requirements.
Also, the projects initiated by the then town panchayats were not readily acceptable to the
elected municipalities as priority projects.
(v)   The municipalities were not ready to use loan amount for conducting feasibility studies
and detail design of the project.
(vi)   Municipalities lacked the expertise to initiate projects and prepare loan application
documentations.



- 26 -                            Appendix B
(vii)  IDA loan requirements necessitated a long initial preparation before application
submission followed by another long period for review, tendering procedures and contract
awarding.
(viii) Frequent changes in the TDFB top management posts resulting in a poor continuity in
policy and loan activity experience.
(xi)  The response from the IDA was slow specially during 1995/96 resulting in incompletion
of the projects; and
(x)   Upper limitations on the total loan amount to be made available to a single municipality
discouraged large municipalities, who wish to take loans exceeding NRs. 20 million (the upper
limit)
G.   Assessment of the Outcome:
30.   The project laid emphasis on the development and improvement of the social
infrastructure and the revenue generating components of the project to promote social
infrastructure and financial status of municipalities in Nepal, and the establishment of the TDFB
in the direction of strengthening the municipalities though provision of financial, technical and
managerial support.
31.   Considering the problems faced in the past a separate act called "Town Development
Fund Act, 1996", has been approved by the parliament and waiting the Royal assent. This will
give the TDFB a lot of autonomy to operate freely and efficiently in the future.
32.   To a greater extent the project helped the municipalities to improve themselves in many
ways financially, economically, technically and managerially. In totality, the outcome of the
project is rated satisfactory.

Annex B.3
Incompleted Loan Projects and their Summary
1.  Stormwater drainage construction (AL-004-S)/Birgunj -
This was a problematic project due to court case; which delayed the project progress very
much. Upon new approval for packages II and III of the project, the progress is made swiftly to
achieve 70% of physical progress; and now the work has been stopped due to early monsoon.
The municipality has committed to complete the rest of the project from their own resource at the
earliest and forward the project completion report to TDFB.
2.  Bypass drain construction in Dirghika Sagar (BL-006-S)/Janakpur:-
This project is in the side of Dirghika Sagar (a historical pond) and the physical progress
is 92%. The rest of the job can be completed within 10 (ten) working days; but due to early
monsoon and heavy flooding the work could not be continued. Municipality is committed to
complete the project from their own resource and send the project completion report to TDFB at
the earliest.
3.  Stormwater Drainage Construction (AL-010-S)/Butwal:-
Due to the change in alignment and scope and design the project consequently the cost
has increased from NRs. 7.9 million to NRs. 15.6 millions, but it took long time for the approval
of additional cost. The municipality has already started the work under irrigation canal (36 Kulo)
by diverting the canal but as this is prime time for paddy plantation in Nepal the farmers opposed
for the diversion of the canal and the work has been stopped. Also the early monsoon caused
interruption in work. The present physical progress is 92.93%. Now the municipality is
committed to complete the rest of the project from their own resource at the earliest and send the
project completion report to TDFB.
4.  Outlet Drain Construction Contract III (BL-027-S)/Janakpur:-
This project has physical progress of 96.12%. Only a small portion of the job is left due
to the dispute in the site and which is likely to be settled soon. Now, the municipality is
committed for the completion of the rest of the project from their own resource and send the
project completion report to TDFB at the earliest.

BORROWER'S REPORT ON COMPLETION
(by the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning for Part B of the Project)
Part B. Earthquake Emergency Housing
Background
1.    On August 21, 1988, the Kingdom of Nepal, experienced an earthquake of magnitude 6.7
on the Richter scale. The earthquake's epicenter was in Udayapur, about 160 km south east of
Kathmandu. Twenty-seven districts in the Eastern and Central Development Regions of Nepal
were affected. These included all the sixteen districts in the Eastern Region and eleven out of
nineteen districts in the Central Region.
2.    The earthquake resulted in the loss of 721 lives and left more than 460,000 persons
homeless. Damages included the loss of more than 65,000 homes, 2,000 schools and 900 public
structures and buildings. The greatest amount of damage occurred in the Eastern Region.
Additionally, infrastructures, including roads, bridges, and irrigation structures were damaged.
Total damage was estimated to be NRs 4.2 billion (US$150 million).
3.   In response to earthquake, His Majesty's Government of Nepal, with the assistance of the
local and international aid community, provided immediate disaster relief to affected individuals.
This included care for the injured, NRs 2,000 for death suffered, NRs 1,000 for loss of a house,
plastic sheets for emergency shelter, cloth, cooking utensils and 40 kg of rice per family.
Subsequent to the provision of immediate aid, HMGN announced and commenced the
implementation of its reconstruction programme. The programme was developed through the
following actions by HMGN:
(a)   Constitution of a Central Earthquake Affected Areas Reconstruction and
Rehabilitation Committee (CEAARRC) under the chairmanship of the Minister of
Housing and Physical Planning, responsible for coordinating the programme.
(b)   Allocation of 3% (NRs 340 million approximately) on the current fiscal year's
development budget for reconstruction and rehabilitation, part of which was
available for housing reconstruction.
(c)   Negotiation of an US$41.5 million credit (Cr. 1 988-NEP) from the International
Development Agency (IDA).
(d)   Recruiting on contracts of 28 engineers and 272 overseers to work on the housing
reconstruction program (recruitment completed by mid October 1988).
(e)   Commencement training of 1,200 rural workers to promote the use of low cost
toilet and smokeless cooking stoves.
(f)    Development of minimum earthquakes resistant requirements. Their
incorporation in district headquarters and urban areas was made mandatory.



- 32 -                           Appendix C
(g)   Begin construction of demonstration houses to show sound building techniques
and a simple low cost earthquake resistant features.
(h)   Provide NRs 600 subsidies for families that incorporate low cost toilets and
improved cooking stoves as part of the reconstruction programme.
(i)    Begin a house reconstruction loan programme through Nepal Bank Ltd. (NBL),
Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB), and Agriculture Development Bank (ADB).
Project Objectives
4.    Soon after the earthquake, the data compiled by the Relief Committees in each affected
districts of Eastern and Central Nepal showed that more than 68,000 homes had been damaged
with mostly being totally destroyed. Faced on this disaster, the main objective of the project was
as follows:
(a)   Assist HMGN in implementing its programme to reconstruct housing damaged
during the earthquake.
(b)   Improve construction standards and develop earthquake resistant features for
incorporation in building through planning and development control regulations.
(c)   Provide technical assistance and training for the housing sector to address longer
term needs.
(d)   Address the environment impact relating to the excess use of timber in building
and building products manufacture.
Program Description
5.    After the completion of the initial assistance, reconstruction and rehabilitation
programmes were launched. According to the existing data some totals of 67,835 houses were
affected by the earthquake. although, an additional 7% composed of families, who were not on
the original eligibility list has now been added to the program. These figures are based in the
original relief list of eligible families which was composed by the then government, Panchyat
system, i.e., from ward chairman (now ward member), through Panchyat (Municipality) and
Ilaka committees (no longer in the present system) to the district Committee chairman and up to
the National Earthquake Relief Committee.
6.    Reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes which were completed on Ashad 2048
(July 1991) consisted of two main components as follow:
(a)   FinancialAssistance
(i)   Subsidized loans made available by the project through the banks (almost
800 branches were involved) for the purpose of reconstruction or
rehabilitation;



- 33 -                           Appendix C
(ii)   Grants, also channeled through the banks, utilized as contributions toward
the construction by householders of smokeless cooking stoves (chulo), and
improved latrines.
7.    Based on the location of the house, the types of loans were as follows:
i.    In the rural areas                                NRs 10,000
ii.   In the district headquarters areas                NRs 20,000
iii.  In the urban areas                                NRs 50,000
i.    rural areas - maximum loan                  NRs 10,000
First installment NRs 5,000                 1% interest
Second installment NRs 5,000                10% interest
ii.    District headquarters area - maximum loan  NRs  20,000
First installment NRs 10,000 consists of
NRs 5,000                              1% interest
NRs 5,000                             10% interest
second installment NRs 10,000 @             15% interest
iii.   Urban areas - maximum loan                 NRs 50,000
First installment NRs 25,000 consisting of
NRs 5,000 @
plus NRs 5,000 @
plus NRs 15,000 @
Second installment NRs 25,000 @c,
8.    Loans were made from three major banks, the Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB), Nepal Bank
Ltd. (NBL), and Agriculture Development Bank (ADB). The terms from Government to the
Bank were 14 percent for eight years with a two-year grace period. Government, however, was
to pay the Bank annually the difference between their standard lending rate for housing credit, 19
percent and the weighted average on leading rates to the affected households.
9.    Disbursements of the loans were done in two installments, which in the majority of cases
were equal, i.e., NRs 5,000 and NRs 5,000 for rural loans, NRs 10,000 for district center loans
and NRs 25,000 and NRs 25,000 for urban loans. For rapid disbursement the first installment
was based on field verification by the Panchayat chairman and ward chairman/member. To
ensure proper utilization of the loan and to motivate builders to adopt earthquake resistance
measures, technical verification by the projects district engineer or overseer was required for the
second installment.
10.   Further, to improve the health and sanitation aspects of the affected households a grant of
NRs 600 (US$2 1) was made to rural households for the construction of a smokeless cooking
stove (NRs 100) and an improved latrine (NRs 500).



- 34 -                            Appendix C
(b)   Technical Assistance
11.   Reconstruction Assistance. Reconstruction assistance was provided by the project
engineers (28) and overseers (272) in direct contact with the householders. These technicians
received training from the project and were provided with simple drawings and booklets
describing designs and techniques for the construction of earthquakes resistant houses, smokeless
cooking stoves and improved latrines. The aims of technical services were to enhance level of
technical awareness between people and to ensure maximally use of locally available materials.
12.   Training. The project trained about 1,200 local artisans in the construction of low-cost
improved latrines, smokeless cooking stoves and the proper use of local building materials.
They were also given instruction in earthquakes resistant construction measures. The project
developed manuals describing earthquake resistant features, building techniques of smokeless
cooking stoves and latrine construction which were distributed to the users.
13.   Demonstration Housing. The project constructed demonstration housing in the urban and
rural areas of the affected districts. The objectives were to demonstrate:
(a)    Sound building techniques, specially to avoid weakness in traditional building
practices.
(b)   Simple and cost-effective earthquakes resistant feature.
(c)   Construction of low-cost improved toilets and smokeless cooking stoves.
(d)   Selection of appropriate altemative building materials, specially which reduced
use of timber.
14.   The projects had printed booklets of low-cost house designs suitable for the different
environment, climatic conditions of Nepal and were distributed.
15.  Improved Material Production. Funds were provided to assist entrepreneurs and
community groups (for employment generation) to manufacture building products (e.g. cement
tiles, concrete elements for low-cost toilets, etc.). Simple and easily operated equipment were
provided free of charge to community groups and leased to entrepreneurs.
16.   In addition to the two main components of the program, the project was also engaged in
the following activities:
*  District center planning.
*  Compact settlement development.
* Government building reconstruction.
*  Support to Non-Government Organization.

Achievement
1.    Housing Loan Disbursement. The housing loan programme was completed within two
years, i.e., on the end of Fiscal Year 2047/048 (1991). As only those who were listed in the
Relief booklet were eligible for the loan, all the affected families could not be covered by the
relief operation. concerns were raised by various district committees on this shortcoming. In
order to accommodate those who were in advertently left out by the relief team, the central
committee decided to grant authority to each district committee to select additional families to
the limit of 7% of the original number of listed families in the district. thus, in total about 70,000
families were expected to benefit from the loan programme based on the information, about 78%
of the total families obtained either the first or both installments. About 54% of these receiving
first installments had obtained second installments as well. Details of loans disbursed in village
development committee, district center and municipalities by district regions and total have been
included in the Project File.
2.    Home Construction. 51,778 households were served out of this amount, 5,369 homes
were built under the supervision of the project technician and which have some measures of
earthquake resistant features.
3.    Smokeless Cooking Stoves and Improved Latrines. This component of the programme
started three months after the loan programme due to time taken to devise implementation
strategy and schedule. It was determined that the project should proceed and distribute
reinforced fiberglass toilet pan and water seal to interested affected families. In the initial phase
the project procured and supplied about 2,500 such pans/seals and then after a year procured
about 8,000 sets. However, the project was able to help to build 10,857 smokeless cooking
stoves and 8,957 improved latrines in the affected districts by the end of the project against the
total target of 55,000 each. About 6 months after the introduction of the design of smokeless
cooking sto ve, the project undertook the task of improving it to suit local conditions as the
following defects were experienced:
* It was felt that the prescribed stove was not flexible enough to accommodate
different size of utensils that families need in various occasions.
*  In spite of its simplicity construction of the stove tend to be faulty.
*  Lack of alternative materials for fuel means the stove could not be used effectively,
the stove demanded use of fuel wood of smaller size, etc.
Not all these problems could be addressed by the project but lessons learnt from actual
experiment at the improvised laboratory in the back yard of the central office as well as from the
field tests produced a cadre of technicians called stove (chulo) motivators. These technicians
totaling 5 (of this, two were retained as the motivator) in number were familiar with design
parameters and as such well equipped to respond to various field situations. Thus, the project
changed its overall strategy from implementing and prescribing a particular design or set of
design to providing broad framework within which people will evolve, as it was, their own



- 36 -                            Appendix C
design. So far as latrine is concerned, the project prescribed four alternative designs, the primary
reliable being the pan and the water seal. The project, however, emphasized two designs more
vigorously than the rest. The first design was of improved latrines with concrete rings (for pits),
concrete slabs (to cover pits) and concrete pan/water seals. The second design was either
concrete ring-pits or ordinary pit with fiberglass pan and water seal. One concrete ring and pan
production center was established at Dharan to make these elements easily available and also to
train artisans who could carry this art to other districts. The project had procured about 18 set
steel formworks, necessary to produce rings, to be distributed to district engineers. At the end of
Fiscal Year 2046/47, 7 such centers were established in 7 districts. The total number of units
sold to affected families from Dharan units was 267 sets. These production centers were
supposed to be self financing, except perhaps, for the initial cost for the training. To date the
project has reimbursed NRs 485,446 to the banks in respect of grants provided by them for
smokeless cooking stoves and improved latrines.
4.    Demonstration House. Totaling 16 demonstration house one each at Dharan, Inarwa,
Solukhumbu, Saptari, Dhankutta, Ramechhap, Sindhupalchowk, Siraha, Ilam, Panchtar and three
each at Kathmandu and Udayyapr were constructed.
5.    Compact Settlement. As per the programme technical support was to make available for
the purpose of establishing compact settlement, for this purpose's feasibility studies of 7 district
centers and villages which were to be relocated to avoid catastrophes in the event of similar
disaster were carried out. The project carried out series of missions to conduct preliminary
investigation of the proposed sites. Harakatte in Ilam, Bihibare, Tankisinuwari, Kanepokhari,
Suntali and Harkapur Jhode all in Morang, Sukrabare in Therathum, were the seven sites for
which feasibility studies were prepared. The planning team also devoted considerable efforts in
preparing survey maps of these area. Given the long-term nature of resettlement projects,
EAARR project approached Nepal Rural Housing company to assist in the implementation of
such projects. This component was terminated in the Fiscal Year 2047/48. All documents were
transferred to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
6.    District Center Development Plan. The physical development plans of those district
centers which were not covered by regular programme of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development were formulated by EAARR project as a part of the rehabilitation programme as
per decision of central committee. The programme identified 12 such district centers and 2
commercial centers. This task was divided into two phases, viz. surveys and plans formulation
phases. The first phase was completed for five centers Khandbari, Manthali, Okhaldhunga,
Diktel and Terathum. Field works at Phidim, Birtamode and Itahari had already been completed.
This programme was terminated in the Fiscal Year 2047/48. All documents were transferred to
the Department of Housing and Urban Development too.
7.    Financial Performance. Information on annual expenditure of the project on housing
programmes was as follows (these figures do not include the amount reimbursed to the three
banks):

In 1991, HMGN has waived loans up to NRs 5,000. By this decision mostly the economically
weaker sections of the society benefited. The total number of beneficiary families was 23,551
and the waived amount was NRs  15,368,848. In the budget of Fiscal Year 2052/53 (1995/96)
NRs 10,000,000 was set aside for the purpose of waiving the loan amount of NRs 5,000 for the
loanees who have received the loans not more than NRs 1 0,000. Due to this waiver loanee of
more than NRs 10,000 are also expecting the same. therefore, only few loanees have started
repayment.
Organization
Given the topography and geography of the earthquake affected area, the organization of the
project was necessarily widespread. Essentially, the organization reached to the grassroots level
of the local organization within the EAARRP central committees chaired by the Minister of
Housing and Physical Planning and each of the Regional committees chaired by Assistant
Ministers. Under the EAARR Project office there were two regional offices and 27 district
offices each headed by a district engineer. Some 272 overseer and sub-overseer with at least one



- 38 -                           Appendix C
in each Ilaka, regularly reporting to the district engineers. The project headquarters, with 56
employees was the center of project operation.
Legal Aspects
There were two major aspects of the project: the overall loan agreement between the World
Bank/IDA and Governnent and the three participating banks. The second aspect was the legal
security, i.e., the collateral, for the housing loan to the beneficiaries.
1. Loan agreement - The subsidiary loan agreement (SLA between Government and the
banks reflects on general terms and condition of the Development Credit Agreement
between IDA and the Government. The banks were to be responded by the
government (the Ministry of Finance) with 14% interest in 8 years time with two-year
grace period.
2. Collateral - In additional to the terms of the loan, sizes of the installment, etc. a major
portion of the instruction has to do the type of loan collateral to be obtained by the
banks. While schedule 5 of the DCA provides for collateral on land, the ownership, of
which can be demonstrated by land entitlement certificates, land revenue, tax payment
slips or other legal means, unreality the provision/documentation of collateral has
sometimes proven rather difficult. The instructions therefore go into details in order
that the branches can obtain adequate collateral under various circumstance.
Habitat Award
The efforts, dedication and achievements of the project staff in assisting the affected families in
rebuilding their homes by providing financial and technical support and make them adopt
improved or earthquake restraint construction technique to safeguard building against future
earthquakes are recognized by UNCHS/Habitat which awarded the Project its Scroll of Honor in
1993.
Lessons Learned
A great deal had been learned about the start up, implementation, administration and financing of
a nationwide housing loan programme. From the first few days after the earthquake to the last it
has been a learning by doing experience. Substantial experience were gained in the operation of
a loan programme. Drawing on the foregoing, some of the significant experiences and lessons
learned from the housing loan programme which could be used in a nationwide housing loan
programme were as follows:
1 .    Experience
a.    Collateral - Although the banks take collateral for other loans, they have never done it on
such massive scale. As such in the beginning it took few weeks for the transfer of title
alone and another few weeks for the processing. But now it has been a routine work for



- 39 -                           Appendix C
them. However, other banks need to be trained in order to launch such types of
programmes in a nationwide scale in future.
b.    Field Inspection - The field staff of districts engineers, overseers and even runners have
gained invaluable experience in-house inspection, incorporation of earthquake resistance
measures, and basic technical assistance to affected families. Those body of experience
and people must be incorporated in any expanded housing loan or development effort.
c.    Record Keeping - The system of records, forms and data collection would be invaluable
to any new programme. However, while the project office was in the process of
computerizing its data base, the banks were still keeping records and reporting manually.
This would inevitable hinder any expanded programme.
2.    Lessons Learned
a.    Affordability - Any futures housing loan programs would have to be based strictly on the
ability and willingness of borrowers to replay the loan. The emergency character of the
programme, which had not been the case, justified concern about the repayment of loans,
especially in rural areas.
b.    Subside - The present programme was substantially subsidized in order to reach the rural
poor. If an expanded program was to financially viable, any subsidies would have to be
applied judiciously, quantified and placed on the budget.
c.    Repayment Schedules - Knowledge of amounts and dates for the repayment of the loan as
well as the grace period of principal and the due date of interest is mandatory to the bank
branches and loanee for any loan programme to be self sustaining. Corrective action
must also be taken in the loan programme to encourage the habit of repayment, especially
of interest during the grace period on district centers and urban loans.
d.    Loan Recovery - The extent to which the banks made a positive effort in collecting
repayments during the loan period, and whether they would attempt to exercise the use of
collateral in case of default remains to be seen in the programme. However, if loan
recovery would be not enforced or would politicize it will set a precedence for any future
loan programme.
Conslusion
The Earthquake Affected Areas Reconstruction and Rehabilitation project was formulated to
adders problems caused by an uncommon incidence. The programme had to be completed on an
emergency basis because a vast number of people were suffering. Given the scale of the
operation, extent and the remoteness of the area covered, lack of similar experience at the
institutional level, and range of actives that needed to be addressed it must be recognized that the
Earthquake Affected Areas Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Committee did perform with
considerable efficiency and vigor. By the same time the project should be cited for being able to



- 40 -                             Appendix C
keep in race with the speed which the committee was making various decision. Indeed the
diversity of jobs that were completed in the short periods (2 years) of the project (ranging from
establishing the project offices 30 in total, hiring of about 250 staffs, training them on ranging
subjects determining implementation strategies, preparing various technical and administrative
manuals, evolving an accounting system which could respond to three separate requirements of
HMGN, IDS and project management, to launching a moral boosting campaign and assisted
about 78% affected household in rebuilding of their homes by providing financial and technical
support) was a confirmation of the dedication of the entire project staffs. Similarly, the fact that
in spite of the apparent insurmountable problem of logistics, the three banks were able to
mobilize their entire field offices just within a period of one month proves that if need arises our
financial institutions can also be counted to respond to similar critical situations the country
might face in the future.
International agencies, in particular the World Bank should also be commended for the speed
with which it moved to finalize credit negotiations. The service of an expert and supply and
equipment like computers, cameras for field staffs, and drafting set, by UNDP were small but
invaluable support the project received.
