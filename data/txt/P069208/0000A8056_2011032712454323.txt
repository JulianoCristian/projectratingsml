                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has already met most of the agreed outcome indicators related to reduced energy deficits, financial performance of the UETCL and the setting up of the Sector Working
                         Group. In order to ensure a financially sustainable sector in the medium term and to reduce the generation deficit, GoU is fast tracking major power projects including mobilization of
                         the requisite financing. In addition, the Energy Sector Working Group (ESWG) has prepared a work plan and deliverables for 2010/2011. Measures to enhance the effectiveness and
                         performance of the ESWG have also been put in place. For the Energy Efficiency component, subsequent to the recommendations of the energy audits in various institutions,

                         contracts have been signed to implement energy efficiency measures (water, public universities and buildings) whereas procurement of energy efficient equipment for street lighting,
                         hospitals and public schools and colleges is ongoing. Most of these contracts are expected to be completed by end May 2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since the commissioning of 150MW of thermal generation during the period 2006/2008, GoU has supported the development of additional generation to meet incremental demand,
                         especially mini hydros. However,the sector continues to face challenges related to having in place sufficient generation capacity to meet the ever growing demand.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
