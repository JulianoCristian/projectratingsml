Project development objective Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3
The primary objectives of the Operation are to reduce short-term power shortages and financial
imbalances, and facilitate orderly longer-term expansion of electricity service.

In order to achieve these objectives, the Operation comprises: (a) a set of investments and policy
measures designed to reduce the supply-demand gap until the Bujagali hydropower plant comes into
service in 2011; (b) financial support for the Government to absorb a part of the high costs of short-term
thermal power generation; and (c) policy measures aimed at making the sector financially viable,
accelerating rural electrification, and moving towards a sector-wide approach for development.
Project description [one-sentence summary of each component] Ref. PAD B.3.a, Technical
Annex 4
This Operation combines a Policy Support Program (US$80 million) and a Specific Investment Loan
(US$220 million).

The proposed Policy Support Program covers three policy areas: (i) power shortages - which includes the
preparation of an energy efficiency strategy and plan, to be implemented under the program; (ii) sector
finances - which will focus on tariff increases to partially cover the high cost of thermal power; the
clearing of GoU arrears owed to UETCL and UETCL arrears owed to generation companies; and (iii)
longer term-sector expansion ­ covering establishment of a joint Energy Sector Working Group;
independent evaluation of the rural electrification framework and Rural Electrification Agency with
subsequent legal modifications to the Agency's statutes by new legislation if required; daily monitoring
of Lake Victoria water abstraction for power generation and reporting to EAC of these data, along with
the amounts permitted by the Agreed Curve; and Participation in development of Regional and In-country
Watershed Management Plans related to Lake Victoria.

The project portion of the operation comprises two components. Component 1 will provide partial co-
financing towards the capacity and energy charges of a 50MW thermal plant to be installed at Mutundwe,
Kampala. Component 2 will provide Technical Assistance and Energy Efficiency. Activities under this
component will include: (a) Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management ;(b) Independent
Evaluation of the Rural Electrification Program; (c) Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA); (d)
Power Sector Medium-term Investment Plan; (e) Lake Victoria Transmission Ring Pre-feasibility and

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This Operation has two parts: a Policy Support Program (US$80 million), designed
according to the Development Policy Loan (DPL) template, and an investment Project (US$220
million), designed according to the Specific Investment Loan (SIL) template. The `hybrid' nature
of the Operation is dictated by the ground realities of the Ugandan power sector. Both support
for policy changes and financing gaps, as well as short-term investments to overcome country-
wide power shortages are needed at this time to stabilize the sector and promote its sustained
future expansion.

2.      Uganda's economy has performed well during the last two decades, signified by a stable
macroeconomic environment and sustained growth in per capita incomes averaging 3.2 percent
per annum. Agriculture has been a key driving factor. In order to build on this growth trend, and
to absorb an ever-increasing work force, the Government is pushing to expand off-farm
employment. Agro-processing and other such growth-oriented industries require a sound
infrastructure base, including affordable and reliable electricity supply. Uganda's current very
low rate of electrification (5 percent) compels an urgent emphasis on significant investments in
the sector both for expanding access and increasing power supply. The Government has adopted
a sector structure which features commercially oriented service provision, and emphasizes
private sector investment that leverages public resources. The former Uganda Electricity Board
has been unbundled, and the generation and distribution components have been privatized. The
sector is overseen by the Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA), which has established a sound
track record of regulatory supervision. A Rural Electrification Agency has been established with
a mandate to extend service to rural and other unserved areas. Uganda's well-developed sector
structure, sound regulatory institution and process, and openness to private sector participation
are unique in the sub-Saharan context.

3.      Notwithstanding the country's commendable progress on reforms and private investment,
Uganda has suffered chronic power shortages over the past three years. The power crisis has
slowed industrial production. The key factor underlying the crisis is the lack of sufficient
generation capacity. The failure of the Bujagali hydropower plant to reach financial closure in
2003 and its subsequent abandonment by the private sector sponsor is a major cause of this
shortage. The situation has been exacerbated by prolonged drought in the region, reducing the
power that can be generated from the existing hydropower facilities. Sustained high oil prices
and the logistical challenge and costs of transporting fuel for power generation into this land-
locked country have made thermal generation a costly alternative. As demand continues to grow
rapidly, even with the significant addition of short-term thermal generation capacity in 2005/06,
the system is still unable to meet about 15-40% of its load, depending upon the time of the day.

4.      The power supply situation and the accompanying financial crisis have affected growth
and could now undermine the power sector reforms and advances achieved in Uganda's power
sector. Most importantly, the fragile situation of the sector now threatens to reverse the gains
made in securing private participation and future prospects for investment in the new Bujagali




                                                1

hydropower project. The Bujagali project is now being prepared a second time with private
sponsorship, commercial financing and broad-based support from donors, including the World
Bank Group (Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project). The project is expected to be
commissioned in 2011.

5.      The power shortages have also led to lower retail electricity sales and revenues, which, in
turn, have reduced the financial viability of the private distribution concessionaire, UMEME.
When the company took over the distribution concession in March 2005, the energy supply
available to UMEME was 1,900 GWh, while it is now 1,500 GWh. This reduction is affecting
UMEME's ability to recover its fixed costs over fewer units of energy supplies. This situation
has been exacerbated by high cost thermal generation, which has increased the retail tariff
without increasing UMEME's net revenue. The Government of Uganda (GOU) restructured the
distribution concession in December 2006 to compensate UMEME, but this has meant a drain on
GOU's budget. If not addressed, the sector's vulnerable situation could therefore impact the
sustainability of the UMEME concession.

6.      The need for tariff increases to service the high costs of short term thermal generation has
been addressed. ERA effected a 37.5% percent increase in tariffs in June 2006, followed by a
further increase of 41% in November 2006. The average end-user tariff is now US$17.2¢/kWh
(excluding Value Added Tax [VAT]), which is high by regional and international standards. The
life-line tariff rate for consumers using less than 15kWh per month has however remained
steady, providing adequate protection for the poor. The tariff increase process has been well
managed, both by the government and the regulator. Wide spread consultations with stakeholders
and political leadership in orchestrating support for the increases have been remarkable.
Continued power shortages and a weak sector situation could however reverse this public
confidence and support, and pose risks to maintaining the reforms and regulatory framework
already in place.

7.      Despite the difficult challenges the Government has therefore taken very responsible
measures - installing short-term generation capacity of 100 MW, allowing ERA the autonomy
needed to raise tariffs in a pragmatic manner, while recognizing the affordability issue, and
continuing on a course of pursuing private sector participation and investments.

8.      The new Bujagali project will be the medium-term solution for the least cost power
supply for Uganda once it is commissioned in 2011. The current tariffs are already at a level
sufficient for full cost-recovery post-Bujagali. Therefore, in the period leading up to 2011, the
sector would need the Government's support, both to sustain the policy and institutional structure
and from a financial standpoint. This project intends to provide both forms of support during
this fragile period. The Policy Support Program supports the Government in consolidating and
advancing sector reform while meeting some of the remaining financing gaps. The investment
Project supports a specific capacity addition to maintain supply.

                        II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

A.      Recent Economic Developments in Uganda

9.      Country Context. With per capita income of about US$280 in 2005, Uganda is one of
the poorest countries in the world. Despite the progress in reducing the national level of poverty,
from 56 percent in 1992 to 31 percent in 2006, the population in the rural areas as well as the
Northern and Eastern regions remains vulnerable ­ rural poverty accounts for 90 percent of the
national level, and about 61 and 36 percent of the population in the North and East, respectively,
live below the poverty line. Uganda's demographic characteristics pose a challenge to future
growth. The country has the third fastest natural population growth rate in the world (3.5 percent
in 2005); very high fertility (about 7 children per woman) and the world's highest dependency
ratio (111 dependants per 100 working people and rising). Life expectancy is low ­ 49 years at
birth. Without commensurate growth in infrastructure, employment opportunities and
productivity, these characteristics of Uganda's demographics could result in a reduction in
savings, investment and growth.

10.     Uganda has experienced robust macro-economic performance in recent years, with
growth averaging 6.4 percent between 1990 and 2005. Domestic inflation was slightly above the
5 percent target for the third consecutive year due to pressures from weather, power shortages
and energy price shocks. The Uganda Shilling (USh) depreciated by 4 percent against the US
dollar due to higher demand for foreign exchange to finance the import bill. Overall, due to good
macroeconomic management, there is an increase in savings, exports, and foreign direct
investment. Within the region, Uganda has been a leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS, with
prevalence dropping significantly during the past decade. The challenge for Uganda is now to
deepen the reforms already underway and prevent their reversal.

11.     To accelerate growth without widening the current account deficit, Uganda needs to
increase exports, ideally developing new non-traditional exports to avoid export volatility.
Export competitiveness is constrained by poor yet costly energy and transport services,
suggesting a role for aid-financed public investments in infrastructure in the short term to attract
foreign private investment in the medium term. In order to maintain macro stability while
financing infrastructure and scaling up social services, the Government is seeking efficiency
savings in public spending.

12.     Although Uganda has made substantial progress towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals, more needs to be done to sustain progress and to improve the prospects
for meeting all the goals. Special efforts will be needed to improve the quality of education
services to ensure that children complete primary education and to eliminate gender disparity
at the post-primary levels of education. Greater access to quality health services is also
essential to significantly reduce child and maternal mortality rates.

13.     Power Crisis Impacts on Economic Growth. Although economic growth and
Uganda's external position were largely consistent with the Government's program for
2005/06, the ongoing electricity crisis has placed a significant strain on growth over the
medium term. This crisis in the power sector consists of substantial power shortages that are
attributable to delays in adding new generation capacity, a significant regional drought over
the past few years, which has reduced the output of existing hydropower plants and annual
demand growth for electricity of about 8%. As a consequence, businesses and consumers have
been forced to endure prolonged service cuts, with some shifting production to times when
power is available, and many larger businesses relying on high-cost back up generators.
Manufacturing, high-value agriculture (e.g., flowers), and processing industries (e.g., fish) are
most affected by power cuts, and profits in these industries are being squeezed. Other
macroeconomic consequences from the current power crisis were inflation that was slightly
above projections through September 2006 due to higher energy costs and a widening of the
trade deficit due to higher oil prices and increases in diesel fuel import volumes for electricity
purchased from thermal power plants. The present situation, with extensive load-shedding
blackouts, is not sustainable and further delays in augmenting Uganda's electricity generation
capacity could undermine the economy. The cost of unserved energy is estimated at
US$38.9¢/kWh.

14.     Ugandan industrial growth has been constrained by spiraling energy and transportation
costs, exacerbated by the current power shortages and both inadequate and poorly maintained
infrastructure. By diversifying away from traditional exports and industries, such as the coffee
sector, the Government is attempting to create a more stable and dynamic economic base.
However, the infrastructure gap, particularly in energy and transportation, has placed extreme
pressure on the cost of doing business in Uganda, especially for the manufacturing and
horticultural sectors (see Box 1).

15.     As an immediate priority, the Government is taking steps to resolve the ongoing
electricity crisis. While this Operation supports GOU's short-term mitigation measures to end
the crisis, it is important to note that the World Bank Group currently also supports GOU's
long-term mitigation measures through the Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project which
will provide financing for the next least cost hydropower generation expansion in Uganda.

16.     Uganda's Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). Uganda's development
objectives are articulated in the 2004 PEAP, the third version of its poverty eradication action
plan. The 2004 PEAP restates the country's ambitions of eradicating mass poverty and of
becoming a middle income country in the next twenty years. It promotes a shift of policy focus
from recovery to sustainable growth and structural transformation. The PEAP presents specific
policies and measures to achieve its objectives, grouped under five pillars: (a) economic
management; (b) enhancing competitiveness, production and incomes; (c) security, conflict
resolution, and disaster management; (d) governance; and (e) human resources development.

B.      Bank Group/Donor Support for PEAP and Power Sector

17.     Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS). The UJAS was approved by IDA's Board of
Executive Directors in January 2006 as the country assistance strategy, which was jointly
prepared with seven other development partners. The UJAS lays out the strategy for supporting
the implementation of the third PEAP and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It
promotes strong collaboration and harmonization among development partners and with the
Government, as well as a stronger focus on results and outcomes. As part of the UJAS
harmonization agenda, an exercise to ensure effective division of labor among development
partners has been launched.

18.     Power Generation Investments. Investments in power generation facilities will increase
the reliability and lower the cost of electricity, thus contributing to the achievement of PEAP
Pillar 2. This pillar has as a specific objective to "strengthen infrastructure in support of
increased production of goods and services." The UJAS aims to help "... create infrastructure
that reduces the cost of doing business, links isolated areas of the country to the broader
economy, and promotes regional integration." The proposed Power Sector Development
Operation will contribute directly to this pillar (see Box 1).

            Box 1: Energy, Growth and Structural Transformation in Uganda

 The recently completed Country Economic Memorandum concludes that Uganda's low level of
 electricity use could put a significant brake on structural transformation, and hence on future growth.
 Much of the Ugandan economy is rural and does not use electricity in production, mainly because it is
 unavailable in most rural areas. Since the mid-1990s, agriculture has been shedding labor, which has
 been finding employment in off-farm rural enterprises (mainly trading, distribution and retail). Average
 labor productivity is higher outside of farming, and so this movement of labor has led to improvements
 in average output per worker.

 Food crop prices started to decline by more than the increase in agricultural productivity ­ with poverty
 amongst farmers increasing between 1999 and 2002/03. This is due in part to the lack of significant
 industrial demand for processing Ugandan agricultural output. Another reason is that most of the labor
 which moved out of agriculture still lives in farming households, growing their own food. For significant
 structural transformation to occur, Uganda needs to develop its agro-processing industry to create
 more jobs for the increasing labor supply moving out of agriculture.

 Given Uganda's population growth rate and current age structure, the work force will more than double
 in the next 15 years. This makes it urgent to expand industry, tourism, and commercial services in
 order to create jobs for a growing labor force at higher average labor productivity, otherwise growth in
 average per capita income will slow down, reducing the prospects for poverty reduction. These sectors
 are currently the most energy intensive in Uganda and will therefore rely on a reliable, affordable and
 expanding supply of power.




                                                     5

19.     Support beyond Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC). The proposed support to
the power sector is in addition to the funds that Uganda will receive via the PRSC program.
PRSC6 is the second in a programmatic series that supports the PEAP with a focus on health,
education and water programs; public sector management and anti-corruption efforts; and
accelerated growth through rural development and a better investment climate. The Policy
Support Program within the proposed Operation complements the PRSC through its support of
reforms in the power sector. It responds to a crisis in the power sector whose roots lie in factors
beyond Uganda's control, such as the failure to develop the Bujagali hydropower plant in a
timely manner, drought, and high oil prices.

20.     Since the unbundling of the power sector and following well managed substantial
increases in electricity tariffs beginning in June 2001, the electricity sector in Uganda stayed
financially self sustaining until 2005. At that time, drought conditions reduced the power
generated from the country's hydropower facilities, reducing peak capacity from 300 MW to 120
MW currently. This compelled the Government to contract high cost, short-term thermal power.
Despite the very high generation costs GOU followed its power sector reform strategy and
supported the additional very substantial tariff increases implemented by ERA in June and
November 2006 of 37.5 percent and 41 percent respectively. Despite the very high level of
average retail tariffs (US$0.172/kWh), the revenues still will not allow the Uganda Electricity
Transmission Company Limited (UETCL), the transmission company that is the single buyer of
power, to fully recover its power purchase costs. The full cost recovery tariff has risen to around
US$0.26/kWh. UETCL plays a vital role for the smooth functioning of the unbundled power
sector. The Policy Support Program intends to support GOU's efforts to maintain the sector's
well functioning structural attributes such as ERA sound regulatory process. It would further
enable the sector's finances to stabilize over the medium term.

21.     Amount of the Policy Support Program. The value of the program component is
determined from additional financing needs for the budget arising from transfers to the electricity
sector. The current estimates of the financial base case assumes the following sector costs to
arise in GOU's FY 2006/2007 and 2007/2008:

                   Table 1: Total Sector Requirements in FY06/07 and FY07/08

                           Total Sector Requirements in US$ million
                                                                     2006/2007  2007/2008
 Total Distribution, Transmission and Hydropower Generation costs:         113         130
 Total Thermal Power Generation costs:                                     132         212
                                          Total Sector requirements        245         342




                                                     6

22.     A substantial part of the sector requirements will be satisfied by the tariff revenues at the
new tariff levels. In addition to those revenues, a part of the thermal power generation costs in
FY2007/2008 will be covered through the proposed Project, which is financing power output
from the thermal power plant situated at Mutundwe and expected to be commissioned in August
2007.

23.     As indicated earlier, the available sector revenues still leave a financing shortfall. As
indicated in Table 2, this is in the order of US$137 million in this current and the next fiscal
year, according to the base case calculations applied in the sector financial model:

                   Table 2: Sector Revenue Shortfall in FY06/07 and FY07/08

24.     Prior to the targeted date of effectiveness of this proposed operation, the GOU will have
provided US$56 million to UETCL in its current Fiscal Year in the form of additional resources
to cover the estimated revenue shortfalls until then through its own budgetary resources. An
additional financing need for the remainder of the government's current fiscal year ending on
June 30, 2007 of $28 million has been projected. The proposed Policy Support Program will be
structured in a single tranche that provides additional budgetary resources in an amount of US$
80 million to alleviate the budgetary burden and avoid undue disruption of other government
spending programs. Future financing needs from transfers to the energy sector ­ estimated at $53
million for the government's FY2007/08 ­ are expected to be covered in the context of general
donor support (including PRSCs) and, if needed, expenditure reallocations.

25.     As shown in Table 3 below, in order to meet the additional costs arising from the energy
situation, the FY 2006/2007 budget for energy was more than doubled, and the share of energy
rose from 3 to 8 percent of total expenditures. In the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) for the 2007/2008 Budget, the energy share is expected to remain high at over 8 percent
of total, with much of the increased budgetary burden related to the revenue shortfall. While the
Government has been able to make expenditure reallocations, and revenues have continued to
strengthen, the energy pressure is also reflected in a higher fiscal deficit. According to the latest
International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures, the fiscal deficit is expected to increase from 7.5
percent of GDP in FY 2005/2006 to 8.8 percent of GDP in FY 2006/2007 and 7.9 percent in FY
2007/2008 (or from 0.9 percent to 2.2 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, excluding grants).

The Policy Support Program represents an important component of this additional financing
requirement for FY 2006/2007.

26.     Other Donors. IMF and World Bank staff maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting the Government's structural reforms, including in the electricity sector. The IMF has
confirmed the importance for the Ugandan economy of maintaining stability in the sector and
restoring normal electricity supply.

27.     Sida has agreed to provide parallel financing to this Operation for energy efficiency
improvements. The Bank is also discussing with other donors, including the Japanese
Government, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the African Development Bank (AfDB),
their interest in participating in other forms of assistance to the power sector.

28.     Coordination with other donors will continue through periodic meetings and exchanges
of information. This will be enhanced by GOU's recent establishment of a Sector Working
Group to facilitate a joint approach by the development partners.

C.      Debt Sustainability

29.     Uganda's risk of debt distress has been greatly reduced through the Multilateral Debt
Reduction Initiative (MDRI), which cancelled 100 percent of debts outstanding to the IMF,
African Development Fund (ADF), and IDA at end-2003. The MDRI reduced the net present
value (NPV) of the external debt-to-exports ratio from a pre-MDRI level of 229 percent (the 3-

year average to 2004/2005) to 46 percent in 2005/2006, and this is estimated to have declined
further to 33 percent in 2006/2007. The reduction in debt distress notwithstanding, prudent debt
management and an efficient allocation of resources will still be critical to maintaining debt at
sustainable levels over the long term.

D.      IMF Assessment

30.     Macroeconomic Stability. Macroeconomic stability remains a cornerstone of Uganda's
reform effort. Fiscal discipline, coupled with prudent monetary management, supported
Uganda's robust growth and helped contain inflation to single digit levels over most of the past
decade. These policies have also contributed to the accumulation of international reserves ­
amounting to about 5.5 months' worth of import cover in 2005/2006. Implementation of
Uganda's PEAP, and ring-fencing of poverty-related expenditures in the budget under the
Poverty Action Fund (PAF) have contributed to improvements in living conditions, although per
capita income gains have been modest because of Uganda's high population growth rate.

31.     New PSI. The IMF Board approved a new 3-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) in
December 2006, following the interim 18-month PSI approved in 2005, qualifying Uganda as a
"mature stabilizer."

                    III. POWER SECTOR CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

A.      Overall Government Strategy

32.     The GOU power sector strategy has been to: (a) promote legal, regulatory and structural
sector reforms, including leveraging private sector investment; (b) provide adequate, reliable and
least cost power generation with the goal to meet urban and industrial demand and increase
access; and (c) scale up rural access to underpin broad based development. The World Bank
Group and the donor community have supported the Government's power sector strategy and
reformed policy framework, including catalyzing private sector management and capital.

33.     Over the past seven years, the Government has:

    · Promulgated a new Electricity Act;
    · Created an independent Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA), which has established a
        strong track record in ensuring the financial viability of the sector (see Annex 1);
    · Unbundled the state-owned Uganda Electricity Board into separate entities responsible
        for generation, transmission and distribution, and concessioned the generation and
        distribution facilities to the private sector (see Annex 1 for details on the Government's
        comprehensive power sector reform program);




                                                   9

   · Increased the number of urban and rural households with direct access to electricity,
       promoted grid and off-grid private sector-led rural electrification and established a Rural
       Electrification Agency (REA);
   · Pursued least cost power investments to provide adequate and reliable service; and
   · Collaborated with the East Africa Community on regional power interconnection. This
       regional approach is expected to benefit all countries involved by diversifying supply
       sources and reducing investment costs.

B.     Main Sector Issues and Government Responses

34.    In spite of the significant structural reforms implemented in the power sector, Uganda is
confronted by a number of short and medium term challenges in this sector which are affecting
growth. The main issues and the Government's responses are described below.

Issue 1: Power Shortages

35.    The lack of adequate and reliable power is consistently cited in private sector surveys as
being among the top five constraints for Uganda's economic growth. Electricity service quality,
availability and reliability have been major impediments to sustained investment and growth.

36.    Government Actions Already Taken. To mitigate the shortages, the Government has
taken action on three fronts: (a) augmenting supply; (b) improving transmission and distribution
performance; and (c) reducing demand.

37.    Augmenting Generation. The Government has taken the following steps:

   Thermal Power

   · Installed an initial 50 MW power station at Lugogo in May 2005 on an Independent
       Power Producer (IPP) basis
   · The average load factor for the Lugogo thermal station was increased from 75 percent to
       90 percent. The plant is now also running on a 24 hour basis. These measures added an
       additional 10 MW of firm capacity.
   · An additional 50 MW of thermal capacity was added at Kiira in November 2006, for a
       current total of 100 MW thermal power capacity.
   · Bid evaluation is now underway for an International Competitive Bidding (ICB) tender
       issued by the GOU in July 2006 for a third 50 MW power station at Mutundwe. The
       purchase of electricity from this plant will be partly financed under the proposed Project.
   · GOU also is currently procuring a 50 MW thermal plant on a BOT basis, which is
       expected to be commissioned in January 2008 for 15 years. This plant would operate on
       Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), which is cheaper than the Automotive Diesel Oil (ADO) which is
       used for the three short-term thermal stations mentioned above. This HFO plant will




                                                 10

        permit the retirement of the first 50 MW ADO unit, allowing Uganda to retain a total of
        150 MW of thermal capacity until the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower plant.

    Hydro Power

    · The hydropower generation regime was optimized by using the available water more
        during the day, and less at night, thus reducing load shedding at times when commercial
        businesses and manufacturing industries need to run their operations.

    Renewable Energy

    · The GOU entered into power supply arrangements with the Kilembe Mines to provide
        2.3 MW of power to the grid for 24 hours per day and the Kakira Sugar Company (KSW)
        will supply 12 MW to the grid in the near future for 18 hours per day. Beyond this, KSW
        will also self-generate 6 MW for its internal use, so that this capacity is not required from
        the national grid.
    · Additional mini-hydro schemes are under active development with the support of the
        Energy for Rural Transformation Project (ERT) (Credit 3588-UG).
    · A Renewable Energy Policy Framework was prepared for Cabinet approval, which aims
        at promoting additional renewable energy development. By 2009, at least 3 mini-hydro
        transactions of a total capacity of 26 MW are expected to produce grid-based electricity.
    · Indigenous geothermal investigations have been accelerated under the Power IV Project
        (Credit 3545-UG).

    Imports

    · The GOU concluded an agreement with Kenya to import up to 10 MW on a non-firm
        capacity basis, i.e., depending upon availability. Some imports have already taken place.

38.     Improving Power Transmission and Distribution Performance. In March 2005,
UMEME, the private concessionaire, took over the operations of the distribution system under a
concession agreement that includes financial incentives to increase the number of connections,
reduce technical and non-technical losses, and increase the collection rate (see Annex 1). At the
time of UMEME's takeover, system technical and non technical losses were around 38% (or
43% including 5% transmission losses through UETCL's transmission network). The
billing/collection ratio was 80%, implying that prior to the UMEME concession only about 47%
of the energy sent out to the national grid was paid for. Since March 2005, UMEME has
improved the collection rate from 80% to 92% (although the rate dropped again to 82% in
December 2006 since the June and November tariff increases), decreased technical and non-
technical losses to about 34%, and connected about 36,000 new customers. During the first 22
months of the concession, UMEME invested US$13.6 million in system improvements, and has
committed to invest a total of US$65 million during the first five years of the concession. A new




                                                 11

billing system will be procured and installed by end 2007. In addition, IDA is providing
US$11million (through the Power IV project) for new poles and transformers, and for 13,500
new customer connections. These investments will help to further reduce technical losses and
improve collection rates.

39.     UMEME's concession agreement contains targets for losses and non-collection rates for
the first seven years and provides strong incentives for UMEME to reduce losses and improve
billing collection. UMEME's forward-looking retail tariff assumes an annual 1 percent
improvement in losses, and the benefits, to be shared between UMEME and Government, of any
loss reductions in excess of this 1 percent would increase UMEME's rate of return.

40.     Reducing Demand. Demand Side Management and Energy Efficiency interventions also
help to reduce the supply-demand gap by reducing demand. MEMD already has an Energy
Efficiency and Demand Side Management (DSM) program, which will be strengthened under
this project. Under the Bank-supported ERT Project, MEMD expects to distribute, on a grant
basis, 800,000 energy-efficient light bulbs, by April 2007. This will not only help poorer
households to cope with the higher tariffs but also reduce the overall demand for electricity
during peak hours and result in energy savings of about 10 MW (average) and 40 MW (during
peak hours).

41.     Further Measures Needed. As indicated above, the Government has taken extensive
steps to mitigate power shortages. The main additional measure that the Government needs to
undertake at this point is more aggressive promotion of DSM and energy efficiency, to reduce
demand.

Issue 2: Sector Finances

42.     The advantage of the short-term thermal plants is that power is available quickly on a
stop-gap basis. The disadvantage is that this power currently costs between US$ 0.22 and
0.24/kWh, which is more than twice the cost of hydropower. This is the main factor that has
unsettled the sector's cost structure and finances. Further, the shortage of power has affected
UMEME's financial viability, as it has fewer units available that can be used to recover fixed
costs.

43.     Government Actions Already Taken. The regulator has raised end-user power sector
retail tariffs by a cumulative 94 percent to US$0.172/kWh in 2006 (and by a cumulative 151
percent since April 2005). These tariffs are high by regional and international standards, but they
still do not cover the full costs of power purchased by UETCL. The Government has provided
funds to UETCL to cover the shortfall, although not fully. Further, the Government has
renegotiated its agreement with UMEME to address financial issues arising from the power
crisis. The Government is committed to filling the financing gap as needed, which is a challenge,
given other critical budget priorities.




                                                12

44.     Despite the fact that only 5 percent of Uganda's population has access to electricity and
that only a very low level of power consumption is attributed to the poor (see Section E below),
the proposed temporary subsidization of the electricity tariffs is justified for two main reasons:

    · Cost of Doing Business. The current fully cost-reflective end user tariff would have to be
        around US$0.26/kWh. Such a tariff level would have negative implications on the
        opening of new businesses and thereby on the expansion of the industrial and commercial
        sectors; and

    · Increase Access to Electricity. Fully cost-reflective tariffs would seriously hinder or even
        stop completely UMEME's ability to expand its customer base as unsubsidized tariffs
        would be unaffordable for a majority of potential new residential and non residential
        customers.

45.     However, as the current financial sector model shows, the GOU subsidies should only be
needed until the next least cost hydropower generation facility comes on stream, currently
scheduled for early 2011. The much cheaper generation costs of this new Bank Group supported
generation facility (Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project) will help eliminate GOU
subsidies to the sector in the medium term.

46.     Further Measures Needed. The Government to stay current to UETCL and UETCL
needs to stay current to the generation companies.

Issue 3: Longer-term Sector Expansion

47.     Uganda has made commendable progress towards establishing a sector framework that
will promote sustainability and growth. However, the Government recognizes that more is
needed to fulfill this goal for the longer term. In particular, the longer-term expansion of the
sector requires that: (a) the generation facilities use Lake Victoria water in a sustainable manner;
(b) the framework for rural electrification be strengthened; (c) a joint GOU-Development
Partners Energy Sector Working Group be set up with an agreed mandate; and (d) the current
sector structure (private generation and distribution companies, State-run transmissions
company, and independent regulator) be maintained.

48.     Sustainable Use of Lake Victoria Water. Uganda's main source of power is located at
the Nalubaale and Kiira (previously called Owen Falls) 380MW1 dam complex on Lake Victoria
at the mouth of the Victoria Nile. Since 2000, Lake Victoria water levels have dropped by about
1.5 meters, bringing the lake in October 2006 to a level of 1,133.26 masl,2 which is very close to
the lowest ever measured level in March 1923. This fall has been partially attributed to three


1   The current commissioned capacity of the dam complex is 300 MW. Two additional 40MW units are scheduled for
commissioning in April 2007.
2   To convert meters above sea level (masl) to Jinja Gauge numbers, subtract 1,122.86.




                                                             13

years of drought and partially to over-abstraction of water, beyond the Agreed Curve,3 by
Uganda for hydropower generation. (See Annex 16 for additional details.) However, it is also
important to note that, since then, the lake levels have increased to 1,134.31 masl (March 2007).

49.       Government Actions Already Taken. The over-abstraction of water is not the result of
Uganda pursuing a business-as-usual strategy in the face of a declining water level. To the
contrary, in response to concerns about the lower level, Uganda reduced firm hydropower output
from the dam complex at Nalubaale and Kiira from about 270 MW in 2002 to around 120 MW
since August 2006. Adherence to the Agreed Curve at current water inflows into the lake would
imply a further reduction in hydropower output to about 112 MW at current water levels. The
Government of Uganda has signaled its intentions to return to releases consistent with the
Agreed Curve as soon as possible. Further, Uganda as a whole ­ not just its power sector - is
participating in regional discussions related to a Regional Watershed Management Plan and to an
in-country watershed management plan linked to Lake Victoria. These plans will help Uganda
contribute to the efforts of the riparian countries to use Lake Victoria water sustainably.

50.       Further Measures Needed. While Uganda's power sector is not the sole cause of
decline in Lake Victoria's water level, it is clear that the sector must take steps to ensure that it
uses this water in a responsible manner. A key element of this responsibility is monitoring and
reporting on actual water abstraction, as well as the amount permitted by the Agreed Curve, to a
suitable body, such as the East African Community (EAC).

51.       Low Electricity Access Levels. Only about five percent of all households have direct
electricity access, and Uganda has one of the lowest rates of electrification in the world.

52.       Government Actions Already Taken. The GOU is implementing the Bank-supported
ERT Program, which is a three-phase ten year program to significantly expand access to
electricity. In keeping with the Electricity Act's emphasis on private participation, the project is
designed to provide initial capital subsidies for rural access investments, which thereafter are
operated on a commercial basis. The ERT is completing its first phase and has established a
framework for expanding rural access, including creation of a Rural Electrification Agency
(REA) to act as intermediary for the subsidies. Furthermore GOU has concessioned Uganda's
distribution company to UMEME, which in its first 22 months of operation has already
connected 36,000 new customers and made significant progress in assessing the overall needs of
the distribution sector. UMEME is currently also supported by IDA and the Multilateral



3    The Agreed Curve describes a water discharge rating curve that emulates the natural relationship between Lake Victoria
levels and the flow of the Nile River through the Nalubaale and Kiira hydropower dams. It depicts the management of the
Nalubaale and Kiira dams in which the volume of water released would remain consistent with what would have occurred under
natural conditions, thereby ensuring no change in downstream discharges. Since the Agreed Curve functions as an operating rule
for water discharge, such water releases are a function of the lake level at any given period. The current water level of the Lake of
1,134.00 masl measured on March 18, 2007 would allow a water release at the Nalubaale/Kiira complex of a daily average
698.03m3/sec, whereas the power station was releasing a daily average of 750m3/sec.




                                                                 14

Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) risk mitigation through the Privatization and Utility
Sector Reform Project.

53.     Further Measures Needed. Despite the progress already made in this area, more needs
to be done by GOU, especially in the field of rural access. There is a need to evaluate the rural
electrification framework and institutions, and to take steps to overcome any identified
weaknesses. The proposed Operation supports this evaluation through the Policy Support
Program.

54.     Phase 2 of the ERT program, which is planned for FY08, will operationalize the findings
of the evaluation. Continuing risk mitigation support for UMEME through the Bank's
Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project will facilitate urban access to electricity and
improvements in the national distribution system.

55.     Energy Sector Working Group. Up to now, donor support for the power sector has
largely been on a bilateral basis between individual donors and the Government. While some
efforts have been made to coordinate donor activities, the current arrangement has hampered
donor participation due to: (a) the need for the Government to separately address each donor's
requirements, which is an added burden on Government's limited staff in the energy sector; and
(b) donor preference for harmonization in priorities and planning to ensure that resources are
well-targeted and do not duplicate other efforts. As a result, there is a need to improve the
coordination between GOU and its development partners, as a first step towards formulating a
sector-wide approach to assistance from the development partners.

56.     Government Actions Already Taken. The Government has formally established a
Sector Working Group for Energy and Minerals Development under an agreed Terms of
Reference.

57.     Further Measures Needed. The main measure needed at this time is to ensure that this
group quickly coalesces into an effective mechanism to support the Government's goals in this
sector.

58.     Longer Term Generation Expansion. Finally and as already stated, the current crisis in
the power sector stems from a shortage of electricity supply due to the lack of least cost
generation facilities. As also demonstrated under Issue 1 above, GOU has already taken and will
further implement short term measures to bridge the generation gap. However, in the long term, a
more sustainable and least cost expansion of the generation capacities in Uganda is needed. GOU
has therefore taken the decision to proceed with the next least cost hydropower long term
solution, which is the construction of a 250 MW hydropower plant at Bujagali Falls. This
investment is supported by the World Bank Group (Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project)
together with other multilateral and bilateral donors in parallel to the present Operation.




                                                 15

C.      Rationale for Bank Involvement

59.     The Bank is a long-standing and deeply involved partner in development of Uganda's
energy sector, maintaining a rich dialogue covering power generation, transmission and
distribution; rural access to electricity; energy efficiency; traditional fuels; and the petroleum
sector. Government continues to seek Bank advice and support in this area, and it is important to
remain strongly engaged, especially during the critical period before commissioning of the
Bujagali plant. This engagement is fully consistent with the UJAS, which identifies the Bank as
the lead donor in the Ugandan power sector. Of particular relevance for this Operation is the fact
that the Bank is the only donor currently in a position to provide the magnitude of support
required by Uganda's power sector.

60.     The Operation builds on and supports the results of former and ongoing Bank projects in
Uganda's power sector:

    · ERT Project. The Policy Support Program initiates a comprehensive review of the rural
        electrification framework and the functioning of related institutions that would allow
        GOU to improve the framework in anticipation of ERT Phase 2.

    · Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project. UMEME, which is supported with a
        PRG under this project, has as its main task under the concession to improve and expand
        the national electricity distribution network and customer base. The expansion of the
        customer base strongly depends on the availability of enough power supply for sale. The
        proposed Project supports a new short-term thermal generation facility that will enable
        UETCL to provide more power to the distribution company.

    · Finally, this Operation reinforces the Bank Group supported Private Power Generation
        (Bujagali) Project that is being submitted to the Board in parallel with this Operation. It
        does so by supporting GOU's measures to stabilize and reinforce the power sector in the
        short term by providing financial resources, and supporting measures to maintain and
        strengthen the sector's reform achievements.

D.      Higher Level Objectives to which the Operation Contributes

61.     The Operation directly supports the UJAS/PEAP pillar of increased GDP growth by
providing critical support during the period prior to commissioning of the Bujagali plant.
Specifically, the support provided by the Operation, coupled with direct budget support, will
allow tariffs to increase on a "glide path" that reduces the immediate impact of sharp price hikes
on industry. The "glide path" approach to tariff increases allows the economy to adjust to the
higher costs of electricity on a more realistic time frame, including via the adoption of energy
efficiency measures.

                               IV. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

A.      Lending Instrument

62.     This Operation combines a Policy Support Program ($80 million) and a Specific
Investment Loan ($220 million); this combined instrument is deemed the most appropriate, as
discussed in the Introduction.

B.      Operation Development Objective and Key Indicators

63.     The primary objectives of the Operation are to reduce short-term power shortages and
financial imbalances, and facilitate orderly longer-term expansion of electricity service.

64.     In order to achieve these objectives, the Operation comprises: (a) a set of investments and
policy measures designed to reduce the supply-demand gap until the Bujagali hydropower plant
comes into service in 2011; (b) financial support for the Government to absorb a part of the high
costs of short-term thermal power generation; and (c) policy measures aimed at ensuring the
sector is financially viable, accelerating rural electrification, and moving towards a sector-wide
approach for development.

65.     The key performance indicators for the Operation are:

    · Level of unmet demand.
    · Financial viability of key sectoral utilities.
    · Quality of functioning of the Energy Sector Working Group.

C.      The Operation

Policy Support Program

66.     The proposed Policy Support Program of US$80 million will be disbursed on
effectiveness provided that the agreed conditions of disbursement have been met. It covers three
policy areas, with support from the investments under the Project.

67.     Policy Area 1 ­ Power Shortages. This area will address the further policy actions
needed to address the power shortages. As the measures to augment generation are already in
place, the focus is on improving the efficiency of power supply, i.e. reducing transmission and
distribution losses, and demand, i.e., energy end-use efficiency. There have been considerable
efforts to improve supply-side efficiency. In contrast, on the demand side, while there have been
some activities to support energy efficiency measures, the policy framework required to
maximize their impact needs strengthening.




                                                 17

68.     Policy Area 2 ­ Sector Finances. As discussed earlier, thermal power generation and
high oil prices have created a financial crisis in the power sector. It is important to ensure that the
sector attains a solid financial footing, so that the sector's structure remains sound, and private
sector participants remain committed.

69.     Policy Area 3 ­ Longer-Term Sector Expansion While Uganda has already successfully
implemented power sector institutional reforms, there remains a need to improve some aspects of
sector governance. First, there is a need to improve coordination between the Government and
development partners, so as to increase aid effectiveness and harmonization. Second, there is a
need to improve the framework and enhance the effectiveness of the related institutions, to
increase the likelihood of meeting rural electrification targets. Finally, although the power sector
is not the sole cause of decline in Lake Victoria's water level, it is clear that the power sector
must take steps to ensure that sustainable uses of the water are maintained and enhanced.

            Box 2: Good Practice Principles for the Application of Conditionality

    Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
    Uganda has successfully reformed its power sector, with privatized generation and distribution, a
    State-owned transmission company, and an autonomous regulator. However, Uganda is suffering
    from power shortages because of a drought that has reduced hydropower generation, which has
    been the main source of power, and the failure to develop the Bujagali dam, which is now being
    proposed to be supported by the Bank in a parallel operation. The Government's plan is to mitigate
    the shortages using short-term thermal power until the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower
    plant in 2011, and to absorb the high costs of thermal power by a combination of increased power
    tariffs (already implemented) and budget support. The Policy Support Program seeks to support this
    Government plan, and also put in place the foundations for longer-term growth of the power sector.

    Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a
    coordinated accountability framework
    The Bank's support is summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix. No other donors are
    currently providing budget support for the power sector. An Energy Sector Working Group consisting
    of the Government, development partners and other stakeholders is being set up under this
    Operation.

    Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to
    country circumstances
    The Bank support is in a single tranche that will, along with the investment Project under this
    Operation, cover for two years the sector's financial needs arising from high cost thermal power.
    Given that Uganda has already reformed the power sector, Bank support is focused on reducing
    power shortages and financial imbalances. No further changes to the sector structure or ownership
    are envisaged under the Operation.

    Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
    The Bank's policy matrix uses a limited set of conditions ­ eight in total. Conditionality is focused on
    critical steps for sustaining the sector through the short-term crisis and setting the stage for longer-
    term sector expansion.




                                                     18

     Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and
     performance-based financial support
     The support is linked to the country's budget cycle and will partially cover the sector's residual
     financial needs (beyond tariff revenues) for FY2006-2007. While the single tranche support will be
     disbursed at Operation effectiveness (prior actions are expected to be met by Board presentation),
     the sector's progress will continue to be reviewed, based on the Operation's results framework, for
     four years. PRSCs are the Bank's regular budget support instrument. This Operation provides short-
     term additional financing for budgetary pressures arising from the power sector and therefore is not
     intended to deliver predictable budget support over the medium term.

70.     Conditions. The following actions have been taken before Board presentation of this
operation.

    Power Shortage

    · Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) has prepared a draft Energy
        Efficiency Strategy and Plan.

    Sector Finances

    · Tariff increases to cover part of the high cost of thermal power (already implemented in
        2006);
    · GOU to clear all dues to UETCL; and
    · UETCL to clear all dues to generation companies.

    Longer-Term Sector Development

    · GOU commitment to undertake independent evaluation (under TOR acceptable to the
        Bank) of the rural electrification framework and institutions, in preparation for expansion
        of rural electrification;
    · Agreement to monitor, on a daily basis, the abstraction of Lake Victoria water for power
        generation as well as amounts permitted by Agreed Curve, and report monthly to EAC;
    · Participation in Lake Victoria watershed management plans discussions (already
        ongoing); and
    · Joint GOU/Development Partners Energy Sector Working Group set up with an agreed
        mandate.

Investment Project

71.     Component 1: Thermal Energy (US$ 206.5 million IDA). The Project will provide
partial co-financing towards the capacity and energy charges of a 50MW thermal plant to be
installed at Mutundwe site, near Kampala. The financial assistance will include coverage of the
capacity payments for the full contract period, and energy charges, including fuel, for the initial
years of the contract. This plant will be fuelled by ADO.




                                                    19

72.     Component 2: Technical Assistance and Energy Efficiency (EE) (US$ 13.5 million
IDA and US$ 6.5 million SIDA parallel finance). The Project will support the following
activities under this component:

    (a) Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management, which will focus on supporting
        MEMD in expanding a framework for a large scale program for energy efficiency and
        demand side management work. This includes: (i) providing relevant training to develop
        the capacity of MEMD staff, and corresponding staff of identified public and private
        entities, for energy efficiency and demand side management; (ii) providing logistic
        support to monitor ongoing initiatives; and (iii) implementing communication and
        education campaigns.

    (b) Independent Evaluation of the Rural Electrification Program, which will support the
        objective of the Policy Support Program to improve the framework for rural
        electrification. This will be implemented by MEMD.

    (c) Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA), which will examine the distributional
        impacts of energy sector policy reforms on the well-being or welfare of various
        stakeholder groups, in particular, the poor and vulnerable populations. This will be
        implemented by the Ministry of Finance.

    (d) Power Sector Medium-term Investment Plan. MEMD will undertake this work in
        coordination with UETCL, UMEME, REA, and the Energy Sector Working Group. The
        plan is expected to be suitable for donor support.

    (e) Lake Victoria Transmission Ring Pre-feasibility and Feasibility Studies. This will consist
        of a pre-feasibility and feasibility study for Masaka-Mutukula-Mwanza line as part of a
        proposed Lake Victoria Transmission Ring. This will be in support of a planned East
        Africa regional power market program. Depending on the outcome of the feasibility
        studies, the Project will also finance the detailed design and preparation of tender
        documents for the first leg of the ring (Masaka-Mwanza) including the required EIA.

    (f) Kalagala Offset Tourism Development Plan. This activity supports the Government's
        plan to institute mitigation measures at the Kalagala Itanda site on the Nile River, below
        Bujagali Falls, to offset the loss of Bujagali Falls when the proposed dam is constructed.
        This will include revising the 2001 Tourism Development Concept and Plan, and
        provision of implementation funds. This will be undertaken by MEMD.

    (g) Energy Sector Communications Strategy. This activity will support Government's efforts
        to ensure that key information on sectoral strategy and initiatives is made publicly
        available in a timely and effective manner. The program will encompass the MEMD's
        broad energy agenda, and will focus on key messages around energy conservation, rural

D.     Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Operation Design

73.    For the Policy Support Program, the main lessons learned are:

    · The commitment of the ministry dealing with power sector reforms is very important,
       along with other involved agencies such as the Ministry of Finance. In that respect, this
       Operation also builds directly on the lessons learned from the previous and completed
       Power III Project (Credit 2268), which underlined the importance of "Government
       ownership of its power sector reform program is a critical underpinning to ensure its
       successful and timely implementation." Through the instrument of a Policy Support
       Program, this Operation creates incentives for GOU to continue with its successful sector
       reform by keeping the ownership of the reform with GOU.
    · The Bank Group should have a clear and consistent articulation of its approach towards
       reforms in a situation where it is supporting a number of projects in the sector. The policy
       focus of this Operation facilitates just such a sector-wide dialog.
    · Techno-economic considerations, such as the conclusions of a least cost expansion plan,
       should be given due weight, and not be overshadowed by political considerations in the
       choice of major sector investments. Government has adopted a sector structure which
       promotes this approach.

74.    For the investment Project, one important lesson is the need to tackle power shortages
from both supply and demand standpoints, which is the approach adopted by this Operation.
Supply initiatives should include the installation of new capacity, provision of fuel, and funding
for purchase of energy from imports or from new plants. Demand side initiatives include
improving energy efficiency at the user end, fostering conservation, and developing sensible
power rationing schemes.

75.    The Project also builds on the lessons learned from the previous and completed Power III
Project (Credit 2268) which concluded that "it is more efficient to initiate and implement
measures to improve institutional and financial performance in advance of major new
investments." Through the ongoing Power IV (Credit 3545) and Privatization Utility Sector
Reform (Credit 3411) projects, IDA has supported GOU in the unbundling of the sector and the
strengthening of its newly created institutions. This investment Project will thus be implemented
following improvement of the sector and its institutions through the other ongoing projects, and
also provides support needed to maintain performance in advance of the Bujagali project.

E.     Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection

76.    During the preparation of this Operation, several alternatives were considered. The most
important alternative was to prepare separate operations for the Policy Support Program and
investment Project. The Policy Support Program is well suited for mitigating short-term financial
imbalances and setting the stage for long-term sector expansion. However, it cannot finance the




                                                 21

country's additional power generation nor can it finance the technical assistance Uganda needs to
define policies and actions needed for long-term expansion ­ activities that are suitable for the
Project. Thus, there is clear need for both elements. Combining the two components in one
Operation makes it possible to capture the synergies between the two, and also enables the Bank
to continue the policy dialogue with the Government under a single Operation that will be active
until the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower plant.

77.     For the investment Project, one alternative considered was to put much greater emphasis
on options such as energy efficiency and regional interconnections instead of adding new
significant generation capacity. Nevertheless, even though a kWh saved is cheaper than a kWh
generated by diesel plants, there is still a pressing need to add new capacity to the power system,
as demand reductions by themselves are not sufficient to address the current crisis. A second
alternative considered was to place a much greater emphasis on other supply alternatives such as
energy imports ­ from Kenya or from other neighboring countries, as part of the umbrella
regional integration effort supported by the East Africa Power Market Project (P068544)
proposed for Bank support (FY08). Those supply alternatives would have the additional benefit
of providing a hedge against oil price fluctuations. It was determined that while interconnections
are important medium-term solutions, they would not be able to make a significant contribution
to solving the current energy shortage since none of Uganda's neighbors today have firm excess
power available. However, in anticipation of future development of the East Africa Power
Market, the Operation does support technical assistance for Lake Victoria transmission ring pre-
feasibility and feasibility studies.

F.      Relationship to Other Bank Operations

78.     The Bank currently has three active projects in the power sector, and is preparing two
others:

    Active

    · ERT (Cr 3588, TF 50371, FY02), which is putting in place a conducive environment and
        related sectoral capacity for commercially oriented, sustainable service delivery of
        rural/renewable energy and information and communication technologies.
    · Power IV (Cr 3565, FY01), which seeks to improve power supply by supporting
        critically needed investments and GOU's capacity to manage sector reforms. Among the
        investments is additional capacity of 80 MW at Kiira.
    · Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project (Credit 3411-UG, FY00), which was
        amended in February 2005 to include the Credit Enhancement component (IDA PRG) to
        back a Letter of Credit in support of the distribution concession to UMEME. MIGA is
        also involved in that Project through a Guarantee that covers a substantial part of the
        concessionaire's investments.




                                                   22

    Under Preparation

    · Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project (P089659), which seeks to provide a
        combination of IDA, IFC, and MIGA support to finance the Bujagali hydropower plant.
    · East Africa Power Market (P068544), which seeks to establish the infrastructural and
        institutional framework for a regional power market. The proposed Project will support
        pre-feasibility and feasibility studies to provide initial support for power market
        development.


                                    V. IMPLEMENTATION

A.      Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

Policy Support Program

79.     MEMD will be responsible for implementing the policy component, including all
necessary coordination with other agencies.

Project

80.     UETCL will implement Component 1 (thermal power generation) in its entirety.
UETCL's existing structure already includes a Thermal Power Project Manager, who will be
responsible for leading the procurement process, with participation from MEMD and ERA.
UETCL also will be responsible for the regional transmission integration study under
Component 2. This will be led by UETCL's Planning unit, which is tasked with both domestic
and regional transmission planning.

81.     In keeping with its mandate and ongoing work, MEMD will implement the Energy
Efficiency and Demand Side Management elements of Component 2. This work will be
undertaken under the direction of the existing Assistant Commissioner for Energy Efficiency.
MEMD will also be responsible for the independent evaluation of the rural electrification
framework; PSIA; Kalagala Offset Development Plan; and Communications Strategy.

82.     Procurement activities will be carried out by mainstream UETCL and MEMD staff,
whose procurement skills are rated satisfactory. As both MEMD and UETCL are in compliance
with the procurement law, the organization of their procurement units, internal technical and
administrative controls, anti-corruption measures, and their appeal mechanisms for bidders are
all rated satisfactory. (See Annex 8 for the project procurement assessment.)

83.     Similarly, transactions will be managed by mainstream UETCL and MEMD financial
management staff. The Project Accountants of the respective agencies will be responsible for
maintaining the books of accounts and records of work under the project, and also will ensure




                                                 23

that audits are undertaken and reported as required. See Annex 7 for the project financial
management assessment.

B.      Monitoring and Evaluation of Outcomes/Results

84.     For the Policy Support Program, the Bank will monitor the progress according to the
indicators listed in the Operations Policy Matrix (Annex 3). MEMD will be required to provide
quarterly progress reports to assist the Bank in this regard. Further, the Bank will monitor overall
progress in power sector reforms as part of its continuing dialogue with the Government. In
addition, the Bank will monitor the key impact outcomes of the program, in particular, the level
of the water in Lake Victoria.

85.     For both the Policy Support Program and the Project, a single results framework has
been developed (Annex 3). The monitoring and evaluation of operation results will be an integral
part of the functions of the implementation teams in the two implementing agencies. Each
agency will have its respective monitoring responsibilities as described in Annex 3.

C.      Sustainability

86.     The Operation is expressly aimed to promote financial sustainability of the sector in the
critical period up to commissioning of the Bujagali plant. On the cost side, the sector faces high
costs as it is compelled to rely more heavily on thermal generation. On the revenue side is the
reduced affordability of electricity for ratepayers, and the limited ability of Government to assign
scarce budgetary resources to the recurrent costs of the power sector. The Operation is designed
to provide the financing necessary to even out this difficult balance, providing a sustainability
bridge to the time of commissioning of the Bujagali plant, which should permit the retirement of
the thermal plants and a return to a more sustainable sector financial structure.

D.      Critical Risks and Possible Controversial Aspects

87.     The potential risks that might prevent the operation development objectives from being
met are described in Table 4 below.




                                                 24

                                  Project will support improved environmental management of the Lake in
                                  Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. The most important factor affecting Lake

Risk of GOU subsidies being       The current GOU subsidies to the power sector are required because of

                                  required once the expensive short-term thermal generation facilities are
                                  replaced by much cheaper hydropower generation. The next least cost
                                  hydropower generation facility is planned to be commissioned in early
                                  2011. This new hydropower facility is expected to put an end to GOU
                                  subsidy requirements once commissioned. The World Bank Group
                                  supports this new generation facility through its Private Power Generation
                                  (Bujagali) Project, which is submitted to Board in parallel to this Operation,
                                  thereby directly contributing to the mitigation of this risk.

                                  US$0.03/kWh) and has not been increased since June 2006. Additional
                                  tariff changes depend upon price of oil and amount of rainfall. Current
                                  projections suggest that no additional tariff increases may be needed up to

88.     Uganda has a successful record of power sector reforms and the GOU remains committed
to it. Thus, overall, the policy component faces only moderate risks in implementation.

89.     A potentially significant risk faced by the Operation is resistance to increasing power
tariffs. Increases in power tariffs are often a political issue, and sometimes difficult to
implement. However, the increases already applied in 2006, which have accomplished the bulk
of the required increases, have been well managed. GOU allowed ERA to follow due process
and in fact supported it through a well orchestrated public communication initiative. Furthermore
the Lifeline Tariff has remained stable. Future tariff changes will depend heavily on oil prices. If
prices track World Bank estimates, increases, if any, will be modest. ERA has demonstrated an
ability to undertake the necessary consultations to ensure customers understand and accept tariff
increases. Hence as long as only modest increases are required, this is not a significant risk.

90.     Another macroeconomic risk is the increase of world market oil prices. The current
financial analysis has assumed current and future oil prices according to the World Bank oil
price forecast. Furthermore, the Financial Analysis in Annex 9 provides a sensitivity calculation
that assumes a high oil price forecast scenario with underlying oil prices to increase to
US$73/barrel by 2011 (in 2006 prices). The result of those calculations shows that the overall
sector revenue requirements would increase by US$92 million over the period 2007-2011 ceteris
paribus Base Case. To mitigate that event GOU would have to provide additional subsidies to
finance such an amount or ERA would have to increase tariffs by another 8 percent (based on the
November 2006 tariff) which would bring the average end user tariff to US$0.184/kWh which is
only moderately higher than the existing average retail tariff.

91.     Finally it is also important to note that both risks described above are strongly linked to
the costs of the short-term thermal power generation measures. As those measures will no longer
be required after the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower generation facility (Bujagali),
there is a time limit for those risks to occur. The Bank Group is supporting this next hydropower
generation facility directly through its Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project and thereby
directly contributes to the mitigation of these risks in the long term.

92.     There are no critical risks or possible controversial aspects in regard to financial
management arrangements.

E.      Loan/Credit Conditions and Covenants

93.     The signing of a Subsidiary Agreement between GOU and UETCL in form and substance
acceptable to the Association is a condition of effectiveness.

94.     Government agrees to consult with IDA prior to decommissioning of any of the thermal
power stations. This covenant is intended to ensure that IDA is informed of Government's plans
with regard to ensuring how best to balance the several potentially competing issues including: i)
the need to ensure UMEME has the minimum supply provided in its concession agreement; ii)
the high cost of thermal power and Government's very reasonable desire to retire the thermal
stations as soon as possible; and iii) the possibility that Lake Victoria waters may again drop,
leading to the need for sustained thermal inputs.

95.     Government (Department of Water Development) will periodically report the abstraction
of water from Lake Victoria to the Nile Basin countries. Reporting will compare the actual
abstraction to that allowed under the Agreed Curve.

96.     There are no financial management loan/credit conditions, although the following action
plan will be monitored by the Country Financial Management Specialist in order to strengthen
the financial management arrangements of the Project.

Financial Covenants for UETCL (Subsidiary Agreement)

97.     The Company shall maintain a proper financial management system, including records
and accounts, and prepare financial statements, in accordance with consistently applied
accounting standards acceptable to IDA, adequate to reflect its operations and financial condition
and to register separately the operations, resources and expenditures related to the Project.

98.     The Company shall submit to IDA: (a) the company's annual audited financial
statements; and (b) annual audited financial statements for the Project, no later than six months
after the end of the Company's financial year.




                                                 27

99.       The Company shall have, from a combination of power sales and GOU transfers, "net
revenues"4 equal to at least the sum of its debt service requirements, working capital
requirements, dividends (if any), and a proportion of investments that requires funding from the
Company's internal resources.

UETCL Reporting Requirements

100.      UETCL will inform IDA of changes in generation capacity and its sources of electricity
supply.

101.      It will provide timely reports to IDA concerning fuel supply, and comparison of
consumption and kWh performance between actual and contracted agreement.

F.        Disbursement and Auditing

102.      Policy Support Program. The program will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures
for development policy credits. The untied budget support will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases;
therefore, there are no procurement requirements. Once the credit becomes effective, and the
conditions of disbursement have been met, the proceeds of the credit will be deposited by IDA in
an account at the Bank of Uganda at the request of the Borrower.

103.      The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the Credit into said account, an
equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the
foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system. The administration of
this credit will be the responsibility of MEMD. See Annex 7 for detailed financial management
assessment.

104.      Project. A review of the financial management, auditing, and disbursement arrangements
for the Project has been conducted, and is described fully in Annex 7. Project auditing
arrangements have been agreed with the Borrower including internal and external audits as per
Bank requirements. Disbursements for the Project will be on the basis of Financial Monitoring
Reports, with which the project entities have satisfactory experience based on other Bank-
supported operations (see Annex 7 for detailed description).



4    The term "net revenues" means the difference between: (a) the sum of revenues from all sources related to operations, net
non-operating income and Government subsidies received towards thermal power costs or other operational costs; and (b) the
sum of all expenses related to operations including power purchase costs, "UMEME off-set payments," administration, adequate
maintenance, taxes and payments in lieu of taxes, but excluding provision for depreciation, other non-cash operating charges and
interest and other charges on debt. The term "UMEME off-set payments" means charges made by UMEME against UETCL for
losses incurred by UMEME in relation to the power crisis and in accordance with agreements reached between the two
companies.

                                  VI. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

A.      Economic and Financial Analyses

Economic Analysis (Project only; not required for Policy Support Program)

105.    The purpose of the economic analysis is to evaluate whether the short-term generation
facility whose costs will be partly defrayed by the proposed Credit, is an economic choice of
technology. Details of the demand forecast, thermal capacity costs, fuel costs, hydrologic data
and value of unserved energy are the same in this analysis as for the proposed Private Power
Generation (Bujagali) Project and are given in Annex 9.

106.    The urgency of the thermal investments is predicated more on the delay of the first
Bujagali project, combined with poor hydrologic conditions than it is on load growth, which has
been constrained by supply problems. As a result, the generation requirements forecast is
conservative and could well be exceeded.

107.    The feasibility of either importing firm electricity from the Kenya grid or locating a
Uganda-specific thermal plant in Kenya, in order to economize on fuel transportation costs, was
examined. Neither option is feasible within the required time period.

108.    The new short-term facility will be a high-speed diesel plant located in Uganda, burning
ADO. As it is a temporary, emergency facility, only technologies that can be: (a) mounted and
removed quickly; (b) run with fuels readily transportable to Uganda; and (c) viable over short
time periods were considered. This limits the choice to gas turbines and high speed diesel plants.

109.    The economic cost of using the short-term plant ranges between US$0.165 and US$0.423
per kWh (including a carbon emissions charge valued at US$15.3/Te of CO2) depending on the
fuel price, year and hydrology case. Details of the parameters and the calculations underlying
this estimate are contained in Annex 9.

110.    Benefit-Cost and Risk Analysis. The project benefit stream consists of system avoided
unserved energy (AUE) with the project versus the AUE without the project, multiplied by the
value of AUE (VAUE). The system AUE varies according to the hydrology, and as the
hydrology improves, the need for the project diminishes since more hydropower is available.

111.    VAUE is the Uganda-specific opportunity cost per consumer category of grid-based
electricity supply. For the commercial and industrial load it is the cost of self-generation, and for
the residential load it is the cost of using electricity substitutes. Calculations to determine these
values are shown in Annex 9.




                                                  29

112.     The marginal cost stream is the sum of system operating costs "with" versus "without"
the proposed project. The economic returns to the short-term plant are enhanced by low
hydrology, high demand and low fuel prices. Conversely they are reduced by high hydrology,
low demand and high oil prices. Hence the project's viability is at risk primarily from these three
factors. The Base, Low and High projections for each of these risk factors is assigned an
individual estimated probability of occurrence, allowing the calculation of a probability weighted
net present value (NPV) for each case and all of them in aggregate. Details of the sensitivity
analysis can be found in Annex 9.

113.     The analysis uses a merit-order dispatch model which calculates the AUE, VAUE, fully
allocated system-wide generation costs and net benefits for 45 different cases, and the overall
probability weighted NPV of the proposed investment. The results of running the model for all
45 cases at a 10 percent discount rate are shown in Table 6.

114.     Light grey areas are positive outcomes and dark grey areas negative ones. As expected,
the proposed Project fares relatively better with lower hydrology, lower fuel prices, and higher
demand. The risk-inclusive NPV at 10 percent discount rate is positive at 1.2 million dollars, and
the inferred economic internal rate of return (EIRR) approximately 12 percent, with substantial
risk of more positive or negative outcomes depending on eventual demand, hydrology, and fuel
prices. The worst negative outcome is USD 42.3 million (probability of only 1.3 percent) and the
best positive outcome is USD 73.4 million (probability of only 0.5 percent). Out of the 45
scenarios, 21 cases are positive and 24 negative. These results should be viewed in the context of
the very conservative projections for demand growth and the VAUE, and the demonstrated
sensitivity of the results in respect of the demand forecast. Overall, this analysis indicates that the
expected economic outcome for this operation is satisfactory with an inferred EIRR of 12
percent, but with substantial downside and upside variations.

Financial Analysis (Policy Support Program and Project)

115.   In June 1999, the Government approved a comprehensive power sector reform strategy
focusing on improving efficiency through a structure that allows for a partnership between the
public and private sectors in the operation of the power system's assets and investment in the
system's development. Annex 1 provides an overview of the implementation of structural
reforms in the power sector. The consolidated performance of the generation, transmission and
distribution Ugandan power utilities is discussed here (Annex 9 provides more details on the
financial performance of the sector).

116.   Power Sector Performance (2004-06). The significant reduction in relatively
inexpensive hydropower supply over the recent past and in the medium term, has forced the
Government to implement an interim generation expansion plan (2005-10) to meet the country's
power generation needs until the proposed Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project is
commissioned in early 2011. As already described under Section III above, this interim plan
includes the installation of up to 150 MW of thermal generation capacity (further details also in
Annex 1). This heavy reliance on very expensive thermal power combined with a reduced
amount of kWh energy to sell has significantly increased the sector's overall revenue
requirements as well as the average costs per kWh. Total revenue requirements in 2004 were
US$76 million, at which time the sector was financially viable. However, the corresponding
requirement in 2006 is approximately US$200 million, equivalent to an increase of 164% over
two years. Thus, electricity tariffs had not kept pace with rising costs since 2005, and the gap
between costs and revenues has widened considerably.

117.   Since the power crisis begun, the Government has shown its commitment to the power
sector by providing substantial support to UETCL (the single buyer in the power system) and in
spite of significant power cuts, ERA has also substantially raised tariffs (by a cumulative 151%
since April 2005), to meet the revenue requirements of the sector (together with budgetary and
donor support).

118.   The power sector's key operational and financial performance indicators for 2004-06 are
summarized in Table 7 below. The consolidated financial performance of Uganda Electricity
Generation Company Limited (UEGCL), Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited
(UETCL), and Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited (UEDCL) for 2004-06 and
projections for the period 2007-16 are provided in Annex 12.

119.    Electricity Tariffs. After the takeover of the distribution business by UMEME, tariffs
were increased effective April 1, 2005 by an average of 27%. This increase took account of
UMEME's revenue requirements and also the costs of the first 50MW thermal plant that was
commissioned in May 2005. Tariffs were increased subsequently by an average of 2%, 37.5%
and 41% on October 1, 2005, June 1, 2006, and November 1, 2006 respectively.

120.    Despite those significant tariff increases the domestic lifeline tariff for the first 15 kWh
per month was only increased one time in the last five years and less significantly than the
average retail tariff. The lifeline tariff was set at USh50/kWh (US$2.7¢/kWh) in 2001 and
represents approximately 5.5% of total consumption by end-use customers. In June 2006, the
life-line tariff was increased by 24% to USh62/kWh (US$3.4¢/kWh).




                                                         32

121.     Retail electricity tariffs are now below costs of supply. Today's weighted average retail
tariff excluding VAT is USh313/kWh (US$17.2¢/kWh and US$21¢/kWh including VAT). The
estimated actual average for 2006 was USh215/kWh (US$11.7¢/kWh). Based on accrued
revenue requirements, the required average tariff excluding VAT for 2006 was USh371/kWh
(US$20.2¢/kWh). The estimated subsidy for 2006 is around USh156/kWh (US$8.5¢/kWh),
equivalent to US$85 million for the calendar year. In 2006, the Government provided USh113
billion (US$62 million) in direct budget support towards thermal power costs of the power sector
and in the Government's Fiscal Year 2006/07 the total amount of subsidies will reach US$84
million under base case assumptions. In addition to the Government's support, UETCL was
directed by ERA to utilize the remaining balance of USh49 billion (US$27 million)5 in the Bulk
Supply Tariff stabilization fund that had been collected from electricity customers in prior years.
This fund was fully utilized in the first quarter of 2006.

122.     Uncollected Energy Bills. Another important factor of Uganda's power sector is the
amount of losses and uncollected energy bills. Since its take over of the distribution concession
from the state owned UEDCL, the collection rate had already been improved by UMEME until
May 2006 from 80% up to 92%, but since the large increases in tariffs in June and November
2006, the collection rate dropped again to 82% at the end of 2006. Equally the transmission and
distribution losses remained at levels of about 4.5-5.0% (transmission losses of UETCL) and
34.1% (distribution losses of UMEME) since mid-2006. This means that at the end of 2006
approximately 49% of the energy sent out is not paid for. It will be crucial that loss numbers and
collection rates improve again. UMEME is actively pursuing various measures to accelerate
technical and non technical loss reduction and to improve collection rates. The distribution
concession has recently been renegotiated between UMEME and the Government due to the
current electricity crisis. The restructured concession agreement includes commercial incentives
for the concessionaire to reduce losses and non-collection rates.

123.     Sector Revenue Requirements and Indicative Financing Plan (2007-2011). A
summary of the base case forecast of the power sector revenue requirements and an indicative
financing plan for 2007-11 is provided Annex 9, as well as the annual sector revenue
requirements and the financing plan for 2007-16.

124.     Total revenue requirements of the power sector for 2007-11 are estimated at US$1,495
million. Based on the tariff levels effective from November 2006, the power sector will raise
revenues of US$1,147 million in that same period, leaving a shortfall of US$348 million during
2007-11. In addition to this shortfall in 2007-2011 the sector also has to service a remaining
shortfall of USh 8 billion (approx. US$ 5 million) that was carried forward from the previous
years.



5Note that US$4 million out of the US$27 million have been applied to outstanding revenue shortfalls carried forward from the
previous calendar year 2005.




                                                            33

125.   It envisages the following revenue raising measures:

   · Deferment of USh128 billion (US$67 million) of debt service by GOU to 2011; the
       sector should be in a position to repay all of the deferred debt service by the end of 2011
       and will be expected to meet all of its debt service obligations to GOU from 2011
       onwards;

   · USh92 billion (US$49 million) annually in 2007 and 2008, USh28 billion (US$15
       million) in 2009, and USh66 billion (US$34 million) in 2010. The slight increase of GOU
       support in 2010 compared to the previous year is due to the fact that the Project will no
       longer provide funds for the financing of the energy charges of the power station
       supported under the Project. On this basis, the projected direct GOU budget support
       applied towards tariffs is estimated to reach USh278 billion (US$147 million),
       representing 10% of sector revenue requirements from 2007 to 2011. No Government
       support will be needed beyond 2010.

   · IDA support (under the Project hereto) of US$ 206.5 million towards the capacity and
       energy charges of a 50MW thermal plant. The financial assistance will comprise US$42.1
       million towards capacity payments and US$164.4 million towards energy charges,
       including fuel.

126.   Electricity Tariff Increases: According to the World Bank's forecast, international
prices of crude oil are expected to decline gradually over the coming years, to reach around
US$45 per barrel by 2011 (in 2006 prices). Based on this oil price forecast, and after taking
account of Government and IDA support towards thermal power costs, the financial analysis
indicates that there will be no need for further revisions in electricity tariffs through to 2011.
This means that tariffs will fall in real terms over the course of the next five years from the
present US$17.2¢/kWh to US$13.8¢/kWh by 2011. However, if crude oil prices from today to
2011 would slightly increase to US$73 per barrel (in 2006 prices), the projections show that an
additional amount of US$92 million would have to be raised through additional tariff increases
or additional tariff subsidies.

127.   Figure 1 depicts the "glide path" of the average electricity tariff until 2011. The revenue
requirements above the dark line show the amount of "tariff subsidy" being provided by the
Government through direct budget support, debt service deferment and IDA support towards
thermal costs. The projected revenue requirements and tariffs converge by the time the proposed
Private Power Generation (Bujagali) project is commissioned in 2011. Electricity tariffs would
be fully cost reflective by then and subsidies would be removed, except for duty exemptions on
generation fuel and transmission investments.

130.       Despite the fact that only 5% of Uganda's population has access to electricity and that
only a very low level of power consumption is attributed to the poor (see Section E below), the
proposed temporary subsidization of the electricity tariffs is justified for two main reasons:

     (i)         As Box 1 in Section II above shows, the expansion of the industrial and commercial
                 sector plays an important role for Uganda's future economic growth prospects. The
                 recent CEM for Uganda points out that the expansion of the commercial and
                 industrial sector is dependent on the provision of reliable and affordable power supply
                 for daily production purposes. The current fully cost-reflective end user tariff would
                 have to be around US$ 0.26/kWh. Such a tariff level would have negative
                 implications on the opening of new businesses and thereby on the expansion of the
                 industrial and commercial sectors. Temporary GOU subsidies are necessary to
                 support economic growth as long as the power crisis exists.

     (ii)        Another reason that justifies the current GOU support to the power sector is the
                 necessary expansion of the customer base and improvement in access to electricity.
                 Fully cost reflective tariffs would seriously hinder or even stop completely
                 UMEME's ability to expand its customer base as unsubsidized tariffs would be
                 unaffordable for the potential new residential and non residential customers. GOU
                 support therefore can also be justified by the important need to increase access to
                 electricity.

                                                                    36

131.   However, as the table above also shows, there will not be a need in the assumed Base
Case for Government subsidies after the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower plant, which
confirms the temporary nature of the proposed GOU financial support. Subsidies will no longer
be required as the Bujagali Dam commissioning will allow for the immediate displacement of at
least 738 GWh of diesel generation under Base Case hydrology assumptions.

B.     Technical (Project only; not required for Policy Support Program)

132.   The technical aspects of the Project are standard, straightforward, and non-controversial.
Diesel engine technology is well-known and widely used for short-term operations such as
proposed for support under this project. Interconnections of the short-term plants with the
national grid will be/are undertaken in compliance with accepted engineering practice and
supervised by UETCL's capable staff. Likewise, the energy efficiency measures contemplated
are well-known and widely used.

C.     Fiduciary

133.   Policy Support Program and Project. The Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) carried out by IDA in 2004 shows that GOU has made substantial progress
in improving its public financial management systems since the last CFAA undertaken in 2001.
However, risks remain in terms of enforcement of procurement and payroll rules and procedures;
completeness of data on debt; effective independent oversight, and timeliness and effectiveness
of legislative and public scrutiny. As a result of the CFAA, GOU has come up with a strategy to
mitigate these country level issues, by designing a Financial Management and Accountability
Program (FINMAP). FINMAP's objective is to address the CFAA action plan issues formulated
within the Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA) and improve on Uganda's Public
Financial Management­Performance Measurement Framework indicators developed by the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Secretariat. FINMAP is to be supported by a
number of Development Partners, including the Bank, which form the Public Financial
Management Donor Group.

134.   Project. The Project's transactions will be managed within the existing set-up in UETCL
and MEMD. The Manager, Finance, Accounts & Sales of UETCL and the Project Accountant of
MEMD will be in charge of maintaining the accounts and records of the components of the
Project that they are implementing. Both MEMD and UETCL have Financial Management
Manuals in place. The Project's financial statements will be audited in accordance with statutory
requirements, and suitable Terms of Reference will be developed.

135.   Actions outlined in the Financial Management Action Plan will be undertaken by the
Project to strengthen the financial management system. One action to be completed within six
months after credit effectiveness is reaching agreement on the terms of reference and




                                                 37

appointment of the external auditor, to ensure that Project accounts are audited and submitted to
the Bank in a timely manner.

136.   In order to ensure that the Project is effectively implemented, UETCL and MEMD will
ensure that appropriate staffing arrangements are maintained throughout the life of the Project.

137.   The conclusion of the assessment is that the financial management arrangements have an
overall moderate risk rating for both MEMD and UETCL, which satisfies the Bank's minimum
requirements under OP/BP10.02 and therefore the implementing agencies are adequate to
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the project
required by IDA. With the implementation of the Action Plan, the financial management
arrangements will be strengthened.

D.     Procurement

138.   Policy Support Program and Project. In Uganda, all procurements utilizing public
funds are governed by the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act, 2003 (the
Procurement Act). The Procurement Act, based on the UNCITRAL model law, established a
regulatory body, the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA).

139.   The 2004 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) indicates that the
Procurement Act represents effective and suitable legislation. However, there are a few issues
with the law and regulations that should be addressed. These issues, which are described in
Annex 8, are more appropriately addressed through the ongoing PRSC support.

140.   Project. Procurement for the proposed Project will be carried out in accordance with the
World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," dated May 2004
(revised October 2006); "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers," dated May 2004 (revised October 2006); and the provisions stipulated in the
Financing and Project Agreements. For each contract to be financed by the Credit, the
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated
costs, prior review requirements, and time frame have been agreed between the Borrower and the
Bank and are outlined in the Procurement Plan. See Annex 8 for a description of procurement
arrangements.

E. Poverty and Social Impacts

Policy Support Program

141.     Since only about 5 percent of Uganda's population has access to electricity, any
additional power generation, as well as any improvements in reliability, will certainly provide
substantial benefits to the country and to poor households in particular. In general, the benefits to
economic growth are expected to come from the multiplier effects of providing a reliable supply
of electricity, which is a fundamental requirement for promoting new investments. In addition,
even communities that have no household electricity connections will benefit when the energy
program expands, as basic services become more accessible. As the sector becomes self-
sustaining and revenue-generating, allowing the power sector reforms to take effect, more
resources will be freed up and reallocated for education, health, and agriculture. Consequently,
as these services expand, including through synchronization with energy programs, the country's
fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals will be facilitated.

142.     In general, effects of changes in electricity tariffs on the poor can be determined through
impacts on affordability and willingness-to-pay. In Uganda, however, the current electricity
coverage in poor areas is much smaller relative to wealthier areas and affordability becomes less
of a concern for three reasons. First, access to electricity is very limited at this stage so the major
poverty implications of energy policies would be through increasing generation and improving
transmission and distribution to rural, poor households.

143.     Second, contrary to what may generally be found in many other countries, wealthier
households in Uganda spend more on electricity.7 The top 10 percent of households spend 12.5
percent of their total expenditures on energy compared to 1.3 percent among the poorest 10
percent of the population. Changes in electricity tariffs are anticipated to have minimal direct
effects on household consumption and on poorer families' electricity consumption. In addition,
Uganda has a Lifeline tariff that is available to users that consume less than 15 kWh per month
has remained stable as noted above.8 Nevertheless, to better understand the implications of these
changes among families who are currently receiving grid-connected electricity, a poverty and
social impact analysis (PSIA) will be undertaken (see below). The results of the PSIA will be
used to identify measures to better protect poorer households from short-term increases in
electricity tariffs.

144.     Third, the Rural Electrification Strategy and Plan of 2001 is currently implementing a
poverty targeted energy program. It aims to provide a connection rate of 10 percent of rural
households by 2012, or about 400,000 new connections, most of which will be in poor villages.

According to the country's poverty mapping, the rural energy subsidies will be prioritized
according to districts where the majority of the extreme poor reside: districts with less than 20
percent of population living below the poverty line; districts with 20-35 percent; and districts
with more than 35 percent below the poverty line. The proposed energy subsidy will cover local
distribution of grid-connected generation projects; mini-grids around isolated generation plants;
grid-connected distribution extensions with no generation of their own; and small, stand-alone
systems with one or few consumers (e.g., photovoltaics or PVs; small diesel).9

145.     The Project provides an allocation for technical assistance to the GOU to lead a group of
local consultants in conducting the PSIA of the ongoing policy reforms in the energy sector. The
PSIA will: (a) examine the distributional implications of electricity tariffs and expanded rural
electrification; (b) assess the poverty impacts of a reallocation of expenditures from energy to
sectors like education, health, and agriculture; (c) address sector policy related environmental
impacts; and (d) recommend actions for Government and other stakeholders to ensure that both
distributional and environmental impacts are taken into account in the implementation of power
sector policies and programs. The matrix in Annex 10 summarizes the key issues.

Project

146.     The investments in thermal power generation and energy efficiency are expected to have
overall positive social and environmental benefits, ultimately leading to increased economic
activities, more employment opportunities, and improved delivery of education, health, and other
services. Further, alternatives to burning fuelwood and charcoal in woodstoves would not only
reduce deforestation but also improve health, especially among women and children, as a result
of reduced indoor air pollution. Aside from their positive environmental impacts, investments in
energy saving technologies, for example in buildings and industrial sites, such as use of more
energy efficient light bulbs, will promote behavioral change and increase awareness of benefits
from using these technologies.

147.     There are no negative social impacts to energy efficiency programs. However, in the co-
financing of the thermal power generation plant in Mutundwe, two possible social impacts were
identified. One is the acquisition of a one acre property. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for
this property was completed, consistent with Government and World Bank requirements. The
RAP covered the survey of the land, appropriate compensation, and informed consultation with
affected people.

F.      Environment

Policy Support Program

148.    Energy policy reforms are generally beneficial to the environment because they promote
efficient generation and use of power. In addition, by promoting execution of policies directed at
expanding access to energy by rural, poor households, including renewable energy sources, it
promotes less dependence on fossil fuels, and in turn, reduces emissions of carbon dioxide.

149.    Three possible effects on the environment may result from the operation of the thermal
power plant. As noted in Annex 10, these will be examined in greater detail. The first effects
may come from continued reliance on burning traditional fuels, such as wood and charcoal,
which cause indoor air pollution and have impacts on deforestation and land degradation. The
second area concerns the current increase in diesel operated private and industrial generators that
are used to augment electricity in wealthier households, businesses, and industries. Dependence
on these generators is expected to decline with improved electricity generation. However, the
rate and level of substitution will need to be better monitored. Lastly, there is the possibility of
fuel switching when electricity tariffs become less affordable. Some of the switching may result
in increased reliance on biomass fuels that may have consequences for forest ecosystems, etc.
These impacts will be reviewed in the planned PSIA, which will make use of findings from the
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) completed under the Second Environmental
Management and Capacity Building Project (P073089). The policy reforms are also aimed at
improving the institutional capacities for mitigating negative impacts, including technical
advisory support from the Energy Sector Working Group (SWG).

Project

150.    Environmental benefits are expected from investments in energy saving technologies,
such as retooling old equipment to make it more energy efficient or replacing it, and applying
insulation and energy efficient heaters and light bulbs in buildings and industrial areas. The
Project investments for the thermal power plant at the Mutundwe site are expected to have only a
modest impact on the environment. The potential negative impacts identified in the construction
and operation phase of the power plant are mainly: (a) oil wastes in the form of used oil that will
be generated by the plant; (b) emissions; and (c) noise. In addition, there are risks of water
pollution related to oil spills, and occupational hazards including accidents. The Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA), which was prepared for the Mutundwe Thermal Power Station,
satisfactorily identified all associated adverse impacts and proposes effective mitigation and
monitoring measures.

151.    UETCL will oversee implementation of the findings from the EIA. However, significant
capacity building is needed since there are only a few qualified environmental specialists in
UETCL who can carry out the technical and scientific monitoring. Stakeholder consultations on
the EIA were held with local authorities and village leaders.

                             UGANDA: Power Sector Development

A. Country Background

153.    Uganda, with a per capita income in 2005 of about US$280, is one of the poorest
countries in the world. Life expectancy is low (49 years at birth) while population growth, at 3.5
percent in 2005, is among the highest in the world.

154.    The Government of Uganda (GOU) has demonstrated a firm commitment to poverty
reduction, as spelled out in its PEAP. The most current version aims at key strategic results in
areas of increased GDP growth, reduced poverty and inequality, and improved human
development. IDA's assistance to Uganda is aligned with the strategic direction given in the
PEAP, and the UJAS, approved by IDA and other development partners in January 2006,
provides the basis for their support of the PEAP's implementation.

155.    IDA's and other Development Partners' contributions have brought the country closer to
reaching the Millennium Development Goals of reduced HIV/AIDS prevalence, poverty
reduction, and increased enrollment rates for primary schooling.

156.    The Uganda country program was the first to utilize the Poverty Reduction Support
Credits, which provide external finance to the budget to support the implementation of the
reform agenda derived from the PEAP. Uganda was also the first to benefit from debt relief
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative, which resulted in cancellation of 100% of
Uganda's IDA debt on July 1, 2006.

157.    Uganda has experienced robust macro-economic performance in recent years, averaging
6.4% growth between 1990 and 2005. Strong macro-economic policies, a credible program to
eradicate poverty and good financial discipline have led to falling poverty levels. Domestic
inflation has been slightly above the 5 percent target for the third consecutive year due to
inflationary pressures from weather, power shortages and energy price shocks. The Uganda
Shilling (USh) depreciated by 4 percent against the US$ due to higher demand for foreign
exchange to finance the import bill. Overall due to good macroeconomic management, savings,
exports, and foreign direct investment are increasing. The challenge for Uganda is now to deepen
the reforms already underway and prevent their reversal.

158.    This section includes: (a) the key characteristics of the power sector; (b) a description of
the Government's comprehensive power sector reform program; and (c) a description of ongoing

situation).

Key Characteristics of the Power Sector

Hydrology, Supply and Demand

159.   Uganda's main source of power is from the Nalubaale and Kiira 380MW dam complex,
located at the mouth of Lake Victoria. Over the past several years, Lake Victoria water levels
have dropped by about 1.5 meters, and in October 2006 reached levels close to the historic low
of March 1923. However, by March 2007, the lake levels have recovered by about 0.7 meters.
The low water levels have resulted in a decline in electricity output from the Nalubaale/Kiira
from around 200MW in April 2005, dropping gradually to reach 170MW by January 2006,
reducing further to 135MW (equivalent to water discharges of 850m3/s) from February 2006 to
August 20, 2006. Since then, the production has dropped to 120MW (equivalent to water
discharges of 750m3/s). In contrast, current system demand is about 380MW at peak times and
about 290MW at base load, resulting in persistent and acute power shortages which are
impacting growth.

160.   The reasons for these power shortages are fourfold. First, there has been a significant
delay in power infrastructure development in particular, in completing the financing of the
previous Bujagali project, which is the next least-cost generation increment. As part of the
previous effort to develop the project, construction was scheduled to commence in early 2002
and the power station was to be commissioned by the end of 2005. Second, the low Lake
Victoria water levels, caused both by the recent regional drought as well as water over-
abstraction for hydropower generation, have resulted in significantly reduced power generation
output at the Nalubaale/Kiira dam complex. In this regard, the Government has decreased
hydropower production in an effort to return to the principles embodied in the Agreed Curve. A
third contributor to current power shortages has been the high level of technical and non-
technical losses of the distribution system, which are now being addressed by UMEME, the
private sector concessionaire. Fourth, annual demand growth over the past several years
increased by about 8%, placing additional pressure on the power system.

161.   Lake Victoria is a shared transboundary resource of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.
Rwanda and Burundi are a part of the upper watershed that drains into Lake Victoria through
the Kagera River. The lake is part of the Nile River Basin system shared by ten countries:
Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan,
Tanzania, and Uganda. In addition to its environmental value, including biodiversity and the
hydrological cycle, Lake Victoria supports a large fishing industry for export and local
consumption, hydropower production, drinking and irrigation water, lake transport, and tourism.
Because of low water levels, these benefits have been threatened by environmental degradation
manifested in reduced fish stocks, the drying out of fish breeding areas and the loss of livelihood
to many fishing communities; a decline of biodiversity; increased sedimentation and nutrient
loads resulting in eutrophication; the drying out of wetlands and loss of littoral habitat;
increased lake transportation costs, since ports and piers are left hanging on dry land, and water
shortages for shoreline towns and farmers. Hence, the consequences of load shedding and
depletion of Lake Victoria have been widespread, with macro, sectoral and environmental

impacts affecting not only Uganda but the other Riparian States. Efforts to regulate and manage
the activities threatening the lake are clearly insufficient at present, and widespread poverty in
the basin exacerbates environmental stress. Even in its current perilous state, the lake is a
valuable asset supporting the livelihoods of approximately three million people directly; and
indirectly the entire population of the basin estimated recently at 30 million.

162.    On July 26, 2006, the daily water outflow regime of the Nalubaale/Kiira dam complex
was modified so as to optimize hydropower generation. Higher volumes of water are now
discharged during the day and lower volumes at night such that the total volume of water
released during the 24 hour period is the same as if the release was at a constant pace (as was
the case up to July 25, 2006). Hydropower output during the day and night is now at 145MW
and 79MW respectively, rather than 120MW continuous. The operating regime of the 2x50MW
short-term thermal plants is now also optimized during peak hours and during the day.

163.    The power supply situation has slightly improved since the optimization of available
generation capacity started in late July. However, the overall load shedding for the calendar
year 2006 remained high with 364 GWh of load shed in 2006. In fact load shedding in 2006
increased by over 370% compared to 2005 (98 GWh of load shed). Those numbers show the
dramatic consequences of the overall capacity constraints in the system that GOU has now
started to address.

164.    The generation mix has changed from a predominantly hydro based system until mid-
2005 to a hydro/thermal mix of 55/45 today and the share of thermal generation is expected to
increase further when the additional 50MW temporary thermal plant, to be financed under the
Project, is commissioned later this year.

165.    In spite of a very low electrification rate, the cost of load shedding to the economy is
significant. The lack of reliable and available power supply and/or the need to run expensive
back up generation has impacted on industrial production (many firms have limited back-up
generation capacity). The cost of unserved energy has been estimated at US$ 0.389 per kWh.
Furthermore, the shortfall in generation has a knock-on effect on the rest of the power sector,
since lower volumes in supply lead to lower retail electricity sales and revenues, which is
affecting the viability of UMEME, the private distribution concessionaire.

Government is currently evaluating the procurement of a permanent 50MW HFO plant on an

Distribution Performance

169.     The operational performance of UMEME has been satisfactory so far. UMEME's
financial performance is also satisfactory, with healthy cash flows. The main features of its
operational performance include:

    Distribution losses went down from 38% on takeover to around 34.1% as of December 2006.

    Overall collection rate went up from 80% on takeover to 92% by May 2006. Following the
    tariff increase of 37.5% in June 2006, the collection rate dropped to 85% from June to
    October 2006 and to 82% in November/December 2006, following another tariff increase of
    41% in November 2006.

    A total of 36,000 new customers have been connected during the first twenty-two months of
    UMEME's operations to December 2006, against 22,000 committed under the concession.
    At present there are approximately 300,100 customers (270,000 domestic, 29,000 small
    commercial, 800 medium and large industry, and 300 street lights).

    During the first twenty-two months to December 31, 2006, UMEME invested USh24.7
    billion (US$13.6 million) in the network and operational assets, and it paid USh2.5 billion
    (US$1.4 million) to the Government as reimbursement of costs of arranging the concession.
    Under the concession, UMEME had committed to invest a minimum of US$5 million in the
    first eighteen months of the concession.

170.     GOU and UMEME have now agreed that as long as the power crisis persists and until
UETCL's bulk supply tariff has stabilized (i.e. the bulk supply tariff does not increase by (a)
10% or more of the retail tariff within a twelve month period or (b) by 20% or more of the retail
tariff within a thirty-six months period), actual losses minus 1% and the actual non-collection
rate (of the last quarter preceding any tariff change) will be applied in UMEME's tariff
determination. There is downside protection for UMEME, but the benefits accruing from lower
losses will be shared between UMEME and UETCL (see Annex 9).

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                                               Annex 1


171.     Box 3 summarizes the main characteristics and key factors affecting Uganda's power
system:

                             Box 3: Uganda's Power System Characteristics
· Uganda's total energy consumption is around 5 million tons of oil equivalent, of which 90 percent is biomass-
    wood, charcoal and agricultural residues. Per capita energy consumption is about 0.2 tons of oil equivalent,
    which is one of the lowest in the world.

· Uganda has one main hydropower complex, located on the Nile River: Nalubaale (180MW), completed in the
    early 1950s, and Kiira (200MW)1, a dam and powerhouse facility located 0.8 km downstream.

· To address the current power shortages, the Government has procured two 50MW short-term thermal power
    plants, and is planning to procure an additional 50MW of thermal power plant under this Power Sector
    Development Operation. An IPP of 50MW running on HFO is also being procured. Thermal power generation
    represented 23% of total generation output in 2006.

· The power sector generated 1,887 GWh in 2005, which decreased to 1,610 GWh in 2006 due to the power
    crisis. Domestic electricity sales revenues were US$116 million in 2006.

· Uganda has the 23rd highest retail petroleum prices in the world ­ about the fifth highest in Africa. The average
    proportion of Ugandan transport costs attributed to fuel charges is estimated at about 50% (compared to an
    average of 30% for Africa).

· There were about 300,100 consumers connected to the national grid at the end of 2006. Efforts to expand rural
    access in areas far from the grid, as well as extending existing connections outside of UMEME's concession
    area, are being pursued under the Energy for Rural Transformation Project.

                                 Key Factors Affecting the Power System
· A significant delay in power infrastructure development and, in particular, in completing the financing of the
    previous Bujagali project, which is the next least-cost generation increment. As part of the previous effort to
    develop the project, construction was scheduled to commence in early 2002 and the power station was to be
    commissioned by the end of 2005;

· The low Lake Victoria water levels, caused both by the recent regional drought as well as water over-
    abstraction for hydropower generation, have resulted in significantly reduced power generation output at the
    Nalubaale/Kiira dam complex (currently only 120 MW of the 300MW installed capacity can be used);

· The high level of technical losses of the distribution system;

· Annual demand growth which has increased by about 8%; and

· Low access rate to electricity of approximately 5%.


Government's Comprehensive Power Sector Reform Program

172.     In June 1999, the Government approved a comprehensive power sector reform strategy
that focused on improving efficiency through private participation in the sector. In November
1999, the Parliament passed a new Electricity Act which provided the legal and administrative


1The total installed capacity of 200 MW will be reached once unit 4 and 5 are commissioned (expected April 2007).
Currently tested and installed capacity is 120MW thereby bringing the totally installed capacity of Nalubaale/Kiira
to 380MW.

framework for reform and removed the legal monopoly of the Uganda Electricity Board UEB.
In April 2000, the GOU created ERA as an independent regulator. On March 31, 2001, the GOU
unbundled UEB into three separate corporate entities, one each for generation (the Uganda
Electricity Generation Company Ltd. ­ UEGCL), transmission (the Uganda Electricity
Transmission Company Ltd. - UETCL) and distribution/supply (the Uganda Electricity
Distribution Company Ltd. - UEDCL). Subsequent to the unbundling of UEB, the private sector
was granted separate concessions for the management of UEGCL's and UEDCL's assets and
UEB was dissolved in early 2006.

173.    Concession of Power Generation Assets (April 2003). In April 2003, Eskom Uganda (a
subsidiary of Eskom Enterprises (Pty) Ltd, the state-owned utility of South Africa) was awarded
a 20 year concession for the management of UEGCL's assets, which consisted of the Nalubaale
and Kiira hydropower plants. UEGCL's function has since been limited to monitoring the
activities of Eskom Uganda. UEGCL has a staff of eleven people and its administration costs are
recovered through a concession fee charged to Eskom Uganda, which in turn, recovers its cost
through its charges to UETCL for the sale of power. Eskom Uganda's charges to UETCL cover
depreciation of capital, the concessionaire's return, annual operation and maintenance costs, and
regulatory fees.

174.    Concession of Distribution Assets (March 2005).         The Government conducted an
international competitive bidding process and awarded a 20-year concession for UEDCL's
distribution assets to Umeme Ltd. (UMEME), a private company established in Uganda in which
Globeleq Ltd. of Bermuda (Globeleq) and Eskom2 had a 56% and 44% ownership, respectively.
Globeleq is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Globeleq Ltd., (UK) which, in turn, is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Commonwealth Development Corporation of the UK. UMEME is the first
unbundled electricity distribution network in Sub-Saharan Africa to be concessioned to the
private sector. From the time of the handover of operations of the distribution network,
UEDCL's function has been to monitor the activities of UMEME. UEDCL has staff of fourteen
people and its administration costs are recovered through a lease payment charged to UMEME
which UMEME recovers through the electricity retail tariff. The figure below illustrates the
current industry structure.




2Globeleq purchased ESKOM's shares in UMEME in November 2006.

Electricity Sector Regulatory Framework

175.    The Ministry of Energy and Mineral development (MEMD) oversees Uganda's power
sector. Its key functions include to: (a) provide policy guidance in the development and
exploitation of Uganda's energy and mineral resources; (b) acquire, process and interpret
technical data in order to establish the energy and mineral resource potential of the country;
(c) create an enabling environment in order to attract investment in the development, provision
and utilization of energy and mineral resources; and (d) inspect, regulate, monitor and evaluate
activities of private companies in the energy and mineral sectors so that the resources are
developed, exploited and used on a rational and sustainable basis.

176.    With the approval of the Electricity Act (1999), the legal and administrative framework
for the electricity sector was created to regulate the generation, transmission, distribution, sale,
export and import of electricity in Uganda. Some of the key elements of the Electricity Act are:
        Establishment of ERA as an independent body, specifying its structure, appointment of
        its members, functions, power and administrative duties;
        Creation of an application and implementation procedure for new projects, which is to be
        conducted in an open and public manner, and which allows for both unsolicited proposals
        to be presented to ERA and for ERA to invite applications for a particular license;
        Access to the transmission system to all licensees on a non-discriminatory basis, upon
        payment of the relevant fees and charges as approved by ERA;
        Universal access to the distribution network to all existing and potential users, upon
        payment of the relevant fees and charges as approved by ERA, subject to technical
        constraints;
        Creation of dispute mechanisms; and

        Commitment by the Government to promote and support rural electrification programs,
        including through the creation of a rural electrification fund, which has been established
        and is managed by the MEMD.

The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA)

177.    ERA commenced its functions in April 2000. ERA is composed of five members
(including a Chief Executive Officer) appointed by the MEMD, with the approval of the Cabinet.
ERA members are appointed for 5-year terms and can hold a maximum of two terms. ERA has a
total of twenty five permanent staff, including fifteen professionals.

178.    ERA key functions and responsibilities include the following:
        Issue licenses for generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity; licenses
        shall remain in force for a maximum period of 40 years and cannot be transferred without
        the written consent of ERA;
        Ensure compliance with the licenses issued and the Electricity Act and, in doing so,
        protect the interest of consumers in respect of electricity tariffs, and quality, efficiency,
        continuity and reliability of electricity supply;
        Establish the sector tariff structure, approve electricity tariffs, and investigate tariff
        charges. The methodology for tariff calculation (which should be determined so that it
        covers all reasonable costs and provides a reasonable rate of return) must be approved by
        ERA and stated in the license;
        Develop and enforce performance standards for the electricity sector;
        Provide the procedure for investment programs by the transmission and distribution
        companies;
        Appoint the system operator, which must be also a transmission licensee (currently
        UETCL); and
        Designate a bulk supplier, responsible for the transmission and sale of electricity in bulk
        to distribution and sales companies (currently UETCL), under the terms specified in the
        license issued by ERA.

179.    Although the Electricity Act allows direct funding for ERA from the GOU and
Parliament, ERA has not received any direct government financing, nor does it rely on
borrowings. Its primary funding (around 70% of its revenues) is through annual license fees,
followed by permit fees and funds from development partners, such as IDA and Nordic
Development Agency.

180.    ERA has played an important role in the oversight of the power utilities operating in
Uganda. It has regulated electricity tariffs effectively since 2001. Since early 2005, the power
crisis brought about by dry hydrological conditions in the region has created significant
challenges for the Government, ERA and the power utilities. ERA has implemented substantial
tariff increases in recent months, 37.5% in June 2006 and 41% in November 2006, in order to

ensure the financial viability of the power sector. The power utilities now operate at arm's
length. UMEME has achieved satisfactory operational improvements, although some of the
efficiency gains have been reversed to some extent following the large increases in tariffs.

The Rural Electrification Agency

181.    The Rural Electricity Agency was established in 2003 by the MEMD as a semi-
autonomous agency.        The Rural Electrification Agency is mandated to facilitate the
Government's goal of achieving a rural electrification rate of at least 10% by the year 2012 from
1% at the beginning of this decade. The Rural Electrification Agency derives its revenues from a
5% levy applied on UETCL's bulk energy purchase costs. A Rural Electrification Fund was
created to support the Rural Electrification Agency's activities. The Rural Electrification Fund
was designed to partially subsidize initial capital costs and debt financing and provide financial
incentives for private companies to bring electricity to unserved areas.

182.    The Government's strategy in rural electrification is being supported by IDA through the
implementation (in partnership with Global Environment Fund of the Energy for Rural
Transformation Program (Credit 3588-UG). One of the projects currently benefiting from this
program's efforts is the West Nile Rural Electrification Company, a small off-grid project, which
currently supplies electricity during 18 to 24 hours per day to around 1,500 rural clients in the
West Nile area. The company is constructing a 3.5 MW mini-hydro plant and is currently
operating a 1.5 MW diesel power plant, benefiting from a US$7.5 million subsidy under the IDA
financed Credit 3588-UG.

Ongoing and Planned IDA-supported Power Sector Operations

183.    IDA has been involved in the power sector in Uganda for over 20 years through
development of several projects, beginning in 1980 with emergency repairs to the Owen Falls
Dam ­ now called Nalubaale dam (financed by the United Kingdom) which, along with the
Owen Falls Extension (now called Kiira) is a complex on the Nile River constructed and
extended over a period of about 50 years. Other projects include the Power II Project in 1985 for
the rehabilitation the Owen Falls (Nalubaale) Dam, Power III in 1991 for the construction of the
Owen Falls Extension (Kiira), a Supplemental Credit to Power III in 2000; the Power IV Project
in 2001, which has financed Unit 4 and Unit 5 (each of 40MW) at the Kiira powerhouse, and the
Energy for Rural Transformation Project in 2001, which aims to expand rural access to
electricity.

184.    Ongoing power projects financed by IDA are described below (see Annex 2 for a
complete list of donor supported projects in the Uganda power sector).


    · Power IV Project (Credit 3565-UG): US$62 million IDA credit to commission
        additional capacity (80MW) at Kiira; geothermal investigations (shallow drilling), and
        US$12 million for urgent distribution investments, petroleum reform and capacity
        building.

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                              Annex 1


   · Energy for Rural Transformation Project (Credit 3588-UG): US$46.5 million IDA
       credit which aims to establish the institutional and legal framework for rural
       electrification and a Rural Electrification Fund, to facilitate scale-up of rural access
       which would otherwise not be a commercial proposition. The project supports the
       development of small and medium-scale renewable energy options, including both grid-
       connected and off-grid mini and micro-hydropower, bagasse based cogeneration plants,
       and biomass gasification.

   · Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project (Credit 3411-UG): This project was
       amended to include a PRG guarantee mechanism to provide risk mitigation support to
       UMEME, Uganda's private distribution concessionaire. IDA is providing limited risk
       coverage (up to US$5.5 million) to backstop a Liquidity Facility that could be drawn
       upon in the event of non-payment by the GOU of its electricity bills and because of
       failure of ERA to approve tariff adjustments according to the pre-agreed tariff
       methodology set forth in UMEME's distribution and supply license. MIGA is as well
       involved in that project through a Guarantee that covers a substantial part of the
       concessionaire's investments.

185.   In parallel to this Operation, the World Bank Group is also preparing another power
sector related operation, the Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project. IDA is also supporting
regional power interconnection within the East Africa Community, which would benefit all
countries involved by diversifying supply, reducing investment costs, and increasing electricity
supply.

                             UGANDA: Power Sector Development

A.      Operation Development Objective and Key Indicators

Policy Support Program and Project

186.    The primary objectives of the Operation are to reduce short-term power shortages and
financial imbalances, and facilitate orderly longer-term expansion of electricity service.

187.    In order to achieve these objectives, the Operation comprises: (a) a set of investments and
policy measures designed to reduce the supply-demand gap until the Bujagali hydropower plant
comes into service in 2011; (b) financial support for the Government to absorb a part of the high
costs of short-term thermal power generation; and (c) policy measures aimed at making the
sector financially viable, accelerating rural electrification, and moving towards a sector-wide
approach for sector development.

188.    Key performance indicators for the Operation are:

    · Level of power shortages;
    · Financial viability of key sectoral utilities; and
    · Functioning of the Energy Sector Working Group.

B.      The Operation

Policy Support Program

189.    The proposed Policy Support Program of US$80 million will be disbursed on
effectiveness provided that the agreed conditions of disbursement have been met.

190.    This Operation covers three policy areas, with support from the investments under the
investment Project.

Policy Area 1 ­ Power Shortages

191.    There has been considerable activity on the supply side. On the demand side, while there
have been some activities to support energy efficiency measures, the policy framework for such
activities is weak. The measures to be undertaken as part of this operation are:

        · Preparation of an energy efficiency strategy and plan.

Policy Area 2 ­ Sector Finances

192.    As discussed earlier, thermal power generation and high oil prices have created a
financial crisis in the power sector.

193.    The measures to be undertaken as part of this operation are:


                                                 59

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                                 Annex 4


       · Tariff increases to partially cover the high cost of thermal power;
       · Government will pay the arrears owed to UETCL, and remain current in the future;
       · UETCL will remain current on its payments to generation companies.

Policy Area 3 ­ Longer-term Sector Expansion

194.   While Uganda has already successfully implemented power sector institutional reforms,
there remains a need to improve some aspects of sector governance. First, there is a need to
improve coordination between the Government and development partners, so as to increase aid
effectiveness and harmonization. Second, there is a need to assess the rural electrification
framework and enhance the effectiveness of the related institutions, which would increase the
likelihood of meeting rural electrification targets. Finally, even though the power sector is not the
sole cause of decline in the level of water in Lake Victoria, it is clear that the power sector must
take steps to ensure that sustainable uses of the water are maintained and enhanced.

195.   The measures to be undertaken as part of this operation are:

    · A joint GOU/Development Partners Energy Sector Working Group will be established
       and become functional with a secretariat;
    · Independent evaluation of the Rural Electrification Agency with subsequent legal
       modifications to its statutes by new legislation if required;
    · Monitoring on a daily basis of water abstraction from Lake Victoria for power
       generation, and reporting to EAC of these data, along with the amounts permitted by the
       Agreed curve;
    · Participation in development of Regional and in-country Watershed Management Plan
       related to Lake Victoria

196.   Conditions. The Policy Support Program will be disbursed after the following conditions
are met:

    Power Shortages

    · MEMD has prepared a draft Energy Efficiency Strategy and Plan ;

    Sector Finances

    · Tariff increases to cover part of the high cost of thermal power (already enacted in 2006);
    · GOU to clear all dues to UETCL;
    · UETCL to clear all dues to generation companies.

    Longer-term Sector Development

    · GOU commitment to undertake independent evaluation (under TOR acceptable to the
       Bank) of the rural electrification framework and institutions, in preparation for "scale-up"
       of rural electrification;
    · Agreement to monitor, on a daily basis, the abstraction of Lake Victoria water for power
       generation as well as amounts permitted by Agreed Curve, and report monthly to EAC;

    · Participation, in Lake Victoria watershed management plans discussions (already
        ongoing);
    · Joint GOU/Development Partners Energy Sector Working Group set up with an agreed
        mandate.

Project

197.    Component 1: Thermal Energy. The Project will co-finance capacity and energy or
kWh charges towards thermal power generation costs payable by UETCL for capacity and
energy charges of a new 50MW short-term thermal plant to be installed at Mutundwe, Kampala
(for the entire contract period). This plant will be fuelled by ADO.

198.    Depending on the final allocation of the financing amount, this subcomponent might also
be used for some kWh imports from Kenya.

199.    Component 2: Technical Assistance and Energy Efficiency (EE). The Project will
support the following activities under this component:

    (a) Energy Efficiency (EE) and Demand Side Management (DSM), to be implemented by
        MEMD and focused on creating an implementation framework for a large-scale program.
        This will entail significant sensitization and capacity building within MEMD and the
        consulting community, as well as sensitization of electricity consumers. A "learning by
        doing" approach is planned, whereby MEMD will expand its ongoing energy audit
        program, and high-impact investments identified by the audit, mostly in the public sector,
        will be financed. This will be complemented by a sensitization campaign, which will
        build on the ongoing work under the Bank-supported ERT. The work also will be
        coordinated with efforts under other Bank projects (e.g., Power IV) as well as activities
        funded by other donors (e.g., GTZ). It will be supplemented by the Swedish
        Development Agency (Sida) with an additional amount of SEK45 million (approx.
        US$6.5 million).

        Under this activity, financed by the Bank, the following sub-components will be
        undertaken:

        (i)     Energy Audits and TA ­ This subcomponent will develop a series of targeted
                energy audits encompassing the public facilities and industries (public or private)
                with the highest social impact and electricity savings potential. This effort will
                leverage work already developed (or under development) by MEMD/GTZ (about
                30 audits in the last three years). MEMD has selected a list of about 30-35
                facilities, including government owned buildings, universities and schools,
                hospitals, water and sanitation, some specific industries (e.g., cement, breweries,
                steel, chemicals) and service companies (e.g., hotels). The audits and additional
                engineering support will be performed in three clusters in order to achieve critical
                mass. The clusters will include: (1) hospitals; (2) public buildings, universities,
                schools; and (3) industries and commercial buildings, including hotels.. Within
                each of the clusters there will be an initial study (e.g., Mulago Hospital, Makerere

          University and National Water and Sewerage Company), training and capacity
          building, and subsequently scaling-up.

    (ii)   Investments in EE and DSM. The objective is to make selective investments in
          investments in EE and DSM initiatives. Target candidates and level of
          investments will be fine tuned based on the results of the above energy audits.
          Allocation of resources will include: (1) co-financing (60-100 percent) investment
          in public facilities, encompassing water and sewerage utilities, hospitals, schools
          and universities and government owned and occupied buildings ­ with the
          objectives of reducing the electricity bills in social and government sectors as well
          as improving the quality of service (e.g., lighting) in schools; and (2) co-financing
          (10-20 percent) of selected private industries with high energy savings and/or
          peak demand saving potential, which should also have a positive demonstration
          effect. Empirical evidence in Uganda has shown significant savings potential,
           with typical financial pay-back periods of 12 months for investments in energy
           efficiency. From an economic standpoint, the pay-back is faster, since the short
           run marginal cost of diesel power generation (about US$20-25/MWh, is almost
           twice as much as the average tariff currently charged to those target customers.
           Tentative allocation of resources, to be refined by MEMD, include the following
           elements:

                   Schools and Universities
                   Water and Sewerage Utilities
                   Hospitals and Clinics
                   Public Owned and Occupied Buildings
                   Private Industry and Service Companies
                   Energy Systems in Police Buildings
                   Kampala City Council Street Lighting

     (iii) Studies, Capacity Building and Technical Assistance

           Studies

          · Energy Efficiency Strategy and Implementation Plan. The draft document
               prepared by MEMD would be reviewed and expanded. Some initial
               suggestions to this draft have been provided by the World Bank. Additional
               aspects to be addressed include, inter alia, incentives and tariffs; institutional
               arrangements; role of UETCL as a single buyer; draft of EE and DSM
               legislation (e.g., new Energy Efficiency Law) and regulations; costs, benefits,
               and priorities of EE and DSM measures; ESCO development; identification
               and elimination of barriers for EE; and a detailed implementation plan with
               milestones and responsibilities.

           · Load Management. Support would be provided for the design and
               implementation of measures for improved load management both on the
               supply and on the demand side. On the supply side, the options include
               incentives to cogeneration, distributed generation and possible "merchant"



                                            62

                 plants. Alternative load shedding schemes will be looked at, in order to
                 allocate energy to the most productive uses. On the demand side, options such
                 as load shifting and alternative tariff schemes (e.g., two-part tariff, critical
                 time pricing) should be looked at. Possibilities to pilot alternatives schemes
                 such as self-rationing need to be discussed, including customer surveys,
                 region to be ring-fenced, monitoring and evaluation and detailed design on
                 scale up. A preliminary analysis is being prepared by a consultant, who has
                 identified the pre-requisites to implement a two-part tariff scheme such as the
                 one used in Brazil in 2001. These include reduction in commercial losses and
                 the system's ability to meet peak demand without load shedding. Those
                 conditions are not present now, but the idea of a two-part tariff should be
                 examined when conditions permit, in order to conserve expensive fuel.

             · Institutional and Organizational Arrangements would be put in place to
                 enable the GOU to apply appropriate standards, codes, labeling, and testing
                 activities for energy efficient appliances, equipment, buildings etc, and to
                 provide capacity building, to MEMD, UNBS and other relevant agencies.
                 Support for the drafting and/or refinement of the Energy Efficiency law
                 regarding these issues would also be provided.

             Capacity Building

             · Capacity Development at MEMD. This includes courses, seminars, experts,
                 visits to other EE and DSM institutions, formal training, and enhancement of
                 project management and procurement capability (either mainstreamed at
                 MEMD or by leveraging existing PIUs, such as those for ERT and Power IV).

             · EE and DSM Training. This training would be for industry practitioners,
                 contractors, consultants and other involved parties, to develop local capacity
                 and assist in implementation of the conservation program in Uganda,
                 including training of trainers to help disseminate knowledge of DSM and EE.

             · Support to the Universities to enhance curricula on EE and DSM.

      (iv)   Communication and Educational Campaigns. This activity encompasses design
             and implementation of tailored programs and mass campaigns to convey
             messages on why and how to save energy, including training and dissemination.
             Customer awareness and education about energy savings will be coordinated with
             UMEME. Media and content will be determined as appropriate. This activity will
             also cover the expenses for the communication strategy for the Private Power
             Generation (Bujagali) Project, whose initial costs are being covered by the Fourth
             Power Project.

  (b) Independent Evaluation of the Rural Electrification Program. This program was
      fundamentally restructured as part of the broader sectoral restructuring in the late 1990s.
      The review will focus on lessons learned to date and adjustment of the program as
      required to proceed to the "scale-up" phase (implemented by MEMD).

   (c) Poverty and Social Impact Analysis. This will examine the distributional impacts of
       energy sector policy reforms on the well-being or welfare of various stakeholder groups,
       in particular, poor and vulnerable populations (implemented by MEMD).

   (d) Power Sector Investment Plan (PSIP). In order to address the challenges facing the
       energy sector, GOU has established an Energy Working Group to ensure that there is
       coherence with Uganda's energy sector strategy, priorities, investment programs and
       budgetary allocations to the sector. GOU proposes to undertake a study to prepare a
       Power Sector Investment Plan which will build on the existing generation, transmission,
       and distribution system planning work already undertaken by relevant sector actors, in
       order to: (i) mobilize private investment, maximize the allocation of limited donor
       resources, form strategic public-private partnerships, and effectively use Government
       budgetary resources in a coordinated manner; and (ii) develop a comprehensive
       monitoring and evaluation system in order to assess the impact outcomes of policies,
       investments and other activities in the energy sector. The PSIP will translate the strategic
       sector plans into a series of carefully-costed and actionable projects or activities over a
       period of up to 10-15 years. The PSIP will include clearly stated long-term objectives and
       corresponding measurable and time-bound targets; specific infrastructure outputs;
       estimated investment requirements; an assessment of the policy and institutional reforms
       in the energy sector that will also be needed to reach the objectives; and an assessment of
       country readiness and implementation capacity for significant scale-up efforts, as well as
       proposed actions to remedy any shortcomings. MEMD will undertake this work in
       coordination with UETCL, UMEME, REA, and the Energy Sector Working Group. The
       work will be performed to international standards of analysis and rigor such that the
       resulting plan will be suitable for donor support. This component will include training of
       suitable staff so that the PSIP can be updated in future.

   (e) Lake Victoria Transmission Ring Pre-feasibility and Feasibility Studies. These studies
       will   assess    the   proposed   (Masaka-Uganda)-(Mwanza-Tanzania)        interconnection.
       Depending on the outcome of the feasibility studies, the Project will also finance the
       detailed design and preparation of tender documents, including the required EIA
       (implemented by UETCL).

   (f) Kalagala Offset Tourism Development Plan. This activity supports the Government's
       plan to institute mitigation measures at the Kalagala Itanda site on the Nile River, below
       Bujagali Falls, to offset the loss of the falls when the contemplated dam is constructed.
       This will include revising the 2001 Tourism Development Concept and Plan, and also
       will provide implementation funds.

   (g) Energy Sector Communications Strategy. This activity will support Government's efforts
       to ensure that key information on sectoral strategy and initiatives is made publicly
       available in a timely and effective manner. The program will encompass MEMD's broad
       energy agenda, and will focus on key messages around energy conservation, rural
       electrification, petroleum development, etc.

200.   The EE and DSM initiatives being proposed as part of this project are complementary
and fully aligned with the ongoing efforts being carried out under the ERT Project. The latter has



                                                64

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                                 Annex 4


been focusing on fast-track, high pay-back energy efficient initiatives, by providing efficient
household and street lighting; it also includes a sub-component on power factor correction,
whereby capacitors will be installed at some critical points of the network. Those actions will
enable savings of about 10MW (average) and 40MW during peak hours. The current Project, on
the other hand, focuses on public buildings and large users, with high savings potential. It has a
major component for energy efficiency capacity building in the Ugandan market. Finally, it will
develop some specific programs and methodologies that can be used to mitigate power crises
through better load-shedding or self-rationing schemes.

201.    All these initiatives, whether under ERT or the current project, are meant to be "Win-
Win" interventions, in the sense that they reduce the bill for the customer and benefit the system
as a whole, since the price of energy charged to those customers is about half of the short run
marginal cost (driven by the most expensive diesel fired power plant). In the case of public
facilities that are not able to pay their electricity bills on time, a reduction in consumption helps
to improve the financial position of UMEME because there is less that goes uncollected.

Technical Assistance for Regional Transmission Integration (Total US$2.0 million by IDA)

202.    The study will cover both the pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for the proposed Lake
Victoria transmission ring (Masaka-Uganda)-(Mwanza-Tanzania), and depending on the
outcome of the feasibility study, will also include the detailed design and preparation of tender
documents, including the ESIA.

203.    Low water levels in Lake Victoria have had an impact not only on Uganda's hydropower
production but also on the upstream countries, especially Kenya and Tanzania. A strong regional
electricity grid could have reduced the Uganda's dependency on the hydropower facilities by
providing an alternative source of power in form of imports from either Kenya or Tanzania. This
could also have been cheaper for Uganda considering the associated fuel transportation costs.
The interconnection study will complement other ongoing initiatives under the East African
Community and the Nile Basin Initiative, as outlined below, aimed at regional grid
interconnection. The component will also contribute towards the African Action Plan objective
of regional infrastructure development and integration.

204.    In an effort to widen and deepen regional economic and political cooperation, the
governments of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda signed in 2000 a treaty re-establishing the East
African Community (EAC). Article 101 of the treaty (East African Community 2000) states that
the Partner States shall in particular promote within the community:

    (a) The least cost development and transmission of electric power, efficient exploration and
        exploitation of fossil fuels and utilization of new and renewable energy sources;
    (b) The joint planning, training and research in, and the exchange of information on the
        exploitation, development and utilization of available energy resources;
    (c) The development of integrated policy on rural electrification;
    (d) The development of Inter-Partner State electrical grid interconnections; and
    (e) The construction of oil and gas pipelines.

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                               Annex 4


205.    The East African Master Plan Study, completed in 2005, had the overall objective of
determining whether further interconnection of the power systems of Uganda, Kenya and
Tanzania is technically feasible and economically viable as growth in demand occurs over the
next 20 years. The interconnection infrastructure will form an integral part of a Regional Power
Master Plan aiming for a mutually beneficial development of the three Partner States' power
systems. Other objectives include:

    (a) Preparation of a least cost expansion plan for the region taking into account
        interconnections;
    (b) Determination of relative merits of interconnection options (the mutual benefits that
        accrue from such a development); and
    (c) Determination of the costs associated with an interconnection together with the definition
        of mitigative measures with respect to any environmental issues.

206.    The Study presents details of the generation and transmission system expansion planning
for the region, provides the results of the economic analysis indicating the possible benefits that
could be obtained by increasing the interchanges of electricity amongst Partner States, outlines
the investment costs necessary to implement the recommended system expansion plan, and
provides risk analysis and long run marginal costs as well as plan justification. When the Plan is
implemented the people of East Africa will be assured of sufficient and reliable power supply to
a greater extent, at reasonably affordable tariffs.

207.    The main infrastructure features of the Plan include the creation of the East African
Power Grid through interconnection of national Grids. An East African Power Pool will also be
established, meaning that there will be an automatic sharing of power generation, distribution
and management of power trade and technical functions.

208.    The Study recommends an integrated generation expansion sequence, with Kenya
importing Tanzania's gas generated electricity and Uganda's hydro generation. The Study also
makes the following conclusions in favour of an integrated planning scenario:

    (a) A full integration of the power sector makes sound economic sense;
    (b) Has a net present value benefit estimated at US$500 million compared to each country
        developing its own resources;
    (c) Facilitates development of large scale, least cost, renewable hydro;
    (d) Increases usage of indigenous resources, particularly natural gas, and promotes more
        exploration throughout East Africa;
    (e) Takes advantage of hydro complementarity, reduces hydrology risk and increases energy
        output;
    (f) Reduces dependence on imported hydrocarbons;
    (g) Is cost effective and Kyoto friendly; and
    (h) Is a good foundation for economic partnerships among EAC States.

209.    The Permanent Secretaries responsible for Energy Affairs met on February 4, 2005 to
review the Study outcome and determine the way forward. Among the recommendations of the
Permanent Secretaries were: (a) to fast track implementation of the Arusha-Nairobi and Jinja-
Lessos 220 kV transmission lines; and (b) to consider the transmission ring around Lake Victoria

in the medium term, in order to supply loads in the Kagera Region and increase reliability of the
network in the lake zone. These recommendations were approved by 10th Council of Minister's
meeting, which met in August 2005.

210.    To support the proposed regional integration as adopted by the EAC Council of
Ministers, the African Development Bank, under the Nile Basin Initiative, is financing the
feasibility study of recommendation (a) above (Jinja, Uganda)-Lessos, Kenya) while the project
will support the studies related to (b) (Uganda-Tanzania).

211.    This is a policy based lending component, and is therefore not directly "implemented."
However, a number of actions will be needed to fulfill the release conditions for the two tranches
of the component. MEMD has responsibility for ensuring that these conditions are fulfilled. This
will require close coordination with MOFED, UETCL, DWD, and other actors such as the
Energy Sector Working Group.

Project

212.    This will be implemented in two parts, according to the mandates and responsibilities of
the sectoral structure which Uganda has adopted. Specifically, UETCL, as the sole-purchaser of
electricity in Uganda, is responsible for entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with
generation entities, including the short-term power plant that is the focus of this project. Thus,
UETCL will implement Component 1 (Thermal Energy) in its entirety. UETCL's existing
structure already includes a Thermal Power Project Manager. This Project Manager is
responsible for leading the procurement process, with participation from MEMD and ERA. The
Project Manager and his team monitor performance of power suppliers under the PPAs,
including power quality and quantum of power delivered per billing period. The Project Manager
also initiates payments, which are processed through UETCL's existing accounting and financial
management structures.

213.    MEMD will undertake the Sector Investment Plan. This work will also be done in
coordination with UETCL, UMEME, REA, and the Energy Sector Working Group. The plan is
expected to be suitable for donor support.

214.    UETCL will be responsible for the regional integration study under Component 2. The
interconnection study is designed as an integral element of the broader East African Power Pool
(EAPP) planning process. For this reason, the UETCL Planning unit will coordinate this study
with other planned and ongoing work towards realization of the EAPP.

215.    In keeping with its mandate to promote energy sector policy, MEMD will implement the
Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management elements of Component 2 of the project. This
is a natural extension and deepening of work that MEMD has undertaken over the past ten years.
This work will be undertaken under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner for Energy
Efficiency. MEMD will recruit additional staff as needed to ensure satisfactory project
performance.

216.    MEMD also has the mandate for broader sectoral oversight, and will therefore take
responsibility for the review of the rural electrification program, and other TA. The Ministry of

Fiduciary Aspects

217.     Foreign Exchange System. The safeguards assessment of the Bank of Uganda (BoU),
which was completed by the IMF on April 13, 2003, identified several strengths of the BoU, in
particular with regard to external and internal audit. Vulnerabilities were noted: (a) delays in
completion of the financial statements; (b) internal and external audit findings not reported to the
Board; and (c) non-existence of an audit committee. The BoU authorities have been
implementing measures proposed in the safeguards assessment to address these key weaknesses.
An Audit Committee (of the Board) has been appointed and procedures have been put in place to
ensure that both internal and external audit findings/recommendations, as well as follow-up
actions taken, are appropriately communicated to the Governor and the Audit Committee of the
Board.

218.     Budget Resource Management System. The 2006 PFM performance report, based on the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) measurement framework covering the
period 2002/2003­2004/2005, notes marked improvements in the reporting of financial
information in Uganda. It describes improvements achieved in transparency and availability of
actual expenditure data, quality and timeliness of annual financial reports, and periodic
reconciliation. Progress is also noted on the Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA,
2004) action plan, particularly the rollout of the Integrated Financial Management System
(IFMS), and activities under the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Authority (PPDA).
Risk associated with lack of clear rules and regulations has been reduced through appropriate
legislation and regulatory frameworks.1 Over the years, fiduciary risks related to poor budget
formulation and budget preparation processes have been reduced and progress will continue to
be guided by the Public Expenditure Management Committee (PEMCOM) to coordinate PFM
reforms now encapsulated in the Financial Management and Accountability Program (FINMAP).
The Government Financial Statements are now being prepared in accordance with the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) framework. The timeliness and
completeness of reporting has improved while training and capacity building for staff in central
and local governments both at technical and professional levels has continued and has seen a
significant increase in the number of professionally qualified staff. The Auditor General has been
provided access to the accounts on classified expenditures since FY2004.

Disbursement and Auditing

219.    The Credit amount is proposed to be disbursed immediately upon effectiveness; it will
follow IDA's simplified disbursement procedures for development policy lending and will be
disbursed against meeting conditions agreed with Government and not tied to any specific
purchases or subject to procurement requirements. Once the Credit becomes effective and agreed
conditions are met, IDA will disburse the proceeds into an account designated by GOU that is
part of the country's foreign exchange reserves accounts, acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower
shall ensure that upon deposit of the credit into the said account, the foreign exchange amount
will immediately be converted to Uganda shillings and credited to the Uganda Government
Consolidated Fund Account, to be used subsequently for budgeted public expenditures activities
of MEMD. The Borrower will acknowledge receipt to IDA of the amount deposited in the
foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the Consolidated Fund Account. If,
after deposit in the foreign reserve account, the proceeds of the credit or any part thereof are used
for ineligible purposes, (i.e., to finance goods or services on the standard negative list) as defined
in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to either: (a) return that amount to
the foreign reserve account for use for eligible purposes; or (b) refund the amount directly to
IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this
Credit will be the responsibility of the MEMD in liaison with the Ministry of Finance.

220.    The following summarizes the fiduciary assurance requirements for receipt of the Credit:

    (a) Foreign Reserve Account. The GOU will acknowledge receipt to IDA of the money into
        the foreign reserve account and crediting of this amount in local currency to the GOU
        Consolidated Fund Account. While no audit is required, it is expected that confirmation
        of receipt will be signed off by both the Accountant General and the Auditor General.
        IDA reserves the right to request an audit of the account as provided for in the financing
        agreement;

    (b) Public (Government) Accounts. The Auditor General is required by law to produce
        his/her annual report to Parliament on the public accounts within nine months of the
        financial year-end. IDA will have access to those accounts; and

    (c) Bank of Uganda. The annual entity financial statements of the Bank of Uganda, audited
        in accordance with international auditing standards as promulgated by the International
        Federation of Accountants, are publicly available.

Country Issues

221.    In recent years, there have been significant improvements in public sector accounting and
reporting in Uganda. Most notably, for more than five years, the annual public accounts of
Government have been produced within the statutory period of four months after the end of the
financial year, and the audits have been conducted in a timely manner.

222.   IDA's 2004 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) shows that the GOU
made substantial progress in improving its Public Financial Management systems since the
previous CFAA, which took place in 2001. The fiduciary risks associated with poor budget
formulation and budget preparation processes have reduced. In terms of appropriate legislation
and regulatory frameworks, significant progress has been made to ensure that the risks associated
with lack of clear rules and regulations have been reduced. Further, more useful information is
provided in the annual accounts. However, it is recognized however that the process of
implementing new rules and ways of working does take time, and does require changes in
attitude, continued capacity building and widespread demand for greater accountability.

223.   Risks remain in terms of:

    · Enforcement of procurement and payroll rules and procedures;
    · Completeness of data on debt;
    · Effective independent oversight, and
    · Timeliness and effectiveness of legislative and public scrutiny.

224.   In addition, the appropriate legislative framework for integrity is still being developed.
There remain significant legal, institutional and capacity constraints on the ability of the integrity
bodies (IGG, DEI, Police, DPP) to carry out their various functions including public education,
detection, investigation and prosecution of offenders.

225.   With the support of a number of donor assisted initiatives, the Government is seeking to
rapidly enhance the financial accountability framework in order to: (a) mitigate fiduciary risk in
public expenditure management; (b) achieve economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of
public funds; (c) enhance transparency and accountability; (d) enhance staff capacity in public
financial management; and (e) establish an appropriate enabling environment for private sector
development and regulation. These initiatives and reforms have been supported and strengthened
through the Bank's Poverty Reduction Support Credit programs.

Project Risk Assessment and Mitigation

226.   The objectives of the Project's financial management system are to:

    · Ensure that funds are used only for their intended purposes in an efficient and economical
       way;
    · Ensure that funds are properly managed and flow smoothly, adequately, regularly and
       predictably;
    · Enable the preparation of accurate and timely financial reports;
    · Enable project management to monitor the efficient implementation of the Project; and
    · Safeguard the Project assets and resources.

227.   Furthermore, the following are necessary features of a strong financial management
system:

   · MEMD and UETCL should have an adequate number and mix of skilled and experienced
        staff;
   · The internal control system should ensure the conduct of an orderly and efficient
        payment and procurement process, and proper recording and safeguarding of assets and
        resources;
   · The accounting system should support the Project's requests for funding and meet its
        reporting obligations to fund providers, including Government of Uganda, IDA, other
        donors, and local communities;
   · The system should be capable of providing financial data to measure performance linked
        to the output of the Project; and
   · An independent, qualified auditor should be appointed to review the Project's financial
        statements and internal controls.

228.    The table below shows the Risk Rating Summary for MEMD and UETCL. The Risk
Rating Summary identifies the key risks that Project management may face in achieving Project
objectives, and provides a basis for determining how management should mitigate these risks.

Inherent Risks

Country Level         M      Government of Uganda (GOU) has developed a Financial Management

                             the entity is managing. These areas are the use of accounting software to
                             ensure accounts are up to date and ensuring the Internal Auditor of the
                             Ministry carries out the function of reviewing the internal control systems
                             and monitoring how the risk areas are addressed by management.

Country Level   M          GOU has developed a Financial Management and Accountability Program
                           that is intended to improve its public financial management performance.
Entity Level    M          UETCL is facing cash flow difficulties having made a loss of US$ 37
                           million in 2005. This will be mitigated by ensuring that a clause is inserted
                           in the Project Agreement that will ensure UETCL remains financial sound
                           through out the project's life such that its net revenues for each fiscal year
                           are at least equal to the sum of its debt service requirements, working
                           capital requirements, dividends (if any), and a proportion of investments
                           that require funding from UETCL's internal resources. This should be
                           possible given that UETCL's targeted profitability is US$ 23 million by
                           2011.

Strengths and Weaknesses of the Financial Management System

230.   The Project financial management is strengthened by the following features:

   · MEMD and UETCL have adequately qualified and experienced accounting personnel,
       most of whom have been trained in World Bank Financial Management and
       Disbursement Guidelines;
   · MEMD and UETCL have budgeting arrangements in place but MEMD has to improve its
       monitoring of its budget, so that variances between actual and budgeted amounts are
       explained, and steps are undertaken to correct adverse variances;
   · External auditing arrangements for both MEMD and UETCL are adequate;
   · MEMD and UETCL both have an Internal Audit unit that has qualified and experienced
       Internal Auditors but experience has shown that they do not get involved in reviewing the
       internal control systems of the project. Hence there will be a need to ensure that the
       Internal Audit units in both MEMD and UETCL carry out this function;
   · Funds flow arrangements are adequate for both MEMD and UETCL;
   · Financial Reporting requirements are adequate for both MEMD and UETCL but
       management needs to ensure that the financial reports are submitted to the Bank in time,
       and Financial Monitoring Report formats are prepared and agreed with the Bank before
       negotiations;
   · MEMD and UETCL both have adequate accounting software but MEMD needs to ensure
       the accounting staff improve on the usage of the accounting software; and
   · MEMD and UETCL have Financial Management Manuals that are sufficient for the
       Project.

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

231.   MEMD and UETCL will be responsible for the overall implementation of the Project.
MEMD and UETCL are also currently jointly implementing the Fourth Power Project; MEMD is
also implementing the Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project.

232.   During Project implementation, MEMD and UETCL will coordinate and manage:

   · Procurement, including purchases of goods, works, and consulting services;
   · Project monitoring, reporting and evaluation;
   · Contractual relationships with IDA and other co-financiers; and
   · Financial management and record keeping, accounts and disbursements.

 Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                              Annex 7


233.    MEMD and UETCL will also constitute the operational link to IDA and the GOU on
matters related to the implementation of the Project.

234.    The Permanent Secretary (PS), MEMD, will be the "Accounting Officer" for the Project,
assuming the overall responsibility for accounting for Project funds. The Managing Director,
UETCL, will report to the Accounting Officer on matters related to accountability for Project
funds that UETCL will manage.

Budgeting Arrangements

235.    The budgeting arrangements of UETCL are adequately defined in its Financial Policies
and Procedures Manual, which will be adopted for the Project. However, the budgeting
arrangements of MEMD concerning the Project are not defined in the Treasury Accounting
Instructions, 2003 and will therefore need to be included in an addendum to the instructions. The
budgets of UETCL and MEMD in relation to the Project will have to be approved by the steering
committee overseeing the operations of the Project. The capacity of the accounting staff to fulfill
budgeting needs of the Project is adequate, and MEMD's and UETCL's accounting software can
adequately cater for the budgeting arrangements of the Project.

Accounting Arrangements

Books of Accounts and List of Accounting Codes

236.    MEMD and UETCL will maintain books of accounts similar to those for other IDA
funded projects. The books of accounts to be maintained specifically for the Project should be set
up and should include: a Cash Book, ledgers, journal vouchers, fixed asset register and a
contracts register.

237.    The books of accounts will be maintained on a computerized system. A list of account
codes (Chart of Accounts) for the Project should be drawn up. This should match with the
classification of expenditures and sources and application of funds indicated in the Financing
Agreement. The Chart of Accounts should be developed in a way that allows Project costs to be
directly related to specific work activities and outputs of the Project.

238.    Books of Accounts to be used for the Project will be opened and a Chart of Accounts will
be completed in accordance with the requirement in the Financing Agreement of the Project of
maintaining books of accounts for the Project.

Staffing Arrangements

239.    MEMD and UETCL have adequate staff to account for the funds of the project. MEMD
has an accounting unit headed by the Project Accountant, who will be responsible for
maintaining the Books of Accounts and records of the Project component funds. The Project
Accountant will be assisted by an Accountant. UETCL has an accounting unit headed by the
Manager Finance, Accounts & Sales, who will be responsible for maintaining the Books of
Accounts and records of the Project component funds.

240.   Most of the accounting staff dealing with this project in MEMD and UETCL has been
trained in World Bank Financial Management and Disbursement Guidelines. The staff will be
advised of any further training requirements as the need arises.

241.   In order to ensure that the Project is effectively implemented, MEMD and UETCL will
have to ensure that appropriate staffing arrangements are maintained throughout the life of the
Project.

Information Systems

242.   MEMD and UETCL have an adequate information system to account for the the Project
funds. MEMD uses Solomon's accounting software while UETCL uses Sun Systems accounting
software. While the UETCL staff has the skills to use the software to produce the Project's
accounts, MEMD staff need to improve their ability to use their software.

that will be used for the Project are documented in the Financial Management Manuals of
UETCL and MEMD prepared specifically for the Project, which will supplement the existing
manuals used by the entities. Those existing manuals are the Financial Policies and Procedures
Manual for UETCL and the Treasury Accounting Instructions, 2003 for MEMD, which comply
with the Public Finance and Accountability Act, 2003 of Uganda. The manuals prepared for the
Project are living documents that can be updated to strengthen the internal control system when
the need arises.

244.   The manuals should describe:

    · The accounting system which includes the major transaction cycles of the project;
    · Funds flow processes;
    · The accounting records, supporting documents, computer files and specific accounts in
       the financial statements involved in the processing of transactions;
    · The list of accounting codes used to group transactions (chart of accounts);
    · The accounting processes from the initiation of a transaction to its inclusion in the
       financial statements;
    · Authorization procedures for transactions;
    · The financial reporting process used to prepare the financial statements and financial
       monitoring reports, including significant accounting estimates and disclosures;
    · Financial and accounting policies for the project;
    · Budgeting procedures;
    · Financial forecasting procedures;
    · Procurement and contract administration monitoring procedures;
    · Procedures undertaken for the replenishment of the Special Account; and
    · Auditing arrangements.

Internal Audit

245.   While internal audit arrangements in MEMD and UETCL are adequate, staff did not get
involved in carrying out internal audit reviews of the Fourth Power Project. Based on this
experience, they need to improve in this area in regard to the present Project. MEMD and
UETCL both have qualified and experienced Internal Auditors. In addition, UETCL has an Audit
Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Board of Directors. The Manager, Internal Audit
and Security reports to this sub-committee, which provides a level of independence to the
internal audit function in this company. An audit committee in MEMD will eventually be put in
place.

246.   MEMD has one Internal Auditor for the whole ministry while UETCL has a department
headed by the Manager, Internal Audit and Security, who manages eleven staff members, six in
the internal audit section and five in the security section. The internal audit section has one
principal internal auditor, three senior internal auditors and two audit assistants. The security
section, which mainly deals with investigations, has one principal security officer, two senior
security officers, one junior security officer and one clerk.

Funds Flow Arrangements

Bank Accounts

247.   The following bank accounts will each be maintained by MEMD and UETCL for this
project:

   · Special Account: Denominated in US dollars. Disbursements from the IDA Credit will be
       deposited on this account; and
   · Project Account: Denominated in local currency. Transfers from the Special Account (for
       payment of transactions in local currency) will be deposited in this account.

248.   These bank accounts shall be opened at Bank of Uganda (BoU) in accordance with the
additional instructions included in the operation Letter of Disbursement. Initial cash flow
forecasts upon which the advance disbursement will be made from the IDA Credit should also be
prepared by the date of opening the accounts.

249.   The account signatories will have to be documented in the addendum to the Financial
Management Manuals of MEMD and UETCL.

Flow of Funds

250.   Funds flow arrangements for the project through the two above bank accounts are:

   · MEMD and UETCL will each prepare a six monthly cash flow forecast based on the
       work plans for the components they are handling and submit a quarterly Withdrawal
       Application under the Financial Monitoring Report (FMR) method of disbursement to
       IDA within 45 days after the end of the quarter.
   · IDA will make an advance disbursement from the proceeds of the Credit based on the
       cash flow forecast by depositing into Special Accounts of MEMD and UETCL.


                                                 79

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                             Annex 7


   · All expenditures will be paid from MEMD and UETCL head offices in accordance with
       the approval mechanisms documented in their Financial Management Manuals.
251.   The following flow chart shows the funds flow arrangements for MEMD and UETCL
during the implementation of the project.

              Project transactions paid in either US$ or local currency




Disbursement Arrangements

252.   MEMD and UETCL have effective financial management and accounting systems, which
will facilitate the introduction of Financial Monitoring Report (FMR)-based disbursements. The
FMRs will be submitted for disbursement on a quarterly basis. In compliance with FMR
guidelines, each of the Project's implementing units will: (a) sustain a satisfactory financial
management rating during Project supervision; (b) submit FMRs consistent with the agreed form
and content within 45 days of the end of each reporting period, and (c) submit a Project audit
report by the due date.

253.   Within six months after meeting all conditions for disbursement, MEMD and UETCL
will be expected to submit their six months cash flow forecasts, using the FMR method of
disbursement, to IDA for disbursement. IDA will then deposit funds into the Special Accounts of
MEMD and UETCL and these funds will be used by the Borrower to finance IDA's share of
program expenditures under the proposed Credit.

254.   Replenishment of funds from IDA to the Special Account will be made upon receipt of
the quarterly FMRs, which will contain the 6 monthly cash flow forecast for the subsequent
period. If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the Special Accounts, the
Borrower will be obligated to refund the same. If the Special Accounts remain inactive for more

than six months, the Borrower may be requested to refund to IDA amounts advanced to these
accounts.

255.   IDA will have the right, as reflected in the Financing Agreement, to suspend
disbursement of the funds if reporting requirements are not complied with.

Financial Reporting Arrangements

256.   Formats of the various periodic financial monitoring reports to be generated from the
financial management system will be developed. There will be clear linkages between the
information in these reports and the Chart of Accounts. The financial reports will be designed to
provide quality and timely information to the Project management, implementing agencies, and
various stakeholders monitoring the Project's performance.

257.   The following quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) will be produced by
MEMD and UETCL:

    · Financial Reports:
       o Sources and Uses of Funds;
       o Uses of Funds by Project Activity/Component;
    · Physical Progress (Output Monitoring) Report; and
    · Procurement Report on prior review contracts.

258.   The formats for the FMRs have been defined and agreed, and the Project teams have
demonstrated their capability to produce the FMRs to the Country Financial Management
Specialist.

259.   MEMD and UETCL are eligible to use the report-based disbursement method, provided
that during Project implementation, they both: (a) sustain satisfactory financial management
ratings; (b) submit FMRs consistent with the agreed form and content as explained below; and
(c) submit Project audit reports by the due dates. In order to support report-based disbursement,
each implementing unit is required to submit to the Bank the following information:

    · Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs);
    · Special Account Activity Statements;
    · Special Account Bank Statements;
    · Summary Statement of Special Account Expenditures for Contracts subject to Prior
       Review; and
    · Summary Statement of Special Account Expenditures not subject to Prior Review.

260.   In addition to the quarterly FMRs, MEMD and UETCL will produce, for analytical and
audit purposes, annual financial statements for their components. UETCL will also produce its
annual entity accounts that will be audited and submitted to the Bank within six months after the
year-end.

261.   The financial statements should be prepared in accordance with International Public
Sector Accounting Standards, which, inter alia, includes the application of the cash basis of



                                               81

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                                   Annex 7


recognition of transactions. The IDA Credit Agreement will require the submission of audited
financial statements for the Project to the Bank within six months after the year-end by both
MEMD and UETCL.

262.    The Project Financial Statements will be comprised of:

    (a) A Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds / Cash Receipts and Payments, which
        recognizes all cash receipts, cash payments and cash balances controlled by the entity;
        and separately identifies payments by third parties on behalf of the entity.

    (b) The Accounting Policies Adopted and Explanatory Notes. The explanatory notes should
        be presented in a systematic manner with items on the Statement of Cash Receipts and
        Payments being cross-referenced to any related information in the notes. Examples of this
        information include a summary of fixed assets by category of assets, and a summary of
        SOE Withdrawal Schedule, listing individual withdrawal applications; and

    (c) A Management Assertion that Bank funds have been expended in accordance with the
        intended purposes as specified in the relevant World Bank legal agreement.

263.    Indicative formats of these statements will be developed in accordance with IDA
requirements and agreed with the Country Financial Management Specialist.

Auditing

264.    The Auditor General is primarily responsible for the auditing of all government projects.
If the audit is subcontracted to a firm of private auditors, with the final report being issued by the
Auditor General, IDA funds may be used to pay the cost of the audit. The audits should be done
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.

265.    The audit report for the Project must be submitted to IDA within six months after the end
of each financial year. In addition, UETCL's entity audited accounts should also be submitted to
IDA within six months after the end of each financial year. Any firm of auditors subcontracted to
carry out the audit should meet IDA's requirements in terms of independence, qualifications and
experience.

266.    MEMD and UETCL have managed a number of IDA projects and none of the projects
has an outstanding audit report. No significant issues have been raised in the most recent project
audit reports managed by MEMD and UETCL.

267.    The arrangements for the external audit of the financial statements of the project should
be communicated to IDA through agreed terms of reference. Appropriate terms of reference for
the external auditor must also be developed, agreed with IDA and external auditor appointed
within six months of Credit effectiveness.

268.    GOU does not have a policy that allows public disclosure of audit findings but Article 41
(1) of the Constitution of Uganda allows the public to access this information. The Access to
Information Bill, No. 7 of 2004 has been drafted to complement the clause in the constitution and
is currently with Parliament. Under the Press and Journalist Act, the media also has access to


                                                 82

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                                Annex 7


information such as audit findings. In addition, the public is allowed to attend the Public
Accounts Committee of Parliament when it is addressing audit issues.

269.    The audit reports that will be required to be submitted by the Project and the due dates for
submission are shown below.

                       Table 17: Required Audit Reports and Due Dates

Conclusion of the Assessment

270.    The project's financial management arrangements satisfy the Bank's minimum
requirements under OP/BP10.02. However, some improvements are needed for the system to
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the Project,
as required by IDA. The recommended improvements are detailed in the Financial Management
Action Plan.

Supervision Plan

271.    A supervision mission will be conducted at least once every year, based on the risk
assessment of the Project. The mission's objectives will include that of ensuring that strong
financial management systems are maintained for the Project throughout its life. A review will
be carried out regularly to ensure that expenditures incurred by the Project remain eligible for
IDA funding. The Implementation Status Report (ISR) will include a financial management
rating for the component. This will be arrived at by the Country Office Senior Financial
Management Specialist after an appropriate review.

A. General

272.   Procurement Environment. In Uganda, all procurements utilizing public funds are
governed by the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act, 2003 (the Procurement
Act). The Act, which is based on the UNCITRAL model law, came into effect on January 17,
2003 and established a regulatory body, the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets
Authority (PPDA). The regulations accompanying the Act were made in September 2003 to
apply to all public procurement and disposal activities of ministries, including defense,
departments and agencies of government. PPDA has issued guidelines and forms for use by
Procuring and Disposing Entities (PDEs) and on July 1, 2005, it published standard bidding
documents which are available on its website.

273.   The 2004 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) indicates that the
Procurement Act is a good law, thus far, but highlights a few issues with the law and regulations.
These include:

   (a) The need for harmonization of the procurement systems and practices at the local
       government level with those at the central government level. To resolve the
       harmonization issue, the Local Government (Amendment) Act, 2006 was enacted in
       February 2006, and regulations for local government procurement and disposal of public
       assets have been made;

   (b) The provision for negotiations with the best evaluated bidder, which can be open to
       abuse. It is necessary to negotiate a contract: (i) with selected consultants; and (ii) when
       directly contracting a supplier or contractor, but the procurement regulations are not
       specific on these aspects;

   (c) The lack of restriction on use of the merit point system of evaluation for selection of
       consultants. This evaluation system is widely abused in the evaluation of applicants for
       prequalification and in the evaluation of supply and works contracts to make biased
       decisions;

   (d) The provision for pre-qualifying providers on an annual basis which is used to register
       businesses for purposes of soliciting for quotations. This provision is abused by the
       procuring entities not opening bidding opportunities to all the "pre-qualified" providers;
       and

   (e) The need for an appeals body. This has been marginally addressed through an informal
       arrangement whereby cases against the PPDA, or in which the PPDA had provided
       advice, can be taken to the Inspector General of the Government who should appoint
       experts to assist in their investigation and resolution.

274.    Procurement Guidelines. Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" dated May 2004 (revised in October 2006); "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 (revised in October 2006); and the
provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. For each contract to be financed by the Credit, the
different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification,
estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame have been agreed between the
Borrower and the Bank and are outlined in the Procurement Plan. A summary of these is
presented below.

275.    Standard Bid Documents and Manuals. The Bank's Standard Bidding documents (SBD)
will be used for all tenders for procurement of goods under International Competitive Bidding
(ICB). Domestic preference would be used under ICB in accordance with Clause 2.55 and
Appendix 2 of the Bank's Guidelines.

276.    The Bank's SBDs will be used for all ICB and national bidding documents agreed with or
satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts which meet the requirements of paragraph 3.13 and 3.16 of
the Procurement Guidelines may be procured using Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT).

277.    The national standard bidding documents for procurement of goods using National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be reviewed to ensure that they are generally consistent with
the Bank's Guidelines and procedures prior to clearance by the Bank. At least the first two such
bidding documents prepared using the national standard bidding documents will be subject to
IDA prior review. The standard documents for the procurement of goods can be used provided
that: (a) the standard documents are used for NCB without pre-qualification only as they do not
incorporate clear provisions on the pre-qualification of bidders; (b) margin of preference is not
applicable; (c) bidders are given a minimum of 30 days to submit bids from the date of
availability of the bidding documents; and (d) the document is revised as per the comments
provided by the Bank. The user guidelines for the SBDs needs substantial revision and are not
considered acceptable for project use. Detailed comments on the SBDs will have to be provided
to make the documents fully consistent with the Bank's Guidelines. The revised document
incorporating the comments will be presented to the Bank before Board Presentation. In the case
of consulting services, the Bank's Standard Request for Proposal (SRFP) and standard time-
based and lump-sum contracts will be used for all assignments involving international
competition. The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as
well as model contracts for goods to be procured, will be highlighted in the Project
Implementation Manual (PIM).

278.    Procurement of Works. The SIDA Component of the project will finance energy
efficiency renovations, improvement, and replacements for the following: (i) Mula hospital; (ii)
20 rural referral hospitals; (iii) NWSC; (iii) 20 public buildings; (iv) three universities; and (v)
40 public schools. The value of the individual works contracts shall be estimated to cost
US$1,500,000 and may be procured using ICB method of procurement in accordance with the
procurement plan.

279.    The IDA Component of the project will finance energy efficiency renovations,
improvement and replacements for the following: (i) industries and hotels; (ii) ten police



                                                85

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                                 Annex 8


buildings; 80 public schools and colleges; and (iv) public buildings. The value of the individual
works contracts shall be estimated to cost US$1,700,000 and may be procured using ICB method
of procurement in accordance with the procurement plan.

280.   Procurement of Goods. (See Component 1 below)The project will finance capacity and
energy charges of a new 50 MW leased thermal plant to be awarded on the basis of ICB and two
project vehicles to be awarded on the basis of NCB, following procedures that are consistent
with the Bank's Guidelines, and office equipment to be awarded on the basis of Shopping to be
used for small value contracts in accordance with the procurement plan.

281.   Procurement of Non-consulting Services. Procurement of non-consulting services will
follow procurement procedures similar to those stipulated for the procurement of goods,
depending on their nature. The applicable methods shall include NCB and Shopping.

282.   Selection of Consultants. The SIDA Component of consultancy services to be provided
under the project would include: detailed energy audits (i) in Mulago hospital and 20 referral
hospitals; (ii) at the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC); (iii) in six universities
and 20 public buildings; (iv) 10 public schools and colleges; and (v) in industries and hotels.

283.   The IDA Component of consultancy services to be provided under the project would
include: (i) drafting the energy efficiency policy; (ii) drafting the energy conservation Act; (iii)
other energy rationalization alternatives; (iv) communication and education; (v) detailed audits in
ten police buildings; and (vi) detailed energy audits in 110 schools and colleges. The preferred
method of selection for consultant services would be the Quality and Cost Based Selection
(QCBS) method. Services for audit and other similar services may be procured under contracts
awarded using the Least Cost Selection method in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 3.1
and 3.6 of the Consultant Guidelines. Consulting assignments costing less than US$100,000 may
be procured by using Selection Based on Consultants Qualifications (CQS). Services for tasks
that meet the requirements of paragraphs 3.8 to 3.11 of the Consultants' Guidelines may be
awarded using the Single Source Selection method. Services for which a team of Consultants are
not required and meet all the requirements set forth in paragraph 5.01 of the Consultant would be
procured under contracts awarded to individual consultants in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph 5.1 through 5.3 of the Consultants Guidelines. Short lists of consultants for services
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of
national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant
Guidelines.

284.   Capacity Building and Training to be financed by IDA. These activities will cover energy
sector institutions associated with the project components. Overall strategy focuses on
conducting training, and support for training activities through seminars, workshops and training
in the region and abroad based on individual needs as well as group requirements. All training
and workshops will be carried out on the basis of programs, which shall have been approved by
the Bank on an annual basis, and which shall, inter alia, identify: (a) the training and workshops
envisaged; (b) the personnel to be trained; (c) the institutions which will conduct the training; (d)
the duration of the proposed training; The detailed annual training program outline categories of
training, number of trainees, duration of training, staff months, timing and estimated cost.

285.    Investment Support ­ Component 1: Thermal Energy. The project will co-finance
capacity and energy or kWh charges towards thermal power generation costs payable by UETCL
for the power output of a new 50 MW short-term thermal plant to be installed at Mutundwe,
Kampala (for the entire contract period). This plant will be fuelled by ADO. In anticipation of
this Credit, the Government initiated the ICB procurement process for this thermal power plant.
Bids have been received and evaluated. As of the end of March 2007, pre-contract discussions
are ongoing. A request for IDA's "No-Objection" on the final contract is anticipated prior to
Board presentation.

286.    Operating Costs. Expenditures made for operational costs such as salary, fuel and
stationery will follow Ugandan Government practices in line with the Public Procurement
Directives or, whenever these Directives do not apply, commercial practices commonly used for
the same.

B. Assessment of UETCL and MEMD capacity to Undertake Procurement

287.    Procurement activities will be carried out by mainstream UETCL and MEMD staff.
UETCL will implement the thermal and regional integration components while MEMD will
implement the Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management component.

288.    An assessment of the capacity of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development
(MEMD), and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (UETCL) to implement
procurement actions for the project has been carried out by Richard Olowo, Bank's Procurement
Specialist between May and July 2006. During the September 2006 mission, an updated
procurement capacity assessment of the UETCL and MEMD were carried out by Helen Kofi, the
Bank's Procurement Accredited Staff assigned to the project. The assessment included the
organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the project's
staff responsible for procurement and the Ministry's relevant central unit for administration and
finance.

289.    Based on the assessment, both MEMD and UETCL are in compliance with the
procurement law, the organization of their procurement units, internal technical and
administrative controls, anti-corruption measures, and their appeal mechanisms for bidders are
all rated satisfactory. Further, the compliance with action plans by both agencies is rated
satisfactory from the experience with actions taken on past recommendations under the Fourth
Power Project. Many of the staff who will implement the proposed project has undertaken
procurement training, some on procurement management under Bank financing and in some
cases more than once.

290.    Further, based on the assessment, both MEMD and UETCL have experience in
implementing Bank-financed project procurement, and consistent with the recommendations of
the 2006 ex-post procurement review of the Fourth Power Project, the overall procurement risk
for the proposed project is rated AVERAGE, and mitigation measures are being proposed
below.

Action Plan

291.    The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation of the project have
been identified. To maintain performance at the overall procurement risk rating of average or
better; the following actions are recommended:

a) The project manager, project coordinator, and ERT project procurement specialist and other
   key staff undertake relevant procurement courses in GIMPA in 2007 and/or ESAMI in 2007
   and the UETCL senior procurement officer undertakes a refresher procurement course in
   2007.

b) MEMD establishes a satisfactory procurement record keeping system and designates a
   qualified member of staff to carry out the task within the first three months of Project
   effectiveness.

c) ERT project procurement specialist is deployed to support MEMD senior procurement
   specialist in the project procurement activities on ongoing basis.

d) UETCL acquires the necessary tools and equipment for the project staff and procurement and
   disposal unit to perform the function efficiently during the first three months of Project
   effectiveness.

e) UETCL Financial Policies and Procedures Manual are, within three months of Project
   effectiveness, revised to make it consistent with the procurement law.

C. Procurement Plan

292.    The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation
which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan was discussed during project
negotiations and accepted by the Bank after making the necessary refinements. The procurement
plan shall be updated by the project in agreement with the Bank annually or as required to reflect
the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity and be
disclosed after Bank's approval on the updated Plan. The plan will include relevant information
on supply and installation, goods, works and consulting services under the Project as well as the
timing of each milestone in the procurement process.

D.      Frequency of Procurement Supervision

293.    In addition to the prior review to be carried out by the Bank Country Office in Uganda, at
least two supervision missions per year will be undertaken to carry out post review of 20% of all
contracts below the prior review threshold; plus regular sampling of contracts for ex-post review
during supervision mission.

295.     Key assumptions for the residential sector:

    · Number of new connections per year: 17,000 (vs. 21,000/ year over 2001-2005), being
         UMEME's commitment of 12,000 per year plus REA 5,000 grid-connected per year.

    · Consumption per new residential connection: 108 kWh/month2 (historical basis), growing
         at the projected disposable household income growth of 2.3% per year;

    · Price elasticity of demand: -0.5 applied to tariff increases of 37.5% and 41%.




1The apparent reduction in commercial losses in 2002 may be due to inaccuracies in the billing system.
2   The aggregate consumption of new connections in their first year is 50% of the 12 month total on the basis that
they are connected evenly throughout the year.

          incremental relative to the Base Case assumptions:

          New residential connections              High: +20,000 per year to 2011 and
                                                   +30,000 per year thereafter;
                                                   Low: +12,000 per year to 2011 and
                                                   +17,000 per year thereafter.

B. Cost of Unserved Energy (CUE)

301.    Power Planning Associates Ltd. took the weighted-average CUE of residential and non-
residential CUE values, with the weighting undertaken on the basis of the imputed split of
unserved demand in 2005. For residential customers, the willingness-to-pay of newly-connected
customers is estimated, in each year, by fitting an income-compensated demand curve between
two points on the curve (see Figure 5 below); the average tariff and average consumption are
used to establish the low price/high quantity point on the curve, and the cost and energy quantum
of a representative mix of electricity substitutes are used to establish the high price/low
consumption point. For non-residential customers, CUE is based on the cost of self-generation.
The Appendix E of the PPA Economic Report contains a 15 page explanation of the many
factors entering into the CUE calculations for residential and non-residential customers.

                                                                      Q

302.    It is assumed that the cost of a planned outage in the residential sector is equivalent to the
foregone consumer surplus, which in turn is the amount that the consumer would have been
willing to pay for each unit of electricity as consumption increases. This can be based on the
customer's willingness-to-pay.

303.    The estimation of WTP for newly-connected customers based on this approach is detailed
in 11 pages of Appendix E.1 of the PPA Economic Report. In sum, a WTP value of US$ 0.418
per kWh was calculated for 2005. WTP values are calculated for each year, in response to real
changes in tariffs and fuel prices.

304.    For the commercial and industrial sectors, the results of Power Planning Associates'
research indicate the following costs of self-generation:

305.    The average profile of auto-generation units can be represented by 10% @ 50kVA, 15%
@ 200 kVA and 75% @ 500 kVA. This produces an average unit size similar to the 405 kVA
observed in ERA research.

306.    The end-2005 economic cost of operating diesel generator sets is calculated in Table 23,
based on the above sizes of diesel generator. One point to note in the table is that, in contrast
with the calculations for the willingness to pay by residential customers, taxes are excluded,
because it is being used in this context as an alternative cost relative to grid energy, and not as
evidence of willingness to pay. For measuring such social opportunity cost taxes are excluded,
while for evidence of consumer willingness to pay taxes are included.

parameters, such as projected fuel price changes and changes in real tariffs.

C. System Supply Conditions

311.    A variety of facilities would operate to meet demand in the Uganda power system over
the next four years, including the existing Owen Falls complex, several anticipated small-scale
hydro schemes, the Kilembe Mines, bagasse-based generation from the Kakira sugar works and
conventional Diesel plants ­ being Aggreko 1, Aggreko 2, the proposed MSD plant and the
proposed short-term plant. The maximum achievable energy production from all non-hydro
facilities is best illustrated by showing the modeled results from adopting the scenario that
combines the driest hydrology and the high demand forecast:

313.     The main differences of the latter relative to the former are the reduction of thermal
production, the large increase of output from the Kiira/Nalubaale dam complex (Owen Falls
Power Station) and the large reduction of unserved energy. Thermal production is still required
with high hydrology because the capacity is required to meet peak loads.

314.     The results of the hydrological analyses indicate the following potential production from
the Kiira/Nalubaale dam complex for all five hydrological scenarios3:

studies for Lake Victoria conducted by Coyne et Belier for Power Planning Associates Ltd., and
fully documented in the Bujagali II: Economic and Financial Evaluation Study, February 2007.
More details on the hydrological conditions of Lake Victoria can be found therein and in Annex
16 below.

316.   It is necessary to define 5-year series of Net Basin Supply4 for the study of the short term
generation policy. The 5-year moving average of lake outflows has been used as the basis of this,
thereby defining 5-year traces with probabilities that the flows would be exceeded ("excedance
probabilities") of 95%, 80%, 50%, 20% and 5%. The probabilities of occurrence of these
scenarios and the equivalent inflows are shown in Table 28. The selected 5-year traces are given
below.

D. Operation of the PPA Dispatch Model

322.   The heart of the economic model applied for this analysis is the merit order dispatch of
system facilities relative to the system load duration curve.

323.   An analysis was undertaken into the shape of the 2005 load duration curve, which was
used as a basis of estimating the energy generation by plant type over the period to the
commissioning of the next major plant in Uganda.

324.   An unconstrained load duration curve was constructed by adding estimates of load shed
to actual sent out figures on an hourly basis. The resulting curve, expressed in per unit terms, is
shown in Figure 6.

325.   The axes of the curve were transposed and it was divided into three areas as shown in
Figure 7. Below the minimum demand, the load duration curve is a straight line. The shape of the
other two curves was analyzed, and a sixth order polynomial determined for each. This analysis
was undertaken using the standard routines in Excel, and the results are shown in Figure 8 and
Figure 9. Very good approximations were derived for each, with R2 values of 0.9997 and 0.9994
respectively. These polynomials are required for the calculation of the energy generation of each
plant in the system, based on merit order dispatch and the shape of the load duration curve.

(H)      Attachments for Sector Projections to 2011:
               1.      Revenue requirements and financing plan 2005-11;
               2.      Operational and financial performance indicators 2004-11;
               3.      Financial Statements 2004-11 in USh billions; and
               4.      Financial Statements 2004-11 in US$ millions.

328.    The financial forecasts are presented in nominal prices and are prepared on the basis of
(a) base case load forecast; (b) base case hydrology (i.e., "low hydrology", see Annex 16; (c) the
Government's interim generation plan to 2010; (d) Bujagali hydropower plant (250MW)

term plant financed under the proposed Bank project; and (e) base case crude oil price forecast,
as per the Bank's forecast.

329.    The consolidated performance of the following power utilities operating in Uganda is
considered in the analysis presented in this document:


        UEGCL, wholly Government owned and owner of the Nalubaale and Kiira hydro power
        stations. The plants' operation was concessioned to Eskom (Uganda) Limited (wholly
        owned by Eskom Enterprise Pty. Ltd., of South Africa) for a period of twenty years
        starting April 2003.

        UETCL, wholly Government owned, owner of the transmission network and system
        operator of Uganda's power system.

        UEDCL, wholly Government owned and owner of the distribution network in Uganda.
        The network was concessioned to UMEME Limited for a period of twenty years starting
        March 2005.

        UMEME Limited, private operator of the distribution network.

A. RECENT PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL POWER UTILITIES (TO 2006)

UEGCL

330.    From the time of handover of operations of the Nalubaale/Kiira dam complex, UEGCL's
function is to monitor the activities of the operator, Eskom (Uganda) Limited. UEGCL has staff
of eleven people and its administration costs are recovered through a concession fee charged to
Eskom (Uganda). In addition to administration costs, Eskom (Uganda)'s concession fee to
UEGCL also includes: (a) UEGCL's debt service payable to Government on the generation debt
vested to it from the former Uganda Electricity Board (UEB), and (b) investments that need to be
funded from internal resources of UEGCL (e.g. counter-part funds for donor funded investments,
vehicles, etc). UEGCL does not earn any depreciation or returns on the leased assets. Eskom
(Uganda)'s bulk supply charges to UETCL are comprised of: (a) recovery of the depreciation of
its capital investments; (b) return (grossed-up for Uganda income tax) on investments (net of
depreciation) made by Eskom (Uganda); (c) fixed annual O&M costs (fixed for the first seven
years of the concession, as bid by Eskom (Uganda), and subject to indexation for inflation); (d) a
small regulatory fee; and (e) UEGCL's concession fee.

331.    UEGCL is financially sound, since it recovers all of its revenue requirements through the
concession fee.

UETCL

332.    UETCL earns its revenues from the sale of bulk power to UMEME.                  Its revenue
requirements are comprised of bulk power purchase costs (hydro power from Eskom (Uganda),
thermal power from private operators, power from small self-generators and non firm imports),
its own operation and maintenance costs, investments to be funded from internal resources (in
place of depreciation and returns on fixed assets), less revenues from small amounts of cross-
border exports to Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda. ERA determines the bulk supply tariff based on
UETCL's revenue requirements. Government subsidies towards thermal power costs are
provided to UETCL and passed on to UMEME through the bulk supply tariff and, therefore, are
taken into account in the determination of end-use customer tariffs charged by UMEME.

333.    Until the first quarter of 2005, the bulk supply tariff included an allowance for
depreciation and return on equity. In addition, an annual allowance of USh17.5 billion (US$10
million) was made for the bulk supply tariff stabilization fund. The purpose of the bulk supply
tariff stabilization fund was to provide a cushion against potential sudden price shocks in the
electricity tariff resulting from large generation capacity additions or any other unforeseen
events. During 2005, UETCL had accumulated a total of USh67 billion (US$36 million) in the
bulk supply tariff stabilization fund and after use of parts of that fund in 2005 the balance of this
fund was USh 49 billion (US$27 million) at the end of 2005. With the introduction of thermal
power in Uganda and the resulting high electricity tariffs, ERA authorized UETCL to apply these
resources towards thermal power costs. These bulk supply stabilization funds were fully utilized
by April 2006.

334.    UETCL has also applied its own surplus funds of USh25.4 billion (US$13.7 million)
generated from its inception to mid-2005 towards thermal power costs. UETCL is now in a


                                                101

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                              Annex 9


precarious financial situation. Since May 2006, UETCL has had to bridge its financing gap
through higher budgetary support from Government. The Government is also hard pressed in
making cash transfers to UETCL on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2006, Government owed
UETCL USh24.6 billion (US$13.5 million).

335.    GOU is currently providing substantial support to the power sector. In 2006, GOU
provided (a) USh113 billion (US$62 million) in direct budget support towards thermal power
costs of the power sector, and (b) USh12 billion (US$6.5 million) as security advance for the
second ADO thermal plant.

UEDCL

336.    From the time of handover of operations of the distribution network, UEDCL's function
is to monitor the activities of the operator, UMEME Limited. UEDCL has staff of fourteen
people and its administration costs are recovered through a lease payment charged to UMEME.
In addition to administration costs, UEDCL's concession fee also includes (a) debt service
payable to GOU on the distribution debt vested to it from UEB, and (b) investments that need to
be funded from internal resources of UEDCL (e.g. counter-part funds for donor funded
investments, vehicles, etc). UEDCL does not earn any depreciation or returns on the leased
assets.

337.    UEDCL is financially sound since it recovers all of its revenue requirements through the
lease payment.

UMEME

338.    UMEME commenced operations under the concession on March 1, 2005. Following the
power crisis, the Government and UMEME renegotiated UMEME's distribution and supply
license in December 2006. Since the lack of power severely hindered UMEME's ability to meet
its performance targets, under the restructured agreement, UMEME has been afforded certain
protections for as long as the power crisis persists. These include, inter alia, (a) recovery of
revenue shortfalls resulting from limited energy supplies, (b) protection against increases in
losses or reduction in collection levels due to continued increases in tariffs, (c) additional
incentives to enhance performance, and (d) risk coverage to safeguard all investments above
US$5 million made during the extended "initial" eighteen month period of the concession, to as
long as the power crisis persists (the end of the crisis currently expected to end when Bujagali
comes into operation), except during the first year following the restructuring. The Government
recruited international experts to assist in this restructuring exercise. IDA and MIGA reviewed
the nature and substance of the renegotiated agreements, and concluded that they were not
unreasonable given the current power crisis. This also included amendments to Credit 3411-UG
in support of covering certain political risks relating to the UMEME concession.

339.    UMEME's operational and financial performance has been satisfactory. The main
features of its operational performance include:

     Distribution losses went down from 38% on takeover to around 34.1% as of end 2006.

     Overall collection rate went up from 80% on takeover to 92% by May 2006. Following the
     tariff increase of 37.5% in June 2006, the collection rate dropped to 85% from June to
     October 2006, and to 82% in November/December 2006, following another tariff increase
     of 41% in November 2006.

     A total of 36,000 new customers have been connected during the first twenty-two months of
     UMEME's operations to December 2006, against 22,000 committed under the concession.
     At present there are approximately 300,100 customers (270,000 domestic, 29,000 small
     commercial, 800 medium and large industry, and 300 street lights).

     During the first twenty-two months to December 31, 2006, UMEME invested USh24.7
     billion (US$13.6 million) in the network and operational assets, and it paid USh2.5 billion
     (US$1.4 million) to the Government as reimbursement of costs of arranging the concession.
     Under the concession, UMEME had committed to invest a minimum of US$5 million in the
     first eighteen months of the concession.

  tariff for the first block up to 15kWh a month was increased by approximately 24% in June 2006
  to 62USh/kWh (US$3.4¢/kWh); it had remained unchanged since 2001. The energy tariff for
  domestic consumption above 15 kWh a month was increased by 37.5% and 42.9% in June 2006
  and November 2006, and by 149% cumulatively since 2004. For commercial, medium and large
  industrial customers, the average energy tariffs were increased between 37.7% and 64% in June
  2006, and between 39% and 55% in November 2006, giving cumulative increases of between
  142% and 210% since 2004; large industry was hit the hardest. In view of supply constraints,
  the time-of-use tariffs for non-domestic customers were substantially narrowed since June 2006.

343.   In real terms, the projected weighted average tariff declines from the present
0.172US$/kWh to 0.138US$/kWh by 2011.

344.   ERA kept the domestic Lifeline tariff of 50USh/kWh (US$2.7¢/kWh) for the first 15
kWh/month unchanged since 2001, and revised it only from June 2006 to 62USh/kWh
(US$3.4¢/kWh). The Lifeline consumption represents approximately 5.5% of total consumption
by end-use customers.

C. GOU ELECTRICITY BILLS

345.   The Government's consumption of electricity represents 7% of UMEME's total
revenues, and the Government currently pays approximately 64% of its electricity bills. The
outstanding balance as at end December 2006 was USh6.2 billion, after set-offs. Under the
concession, UMEME has the right to offset overdue bills of Government against its lease
payments due to UEDCL. Thus far, UMEME has deducted USh8.3 billion against UEDCL's
lease payment. The amounts withheld by UMEME are in turn deducted by UEDCL from its
debt service obligations to Government. This means that ultimately the Treasury pays for the
unpaid bills of Government agencies.

346.   Possible actions that the Government may consider to reduce the number of unpaid
Government bills, include: (a) adequate budgetary provision, (b) support to UMEME to
disconnect non-paying agencies (e.g., defense, police and prisons are major defaulters), (c)
specially earmarked bank accounts for electricity bills, and (d) prepaid meters. UMEME has
indicated that it would require Government/donor support to install and service prepaid meters
for Government customers.

D. KEY ELEMENTS TO RESTORATION OF SUPPLY & FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY

347.    The key elements needed for the restoration of adequate power supply and financial
sustainability of the power sector in the coming years can be summarized as follows.

Power Supply & Demand

348.    In order to secure supply and curtail consumer demand, the following actions are
necessary:
     GOU to secure additional short-term thermal capacity (maximum 150MW, of which
     100MW is now contracted with Aggreko), until the commissioning of Bujagali. The credit
     under this proposed Project will secure the need for an additional 50MW generation
     capacity. In addition, GOU is evaluating an IPP for 50MW of HFO fired power plant. This
     permanent plant will displace 50MW of existing ·thermal plant running on more expensive
     ADO.
     GOU to encourage development of alternative sources of energy generation such as
     renewables and cogeneration. In this regard, UETCL is in advanced stages of negotiating
     power purchase agreements involving 58MW of new capacity, to be commissioned between
     mid-2007 and early 2009.
     Commissioning of 250MW Bujagali hydropower plant by early 2011.
     Demand side management to curtail demand. Preliminary analysis indicates that between
     30MW to 70MW could be reduced in the short to medium term. With the support of IDA
     and Sida, energy efficiency studies and audits will be initiated; 800,000 energy saving bulbs
     (compact florescent lamps) will be acquired and distributed free of charge; capacitors will
     be installed to correct power factors; 3,000 inefficient public lighting points will be
     replaced; and 50,000 solar panels for water heating will be installed.
     Government/UMEME commitment to accelerate reductions in distribution losses and to
     increase collection rates.

Financial Support & Tariff Measures

349.    The existing and projected financing gap between the sector revenue requirements and
electricity revenues will need to be closed by both tariff and non-tariff measures, as summarized
below:
   GOU budgetary support towards thermal power costs until Bujagali is commissioned;
   Deferment of debt service due to GOU in the short to medium term;
   Donor support towards thermal power costs; and
   Tariff increases, as needed, to meet the remaining sector revenue requirements (as explained
   earlier, under the Base Case no further tariff increases are expected until 2012. However
   should any of the assumptions of the Base Case materialize differently in the future, then it
   may be required to increase tariffs earlier or higher than projected.

Distribution Losses & Uncollected Billing

350.    One of the biggest challenges currently facing Uganda's power sector are the high level
of distribution losses (34.1%) and non-collection rate (18%) as of December 2006. The need to
reduce such losses has become more urgent in recent times due to increased power shortages, the
use of expensive fuel and the resulting high electricity prices for all consumers ­ industry,
commerce and households. One of the principal aims of privatization of the distribution business
was to accelerate the introduction of efficiency improvements. UMEME is focused on these
issues and is in discussions with the MEMD to develop joint strategies aimed at an accelerated
reduction in losses. In addition, the tariff methodology gives strong incentives for UMEME to
reduce losses and improve billing collection. UMEME's investments by December 2006
amounted to US$13.6 million, and it is committed to invest at least US$65 million during the
first five years of its operations, although UMEME plans to exceed the minimum investment
commitments. A new billing system is expected to be procured and installed by end 2007. In
addition, IDA is providing about US$12 million (to UEDCL) for the procurement of poles and
transformers and for 13,500 new customer connections. Such levels of investments will help to
reduce technical losses significantly over the medium term.

351.    The Government and UMEME have agreed to jointly develop an Action Plan to reduce
losses and non-collections, based on the strategy summarized below:
    Implement business processes that enable the revenue cycle (measure consumption, bill
    correctly and on time and collect revenue) to be effectively carried out and managed;
    Procure a new billing system;
    Analyze the network and plan and implement repair and upgrade/restoration in overloaded
    areas;
    Set objectives, measure performance and implement actions to achieve and sustain desired
    outcomes;
    Recognize loss reduction as a core business imperative; and
    Improve cooperation between the Government and UMEME.

352.    UMEME's concession agreement contains targets for losses and non-collection rates for
the first seven years of the concession. Under the restructured concession, there will be a
downside protection for UMEME, and benefits accruing from lower losses will be shared
between UMEME and UETCL as long as the power crisis persists.

353.    Distribution losses and non-collection rates assumptions are provided in the table below.

E. PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS TO
2011

Macroeconomic Assumptions

354.    The financial projections are prepared in current Uganda Shillings, using the inflation and
exchange rate forecasts below. Exchange rate of the Uganda Shilling against the US dollar has
been projected forward on the basis of the inflation differential.

  Average in year

Energy and Sales

355.    The forecast of energy requirements is based on the base case load forecast, as presented
in the Power Planning Associates Ltd. report of February 2007. The Government's interim
generation plan to 2010 has been adopted in the financial analysis (see Annex 1 for details). In
addition, it is assumed that the Bujagali hydropower plant with 250MW installed capacity will be
commissioned by April 2011.

356.    The forecast peak demand, energy sent out, losses, energy sales and sales growth rates
are provided in Attachment 2 to this Annex.

357.    Concerning hydrology assumptions, Median or average inflow conditions are assumed
from August 1, 2006 to December 2010 and low inflow conditions are assumed for 2011 (post
Bujagali). Available hydro capacity (MW continuous) and hydro generation (GWh) under these
inflow conditions for 2006-10 and beyond 2010 are based on the Power Planning Associates Ltd
report of February 2007 on "Bujagali II ­ economic and financial evaluation study, Final
Report". Under these conditions, hydropower output from the Nalubaale/Kiira dam complex is
assumed at 120MW up to July 31, 2007 (until the proposed IDA financed short-term thermal
plant is commissioned), about 100MW in 2007 to 2009, and 113MW in 2010. Upon Bujagali's
commissioning, the total annual average output of Nalubaale/Kiira and Bujagali is forecasted at
248MW.

358.    Cross-border exports to Tanzania and Rwanda are assumed to grow from their current
low levels by 5% annually. No imports from or exports to Kenya are assumed in the projections.

Uganda Electricity Tariffs

359.   Uganda retail electricity tariffs 2007-2011 are indicated under (B) above and in
Attachment 2 to this Annex. Tariffs are set at levels to meet the sector revenue requirements, net
of assumed GOU subsidies. Any revenue surpluses are assumed to be utilized to pay-off GOU
deferred debt service.

Government Subsidies

360.   Government subsidies to the power sector are provided in the text of this document and
in Attachment 1 to this Annex.

Fuel Prices

361.   The underlying crude oil prices are based on the World Bank's forecast, as shown in the
table below. Fuel transport costs to Kampala for ADO and HFO are based on estimates prepared
by Power Planning Associates Ltd. It is assumed that ADO will be delivered through the pipeline
from Mombasa to Eldoret and then trucked from Eldoret to Kampala. In the case of HFO, it is
assumed that the fuel will be trucked from Mombasa to Kampala. The Government's existing
duty exemptions on generation fuel will continue through to 2016.

Power Purchase Costs

362.   Power purchases costs for Uganda's power sector have been forecasted as follows:

       Eskom (Uganda)'s capacity costs are provided in accordance with the tariff formula
       provided in its concession agreement. Capacity and energy charges of thermal plants are
       based on the contracted prices, as per the terms of the bids.

       Fuel costs are calculated on the basis of fuel consumption rates and transport costs, and
       assumed underlying oil prices.

       Bujagali capacity costs are based on the latest available estimates.

       Costs of small-scale renewable energy generators (small scale hydro and bagasse based
       cogeneration) are based on indicative prices agreed upon between UETCL and third
       parties.

Rural Electrification Levy

363.   The rural electrification levy is provided as per the provisions of the Electricity Act.
Under the current legislation, UETCL is required to pay 5% of power purchase costs and 0.3% of
export revenues to the Rural Electrification Agency.




                                                           109

Other Operating Expenses

364.    Payroll costs are based on assumed numbers of employees and present payroll costs per
employee, escalated for Uganda inflation. UMEME's employee numbers are based on its
estimates of average annual growth of 3.5%. Employee numbers for UEGCL, UETCL and
UEDCL are kept constant throughout. O&M costs of UETCL and UMEME are based on US$
unit cost of energy transmitted and energy sales respectively. In recognition of inadequate
maintenance of the network in the past, UETCL's costs are assumed to increase by 23% in 2007
and by the rate of international inflation thereafter. UMEME's estimates are based on the
company's projections. All other operating costs of UEGCL, UETCL and UEDCL are assumed
to increase in line with inflation, and UMEME's costs are based on its estimates. For purposes
of retail tariff determination, UMEME's operating costs are based on contracted costs for the
first seven years.

Depreciation

365.    Depreciation is provided on the closing gross value of fixed assets in service. Fixed
assets of the Uganda Electricity Board were transferred to its successor companies (i.e., UEGCL,
UETCL and UEDCL) in 2001 at professional valuations carried out at the time. The following
depreciation rates are assumed.

Bad Debts

366.    Provision for bad debts is made in full at the assumed retail non-collection rates in each
year. The assumed collection rates are indicated in Attachment 2 to this Annex.

Corporate Income Tax

367.    Corporate income tax based on the present tax rate of 30% and applied to taxable income
according to current legislation. Deduction for capital allowances are based on current rates.
UMEME is expected to pay taxes in 2009. No provision has been made for deferred tax.

Concessionaires' Costs and Returns

368.    The projected sector revenue requirements (and required retail tariffs) include all
operating costs, recovery of capital investments, and returns for Eskom (Uganda) and UMEME
in accordance with the tariff methodology specified in their respective concession agreements.

Dividends

369.     It is assumed that UEDCL will pay a dividend of USh18.8 billion (US$10 million) to the
Government in 2008. This will utilize about 50% of surplus funds remaining in UEDCL. In the
case of UMEME, it is assumed that the company could declare and pay dividends equivalent to
60% of its annual after-tax profits, starting in 2009, which. This assumes distribution efficiency
improvements in distribution system efficiency in line with contract requirements.
Investments,

Fixed Assets and Work in Progress

370.     Projected investments and financing plans are summarized in the table below.
Investments in generation represent remaining disbursements for Units 4 and 5 at Kiira (3565-
UG), together with committed and assumed investments to be undertaken by Eskom (Uganda) at
the Nalubaale/Kiira dam complex. Transmission investments include connections to all new
generation projects in the least-cost expansion plan. Investments in distribution are based on
UMEME's forecasts. Transmission and distribution investments in 2007 include the final
disbursements under the Power IV Project funded by IDA and other donors.

371.     Investments to be undertaken by Eskom (Uganda) and UMEME are shown as
investments by concessionaires in the above table. Borrowing requirements and funding from
own resources mainly relate to UETCL's transmission investments. Government contributions
of US$23 million relate to resettlement costs.

372.     Assets under construction are shown under work in progress in the balance sheet. The
cost of assets is transferred from work in progress to fixed assets on their commissioning.

Bulk Supply Tariff Stabilization Fund

373.     The Bulk Supply Tariff Stabilization Fund is retained within UETCL's balance sheet for
purposes of smoothing the retail tariff path and avoiding frequent increases and decreases in
tariffs from year to year.

Accounts Receivable and Payable

374.   Accounts receivable are assumed at 60 days of annual billing, inclusive of VAT. A
deduction is made in UMEME's receivables from end-use customers for billings that are not
expected to be collected.

375.   Accounts payable for power purchase costs and other operational costs are assumed at 60
days of annual costs, inclusive of VAT. Project related creditors are assumed at 30 days of
annual investments that are forecast to be funded from UMEME's and UETCL's internal
resources.

Inventory

376.   Inventory at the balance sheet closing date is forecasted at 2.5% for UETCL and at 2.0%
for UMEME, of opening gross fixed asset value.

Long-term Loans

377.   All existing on-lent loans between the Government and UEGCL, UETCL and UEDCL
are accounted for on the basis of on-lending agreements. All future borrowing requirements of
UETCL are assumed to be on-lent by the Government at 6.5% annual interest, repayable over 15
years after a 5 year grace period. IDC for any investment project made to UEGCL, UETCL and
UEDCL will be added to loan principal and repaid with loan principal and capitalized to fixed
assets on project commissioning. No borrowing is assumed for UMEME.

    8. High hydrology scenario throughout forecast period               (580)        (302)      -26.4%


379.     The key sensitivity scenarios from the above Table are discussed below:

         High oil price forecast scenario (Scenario 1) assumes underlying oil prices to increase to
         73US$/barrel by 2011 (in 2006 prices).

         High demand scenario (Scenario 5), which envisages growth rates of -0.5% in 2007,
         4.0% in 2008, 6.9% in 2009, 6.6% in 2010, and 10.9% in 2011. Thereafter, the annual
         growth averages 10.0%.

         High hydrology scenario (Sensitivity 8): The High Hydrology sensitivity assumes all
         model inputs being as in the base case except for Lake Victoria water levels being at the
         highest end as described in the Bujagali II: Economic and Financial Evaluation Study, by
         Power Planning Associates Ltd. This scenario has a probability of occurrence 21%
         (compared to the probability for the low hydrology scenario of 79%). Although this
         scenario has a low probability of occurrence, it shows that in the high hydrology scenario
         the total hydropower output (from Nalubaale/Kiira leads to important cost savings by
         reducing the overall power sector's revenue requirements by US$302 million, between
         2007/11.

380.     The assumptions on the hydrology and fuel prices have the most impact on the revenue
requirements of the power sector. Higher consumer demand would require higher tariffs since
the incremental demand would have to be met through thermal power generation. A slower than
forecasted reduction in distribution losses will also have a significant impact. The financial loss

will also be high if the planned displacement of thermal capacity with less expensive renewables
(i.e. mini- hydros and bagasse based power plants) is delayed.

G. IDA PROJECT COMPONENTS AND GOU SUPPORT TO POWER SECTOR

381.        The project components for the thermal short-term plant are summarized the following
table. It is proposed that IDA will finance all of the capacity charges and that the remaining
balance will be utilized towards energy charges. On this basis, US$164 million will be available
for energy charges. Total energy charges for the plant are forecast at US$210 million. Thus,
balance of US$46 million will be funded by the sector, made up of US$39 million in 2010, and
US$7 million in 2011.

going to be considerable. The support provided in 2005 and 2006, together with likely support
needed to 2011 is indicated in the following table.

383.        Total Government support to the power utilities over the period 2005-2011 is estimated at
US$734 million. IDA is expected to finance US$206.5 million towards thermal power costs,
US$13.5 million towards the costs of demand side management measures and technical
assistance, US$80 million in general budgetary support under the Policy Support Program (the
US$ 80 million are not included as IDA support in the overall number of US$734 million).
Import duty exemptions on generation fuel are estimated at US$235 million. In addition, the
Government would have to step in and bridge finance yearly shortfalls in revenue requirements
of the sector by way of deferring debt service payments due from the sector. However the sector

  should be in a position to repay all of the deferred debt service by end 2011 and will be expected
  to meet all of its debt service obligations to GOU from 2011 onwards.

  384.          Fuel and import duty exemptions will be settled between the Ministry of Finance,
  Planning and Economic Development and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development
  (MEMD) by way of exchange of cheques. MEMD's yearly budgets will make appropriate
  provisions for taxes and duties which have been exempted for the sector. The Government has
  approved to exempt generation fuel from fuel duties. It is assumed in this analysis that the
  Government will also grant customs duty exemptions for materials imported in connection with
  the major transmission investments, including those related to Bujagali and Karuma.

  385.          The Government is also committed to pay for all resettlement costs involved with the
  associated Bujagali project and all other transmission projects. Such costs are estimated to
  amount to US$23 million from 2005 to 2011.

  389.    Energy consumers (e.g., domestic households, businesses, institutions, industries) can be
  classified by location (urban and rural) and income groups. The majority of consumers are likely
  to benefit from improvements in service quality and delivery, and ultimately from overall
  economic growth. However, for poorer households who have problems with paying for
  electricity services, the impacts of electricity tariff increases may be unevenly distributed. The
  impacts will have social and environmental consequences that may be different in nature and
  scale, for example, among households using grid-connected systems, households who produce
  their own energy, and households without access to electricity. The table below summarizes the
  expected impacts, knowledge gaps, and corresponding institutional arrangements for enhancing
  benefits and mitigating risks.

390.    The Project provides an allocation for technical assistance to the GOU to conduct a
poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA), including environmental impacts, of the ongoing
policy reforms in the energy sector. The PSIA will: (a) examine the broad distributional
implications of expanding access to electricity, taking into consideration differences in income
levels and poverty rates across the 72 districts and five zones in Uganda; (b) assess the impacts
of power sector reforms on the allocation and expenditures in sectors that rely on access to power
for improving quality and delivery of services, especially in health, education, and agriculture;
(c) identify the environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures; and (d) recommend
specific actions to be undertaken by the GOU, international financial intermediaries, energy
sector investors, and local governments to ensure that the distributional and environmental
impacts are taken into account in power sector policies and investments. This will include an
analysis of electricity consumption patterns and the environmental impacts of changes in
electricity tariffs on substitution, energy switching, and household preferences, as well as their
effects, especially in forest areas.

391.    The following issues will be taken into consideration in the selection of poverty, social
and environmental information. One is the reliability of energy consumption data. The estimate
of 5 percent of the population having access to some form of energy in Uganda will need to be
verified and further broken down by energy source, location, and poverty or income groups. This
may affect the sampling frame for quantitative analyses. Second is the level of disaggregation of
poverty data. The most recent poverty mapping in Uganda is broken down by 72 districts.
However, this may need to be further disaggregated into counties in the rural areas where much
of the poverty-energy linkage will need to be analyzed. This would be especially significant
among poorer villages relying on biomass energy sources that may have significant
environmental impacts. Third are the impacts of electricity tariff changes. Because only a small
portion of Uganda's population actually pays for electricity, the issues of tariff changes,
affordability, and willingness-to-pay need to be differentiated first by grid versus off-grid
systems, and second, and when applicable, by electricity consumption and payment behavior of
poor and non-poor households following changes in electricity pricing. Lastly, there are concerns
about the availability of reliable electricity information. Data on electricity delivered and
revenues collected may need to be cross-checked. Data will generally come from the Uganda
Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (UETCL).

Project

392.    Investments to be supported by the project consist of the Mutundwe Thermal Power
Station and energy efficiency investments. The latter consist of changes to existing buildings
such as installation of Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs) in place of incandescent bulbs,
rooftop solar water heating systems, modifications to building systems and equipment, etc. These
measures are not expected to have adverse environmental or social impacts. For this reason, the
environmental and social impact discussion focuses on the Mutundwe Thermal Power Station
(50 MW thermal plant).

393.    The Mutundwe Thermal Power Project will be comprised of a 50 MW auto engine-driven
power plant that will be constructed near the existing Mutundwe electric power substation. The
engine-driven power plant will operate with diesel (i.e., Light Fuel Oil)) with sulphur content of
1.9 percent or lower that will be supplied through pipes from storage tanks to be constructed on

the site. The power generated by the plant will be fed into the existing grid at the Mutundwe
substation.

394.    According to UETCL the detailed specifications of the 50MW thermal power plant,
which might influence the exact installation of the facility, including its associated infrastructure,
is not yet available pending a tendering process. The additional one acre of private land required
is Mailo land located at Kitaluuzi zone in Mutundwe Parish, Rubaga division. The land can be
identified as Block 32, Plot 1023, and Kyadondo in Kampala District.

Environment and Social Safeguards

395.    The following safeguards policies apply: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP4.01) and
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP4.12). The potential ecological impacts identified in the
construction of the power plant are:

    · Wastes that will be generated by the thermal power plant;
    · Change of land use;
    · Soil erosion;
    · Dust, emissions, and noise pollution; and
    · Water pollution from oil spills (although this is expected to be minimal).

396.    Numerous designs of engine-driven generators exist but the best alternative, in terms fuel
consumption, emission, and noise levels has been recommended by the EIA report.

397.    The social assessment identified several benefits, including: (a) increased employment
opportunities, especially among youth in the area, and particularly during the construction phase;
(b) benefits to local women as a result of enhanced trade and market access; and (c) a boost in
electricity supply ultimately leading to enhanced industrialization, commercialization, education
and research and reduction in deforestation due to less use of fuelwood and other biomass energy
sources.

398.    The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) identified the following impacts that will be
monitored throughout the project:

    · Encroachments in and around the site, including population influx in surrounding
        communities since the site is located near a major urban center that attracts a large
        number of people in search of employment;
    · Social disruption;
    · Spread of diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS; and
    · Traffic accidents due to increased vehicular movements.

399.    To address these impacts, several mitigation measures are recommended during the
construction and operation phases of the project. During construction, the EIA recommended
watering of area during surface soil removal; putting in place speed limits for truck drivers;
control of soil erosion; sensitizing workers on HIV/AIDS; ensuring workers and surrounding
populations' safety; and proper management of oil spills and litter. Throughout the operation
phase, emphasis will be placed on the control of emission levels; noise reduction (particularly for
the workers); stringent and proper management of oil spills; precaution against fire accidents and

electrocution; and the periodic monitoring of noise and emission levels and drinking water
quality.

Implementation Set-up

400.   Capacity within the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development (MEMD) will be
strengthened, specifically to address the poverty, social and environmental impacts of energy
policies and programs. UETCL, as the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, and the agency
responsible for the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with generation companies, will also
implement the EIA and RAP for the three short-term power plants. The arrangements for
ensuring that capacities are adequate for safeguards implementation will be made by UETCL,
consistent with overall project management. The GOU requested technical assistance in the
conduct of the PSIA, which will be supervised through MEMD, and in the follow-up
implementation of the EIA and RAP, which will be the responsibility of UETCL.

Stakeholder Participation

401.   Feedback from energy consumers helped validate and cross-check data collected from
secondary sources and findings that informed the EIA and RAP. In the PSIA, methods for
involving stakeholders will include expert interviews, focus groups, and public meetings. In
Uganda, the key energy stakeholders can be classified into the following:

    · Urban consumers of grid-connected electricity, especially those around the capital of
       Kampala and the urban center in Jinja;
    · Rural consumers of grid-connected electricity supplied through UETCL;
    · Urban and rural consumers of grid-connected electricity supplied through UMEME and
       other private distributors;
    · Rural consumers of energy in off-grid systems (renewables) under the Government's
       ERT program;
    · Rural consumers of energy in off-grid systems (renewables) that are managed by non-
       government providers, including those that are household based or locally managed by
       village electricity cooperatives, etc; and
    · Households with no access to electricity.

402.   Stakeholder consultations were held during preparation of the EIA and RAP in Kampala
and in two villages in the Project site. For the PSIA, MEMD will conduct consultations with
representatives from key energy stakeholders, other government agencies, local authorities,
private sector, and non-government groups. Findings from the consultations are summarized and
taken into account in the design of programs and mitigation approaches.

                 403.    Summary on Hydrological Performance of Lake Victoria. The period of time after the
                 commissioning of Bujagali, when the energy generation represents most of the benefits of the
                 project, is approximately 20 years. This is the consequence of the discounting process in the
                 economic evaluation of the project. Therefore, the hydrological scenarios considered for the
                 calculation of energy generation and economic evaluation should be selected for being most
                 representative of periods of 20 years of duration that are likely to occur again in the future.

                 can be observed:

                     · 1900 ­ 1959: average net inflow = 662 m3/s

                     · 1960 ­ 1999: average net inflow = 1206 m3/s

                     · 2000 ­ 2005: average net inflow = 659 m3/s

                 405.    Both periods 1900 ­ 1959 (60 year-duration) and 1960 ­ 1999 (40-year duration) appear
                 to be homogeneous enough to define the two hydrological series that are most representative of
                 the future net inflow pattern that is likely to occur for a period of approximately 20 years after
                 commissioning of the next major hydropower plant on the Nile.

406.    A scenario that would consider the whole period 1900 ­ 2005, leading to a long term
average of 867 m3/s, is found not to be representative enough of 20-year periods, as shown by
the 20-year moving average curve in the above figure, in which the Net Basin Supply is for most
of the time clearly above or clearly below the long term average value. On the other hand, as no
reason can be produced to discard the possibility that a future 20-year period will be similar to
those observed in the historical record, the following scenarios are defined:

    · Low Hydrology Scenario: the net inflow into the lake will be in broad agreement with
        what happened between 1900 and 1960, and again between 1998 and 2005, that is to say,
        annual variations around an average Net Basin Supply of 660 cubic meters per second
        (m3/s);

    · High Hydrology Scenario: the net inflow will be in accordance with the period that
        started with the exceptional inflows of 1961-1964 (average 2,300 m3/s), followed by
        approximately 35 years of NBS averaging more than 1,000 m3/s, with an average net
        inflow of 1,200 m3/s during the whole period.

407.    The reservoir operation studies performed on the basis of each of these two net inflow
series produced the values of constant release that are guaranteed with 95% reliability:

    · Low Hydrology: the firm release is 687 m3/s

    · High Hydrology: the firm release is 1,247 m3/s.

408.    Based on a combination of analysis of dry sequences and mean values, the probabilities
associated to each of the above hydrology scenarios occurring during the period 2011 ­ 2030 are:
79% for the Low Hydrology and 21% for the High Hydrology. The possible influence of climatic
changes was found not to be significant enough in the medium term (to 2030) to influence in one
way or the other the hydrological scenarios.

409.    Departure from the Agreed Curve and Recent Fall in the Level of Lake Victoria.
The "Agreed Curve" is the relationship between the release at the Nalubaale/Kiira dam complex
and the level of Lake Victoria, for the release to follow the "rating curve" that used to be
imposed by the level of the lake outlet before the construction of the Nalubaale hydropower
facility in the 1950s, based on the Jinja Gauge.

410.    The consequence of meeting the Agreed Curve is that, the lower the lake level, the lower
the release, and the higher the lake level, the higher the release. The two extreme situations that
were experienced by the lake level are as follows:

    · lake level = 1133.2      the release according to the Agreed Curve is: 400 m3/s

    · lake level = 1136.2      the release according to the Agreed Curve is: 1,850 m3/s

411.    The Agreed Curve therefore constitutes a "moving reference". If during a long dry
period, when net inflows are consistently lower than the long term average, releases are
consistently higher than the net inflow, then the drop in lake level is accelerated and the

departure of release from the Agreed Curve is amplified. This is precisely what occurred during
the period 2003 ­ 2005, and is illustrated in Figure 13 below:

    · The net inflow of these 3 years was consistently below the long term average: 80% of the
                   long term average net inflow in 2003, 53% in 2004 and 3% in 2005.

    · During the same period, the power demand in Uganda required a sustained release that
                   was above the net inflow, thus accelerating the drop in lake level, and automatically
                   increasing the departure from the Agreed Curve.

412.               A main cause of the drop in lake level in the past few years was the exceptionally dry
period during 2003 ­ 2005, when the mean net inflow was only 46% of the long term average net
inflow, and only 60% of the mean net inflow of the Low Hydrology scenario. The consequence
of this low inflow, combined with the release for power generation that was not reduced to the
Agreed Curve level due to Uganda's lack of sufficient alternative sources of power generation
resulted in a further drop in lake level.

413.               Had the proposed project been in operation during the time, the consequence of this
exceptionally dry period would have been much lower. Since the Bujagali site is downstream of
the existing Nalubaale and Kiira plants, the same release could have been used a second time at
Bujagali and would generate an additional 120% of the power already generated by the turbines
of Nalubaale ­ Kiira (the ratio 1.2 is due to the higher head available at Bujagali). Therefore,
with Bujagali in operation, the generation of the same total power and energy would require only
45% (=1/(1+1.2)x100) of the release from the lake as compared to the present situation without
Bujagali.

December 15, 2006 International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes the First Review under the Policy Support Instrument for
Uganda and Approves a New Three-Year Policy Support Instrument

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review
under a 16-month Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Uganda. The PSI was approved on
January 24, 2006 (see Press Release No. 06/14).

The Executive Board also agreed to Uganda's request to replace the current 16-month PSI with a
new three-year PSI, to support their near-and medium-term policies. The new program includes
structural measures to spur private sector activity, lower business costs, and improve Uganda's
competitiveness. Macroeconomic policies would continue to emphasize stability and sound
management of aid flows. Uganda remains a strong candidate for a PSI with its longstanding
track record of prudent monetary policies, ample foreign exchange reserves, and low external
debt, particularly after the recent Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).

The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need IMF
financial assistance, but still seek close cooperation with the IMF in preparation and endorsement
of their policy frameworks. PSI-supported programs are based on country-owned poverty
reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development
partners. This is intended to ensure that PSI-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social policies to foster growth and
reduce poverty. Members' performance under a PSI is reviewed semi-annually, irrespective of
the status of the program (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).

Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, made the following statement:

"Sound macroeconomic management, structural reforms, and substantial donor assistance
supported Uganda's long record of high economic growth and poverty reduction. Per capita
growth, however, has tapered off in recent years. To maintain high, sustainable per capita
growth, there is a need to scale up investment in infrastructure, deepen the financial sector, and
continue to strengthen governance.

"In addressing Uganda's infrastructure bottlenecks, careful attention must be paid to financing
and macroeconomic considerations. Infrastructure projects need to be well planned and financed
to the extent possible through grant scaling up, domestic savings, and concessional borrowing.

Uganda Power Sector Development Operation                                             Annex 17


"Uganda's financial sector needs deepening to build on recent improvements in the banking
sector. The government is developing new supervision and legal arrangements for the provision
of long-term capital and is beginning to promote financial services in rural areas. To sustain
these initiatives, it will be important for the government to avoid directed lending.

Sustaining the country's fiscal performance will require further efforts to boost revenues and
strengthen expenditure management. In this context, caution in the government's efforts to
introduce tax incentives to attract investments is warranted. The way forward for Uganda would
be to use the country's scarce resources to improve its infrastructure.

As regards structural reforms, the authorities are encouraged to press ahead with their ambitious
agenda, covering the public finances, the financial system, and governance. In addition, the
recently established East African Community (EAC) customs union should help promote
regional trade and provide a forum for discussion of trade policies and advancement of regional
integration.

"The first scheduled review under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) is completed. As
envisaged, the current 16-month PSI is being replaced by a three-year PSI. The latter is based on
the approved 2006/2007 budget, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, and Uganda's
Poverty Eradication Action Plan. The program--which meets the standard of upper credit
tranche conditionality--aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability through continued prudent
fiscal, monetary, and exchange policies, while preserving debt sustainability. As in the past,
these would set the basis for private sector-led growth and continued poverty reduction," Mr.
Kato said.
