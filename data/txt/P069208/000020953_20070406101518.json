imbalances, and\n            facilitate orderly longer-term expansion of electricity\n            service. In order to achieve these objectives, the Operation\n            comprises: (a) a set of investments and policy measures\n            designed to reduce the supply-demand gap until the Bujagali\n            hydropower plant comes into service in 2011; (b) financial\n            support for the Government to absorb a part of the high\n            costs of short-term thermal power generation; and (c) policy\n            measures aimed at making the sector financially viable,\n            accelerating rural electrification, and moving towards a\n            sector-wide approach for development. The project portion of\n            the operation comprises two components. Component 1 will\n            provide partial co-financing towards the capacity and energy\n            charges of a 50MW thermal plant to be installed at Mutundwe,\n            Kampala. Component 2 will provide Technical Assistance and\n            Energy Efficiency. Activities under this component will\n            include: (a) Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management\n            ;(b) Independent Evaluation of the Rural Electrification\n            Program; (c) Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA); (d)\n            Power Sector Medium-term Investment Plan; (e) Lake Victoria\n            Transmission Ring Pre-feasibility and Feasibility Studies;\n            (f) Kalagala Offset Tourism Development Plan; and (g) Energy\n            Sector Communications Strategy."}, "docdt": "2007-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
