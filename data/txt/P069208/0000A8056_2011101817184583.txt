                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has met most of the agreed outcome indicators related to reduced energy deficits, financial performance of the UETCL and the setting up of the Sector Working Group.
                         Most of the project activities are completed with some of the energy efficient investments substantially completed. The Government of Uganda has extended to December 2011 the
                         contract of the main investment, the Mutundwe 50MW thermal plant, to ensure that electricity supply levels are maintained until the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower plant.
                         Since the commissioning of 180MW of thermal generation during the period 2006/2009, GoU has supported the development of additional generation to meet incremental demand,
                         especially mini hydros. A total of about 42MW has been commissioned since 2009 . Further, GoU proposes to retain at least 100MW of thermal plants beyond the commissioning of

                         footing than it was since the power crisis started in mid-2005 and into the first half of 2007. Over the past six years (2005-10), the Government has provided USh576 billion (US$305
                         million) in direct budgetary support.
