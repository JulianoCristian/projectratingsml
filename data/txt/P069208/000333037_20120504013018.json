     moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: electricity shortages need to\n            be addressed from both supply side (generation) and demand\n            side (energy efficiency) as they complement each other; as\n            evidenced by the results of the project that resulted in\n            contributions of about 1,000 GWh from the 50 MW Mutundwe\n            plant on the supply side over the 4 years, and about 10 GWh\n            from the demand side, out of savings arising from energy\n            efficiency measures. In view of the planned new major\n            investments, the Government has to implement measures to\n            improve institutional and financial performance in advance\n            of these investments. These measures include plans to\n            facilitate a financially sustainable sector in the medium\n            term highlighting the sector committed investments including\n            the associated financing and implementation plans. The post\n            project closing events, arising out of not having adequate\n            budget provisions to ensure the continuing operations of\n            thermal plants highlight the need for the stakeholders to\n            continue high level dialog on key policy issues beyond the\n            project period."}, "docdt": "2012-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
