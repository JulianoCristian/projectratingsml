In King George's Dock, the western arm will be\n            extended to provide holding space for four ships, and four\n            dolphin berths for ships undergoing repairs. In Kidderpore\n            Docks a water re-circulation scheme will eliminate the\n            siltation problem in the docks, and the no. 2 swing bridge\n            will be replaced.
