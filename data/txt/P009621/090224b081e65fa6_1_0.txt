SCHEDULE 2
Description of the Project
The Project consists of a program of improvement of the
Port of Calcutta designe' to maintain access to the port,
and improve the operations thereof. It is estimated to
involve total expenditures in Indian currency and foreign
exchange, after April 1, 1961, amounting to the equivalent
of about $31 million and comprises the following main
items:
A. Floating Craft
Floating equipment will be provided, including two
suction hopper dredgers, two pilot vessels, and other
auxiliary craft.
B. Roads and Bridges
The No. 2 swing bridge across the Kidderpore Docks
will be replaced by a new structure in order to relieve
the congestion on one of the main roads in the dock
area.
C. Port Equipment
In order to ameliorate the conditions brought about
by increased siltation in the River Hooghly, a dock
water recirculation scheme will be constructed at the
entrance to Kidderpore Docks which will reduce the
amount of silt laden water required to be pumped
into the docks for impounding purposes. In order to
modernize and improve the efficiency of the workshops
and shipyards, additional plant and machinery will
be provided. Mechanical appliances will also be pro-
vided, including mobile cranes, fork-lift trucks, trac-
tors and trailers.


﻿15
D. Docks and Berths
The Western Arm of King George's Dock will be
extended to provide: holding space at moorings for
four ships which can handle cargo overside, berthing
facilities for four additional ships undergoing repairs,
and aditional sheltered area in the port so as to afford
increased operational flexibility to the working of
King George's Dock.
E. Hydraulic Studies of River Hooghly
Up-to-date scientific studies of the hydraulic regime
of the River Hooghly in its upper and estuarial
reaches will be carried out. In addition to the com-
prehensive study of the river, the hydraulic conditions
at a satellite port site will be thoroughly investigated.
The hydraulic studies will provide such additional
information as may lead to improvements of present
dredging techniques, indicate beneficial river training
works, and determine the feasibility of maintaining
deep water alongside the satellite port site and of
improving deep water access thereto and to the exist-
ing Port of Calcutta.
