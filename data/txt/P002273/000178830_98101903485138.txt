APPRAISAL OF THE SENEGAL RAILlAYS PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Senegal Government has asked the Association for a credit of
US$ 9.0 million equivalent to help finance the Railways' Second Four-Year
Investment Plan, l965/66-l968/69, the highest priority elements of which
are included in the Project.  With minor exceptions, the proposed credit
would finance the foreign exchange cost of the Project (Us$ 6.85 million
equivalent);  it is proposed that the credit also finance 40% of the Project's
local cost (US$ 2.15 million equivalent). The credittwould finance 65% of
the total cost of the Project, or 5OG of the cost of the Four-Year Invest-
ment Plan.
ii.       Senegal Railways have suffered large financial losses in recent
years, principally because of a three-year cessation of traffic to and
frcm Mali. The resumption of this traffic in mid-1963 has brought about an
improvement in the financial position of the Railways. With increasing
traffic, better utilization of equipment and greater efficiency of operation,
the Railways could achieve increasing operating surpluses after adequate
depreciation, and it is expected that they will be able to earn an increasing
return on their net fixed assets.
iii.      The Project is designed to accomplish the first stage of main
line track renewal essential for safety and efficient operation; to re-
place obsolete and worn-out rolling stock and equipment; and to acquire
additional rolling stock and facilities to be able to carry traffic
efficiently at the expected levels.
iv.       The Project is in general technically sound and the Senegal Rail-
ways are competent to carry it out. In addition to the project investments,
other measures will be taken to increase revenue and reduce costs, such as
revision of tariffs and more rational coordination of rail and road transport.
v.        The Project is also justified on economic grounds. It woild
ensure the continued and safe operation of the Railways, which is essential
to the economic needs of Senegal and of Mali. Railway freight traffic is
likely almost to double during the next six years. This traffic is already
carried at lower cost by rail than by road in those areas where roads exist,
and increased efficiency resulting from the investment would further reduce
rail costs. The quality of rail servnices, particularly for passengers,
would also improve and make the Railways more competitive with the road.
The investment would yield a substantial economic return on the basis of
cost savings.
vi.       The proposed mIA credit would primarily finance locomotives,
rolling stock and new track. Some expenditure (US$ 1.h million equivalent)
has already been made or coimmitted; procurement has been largely by
negotiated contracts because of the need for standardization of the items



involved. The remaining imported goods to be financed under the credit
would be acquired after internatioonal competitive bidding.
vii.      IDA has under consideration a credit to Mali to help finance the
Mali Railway's rehabilitation and modernization progran, the negotiation
of which has taken place concurrently with that of the Senegal Railways
Project0 In recognition of the fact that the two Projects are closely
interdependent, appropriate cross-references and reciprocal provisions are
included in the credit documents for both ProJects.
viii.     The Project is sound and provrides a suitable basis for an IDA
credit of US$ 9.0 million equivalent to the Government of Senegal, to be
relent to the Railways at 6% interest, for a term of 30 years including
three years of grace. A Project Agreement wculd be concluded between the
Association and Senegal Railways.



REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
APPRAIS.4L OF TI1 SENEGAL RAILWAYS PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
1.      The Government of Senegal and the Regie des Chemins de Fer du Senegal
(Senegal Railways) have asked the Association for a credit of US$ 9.0 million
equivalent to help finance the Railways' Second Four-Year Investment Plan
(1965-69). The Project consists of the highest priority items in the Plan,
comprising 78% of the total;   the proposed credit of US$ 9.0 million would
finance 65% of the Project cost or 50% of the Plan cost.
2.      This report is based on (i) a study by the consulting firm SOFRERAIL
made in October 1964, (ii) the findings of an appraisal mission consisting
of Messrs. Loven and Sander (of the Association) and Waddams (consultant) in
November 196h, (iii) the results of a pre-negotiation mission comprising
Messrs. Lutolf, Jones, De Gryse (of the Association), Broca and Waddams
(consultants) in June 1965, and (iv) recent information provided by the
Government and the Railways.  Mr. MacKay of the Association also contributed
to the preparation of the report.
3.      On June 10, 1954 the Bank made a loan (No. 100-FR) of US$ 7.5
million equivalent to the Office Central des Chemins de Fer de la France
d'Outre-Mer for completion of the conversion from steam to diesel traction
of the Dakar-Niger and Abidjan-Niger Railways. The entire loan amount was
for the acquisition of diesel locomotives. The Project of which the Loan
financed a part which included track and communications improvements on
both railways, was successfully implemented.
4.      Senegal Railways was created as a State-owned autonomous. entity in
August 1960 out of that part of the former Dakar-Niger Railwayrs situated
in the Republic of Senegal. Dakar-Niger Railways, serving what has now
become Senegal and Mali, was run by a single management with headquarters at
Thies, Senegal, where the workshops were also located. Senegal Railways,
while continuing with its headquarters and workshops at Thies, inherited a
share of the properties and net assets of the former Dakar-Niger Railways
representing 62% of the total.   The remaining 38% became the Mali Railway,
operating in the Republic of Mali under separate and independent control and
management.
5.      From September 1960 until July 1963 all railway traffic was dis-
continued between Senegal and Mali. After reswuption of traffic the Dakar-
Niger system remained divided into the Senegal Railways and the Mali Railway
each under its own management. International traffic is regulated by an
Agreement between the Senegal and Mali Governments and by a Convention
between the Senegal and Mali Railways, both signed in June 1963. The Con-
vention provides for the handling of traffic and operations across the
border, exchange of rolling stock, and common tariffs. In addition, the
Convention includes arrangements for Mali locomotives and rolling stock to
be repaired in the Senegal workshops at Thies, and for the Mali Railway to
hire Senegal locomotives when needed for use in Mali. International traffic
is also facilitated by a Customs Agreement between the two countries provid-
ing for tax-free passage of Mali goods in Senegal.



-2-
6.      The Convention, which may be revised annually at the request of
either party, generally proviOles an adequate and practical basis for the
regulation of international traffic. For the efficient operation of what
is essentially a single railway system, it would be best to have one cor-
poration and one management, but this is not possible politically.   The
Association has under consideration the granting of a credit to Mali to
finance part of its Railway's program. The continued cooperation of the two
Governments and the two railways within the framework of the International
Traffic Agreement, the Customs Agreement, and the Railway Convention was
agreed during the negotiations of both the Senegal and Mali credits. Appro-
priate provisions are included in the credit documents to ensure prompt notice
to the Association of any difficulties arising under the Convention and to en-
sure that no material changes are made therein without prior approval of the
Association. Any substantial interruption in the normal flow of international
traffic for other than technical reasons has been made an event of default
under both credit agreements, unless such interruption is manifestly beyond
the borrower's control. In recognition of the close interdependence of the
twio railways and the two projects, appropriate cross-references and reciprocal
provisions are included in the credit documents for both projects. In this
connection suspension or termination of withdrawal for Senegal entails auto-
matically the same sanction for Mali if, as a result of the suspension or
termination for Senegal, it became improbable that the purpose of the Mali
project would be achieved.
II. TRANSPORT IN SENEGAL
A, Background
7.      The Republic of Senegal covers an area of 200,000 square kilometers,
about one-third of the area of France; it borders on the Atlantic to the
west, Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, Guinea and Portuguese Guinea
to the south (see map), and virtually surrounds a narrow enclave stretching
200 miles on both sides of the River Gambia comprising The Gambia. Seregal
has a population of about 3.h million, which is estimated to be increasing at
a rate of 2.5% a year. About one-quarter of the population is urban and con-
centrated particularly in the provinces of Cap Vert (Dakar) and Thies.
Dakar, which was built up as the administrative, industrial and commercial
center of French West Africa, has a population of over L0O,000, followed by
Kaolack, Thies, Rufisque, Ot. Louis, Ziguinchor and Diourbel, all between
30,000 and 70,000.
8.      Agriculture employs about 80% of the working population;   however,
it accounts for only 30% of the domestic product, the largest share of which
is provided by services (nearly 55%) reflecting the legacy of Senegal's pre-
independence status. The most important cash crop is groundnuts, which
accounts for 60% of the country's export earnings.
9.      Senegal's per capita domestic product is relatively high for West
Africa, being approximately $190 a year, which is due in large part to
the substantial contribution in industry and commerce of a non-African
population of about 55,000. The growth in domestic product is estimated



- 3 -
to be about 3% per annum since 1960 ;rhich, allowing for population in-
crease, reflects a quasi-stagnation of per capita domestic product resul-
ting from the loss of export markets in neighboring countries followTing
independence, excess capacity in manufacturing and service industries and
in government, and the subsequent reduction in French civil and military
expenditures (see the Bank's economic report No. AF-44a).
B. The Transport System
10.       The railwTays and roads in Senegal fan out from the Dakar-Thies
region, which contains nearly all industrial development; in general the
further awtay from this focal point, the less developed and more sparsely
inhabited is the country.
11.       Rivers are not presently very significant in the country's
transport system. Tne Senegal river in the north, although navigable all
year round up to Podor (160 miles), is not at present suitable for bulk
transport. An inte.governmental committee representing the four riparian
countries, Senegal, Guinea, Mali and !1auritania,was recently set up to
coordinate studies and investnents for the better development of the
Senegal river basin. Under its direction, studies are being carried out
by the United Nations Development Programme and U.N. specialized agencies.
In any event, assuminig that the necessary works are feasible, it will be
many years before tihe Senegal river can be transformed into a suitable
artery for bulk transport and this possibility has not been taken into
account in the appraisal of the Senegal Railways Project.  The Gambia
river in the south is navigable in part and may play a limited role if
a custom union were to be established between Senegal and the Gambia.
This, however, would not affect the railways substantially.
12.        Dakar, the terminal point for much of the Senegalese, Maurita-
nian and :;ali traffic, is one of the major ports of Africa. A project costir.g
some CF;F 1.7 billion (US$ 6.9 million) for the improvement of its facilities
has been submitted to the IBRD. There is a port at Kao'acl: on the
Saloum River, accessible to ships wfith drafts of up to 5 m; the Common
Market's Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED) is currently financing
dredging works estimated at about US$1.2 million equivalent which will
permit the port to receive larger vessels. As Kaolack is connected by
rail to the main line from Dakar to iIali, and is the second largest toitm
in Senegal with groundnut processing plants in the vicinity, it offers a
channel for international trade suitable for transport in ships of limited
tonnage.
13.       The railway system consists of a main line from Dakar to Kidira
on the Mali border, and a major branch connecting Dakar irth St. Louis
in the north. Other branches run as far as Linguere and Touba, serving
groundnut production centers, and to Kaolack, and the calcium phosphate
extraction works of Taiba (see map).
14.       Senegal was relatively well endowed with roads when it became
independent and in the past five years there have been large investments
in roads and road vehicles. Existing paved trunk roads are marked on



-4-
the map, which shows that, with two exceptions in the extreme north and
south, they parallel and in most cases run alongside the railway.  In the
Government's Second Four-Year Plan 1965-1969, the program for roads is mainly
directed to constrlcting and improving dirt roads and trails in agricul-
tural areas at present poorly served, and to linking them to the existing
road network or to the railway.
15.       The problems of transport coordination in Senegal were studied
some years ago by French experts working on behalf of the Senegal Govern-
ment.  Their reports, which were published for the most part in 1962,
provide a valuable source of material for assessirng the soundness of the
RailTways' investment plans  and the optimum division of traffic between
rail and road (see chapter on "Economic Justification").
III. TTE RAILMAY SYSTEM
A. Organization, Vlanagement and Training
16.       Senegal Railways are administered by a Board of Directors whose
Chairman, the Minister of Transport, has control through right of veto.
There are eighteen members of the Board, of whom eleven are Governrnent
representatives (including the Chairman), the remainder representing the
National Assembly (1), the Chambers of Commerce and Industry (3), the
trucking industry (1), and Railways' personnel (2). The Board may delegate
part of its authority to a Permanent Committee of seven members, also under
the chairmanship of the 14inister of Transport.
17.       With the exception of the operating and capital budgets, which
in addition to review and endorsement by the Board require the specific
joint approval of the Ministers of Transport and Finance, the Board has
authority in all spheres of railway administration.  Its powers are
delegated to the Chairman, suoject to his reporting at least bi-annually
to the Board at statutory meetings to consider the budaets and the accounts.
The Chairman must also submit to the Board the investment programs, per-
sonnel policies and borrowing operations.  He may delegate authority to
the Manager, who is the chief executive officer of the Railways appointed
by Presidential decree and responsible to the Board, whose meetings he
attends. sIJith the approval of the Chairman of the Board, the Manager may
further delegate authority to department heads.
18.       The Railwviays are adainLstered in a satisfactory manner in spite
of their great financial difficulties since 1960. In February, 1964,
a Decree applying to all public entities appointed Government Commissioners
to approve all commitments of expenditures over ClvAiF 500,000, and also
any recruitment or statutory review of personnel; with respect to these mat-
ters, the Commissioners also have power of susuensive veto on decisions
of the Board, whose meetings they attend. This control of expenditures,
although limiting managerial action to a certain extent, worked satisfactor-iy
and did not result in serious delays in authorizations. A recent law,
effective July 1, 1966, replaces the Government Commissioners by Financial
Comptrollers whose duties are similar to those of the Commissioners. They
report to a newly established "section de controler' attached to the Presi-
dency. The new organization, although strengthening the Government's
control, is not expected to impair the Railways' managerial action.



- 5 -
19.       There are six departments reporting to the Manager, and except
for the purchasing and stores department the organization is satisfactory
and similar to that of other railways
20.       Adcounts and statistics are mechanized and produced efficiently
within reasonable time. The purchasing and stores department has been un-
satisfactorily organized, with resulting delays in ordering spare parts and
in the repair of equipment. The Railways have decided to retain the ser-
vices of an expert from the French Office Central dos Chemins de Fer d'Cutre-
Mer who will appraise the purchasing and stores department, make proposals
to improve its administration and operations and supervise the implementation
of his proPosals.
21.       There were 63 French teclhicians employed by Senegal Railways
in 196h/65. The policy has been to train Africans for managerial and
techlnical posts and progressively to replace expatriates with nationals.
In 1959, when Senegal became independent, there were 128 expatriates on
Dakar-Niger Railways and, according to present plans, there will be 56
by 1967.  In general this gradual transition has been smooth and has
ensured continuity of management; assurances were obtained during
the credit negotiations that this policy ril1 be continued.
22.       Managerial officials are generally competent and qualified,
but there are inadequacies at the supervisory and foreman levels, at
which the Africanization policy has been applied width insu£ficient
regard to technical experience. The training programs at present being
Liplemented should improve this situation. These programs include short
courses for track inspectors,   locomotive drivers and station masters,
and attendance by 10 to 15 promising employees each year at three- to
four-month courses with the French Railways.  There is a well-equipped
and managed apprenticeship school at TLhies providing three-year courses
and turning out about 30 trained apprentices a year; and, in addition,
three outstanding Senegalese trainees wrill in the future attend a-tro-
year course at the railway technical school in Abidjan (Ivory Coast).
These training arrangements are well-conceived and should ensure the emer-
gence of adequate managerial, supervisory and technical slills in the
future.
B. Personnel
23.       The total personnel establishment (excluding temporary track
workers) at June 30, 1965 was as follows:
Number
Technical Assistants              63
Permanent                      1,892
Au:dliary                      2,261
Total                     4,216
24.       There has been a 4h decrease in numbers since the end of 1960,
mainly in the auxLliiary category. The productivity of emDloyees is generally
satisfactory in relation to African experience and traffic density. Except- Jns
to satisfactory personnel productivity are in the Thies workshops, ,ihich



with about 1,600 employees are overstaffed, in the purchasing and stores
department, and in track maintenance, where a large work force produces
poor results. Agreement was reached during the credit negotiations on a
schedule for anntual workshop staff reductions of 35 employees over the
period 1966/67 to 1975/76, with the understanding that at the same time the
productivity of the workshops will be maintained or improved.   In respect
to track maintenance, it has been agreed that three technical experts on
track maintenance techniques would be engaged; their appointment is a con-
dition of effectiveness of the credit. The foreign exchange cost and part
of the local cost of the experts' services are included in the proposed
credit.
25.       Permanent staff include all officials and supervisory personnel and
most of the skilled workers whose tasks are coinected with safety, workshops
or cash handling. They cannot be discharged except for cause. Auxiliary
personnel may be dismissed on one month's notice. Permanent staff are highly
paid in comparison to other African railways, having acquired this position
before independence, when union pressure was strong.   Remuneration of auxi-
liary personnel is governed by regulations applicable to other workers in
Senegal. In 1964/65 average annual wages were:
Basic       Fringe Benefits              Total
CFA Francs       CFA Francs       CFA Francs  US$ Equivalent
Permanent     368,000          266,000          63L,000        2,567
Auxiliary     230,000          h2,000           272,000        1,000
26.       The permanent category includes all the higher salary echelons and
thus overemphasizes the contrast in remuneration between the two groups.
The remuneration of permanent staff is higher than that of other Senegalese
public employees in similar categories. The Government has decided to hold
Railways' staff remuneration at the present level until this level is reached
in other areas of government employment. Since this will take some time
railway remuneration as a whole should be static over, say, the next ten
years, although promotions and seniority increases will continue. During the
credit negotiations assurances were obtained that the Railways will use their
best efforts to contain the payroll and that they will endeavor to prevent
increases in the wages and salaries of their permanent employees until the
wages and salaries paid to government employees in similar categories reach
the same level. In addition, the RailTways have agreed to reduce their staff
by attrition and to limit recruitment to about 25% of retirements during each
of the fiscal years 1966/67 to 1970/71.
27.       Labor relations are good. There is one union of Railwqay employees,
which restricts its activities to local and personmel matters. TWorking hours,
vacations, retirement and pension arrangements are satisfactory.
C. Facilities
28.       The total length of track of Senegal Railways is 1,032 km. The
main line from Dakar to Kidira on the Mali frontier is 6h3 km long. There
are branch lines from Thies to St. Louis (193 km), Louga to Linguere (128 mn)
Diourbel to Touba (47 km) and Guinguineo to Kaolack (21 kin). There is also
a short spur from Tivaouane to the phosphate extracti-on works at Taiba.



- 7 -
29.       A11  lines are meter-gauge, single track, except bet-Teen Dakar
and Thies, wJhere double tracking is being completed.  The adnLinistrative
headquarters of the Railways are at Thies, as are the workshops, training
school, welding and tie plants, with ancillary residential and social
facilities for headquLarters personnel.
30.       The Railways traverse flat country with no important rivers.
Track, is in poor condition for the most part, owing to its age. Over half
is of light rail (20-26 kg/meter) which is inadequate for the axle loadings
of modern diesel locomotives. A program of track welding has been started
for those parts of the line which will not be replaced in the foreseeable
future, with continuously welded track betwTeen stations, and this has
reduced maintenance costs.
31.       Buildings are generally in good condition, a'though some
stations are inadequate for requirements and are scheduled for
improvement in tiie Railw;zays' Four-Year Plan. Signalling is generally
adequate and the telecommunications network is in good condition.
32.       Details of locomotives and rolling stock are given in Table 1.
The dieselized locomotive and railcar fleet consisted in mid-1965 of
36 main line locomotives, 20 shunters and 12 railcars. Among the main
line locomotives seven were built in France in 1939/40 but were not deli-
vered until after the war. They have been adapted for heavy slow trains
for which they were not intended; their design is obsolete and they are
to be scrapped within a few years. Four 720 h.p. locomotives with unsa-
tisfactory hydraulic transmission and two 1300 h.p. locomotives are also
in bad condition and are to be scrapped in the near future. The remaining
23 main line locomotives and all the shunters are of suitable design and
in good condition; they will continue in service for the next ten years.
Four of the 12 railcars are in bad condition and will be scrapped in
1967/68 when delivery of five new railcars is expected.
33.      Hqost of the 120 passenger cars, trailers and auxiliary cars
are in good condition and will continue in service throughout the period.
The policy of the Railways for some time has been to develop railcar
and trailer services, and all new passenger equipment will be of this t'ype.
34.       Of the 779 freight cars with average load capacity of 25 tons,
334 are over 35 years old and thleir progressive scrapping over the next
ten years is envisaged. The phosphates are carried in 91 hoppers of 45-ton
average capacity owned by the phosphate companies.
35.       The Thies worlkshops are in good condition and well equipped with
modern facilities. Their principal function is maintenance and repair of
locomotives and rolling stock, but they have recently started building
freight cars for the Railways.   In addition they repair and maintain Mali
traction and, during the years when they were not used to full capacity,
expanded activities to include road truck assembly and manufacture of



- 8 -
school furniture. The withdLraial of Hial i repair work- following the es-
tablishment of wrorkshops in Hlali (see Mali Railway Appraisal report) will
not have a major impact on the Thies workshop, and general overhaul of
Mali locomotlves will continue to be done at Tnies.   The workshops' non-
railway  activities are excluded from consideration in this report but do
not affect adversely the efficiency of railwTay operations; thie Railways
keep separate accounts for workshops operations, charging their services
to railwray operations, to M}ali Railway and to other customers. i',aintenance
of rolling stock is also carried out in the depots and in the subsidiary
workshops at Dakar and Guinguineo.
D. Operations
36.       Senegal Railways operate 63 stations for freight and passengers
and 56 unsta.ffed flag stations  for passengers only.  All train running
is controlled from a central office at Thies. Scheduled trains cormiprise
94:' of total runs.  Speeds are adequate and train loadings satisfactory.
37.       Passenger train occupancy was as follcws:
January 1965               July 1965
1st class  2nd class      'st class  2nd class
International express           36p       100l            86,%       121
Railcars                         l%o      103%              -         73
Local trains                     -         O5fi             -         69%
The high occupancy ratios in second class lend force to the case against
the mooted suppression of passenger services (discussed in the section on
Economic Justification) and also to the case for raising passenger fares,
recommended in the section on Tariffs. Except on the international
expresses, a one-class system was adopted recently and thlis was fully
justified by the low first-class occupancy.
38.       The turn-arourd of freight cars in international traffic is
slow, at three one-way trips a month between Dakar and Bamako, and with
more efficient operations (particularly in Mali) should be
increased to four a month. Usage and loading of freight cars on local
traffic should also be improved.
39.       Delays, accidents and on-line failures are high.  Most of the
accidents and failures are attributable to the poor condition of the
track and provide additional evidence of the necessity of the track
renewal program in the interests of safety and efficiency.

E. Traffic
(a) Freight
40.       Freight traffic on the Senegal Railways can be divided into four
categories:
Thousands       Millions
of Tons        of Ton/Km
1964/65
1. Mali Traffic                    188             119
2. Groundnuts                      222              39
3. Phosphates                      8h1              91
4. Other                          1J5               28
Total                  1,396             277
The tonnages carried in the past 4 years, and estimates for the nextc 6,
are given in Table 2.
41.       Mali traffic is the Railways' most important traffic, owing to
its long distance of haul (at present averaging 635 km) and remunerative
tariffs.  It accounts for 43% of total ton-kilometers and 53% of freight
revenue. The traffic was resumed in July 1963 and, according to Senegal
Railwiayst statistics, 150,000 tons were carried in the first year of
resumption (1963/64), compared with about 250,000 tons a year before the
closing of the frontier in 1960. The tonnage carried in 1963/65 was
limited by Mali's operational difficulties, and higher tonnages should
be achieved with more traction and better organization in MEAl.- The
forecasts, rising from 200,000 tons in 1965/66 to 330,000 tons in 1970/71,
are derived from the estimates made in the Mali Railway appraisal report.
42.       Of the 200,000 tons forecast in 1965/66, 170,000 tons are imports
to Mali spread evenly throughout the year; of the remaining 30,000 tons of
Mali exports, 20,000 tons are groundnuts, shipped from January to June.
Thus, there is a marked lack of balance outside the Mali export season;
from July to December a monthly average of 14,000 tons of up traffic to
Mali is matched by no more than 2,000 tons of down traffic.
43.       Groundnut traffic in Senegal (excluding Mali traffic) has been
about 250,000 tons a year during the past six years with an average haul
of 165 kilometers, wi-th the exception of the 1961/62 season (December-June)
when a record 317,000 tons was carried. Since 1961/62 the share of the
total commercial crop going to the Railways is about one-third; in 1964/65
the distribution was approximately as follows:
(Thousands of tons)
Rail           Road    %      Total
in shell               192     h1     280    59      472
Docorticated            30     18     140    82      170
222            h g 20-          y _2



- 10 -
It is expected that in the coming years the Railways' share will increase
considerably for the following reasons:
i)    Measures are being taken to spread the shipment of ground-
nuts over a longer period, by building storage facilities
in production areas, mostly at rail pick-up points. This
will ease congestion at rail unloading sidings at the
Dakar processing plants and elsewhere and enable the Rail-
ways to handle far more over a longer period.
ii)   The Government, through its agency O.C.A. (Office de
Commercialisation Agricole), has allocated to the Railways
from 1965/66 on, an annual total of 400,000 tons of ground-
nuts. This would bring the RailTways' share to 62% of the
crop on the 1964/65 level and to 50% of the expected 1968/
69 level. During the credit negotiations the Government
agreed to take the necessary measures to ensure that not
less than 400,000 tons of groundnuts will continue to be
allocated to the Railways during each fiscal year.
iii) One of the objectives of the current plan is to increase
groundnut production by at least 25% over the next four
years by the development of existing and new areas.
This should favor long-distance rail transport; the first
results were shown in 1964/65, when the average haul of
groundnuts by rail increased from 165 to 175 km. It is
expected that the average haul will increase further to 200 km.
As groundnuts are transported in full carloads over increasing distances and
at lower cost than by road (see paragraph 5a), the increased allocation of
groundnut traffic to rail is economically justified.
h4.     Phosphate traffic consists of aluminum phosphate from deposits near
Thies, amounting to 110,000 tons a year, with a haul of 86 km, and the
larger calcium phosphate deposits of Taiba, of which 730,000 tons were
carried in 196h/65 over a distance of 112 km. Demand for aluminum phos-
pnate is likely to remain stationary and the producer has no plans for ex-
pansion;  the present level of traffic is expected to remain unchanged.   Ex-
pected demand for calcium phosphate has led the Taiba producer to increase
capacity to a level which it expects to reach one million tons a year in
1966 and 1.7 million tons a year by 1968/69. The phosphate is carried at
long-term contract rates.
45.     "Other" commodities carried (including "less-than-carload") amounted
in total to=5,0oo tons in 1964/65, with an average haul of 193 km; they
accounted for 10% of total freight traffic in ton/km. The largest item was
petroleum (32,000 tons), which should increase as the oil companies complete
their plans to introduce more tank cars. There are also good prospects of
the Railwiays improving their share of the transport of several commodities,
in particular rice and fertilizers.*
* A project to be located near Dakar and costing a total of about $12 millio
for the production of phosphate fertilizer is under consideration by the
IFC and other potential participants.



- 11 -
46.       Total fre-ght tonnage in 1964/65 was 1.4 million tons for an
average haul of 198 kilometers, amounting to 277 million ton/km. The
expected growth of traffic from 1964/65 (actual) to 1970/71 is given below:
1964/65                             1970/71

S/Total       555        186         335        930       330       355

T'hlies         110          9          86        110         9        86
Taiba           731         82         112      1,720       193       112
S/Total       841         91         108      1,830       202       110

Freight tonnages, other thar. phosphates, would rise from 555,000 tons in
1964/65 to 930,000 tons in 1970/71, an average of 11% per annum, and on
an average haul of 355 km., the ton/hm would rise from 186 million to 330
million, or 13% per annum. These rates of growth are considered to be
realistic.
(b) Passenger Traffic
47.       Passenger traffic is adversely affected by road competition.
The passenger increase in 1962/63 (see Table 2) followed the introduction
of drastic fare reductions to meet the road challenge but was temporary.
In 1964/65 the total of passengers carried fell to 3.2 million for 292
million passengers/lm.
48.       The Commission which reported on the coordination of transport
in 1962 (see section- on Economic Justification) recommended a phased
suppression of passenger services by the Railways.   The Government has
not accepted this recommendation, and as passenger revenues are at the
present time covering marginal costs, there is no justification for
discontinuing these services.
49.       Past records of passenger travel show a close correlation between
number of passengers and both per capita income and level of fares.
Although an annual increase in G.D.P. of about 3p, and a population increase
of 2-1/2% per year (4% in the railwiay service areas) may be expected, it
is assumed that the number of passengers will not increase because of a
proposed fare increase of 15% (see section on Tariffs). Over the period
1965-71, the number of passengers is expected to remain at 3,500,000



- 12 -
(based on prorated  figures for the period July1965 - ADril 1966);  the
average distance travelled per passenger has increa3ed (83 km in 1963/64 to
91 km in 1964/65) and is considered as likely to continue since the
shorter distance traveller would go 'by road; passenger/km are estimated
to rise from 292 million in 1964/65 to 350 million in 1970/71, an average
increase of 3% per annum.
F. Tariffs
(a) Freight Rates
5o._      The freight rates in force on the Senegal Railways take account
of the cost of carrying different commodities in terms of loading ratios,
speed, distance and other factors, but for the reasons given below they
do not cover costs at the present time. In terms of constant prices,
freight rates are half what they were nine years ago. This is attributable
to (i) failure to increase rates to cover rising costs, (ii) the reduction
of many rates to meet road competition and (iii) the development of large-
scale phosphate traffic carried at louT rates on long-term contracts.  Exclud-
ing the phosphate traffic, average receipts in 1964/65 wfere about CFF, 6.59
per ton/km, which is not out of line with other former French-African
railways:
CFAF Equivalent

Cameroons                         8.63
Mali                              6. 74
Congo-Ocean                       6.36
51.       Average receiptis for principal categories of goods compared
with average unit costs given by the Railways for 1964/65 actual results,
are as follows:
Average                  Approximate

Mali traffic           119     6.39       760            6.17        734
Groundnuts              39     5.95       232            8.00        312

Total             277      5.19   1439             5.93      1,643



- 13 -
52.       The above figures show that, except for the Mali traffic which
is carried at a small profit, all other main categories of receipts do not
cover costs with fully distributed overheads.   Proposals for improving
this situation are discussed below.
53.       Tariffs on international traffic are fixed by the Convention
(see paragraph 6) between the Senegal and Mali Railways and are the same
per ton/km and per passenger/km on both railways.   However, as costs may
vary between the railways, the tariffs for international traffic should
not necessarily be the same for both railways. During the negotiations
for the Senegal and Mali credits both Governments and Railways agreed
that tariffs, including those for international traffic, should be esta-
blished on sound traffic costing principles and that, to this end, traffic
costing consultants should be appointed. For the sake of uniformity both
Railways agreed to appoint the same consultants, satisfactory to the
Association, and with terms of reference, including the principles to be
followed in allocating costs and establishing accounts, prepared by the
Association and agreed during the negotiations. Both Governments and
Railways further agreed that as changes in costs applying to individual
items of international traffic may occur and may not be the same for
both RailTways, the tariffs applicable to international traffic may have
to be modified from time .to time and need not necessarily be the same for
both Railways. Agreement was further reached that should at any time
either Railway, on the basis of the findings of the consultants or on
the basis of changes in costs, wish to modify any of its tariffs appli-
cable to international traffic, the matter would be referred to the
"Commission Mixte", a body set up in 1963 with ministerial status to
meet regularly to discuss matters of common interest to both parties.
Should a decision on such a matter not be reached by the "Commission
Mixte" within an agreed period, either Railway may submit the case to
arbitration under the Railway Convention, but with time limits agreed
during the negotiations. Provision is made for the assistance of the
Association to be sought at any time in such matters. The Association
will also be given the opportunity of expressing its views before any
arbitration award is made. The appointment of the traffic costing con-
sultants is a condition of effectiveness of the credits. Part of the
cost of the consultants' services is included in the proposed credits.
5h.       Groundnut railways rates (excluding international traffic) are
lower than the road rates and costs; the latest price negotiated between
the OCA and road transporters is CFAF 12 per ton/km. The diversion of
groundnut traffic to roads (see paragraph 43) is believed to be due to the
Railways' unsatisfactory cooperation ;writh the OCA which is now being over-
come. Although groundnut railway rates should be increased, it is
necessary to do so gradually and in stages for the following reasons:
i)   In accordance with the provisions of the Yaounde Con-
vention of 1964 between the European Economic Community
and the associated countries, preferential treatment of
Senegal groundnut exports to France will gradually be
eliminated. Senegal must therefore align export prices
to world market levels during the 5-year period ending
in 1969.



- 14 -
ii)   To ease the burden on the economy during the adaptation
period, the Fonds Europeen de Developpement has accorded
Senegal a grant to subsidize the present price to farmers.
The subsidy will be gradually reduced, and discontinued in
1969, with a corresponding reduction of the price to farmers.
iii) An increase in groundnut railway tariffs applied before
1969 would therefore run counter to the Government's policy
and would be very difficult to explain to the farming popula-
tion.
The Government has therefore decided to increase railways rates for ground-
nuts gradually, and has agreed that the rates will cover costs by not later
than June 30, 1969. Since rates will probably not cover costs in the mean-
time, the Government has agreed to pay the Railways a contribution to
revenue for the difference. The amount of the contribution has been pro-
visionally fixed at the equivalent of CFAF 1 per ton/km of groundnut trans-
ported by rail during 1966/67 and CFAF 2 per ton/kmci in 1967/68 and 1968/69;
however, the amount of the contribution will be reviewed in the light of
actual transport costs as established by the traffic costing consultants re-
ferred to in paragraph 53.
55.       Phosphates rates are fixed by long-term contracts, valid until
1968 for the Thies phosphates and until 1977 for the Taiba phosphates, uith
escalation clauses covering increases in wages, fuel and steel costs. The
rates, which decline in relation to quantity levels, cannot be altered be-
fore the termination dates of the contracts, except by agreement among the
parties. On the basis of the present and forecast 110,000 tons per annum
for the Thies phosphates, contract rates average 4.o6 CFAF per ton/km and
are thus higher than the present average unit cost of 3.35 CFAF per ton/km.
-On the other hand the 1,720,000 tons of Taiba phosphates forecast for 1968/69
would be transported at contract rates giving an average 2.22 CFAF per ton,/on,
which is substantially below the present average unit cost to the Railways.
Forecast increases of phosphates traffic and train tonnages will reduce the
average unit cost for this commodity but not sufficiently to permit the Rail-
ways to cover costs. Because of the existing contracts no phosphate rate
increases are proposed or included in the financial forecasts of the Railways-
However, the Railways have agreed to initiate early negotiations with the
Taiba concessionaire to explore the possibility of revising the phosphate
transport rates.
56.       Other Commodities.  As road competition is particularly strong for
this category of goods, no rate increases are proposed at this stage or in-
cluded in the forecast financial statements of the Railways.
57.       Less-than-Carload.  The Railways have increased rates from about
17 to 25 CFAF per ton/km as of February 1, 1966.
(b) Passenger Fares
58.       Passenger fares are set primarily to meet road competition.   They
amount to 25 CFAF per section, except for the eastern end of the main line



- 15 -
from Koungheul to Kidira where a per kilometer fare applies. On the most
travelled stretches of the Railways, between Dakar and Kaolaclk and Dakar
and St. Louis, where there is the keenest bus competition, the average
length of section is 12.5 km, and the fare is thus 2.00 CFAF per km;   between
Louga and Linguere the section is 7.5 Iam and the fare 3.30 CFAF per km. In
addition, for trips of five sections or more the Railways collect a special
charge of CFAF 10. Passenger fares on buses are approximately the same as
rail fares; like rail fares they are higher in remoter and less populated
places.
59.       The average receipt for passengers in 1964/65 was 2.33 CFAF per
Ian (USO 1.51 per mile). This low level was the result of a 28% cut in
fares implemented in 1962 to meet r-oad competition. Passenger fares are
now only 60% of their level nine years ago, at constant prices. Fares are
lower in Senegal than on other comparable African railways:
CFAF equivalent
per passenger/km
Abidjan-Niger                   2.38
Cameroons                       2.54
Congo-Ocean                     2.93
Mali                            3.83
60.       The fully distributed cost of passenger transport for 1964/65
is 3.49 OFAF per passenger/km, and the marginal cost 1.81 CFAF. The
Railways' management recognizes that the past trend of falling fares should
be reversed and some increases have recently been made. Further increases
of 15 per cent (at constant prices) spread over five years should be
feasible without loss of traffic. Average travel distance should-also in-
crease as the Railways lose suburban and gain long distance traffic. During
the credit negotiations the Government and the Railways have agreed to
increase passenger fares by 15% before June 30, 1971; a first raise of
about 5% will be implemented by not later than June 30, 1968. With in-
creases in fares and the traffic forecast (see paragraph 49) passenger
receipts would make a greater contribution to the Railways' finances.
G. Rail-Road Coordination Policy
61.       The traffic forecasts and proposed rate and fare adjustments are
believed to be feasible if the Government initiates a suitable transportation
coordination policy. The principles of such a policy are laid down in the
Government's Second Four-Year Plan.   It provides for studies to determine
for each product the cheapest transportation mode under conditions of fair
competition. It also calls for studies aimed at establishing a progressive
tax per truck axle and the control and regulation of road transport. Durinr'
the credit negotiations agreement was reached on a statement of Government
policy which provides for the development of road and rail modes of transport
in the most economical manner, so that the pattern of demand for transport
services and the division of traffic between road and rail reflect least
total economic cost solutions to particular distribution problems under con-
ditions of fair competition between the modes. Measures to implement the
coordination policy have also been agreed in broad terms and the Associat-cn
wzill be kept informed of progress.

II. Finances
62.      IWhen the Miali Federation was disbanded on September 1, 1960,
the assets and liabilities of the former Dakar-Niger Railways wera divided
according to a 62/38 ratio between Senegal and Mali. The 62 per cent of
the net assets attributed to Senegal formed the opening entries of Senegal
RailwJays books on Septem.ber 1, 1960. The net asset value amounted (after
subsequent adjustments) to CFAF 9,377 million (US;i 37.9 million). Of this
amount,CFAF 9,013 million became equity capital owned by the State of
Senegal and CFAF 364 million was loan capital,principally Senegal's share
of loans from IBRD and CCCE (Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique)
made to the former French West African Railways. This capital was re-
presented by fixed assets of CFAF 8,738 million (taken up at their net
book value), investments of CFAF 12 million and net working capital of
CFAF 627 million.
63.       The income and expenditure accounts of the Senegal Railways
and of the former Dakar-Niger Railways from 1958 to mid-1965 are repro-
duced in Table 3. Before the cessation of Mali traffic there had been
operating deficits, the operating ratio being 107 in 1959 and in the
first part of 1960; the last year of surplus was 1958, when the operating
ratio was 95.  Since September 1960 there have been further deficits as
follows:
Sept. 1960-   July 1962-    July 1963-  July 1964-
June 1962     June 1963     June 1964   June 1965

Met Deficit                 (2,013)       (1,023)       ( 419)      ( 522)
WJith the resumption of Mali traffic in mid-1963 the situation began to
improve, the inteirnational traffic being largely responsible for an
increase of some CFAF 870 million of gross revenue in 1963/64, whereas
expenditure rose by only about CFAF 100 million. However, cash generated
froin operations did not cover expenses in 1964/65; after depreciation the
operating deficit was CFAF 495 million, and the operating ratio was 121,
compared with 117 in the previous year.
64.       Between September 1960 and June 1965 the Railways' investment
expenditure totalled CF.gF 1,966 million. The financing of this expendi-
ture, and of the operational deficits during this period, was as follows:

6,179                                  6,179
State subventions only partially covered the deficits and the balance of
cash needs was met by Treasury advances.   External contributions for
investment were in the form of grants primarily from FED (Fonds Europeen
de Developpement) and FIDES (Fonds d'Investissement pour le Developpement
Economique et Social) with smaller amounts from FAC (Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation) and the Government. The resulting financial position is
shown in the balance sheet of the Railwiays as at June 30, 1965, reproduced
in Table 4, which may be surrnarized as follows:

65.       In spite of an apparently satisfactory current assets/liabili-
ties ratio of 1.4:1 the Railways have since 1960 suffered from a chronic
shortage of working capital. The net liquid position as of July 1, 1965,
which is used in the cash flow statement (see Table 8) is as follows:
CFAF million
Current liabilities                 974
less outstanding supplier credit
for 4 locomotives BB 1100
type which are included in
the proposed IDA credit       136
838
Liquid assets                       622
less bad debts to be written-off     44
-                       578
Shortage                                                   2o0
The sum of CFAF 586 million ow^ring to the Treasury is a consolidation of
advances to meet the Railways' perennial shortage of cash, that were made
in lieu of sufficient State subventions to cover operating deficits. During
the fiscal year 1965/66 special Treasury funds, totalling CFAIF 435 million,
were also made available to the Railways; the latter amount corresponds
approximately to receivables due from the Mali Railway and from Socopao (a
French trading concern which acts as the Mali Government agent in consigning
traffic to the Senegal Railways). The special advances are reimbursable as
and when the amounts due by the Mali Railway and by Socopao are paid to the
Senegal Railways.
66.       In addition, there is also a Treasury advance of CFAF 14 million
representing a payment made to Mali by the Senegal Government in the
division of assets of the Dakar-Niger Railways.   As agreed during the credit
negotiations, the Senegal Government has waived the latter claim and the
sum of CFAF 124 million has been incorporated in the Railways' equity.
67.       The present unsatisfactory position is due partly to the Mali
Railway's delay in reducing its debt, amounting to CFAF 239 million at
March 31, 1966, to a reasonable working 'Level. The resumption of inter-
national traffic improved the revenue figures but it has not as yet had a
full impact on the cash position, as the Senegal Railways, having incurred
higher operational expenses have not collected the total revenues due from
Mali. Measures to put this right, now and in the future, have been agreed
with the Mali Government and the Mali Railway (see paragraph 71 of the Mali
Railway Project Appraisal Report).
68.       Other action is being taken to improve the illiquid position.
The Government has granted the Railways a moratorium on the reimbursement
of and payment of interest, on the CFAF 586 million Treaslry advances. Re-
imbursement of principal and interest of the Treasury advances will be made
only to the extent that the Railways shall have revenues available after



- 19 -
having (i) met its debt service, (ii) established and maintained adequate
working capital, and (iii) financed its capital expenditures. As for the
future, during such time as the Railways' revenues may be insufficient to
meet the requirements listed above, the Government has agreed to provide
the Railways with funds in the forn of Treasury advances. The moratorium
clause mentioned above would also apply to these advances, which would
carry 1% interest charges.
69.       Other financial matters which were agreed during negotiations
are:
i)   Stores, at CFAF 723 million, which are excessive
and probably overvalued, will be reviewed and, if
necessary, written down to a realistic value.
ii)  Depreciation charges will in the future be cal-
culated by reference to replacement cost and
estimaated length of life of the fixed assets, in
accordance with the Railways' statutes.
70.       The auditing of the Railways' accounts is the responsibility
of the "Conission des Comptes de la Cour Supreme". This body, which
was recently set up, is organized along the lines of the "Cour des
Comptes" in France. It is totally independent from the Railways and
is suitably equipped to carry out its auditing function.
IV. THE INVESTMENT PLAN
A. Introduction
71.       The principal aims of the Railways' Second Four-Year Invest-
ment Plan (1965/66-1968/69) are:
i)   Renewal and modernization of traction, rolling
stock and equipment, to improve safety and
efficiency and reduce costs.
ii)  Provision of additional equipment to meet
higher levels of traffic in the future.
iii) Track renewal as part of a long-term program.



- 20 -
The contents of the Plan, as revised since its preparation in 1964,
have been agreed with the Association;   the Project covers those items in
the Plan that the Association considers to be of highest priority for the
Railways.
72.       The Plan calls for expenditure of CFAF 4,426 million (US$ 17.9
million equivalent), including approximately 10% contingencies. The
Project amounts to CFAF 3,431 million (US$ 13.9 million eauivalent) or
78% of the Plan. Details of the Project are given in Table 5 and are
summarized below:
CFAF billion         US$ million
equivalent
Track and Infrastructure                1.6                 6.5
Locomotives and Rolling Stock           1.3                 5.3
Materials, Equipment, Signalling
and Telecommunications                0.3                 1.2
Consulting Services and Con-
tingencies                           0.2                  0.9
3.4                13.9
73.       A detai'led list of the Project items to be financed by the pro-
posed IDA credit is given in Table 6 and in the summary below:

1,689      531  2,220     6.85    2.15   9.00
B. The Plan and the Project
74.       Items included in the Plan but excluded from the Project are:
i)  The rerailing of the Louga-Dahra line (90 km) with
26 kg/meter rails salvaged from the Khombole-Kaolack
line at an estimated cost of CFAF 315 million
(US$ 1.3 million equivalent).



- 21 -
ii)  The transfer of the Da'kar depot and ancillary facilities
from a congested area to the outskirts of the city. The
cost of the proposal is estimated at CFAF 415 milion
(US$ 1.7 million equivalent) and is expected to pay
partly for itself through the sale of the land that would
be made availab.e in town.
iii)  Miscellaneous construction items, including improvement
works at stations (CFAF 175 million or US$ 0.7 million
equivalent).
Although not without merit, these proposals are considered to be of lower
priority and they have therefore been excluded from the Project and from
IDA financing. Their total cost (including 10% cont-ngencies) is estima-
ted at about CFAF 1 billion, none in foreign exchange, to be financed
fully by the Railways.
C. Physical aspects of the Project
75.       Track renewal and improvement as a long-term program is essential
in the interests of safety and efficiency; before 1959 rene-wal of most of
the Mali section of the Dakar-Niger Railways had been accomplished, while
on the Senegal side it had just begun. Since then the Senegal Railways
have not commanded the funds necessary to embark on this work. Renewal
is planned for 30-40 hn a year and is to continue boyond the Second Plan
period. The Project includes the relaying writh 36 kg/metcr rails of the
heavily used Khcmbolc-Kaolack section (130 km), the completiorn of the
doubling of the Dakar-Thies line (8 lan) and the construction of the Dagoudane-
Pikine marshalling yard (10 kn) and the welding and ballasting bf about 147 Ian
of other lines.
76.       Locomotives. There are 11 in the Proj,ect, 8 line locomotives
and 3 shunting locomotives. Four line locomotives of the BB 1100 h.p.
type were delivered from France by mid-1965. This type of locomotive was
selected in the interest of standardization and is acceptable to the
Association. With respect to the other four line locomotives,the consul-
tants and the Association agree that the proposal of the Railways to acquire
CC 2L400 h.p. locomotives of a new and different design, mainly for phosphate
trains, is questionable and that six BB llCOs would be techlnically more
suitable. The Railways do not support this view and they have ordered
these locomotives from France at a total cost of CFAF 380 million (US$ 1.5
million equivalent) of which one is being financed by a grant from FAC
(French FondS d'Aide et de Cooperation). For the reason stated the four
CC 2400 locomotives are not included in the proposed IDA financing.
Out of these eight new line locomotives, four would replace in capacity
obsolete engines to be scrapped and the other four would be to meet the
expansion of traffic. In addition three shunters will be acquired for
heavy shunting operations.,



- 22 -
77.       Railcars and Trailers.  Five railcars and lb trailers are re-
quired for passenger transport to replace four railcars and six trailers
that are to be scrapped, and to provide increased capacity so that present
excessive overcrowding may be reduced.  No passenger cars will be bought.
78.       Freight Cars.  The 100 freight cars included in the Project will
be sufficient to meet requirements until 1968/69.
79.       The Project is technically sound except that the performance
under regular operating conditions of the four large locomotives, which
will not be financed from the proposed IDA credit, is as yet unproven.
The implementation of the Project should result in operating economies
and better safety, as described in the chapter "Economic Justification."
D. Proposed IDA Credit and Plan Financing
80.       The proposed IDA credit amounting to US$ 9.0 million (CFAF 2,220
million) would cover 65% of the Project total cost, or 50% of the Plan
total cost. The proposed credit would finance the Project's foreign ex-
change cost, excluding the four heavy locomotives and the part of the
track programalready financed by the FAC, and 40% of the Project's local
cost excluding import and custom duties. Financing more than the foreign
currency component of the Project is in accordance with the reconmendation
of the economic report AF4ha on "The Economy of Senegal", dated Niay 26,
1966, paragraphs 110-111. This arises from the limited possibilities for
expanding public saving to finance public sector inves-tment under the
Development Plan. A summary of the proposed financing of the Plan and
the Project is given below:
CFAF million           US$ million equivalent

- 23 -
81.       As agreed during the negotiations the Government has exempted the
Raiflways from the payment of any taxes or duties levied on the import of
goods to be financed by the proposed credit.
82.       During the negotiations it has been agreed that the proposed
credit funds will be relent by the Government to the Railways at the present
Bank interest rate (6% interest per annum and 3,'8 of 1% commitment charge on
undisbursed funds) for a term of 30 years (slightly less than the weighted
average useful life of the equipment in the Project), including a three-year
period of grace.
E. Project Execution and Procurement
83.       The award of contracts for procurement of the IDA-financed foreign
exchange items will be made following international competitive bidding, ex-
cept for the following items:
CFAF million
i)  Items already ordered and
partly delivered:
a)  4 locomotives BB 1100     176
b)  6 trailers                 h8
c)  breakdown crane            L5
269
ii) Items to be ordered:
Spare parts and part of
the workshop and mis-
cellaneous equipment                      8L
353
(US$ 1.L million equivalent)
The locomotives, trailers and parts have been or will be ordered in France on
grounds of standardization requirements. The order for the crane was placed
in Germany after limited international bidding.
8a.       The Project has been ready for some time;  it was studied by the
Association's consultants and was first appraised by an IDA mission late in
196L. However, since the Senegal and the Mali Railway Projects are inter-
dependent, the Association felt that it could not give further consideration
to the Project until satisfactory assurances had been obtained from the Mali
Government that the steps necessary to redress the economic and financial
situation had been or would be taken. Therefore, negotiations for the
Senegal Railways Project have been delayed. Mieanwhile, the Railways began
carrying out their Plan and obtained suppliers' credits for the items covered
in paragraph 83 Wi). In these circumstances, it is recommended that the
Association reimburse payments made by the Railways to the suppliers from
Januaryr 1, 1965. As agreed during the negotiations, the Railways a3re
m alc in g   arrangements with the suppliers for payment of the outstanding
balances on a cash basis so as to elinrinate further charges.



- 24 -
85.       The concrete ties for the Khombole-Kaolack line will be manu-
factured in the Rallways' workshops where the freight cars will also be
assembled;  track relaying, ballasting and rail welding will be carried out
by force account. All local materials (mainly ballast) will be procured
through local competitive bidding except for cement for which there is only
one local supplier whose prices are competitive w-lth imDorted cement, ex-
cluding import duties.
86.       The Railways are competent to carry out the Project.   Because the
financial and managerial responsibility for the execution of the Project
will rest with the Railways, a Project Agreement will be concluded between
the Railways and the Association. The Agreement provides that the Railways
will give priority to carrying out the Project, if necessary by deferment
of other wo-ks; it also provides for consultation with the Association
before the Railways would incur substantial capital expenditures outside the
agreed plan.
V. FUTURE EARNINGS AND FINANCES
A.  Forecast Operating Income and Expenditure
87.       The earnings prospects of the Railways depend for their reali-
zation on greatly improved revenue coupled with containment of operating
costs. Over the Second Four-Year Plan period 1965/66 to 1968/69, gross
revenue is forecast to increase 53% and operating expenses 11%; bj 1970/71,
two years after completion of the Project, the increases would be 64% and
12% respectively. A detailed income and expenditure forecast which incor-
porates the tariff increases mentioned in the chapter on Tariffs is_given
in Table 7, and notes on its compilation are in Annex A.   The forecast im-
provement in revenue would depend primarily on increases in freight traffic,
receipts from which are expected to rise from about CF.AF 1.44 billion in
1964/65 to CFAF 2.64 billion in 1968/69 and to CFAF 2.78 billion in 1970/71,
increases of 83% and 93% respectively. Revenue from passenger traffic should
rise simultaneously by 20% and 37%, from CFAF 0.68 billion in 196L/65 to
CFAF 0.82 billion in 1968/69 and to CFAF 0.94 billion in 1970/71.
88.       The following is a summary of operating revenue and expenditure
forecasts during the period 1965/66-1970/71:

17 Actual figures
2/ Based on actual figures of the first ten months of the fiscal year
In 1965/66 there would be a net loss of CFAF 2h2 million which in the
following year would be changed to a small net profit which should rapidly
increase in the following years. However, on a cash basis, i.e. before
depreciation, the Railways would cover all expenses, including interest and
have an excess of CFAF 158 million. The operatirag ratio, which was 121 in
1964/65, is expected to improve to 88 in 1968/69 and to 85 in 1970/71. The
interest earned and debt coverage ratios would be satisfactory frum 1966,'67.
The return on investment calculated on net operating revenue as a percentage
of the average net fixed assets should improve from -5.2% in 196L/65 to 3.8%
in 1968/69, at the end of the Second Four-Year Plan period, and to 5.0% in
1970/71, and may be expected to improve further in subsequent years. Rates
of return of 4% and 5% have been agreed during the negotiations as the goals
to be reached in 1968/69 and 1970/71 respectively and not less than 6% there-
after. It has also been agreed that should the Railways be in danger of
failing to achieve these goals they woxld propose the necessary measures,
including but without limitation tariff adjustments, to correct promptly the
situation, and the Government has agreed to approve them.
B. Forecast Cash Flow
89.       The cash flow forecast 1965-1971 is given in Table 8. The fore-
cast incorporates the financial actions explained in paragraphs 65-690, which
are surmarized below:
i)    Waiving of the CFAF 124 million claim by the
Treasury against the Railways.
ii)   Reimbursement by the Railways in 1966/67 and 1967/68
of the CFAF h35 million special Treasury advances.
iii) Treasury advances estimated at CFAF 815 million in
1966/67 and 1967/68 to correct the Railways' net
liquid position, and bring the working capital to an
adequate level in relation to the operating e-penses.



- 26 -
iv)  Moratorium for the amortization and interest charges
of the existing (CFAF 586 million) and filtture (CFAF
815 million) Treasury advanres until the Railways
operate at a profit and do not require the funds for
debt service, working capital or capital expenditures.
It is assumed that iMali will reduce its outstanding debt, as agreed during
the Mali credit negotiations, and that the sale of land referred to in
paragraph 74 (ii) will yield CFAF 300 million. The cash flow also makes
allowance for track relaying expenditures, estimated at CFAF 300 million a
year during the period 1969/71. Under these assumptions, the Senegal Rail-
ways will be able to meet their current liabilities, maintain adequate wiorking
capital, meet capital expenditures, and reimburse in full the Treasury ad-
vances by 1970/71.
907       The surmnary of the cash flow over the Second Four-Year Plan
period, and until 1970/71, is as follows:
------ CFAF million-------------

Total        6,000              7,892
The above table shows that the Railways' capital and cash requirements
during the Second Four-Year Plan period would be covered 40% from own funds,
21% from Treasury advances, and 37% from IDA lending. For the period
1965.41, the proportions would become 511, 16 and 28%;  and the track re-
laying program for the years 1969-71 would be carried out without further
borrowing.

C. Forecast Balance Sheets
91.       The forecast balance sheet position 1965-1971 is given in Table 9,
and may be summarized as follows:
CFAF million
6/30/65      6/30/69      6/30/71
Liquid assets                  622          730          820
Current liabilities            97L          603          610
Net working capital           (52)          127          210
Stores                         723          723          723
Net fixed assets and
investments               9,654        12,129       11,621
Total Assets     10,025        12,979       12,55S
Debt                           810        3,361        2,152
Equity                      9,215         9,618       10,402
Total Liabilities    10,025        12,979       12,55S
92.       Wlith the present illiquid position being rectified by the actions
summarized in paragraph 89, and applying all net surplus (deficit) to
reserves, the current ratio would improve by 1968/69 from 1.h to 2.h and the
liquid ratio from 0.6 to 1.2. The debt/equity ratio would change from 7/93
to 26/74 on the ful'l drawing of the proposed IDA credit, and thereafter
improve to 17/83 by 1971.
93.       Nlo allowance has been made for the recommended reduction of
stores from their present excessive level (see paragraph 69) because of
the uncertainties involved in this review and writing down to realistic
value.
VI.  ECONOIC JISTIFICATION
9LI.      About one-third of the Project expenditure is on main line track
renewal (see item 1 of Tables).   This renewal is essential, as part of a
long-term program, to ensure safety and to improve efficiency. The re-
maining Project expenditure is to provide the locomotives and rolling stock
and equipment necessary to operate efficiently at expected traffic levels.
Without track renewal the Railways would operate at costs which would in-
crease rapidly, and with the added dangers of derailings and breakdowns the
Railways would eventually have to close down. The merits of the proposed
expenditure therefore depend in the last analysis on the justification of
maintaining the Railways in operation.   This justification is examined below
as follows:



- 28 -
i)  For each sector of iine separately (paragraphs 95-98).
ii) For passenger services separately (paragraph 99).
iii) A comparison of rail versus road transport (paragraphs
'ICo -1oi) .
iv)  The economic return on the Project as a whole (paragrapi
102).
95.       The continued operation of the main line of the Senegal Railways
from Dakar to Kidira (643 km) is essential to Mali (see Mali Railway
appraisal), and the Mali international traffic on this line is profitable
even at the present time. It is also desirable to keep this line in
operation for the economic development of eastern Senegal, where there are
no Pll-weather trunk roads, About one-thi rd of the Project cost is for
this main line, and large capital expenditure in subsequent years is for
the completion of main line track renewal.    Two Project items are
concerned with the main line:   (i)  the  relaying of the Kho,ibole-Guinguineo
section (109 kr.), and (ii)   the completion of doubling the Dakar-Thies
section for 8 kin.
96.       The continued operation of the section of line from Taiba to
Thies (its junction with the main line) also is essential to carry the
Taiba phosphates(amounting to .9 million tons a Year in 1965/66).   Road
transnort carnot do this at the present time, and to switch to road woul.d
involve road construction and investment in a large fleet of trucks,
which would then operate at higher cost than the Railwrays.
97.       There remains the question of the econoric justification of
keeping in operation other branch lines. The longest section, from
Tivaouane to St. Louis (170 km), has been the subject of a report
published in December 1962 by a Group under the presidency of the
United Nations' EJiropean Corumission Transport Director, appointed by
the Senegal Government to study the coordination of transport in Senegal.
The conclusions reached by this Group, supported by an exhaustive and
complex cost analysis, weere that the econoric cost of transport on this
line was lower than by road transport. The same result was obtained on
several alternative assumptions of annual increases in traffic, and on
all capital and operating costs involved both in rail and road transport
discounted to a base year (1964) at various rates of interest.   The we_ding
and ballasting of the Tivaouane-Louga section (100 !cnn) is included in the
Project.
98.       The Diourbel-Touba branch (47 kn) gives access to grounXdnu.lt
cultivation districts, and the welding and ballasting of this section is
included in the Project.  The Guilguineo-Kaolac1k branch (21 km) requires
track renewal at a cost of about CFAF 190 million, which is included in
the Project and is necessary to keep the rail connection of this port and



- 29 -
second largest tommn in Senegal w-zith the main rail nett!ork, and hence
Tith the principal groundnut centers and with lIali.
99.       The expenditure proposed in the Project on rolling stoclk for
passenger traffic (OFAF 380 million) is justified, despite the recormen-
dation of the Group mentioned above that passenger services should be
progressively discontinued and no new investment in rolling stock for
passengers incurred.  The studies on which the Group based its conclusion
attempted to show that there was little difference in the economic costs
of road and rail for passengers. The Senegal Government did not accept
the validity of the Group's conclusions and the Association agrees with
the Government since passenger revenue at the present time is in excess
of the marginal costs of passenger services, and will continua to be so
even after inclusion in marginal costs of depreciation and interest charges
on the new passenger stock to be acquired.
100.      Comparative costs of freight by road and rail may be made by
reference to a study by BCEOM (Bureau Central d'Etudes pour les 3quipe-
ments d'Outre-Mer) on road costs in Senegal, which gave the following
figures derived from financial information supplied by road operators.
The figures refer to average cost of all road freight and do not include
profit:
Average Cost
per ton/km
--- CFAF ---
15-ton vehicle operated by large
concern (50 vehicles)                   6.60
5/7-ton vehicles operated by medium
concern (20 vehicles)                  i4.95
5-ton vehicle - one-man business           12.60
These figures serve to compare with rail costs on those sections of the
line wihere roads run alongside rail.  It is clear that,in general, road costs
are higher than rail costs, which were COAF 5.93 per ton/kn in 1964/65, but
in some cases, particularly for short hauls, road costs may be lower.
101.      The cost of completion of track renewal on the main line to
Kidira on the Mali frontier may be compared with that of building a road
from lIaleme, where the asphalted road now terminates, to Kidira as an
alternative means of transport to Mali.
CFAF million
Total costs of rail track renewal
(CFAF 8.5 million per kin, 555 Ian)         4,700
Cost of turning earth road into
asphalted 6 meter-wide road,
Maleme-Kidira (CFAF 7.2 million
per kam, 345 kkm)                       2,500



- 30 -
The difference in capital cost is CFAF 2,200 million. In 1969 when the
Mali traffic should have increased by 6015' to 190 million ton/km., the cost
per ton/km would be about CFAF 4.4o by rail and CFAF 6.60 by lowest
cost road transport. The difference of cost in favor of rail would thus
be CFAF 418 million, to which must be added a road/rail trarsshipment
cost of CFAF 350 per ton at the border, i.e., CFAF 105 million, making
CFAF 523 million in total. At this level of traffic, therefore, the
investment of the additional CFAF 2,200 million in rail transport
(in comparison with road construction) would earn a return of 25% from
the savings in rail transport costs. This calculation leaves out of
account the east Senegal traffic and the Mali passenger traffic, both
of which are of significance and growring, and therefore the return is
understated.  It makes it clear, hoiwever, that investment in rail track
renewal is justified on economic grounds, compared with the alternative
of constructing a road to the M<ali border.
102.      The economic return on the whole Project may be measured by
the decline in operating costs during the period.   In the two years 1963/4
and 196L/5 the average operating cost (excluding depreciation) per
traffic unit (one ton/kma of freight or 2 passenger/km) was CFAF 5.66.
In 1968/69,after the completion of the Project it would be CFAF 3.93.
On 1968/69 levels of traffic the savings in cost resulting from the
investment would be about CEAF 1,170 million.   The economic return on the
investment of CFAF 3,431 million over the average length of life of
the assets acquired would be 25%. However, there are several other
factors which affect the benefit calculations. On the one hand, they
make no allowance for the fact that without new investments operating
costs would rise because it would become increasingly more costly to
maintain the old equipment. On the other hand, certain operating im-
provements, such as a reduction in the labor force,
could be achieved without  new investments.   It has not been possible
to quantify these factors, but they tend to some extent to offset each
other, so that on balance the economic return on the project is
undoubtedly high.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECO1l.NENDATTON'S
103.      The 1965/66 - 1968/69 Senegal Railways Project provides for
track rene-al which is essential for the safety and future operation of
the Railways, and for renewal, modernization and expansion of rolling
stock and equipment rhich will increase efficiency, reduce costs and
enable the Rail-ways to meet the increases in traffic expected. The
Project is in general technically sound, of economic benefit to the
country and should bring about an improvement in the Railways' finances.



- 31 -
10h.      The Project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of
US$ 9.0 million equivalent to Senegal to be relent to the Railways;   a
Project Agreement would be concluded between the Association and the Sene-
gal Railways.

Notes on Forecast Operating Income and Expenditure (Table 7)
A. Income
1.        Passenger traffic receipts in 1964/05 were CFAF 2.33 per
passenger/km, including supplementary receipts for reservations, berths,
etc. (paragraph 59). In the forecast average receipts have been increased
to take account of the proposed 15% raise in fares (5% in 1968/69 and
10% in 1970/71).
2.        Passenger traffic amounted to 292 million passenger/km in 1964/65.
The average distance travelled per passenger was 91 km, as compared with
83 km in 1963/64; the average distance is expected to continue increasing
and to reach 100 km by 1970/71. Since the number of passengers is expec-ted
to remain at 3.5 million, passenger/km would rise to 350 million in 1970/
71, an increase of 3.3% per annum.
3.        Mali traffic is expected to increase from 186,000 tons in
1964/65 to 330,000 tons in 1970/71 (paragraph 41). On the bases of the
present average haul of 635 km and the present average receipt of CFAF 6.39
per ton/km, revenue would rise from CFAF 760 million in 1964/65 to CFAF1,339
million in 1970/71, an annual increase of 12%.
4.        Groundnut traffic in 1964/65 was 222,000 tons which, with an
average haul of 175 km, totalled 39 million ton/km. In the forecast,
the 1964/65 average receipts of CFAF 5.95 per ton/km have been increased
to CFAF 7.00 in 1966/67 and to CFAF 8.00 in the following years. As ex-
plained in paragraph 43 the average haul of groundnuts is expected7to rise
gradually and to reach 200 km by 1970/71. On the basis of an annual
allocation of 400,000 tons, groundnut traffic would rise to 80 million
ton/km in 1970/71 and revenue therefrum to CFAF 640 million.
5.        Revenue from phosphate traffic has been projected on the basis
of the present average hauls of 86 km for Thies and 112 km for Taiba, on
the producers' production forecasts, and at the present contract prices.
6.        Revenue from "other commodities" traffic (excluding less-than-
carload) takes account of recent rate reductions for certain commodities, a
gradual increase in the average haul from 191 km in 1964/65 to 200 km in
1970/71, and increasing tonnages rising from 125,000 in 1964/65 to 180,000
tons in 1970/71, which was about the 1962/63 level.
7.        Less-than-carload traffic is expected to remain over the period
at its 1964/65 level but revenue therefrom takes account of the increased
average receipt of CFAF 25 per ton/km as from February 1, 1966.
8.        Receipts from hire of traction to the iMali Railway will remain iiggh
in 1965/66 and 1966/67, but will tail off as i1iali becomes equipped with new

traction adequate for its operations.
9.        Miscellaneous revenue consists principally of reimbursement
by the Government of costs of railway police, traffic revenue such as
sidings charges, demurrage, etc. and rent.
B. Working Lrpenditure
10.       As explained  in paragraph 26 railway wages as a whole should
be static over the period but an annual increase of 2% has been allowed
for promotions and seniority increases.
11.       Seventy per cent of the train/km run in Senegal is for passenger
traffic. This traffic, although increasing over the period by 20% in
passenger/km, is not expected to require more train/km. The remaining
30% of train/km, for freight traffic, is expected to increase closely in
proportion to the forecast increase in ton/km, from 277 million in 1964/65
to 532 million in 1970/71, an increase of 92%. Fuel and lubricants costs
will increase accordingly, allowance being made for heavier phosphate
trains.
12.       Materials have been calculated from the forecast runs on similar
bases as explained above., allowance being made for the use of the new equip-
ment included in the Project.
13.       Miscellaneous expenditure is mainly for pensions and medical
care; these costs are not expected to rise substantially since the Railways
staff is not increasing.
C. Depreciation
14.       The depreciation charge in 1964/65 is adequate in relation to
the existing depreciable assets and the same amount has been included in
the forecast. In addition an annual 2-1/2% depreciation on the new
investments costs has been allowed, based on an average 40-year life of
the items included in the Plan.
D. Interest Charges
15.       They include (i)  charges for the remaining portion of the
Senegal share of the IBRD and CCCE loans (see paragraph 62), (ii) the
proposed IDA credit which will be relent by the Government to
the Railways at the present Bank terms (6% interest per annum and 3/8 of
1% conmitment charge on undisbursed funds) for 30 years including a
3-year period of grace, and (iii) an annual 1% charge on the Treasury
advances.

E. General
16.       No price escalation has been assumed in any of the financial
forecasts for the following reasons:
i)   Since the Railways wages and salaries are to be
static until their level is reached in the
other areas of Government employment, which
will take some time, it is assumed that in-
flationary factors will not affect the Rail-
ways' payroll and associated expenses (pensions,
etc.).
ii)  The operating expenses, other than i), are
mainly steel and fuel, the world prices of
which are expected to be stable in the fore-
seeable future. However, should there be
operating cost increases because of inflation,
tariff adjustments will be required above those
agreed; this possibility and the remedial
action thereon, have been discussed and agreed
with the Government and the Railways during the
credit negotiations (see paragraph 88).
