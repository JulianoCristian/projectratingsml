                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to enhance the country capacity for the prevention and control of infectious diseases that transmit between animals and
                         humans (zoonoses) under a One Health approach. This is a necessary first-step in reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases from animals to humans which will
                         also lead to increase livestock productivity and strengthen the livelihoods base for food insecure communities. This objective would be achieved through two types of
                         interventions: planning and preparedness; and prevention. If successful, the proposed project would contribute to reduce the burden of disease in animals, the
                         consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity attributable to animal and human infections in Nepal. In addition, this project will
                         specifically link up with the GAFSP-financed project that is being prepared in parallel, to support the realization of these outcomes in the mid- and far west regions of
                         Nepal . The project would also leverage with and contribute to enhancing the Climate Resilience Agriculture Management Information System, which is prepared by the
                         PPCR.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the project has not yet moved into implementation, no component wise progress or disbursements has been recorded yet. However, remarkable progress has been noted in
                         financial management and procurement activities, despite financial constraints. The Government of Nepal (GoN) releasing a one–third budget has put a lot of pressure on the team to
                         deliver the planned activities on time. The project teams have nevertheless been able to complete most of the preparatory ground work so that they will be able to start the planned

                         activities once the GoN releases the full budget, which is expected to happen in November 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         -        Currently there is no one from the MoHP side formally appointed to work on the human health component of the project. The WB team requested the Department of Health
                         Services (DoHS) of Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) to appoint a focal person to the Project Management Team (PMT) so that the procurement plan and the other activities
                         assigned under the MoHP, can commence at the earliest;
                         -        Communication gaps and often lack of active participation has been observed between ministries. Therefore, the WB team requested both the ministries and their respective
                         departments to work in close coordination with one another, as the collaboration is highly essential for the smooth implementation and the success of the project.
                         -        The Ministry of Finance (MoF), National Planning Commission (NPC) and the PMT discussed with the WB team the need for a longer term project that addresses the animal
                         and human health issues. The WB team agreed to hold consultations with the development partners active in the sector to gauge the interest of a joint support to the GoN.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
