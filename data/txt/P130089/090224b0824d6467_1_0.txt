                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to enhance the country capacity for the prevention and control of infectious diseases thattransmit between animals and humans
                         (zoonoses) under a One Health approach. This is a necessary first-step in reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases from animals to humans which will also lead
                         to increase livestock productivity and strengthen the livelihoods base for food insecure communities. This objective would be achieved through two types of
                         interventions: planning and preparedness; and prevention. If successful, the proposed project would contribute to reduce the burden of disease in animals, the
                         consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity attributable to animal and human infections in Nepal. In addition, this project will
                         specifically link up with the GAFSP-financed project that is being prepared in parallel, to supportthe realization of these outcomes in the mid- and far west regions of
                         Nepal . The project would also leverage with and contribute to enhancing the Climate Resilience Agriculture Management Information System, which is prepared by the
                         PPCR.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Grant Agreement for this trust fund was signed in June 2012. Late release of budget from the GoN by seven months and elections in November 2013, affected implementation.
                         Despite this, the project managed to register almost 98 per cent physical progress and 84.5 per cent disbursement as at April 2014. The PDO level indicators for the project were: 1)
                         prioritization of zoonotic diseases, and 2) development of a mechanism to share information on priority zoonotic diseases both of which have been achieved. Six zoonotic diseases

                         have been prioritized through a consultative process between the Department of Livestock Services, Department of Health, Universities, Nepal Agriculture Research Center and other
                         key stakeholder. Avian Influenza Surveillance Committee (AISC), Chaired by Chief, National Public Health Laboratory under the Department of Health, now includes Nepal
                         Agriculture Research Council in addition to Department of Livestock Services. AISC collects, analysis and reports information on zoonotic diseases to WHO, OIE and others
                         concerned in Nepal. At the field level, the terms of reference of the Regional and District Avian Influenza Technical Committee have been broadened to collectively monitor and report
                         zoonotic diseases. The project has made significant progress in terms of developing the DoLS capacity to survey, respond to and contain zoonotic diseases, the very objective of the
                         project. Since the project began in 2012, over 150 reported Avian Flu outbreaks were contained without a single case of human transmission to human beings. An assessment
                         carried out by FAO reported potential savings in the range of USD 200 million by saving potential losses and damages that would have incurred on the poultry industry.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project closed on March 31, 2014 after two years of operation.

                         The project picked up significant momentum in the last four months which has resulted in meeting the PDOs with substantial physical (98%) and financial (84.5%) progress. The
                         exchange rate at the time of project formulation and signing was NPR 80.33 to 1 USD. Since then there has been substantial appreciation of USD to NPR 95 to 97 to a Dollar.
                         Hence, savings of nearly USD 1.5 million. If the original exchange rate was to be used the disbursement would have been very close to hundred per cent.
