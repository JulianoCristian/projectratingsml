                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to enhance the country capacity for the prevention and control of infectious diseases thattransmit between animals and humans
                         (zoonoses) under a One Health approach. This is a necessary first-step in reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases from animals to humans which will also lead
                         to increase livestock productivity and strengthen the livelihoods base for food insecure communities. This objective would be achieved through two types of
                         interventions: planning and preparedness; and prevention. If successful, the proposed project would contribute to reduce the burden of disease in animals, the
                         consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity attributable to animal and human infections in Nepal. In addition, this project will
                         specifically link up with the GAFSP-financed project that is being prepared in parallel, to supportthe realization of these outcomes in the mid- and far west regions of
                         Nepal . The project would also leverage with and contribute to enhancing the Climate Resilience Agriculture Management Information System, which is prepared by the
                         PPCR.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite a late start due to slow release of budget from the GoN, the project is on track to achieve the project development objective. Progress to date includes the identification of 6
                         priority zoonotic diseases and 9 priority climate sensitive diseases. Nearly 8000 farmers have been trained on the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases, and an additional 600
                         farmers trained on bio-security measures. A total of 43,817 livestock were inspected at various quarantine posts. On the operational side, contracts have been awarded for almost all

                         meetings are held on regular basis (10 meetings to date) to review the progress and facilitate implementation forward. The project has disbursed USD 1.5 million and a withdrawal
                         application of USD 1.26 million has been submitted on August 19, 2013. Upon its clearance, the total disbursements will add up to USD 2.76 million ( i.e roughly 28% of total

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Verification of IEG results: The IEG conducted an assessment of AICP, a precursor to the NZCP. In order to verify the IEG observations on operations of laboratories, the WB team
                         travelled to the project supported laboratories in Chitwan and Pokhara to further check on the operational status, quality, cleanliness, staffing arrangements, equipment used. Upon
                         visiting the sites and discussing with the laboratory operators and officials, the mission provided additional information to complement the IEG findings. The rating was subsequently
                         revised from Moderately Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory, consistent with the rating of Implementation Completion Report (ICR).

                         Revision of Cost Tables: The Bank and the project teams reviewed the cost tables and requested the PMT to revise their planning and estimate in light of the tight timeline, priorities
                         and their current capacity. Allocations for the construction work, consulting services and operational work was agreed to be revised using the figures in the recent contracts as the

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                       Report No: ISR11567



                         basis of new estimates. Also, amounts allocated to trainings and capacity building activities and human health component will also be revised so that some of the funds can be freed
                         up and can be used for the implementation of other activities that visibly contributes to the achievement of the project development objectives. Upon careful revision of the costs, cost
                         reallocation across components and categories was proposed. The PMT has already prepared and submitted a revised cost table to the Bank for review and clearance.

                         Consolidation of training schedule: With roughly about 10 months remaining in the project life, many training activities on the capacity development plan remain outstanding. Planning
                         and implementing a training course is a time consuming activity and implementing 26 training courses in the remainder of the project was not seen to be feasible. Therefore, it was
                         agreed that the capacity building plan will be consolidated and trimmed down to focus on more priority trainings that can add value to the development objectives.

                         Technical advisory and implementation support: Although the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) mentions the possibility of engaging to support technical advisory, this has yet to
                         happen. Given NZCP is a ‘bridge’ to future livestock related projects, the technical advisory support of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is seen as relevant and critical.
                         Areas where FAO could immediately contribute include: the preparation of the One Health component under the ‘long term livestock proposal' ; and facilitate capacity development
                         through training and collaboration. Therefore the project team was suggested that they should consider seeking technical and advisory support from FAO in relevant areas, as
                         needed.

                         Long-term livestock project – The Bank and PMT had discussions regarding a potential long term project in livestock that targets innovative and transformational opportunities to
                         respond to development goals; and which addresses gaps and adds value to past and current projects. In order to address this, the Bank team suggested the PMT that a consulting
                         group should be hired to facilitate the preparation. In response to that, the project team prepared a draft Terms of Reference (ToR), which is currently under Bank's review.
