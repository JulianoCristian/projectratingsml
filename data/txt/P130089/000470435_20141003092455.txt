F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document):

The Project development objective of the proposed project was to enhance the country capacity for the
prevention and control of infectious diseases that transmit between animals and humans (zoonoses) under a One
Health approach4. This is a necessary first-step in reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases from animals
to humans which will also lead to increase livestock productivity and strengthen the livelihoods base for food
insecure communities. This objective would be achieved through two types of interventions: planning and
preparedness; and prevention.5 If successful, the proposed project would contribute to reduce the burden of
disease in animals, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity
attributable to animal and human infections in Nepal.

(a)   PDO Indicators
            Indicator                    Baseline Value                     Original Target Values          Actual Values Achieved
                                                                         (from approval documents)              at Completion
Indicator 1:                      Priority zoonoses identified and prevention and control plan developed for animals
                                  and humans
Value (Number)                             1 of 6 (17%)                    5 of 6 (83%)                    6 of 6 (100%)
Date achieved                               31/07/2011                      05/07/2012                       31/03/2014
Comments (% achievement)          The PAD results framework reflects yearly targets instead of cumulative targets. The current
                                  TTL has confirmed this with the appraisal TTL. Results reflected in this ICR reflect
                                  achievement against cumulative targets, which were calculated from the PAD. The objective
                                  was 100% achieved based on project developed surveillance plans for 6 ZDs (3 per year with
                                  2 years of implementation). The project contained 216 Outbreaks in poultry during the project
                                  period. There was no transmission to humans.
Indicator 2:                      Mechanisms developed to share information on priority zoonoses (mitigation and outbreak)
                                  among DOLS, DOHS, and NARC
Value (Yes/No)                    Partial (mechanism between      Yes (data and information       Yes
                                  DOLS and DOHS for HPAI)         shared among three agencies
                                                                  for three priority diseases)

  The One Health (OH) targets to reduce the risk of infectious diseases at the animal-human ecosystem interface nationally, regionally and
internationally. The approach propose an interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral, integrated multi-partner approach to surveillance, monitoring,
response, control, mitigation and prevention of emerging and infectious diseases, as well as to ecosystems health.

  While earlier GPAI projects typically included response as one of the interventions, this project focused on a more systemic approach
based on prevention and preparedness and planning. This is because the AICP developed and tested rapid response mechanisms by
successfully containing several avian influenza outbreaks in Nepal and should containment be required these mechanisms would be used
for zoonotic disease outbreaks.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives [or Global Environment Objectives] and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Nepal is a landlocked Himalayan country of 27 million people, bordering India and China. The GDP
growth rate has increased to more than 4.3% over the last three years. Nepal is one of the least developed
countries with an annual income per capita of USD 700. There is a strong trend towards rapid urbanization at an
annual growth rate of 3.8% and this together with rising incomes has led to increased demand for meat.

2.      The livestock sub-sector contributes about 26% of agriculture GDP, with an estimate of 24.5 million
poultry, 11.8 million cattle and buffalos, and 9.3 million goats and sheep. There is a high incidence of infectious
diseases which constrain productivity and cause severe losses. Many of these diseases are zoonotic and therefore
pose a threat to human health which could reduce income and even cause loss of lives. Climate change with rise
in temperature and extreme weather events has also been associated with increased disease risk.

3.      In 2012, Nepal was at high risk of avian influenza outbreaks in poultry because of reported outbreaks in
wild birds and domestic poultry in India. The border controls were limited both for animals and humans. Avian
Influenza detection and control capacity, both in animals and humans, had been significantly strengthened with
funding from the Bank and other development partners. The Bank supported the Department of Livestock
Services (DOLS) and the Department of Health Services (DOHS) through the Avian Influenza Control Project
(AICP – P100342) between 2007 and 2011. Pandemic preparedness had improved and gains in collaborative
zoonotic disease control and preparedness were made but they had not been fully institutionalized and were at risk
to decline over time with ceasing funding. The Bank intended to continue its support to address these issues
through the One Health approach. This approach aims to address zoonotic diseases by linking animal health,
human health, and ecological factors.

4.       The project supported Pillar II of the Nepal Interim Strategy Note for FY12-13, reducing vulnerabilities
and improving resilience, by building GON capacity in preventing and controlling zoonotic diseases. It would
reduce the likelihood of incidence of such diseases and complement the proposed Agriculture and Food Security
Project (to be financed by GAFSP) by improving animal and human health, rural livelihoods, and food and
nutritional security. The project would also support ISN's second cross cutting theme, fostering gender equality
and social inclusion, given that about 50 percent of rural households keep poultry and other livestock in their
backyard. Approximately, 30 percent rural households with backyard poultry belong to Dalits and Janajati, which
are the most disadvantaged social groups. The proposed project would have inclusive outreach in animal and
human health service delivery by complementing the IDA-financed Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF). It would
engage PAF’s Village Organization (VOs) in livestock husbandry into prevention activities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO)
5.      The objective of the project was to enhance Nepal’s capacity for the prevention and control of infectious
diseases that transmit between animals and humans (zoonosis) under a One Health approach.
Revised PDO:
6.      The PDO and Key Indicators remained unchanged throughout the project period.

1.3 Main Beneficiaries
7.       The project was intended to directly benefit the farmers and the rural population whose livestock is
threatened by zoonotic diseases (ZD) and who depend on livestock for their livelihoods, food security and
nutrition. In addition, the project aimed to strengthen the key government agencies involved in prevention and




                                                        1
control of zoonotic diseases, protect consumers of livestock products and the public at large from infection, and
contribute to the wider global public good of mitigating the risk of pandemics.

1.4 Original Components
8.     The project consisted of four components: (a) animal health, (b) climate sensitive disease risk mitigation,
(c) human health, and (d) communication. The total project cost was US$10 million.
9.      Component A. Animal Health (US$5.4 million) to further enhance capacity to control AI and broaden
the scope to control a wider set of ZD. This component was implemented by DOLS and comprised 4 sub-
components: (1) institutional capacity, (2) capacity building in surveillance and diagnostics, (3) strengthening live
animal markets, and (4) project management unit:
         Sub-component A.1: Institutional capacity to support development of veterinary legislation for
          prevention and control of animal diseases; to develop a “One Health” strategy and action plan; to identify
          key infectious diseases in relation to climate change (component B) and their impact on animal and
          human health.
         Sub-component A.2: Surveillance and diagnosis to refurbish laboratories, provision of equipment and
          to train staff.
         Sub-component A.3: Strengthening live animal markets via response and control capacity building:
          Modernization of live bird markets, biosecurity awareness raising and upgrading of quarantine facilities.
         Sub-component A.3: Project management unit to support overall project implementation. Project
          management was the responsibility of DOLS, which hired consultants to assist in financial management,
          procurement and monitoring.
10.     Component B. Climate Sensitive Disease Risk Mitigation (US$2 million) to support building livestock
climate resilience by benchmarking priority climate sensitive infectious diseases. This component was
implemented by NARC, which introduced the innovative climate change mitigation instruments under the ‘One
Health’ approach such as improving climate impact assessment on diseases and concrete interventions to mitigate
climate risk.
11.      Component C. Human Health (US$2 million) to support enhanced surveillance, diagnostics, and case
management of priority zoonotic diseases in humans. More specifically the component was to strengthen sentinel
sites7 by equipping them with adequate diagnostic facilities, training public health workers on zoonotic disease
prevention and control and to assess the prevalence of zoonotic diseases in humans. The component was to
complement an on-going IDA-financed project (National Health Sector Program (P117417) by strengthening
collaboration with DOLS. This included linking of an Animal Health Information System (AHIS) in DOLS
(component A) with the Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS) of DOHS. The component was
implemented by DOHS.
12.     Component D. Communication (US$0.6 million). This cross-cutting component, which was managed
by DOLS, was to support communication activities for zoonotic disease control. This included the provision of
technical assistance to support DOLS and DOHS to revise their AI communication strategy to encompass priority
zoonotic diseases and implement awareness raising campaigns.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
13.     The rationale for the project and for Bank involvement was strong, and the PAD provided solid analysis
of the background issues to justify Bank involvement. The PAD underscored the relevance by stressing that the

7
 The target was 40 Sentinel survey sites of which 36 were identified and developed by AICP. Sentinel sites are hospital
based.


                                                             2
project would enhance the capacity of Nepal for the coordination, preparedness, and prevention of the zoonotic
diseases. Further to enhanced inter-sectoral coordination, the project was envisaged as an instrument to promote
awareness and to develop early warning mechanisms to mitigate climate change induced livestock disease risks.
14.      The design benefited from the lessons learned during the design and implementation of the national
(AICP) and regional (capacity development, surveillance and creation of the OH Hub) projects. For example,
several activities to be supported by NZCP (e.g. the 36 out of the existing 40 sentinel district surveillance sites)
were developed by AICP. The appraisal team was cognizant of the significant risk facing implementation and
designed NZCP to mitigate those risks as much as possible. NZCP built on the achievements, organization, and
management structure of AICP. Those government officials who had been deputed to AICP, were continued for
NZCP. This proved prescient when GON funds were delayed in the first year because non-procurement-related
activities could continue with staff familiar with the program’s goals and Bank processes. Similarly, by building
on existing institutional arrangements for inter-ministerial coordination (Steering and Technical committees),
NZCP increased the likelihood of achieving the expanded agenda of surveillance and response to key zoonoses.
The capacity of the implementing agency was assuaged by designing in a technical assistance team for
procurement, financial management, and other critical functions.
15.     The project used sector investment lending (SIL) instrument and was financed by a grant from the Avian
Human Influenza Facility (AHIF). The AHIF was administered by the World Bank and was established with
contributions from various bilateral and multilateral donors, including European Commission. Since the AHIF
Trust Fund was scheduled to close on June 30, 2014 (without any possibility for extension), the Government of
Nepal had to prepare the project in a very short time (2 months) to take advantage of the AHIF before its closing.

2.2 Implementation
16.     The project was approved in July 2012, but release of the budget from GoN was delayed during the first
year of the project. Actual disbursements began in January 2013, and the resultant completion of civil works and
delivery of goods were completed during the grace period. However, project activities that did not require
procurement—such as, planning project implementation, Technical Committee and Steering Committee meetings8
of which there were 30 and 9 respectively. This was made possible because the national staff that managed AICP
was transferred to the new project while they remained on their respective government payrolls. Disbursement
was accelerated by reallocating funds from international level training to a compensation cost category for GON’s
culling and compensation policy and completion of civil works towards the end of the project. Implementation
progressed rapidly in the last few months before project closing in March 2014. However, US$1.54 million had to
be cancelled at project closing in May 2014. This was a result of a substantial US$ appreciation against the NRS.9
17.    In addition to the national project staff released to the project from their respective departments (DOLS,
NARC and DOHS) the project was supported by a number of subject matter specialists (consultants) for:
procurement, finance management, training and curriculum development, engineering, environmental screening
and M&E. This team of experts provided technical backstopping and facilitation.
18.     By the time of the ICR mission in May 2014, most of the project activities were completed. During
implementation, the project was subject to three implementation reviews (October 2011; June 2013 and January
2013) and a WB commissioned independent assessment through the FAO Investment Centre. The assessment
revealed that significiant technical capacity to control zoonotic diseases has been built by the WB and other
development partners. Economic analysis showed significant returns on the investment in AI control capacity.
However, the need to reduce GON’s dependency on development partners for funds to sustain the operational
costs of its veterinary services for zoonosis disease control was highlighted along with the recommendation for

 The exchange rate at the time of project formulation and signing was NPR 80.33 to 1 USD. Since then there has been
substantial appreciation of one USD to NPR 95-97, which led to a savings of nearly USD 1.5 million. If the original
exchange rate was to be used the disbursement would have been very close to hundred percent.


                                                              3
revision of compensation for culled birds to reflect market value. The assessment also advised on continued
support to a One Health approach within the framework of a larger livestock development initiative.
19.      Despite the late start, the project achieved and exceeded all of its key targets, namely: understanding the
prevalence of zoonotic diseases10 and climate sensitive zoonotic diseases (ZDs), using data collected from 12
research sites,11 and identification of eight ZDs.12 These activities related to sharing information of priority ZDs;
training in biosecurity of zoonoses through awareness building, AI prevention and control, inspection of livestock
at a number of quarantine posts; construction of additional space for laboratories; collection of epidemiological
data on enlisted ZDs; human health diagnostic test results; laboratory tests results on climate sensitive animal
diseases; construction of drug warehouse and administration facilities or upgrading in addition to the creation and
support of networks—e.g., national AI surveillance networks; training and prevision of compensation to
encourage reporting and culling. The benefits of reallocating funds from training to provision of cash
compensation to encourage poultry producers to report and cull suspected stock was discussed, but the magnitude
of benefits need to assessed. The provision of USD 886,000 for culling and compensation operations also led to
earmarking of compensation funds within the GON budget (NR 110.0 million in 2013). A policy supportive of
compensation has been initiated but leaves room for improvement to reduce farmers’ reporting disincentives. In
spite of the tight and very short implementation period (2 years according to PAD; but actually 15 months from
disbursement of funds to project closing) and the short grace period of only one month for disbursement,13 the
project accomplished all of its planned activities except for few activities such as reporting of test results,
functioning of upgraded laboratories, and closed without pending audit or financial reports. Contributing factors
to this success include the dedication of the Project Manager and his close collaboration with the country based
WB’s TTL and specialized administrative support staff; continuity of the AICP project management and staff;
commitment of the GoN and its provision of advance resources to allow for project startup and planning; and the
recruitment of capable subject matter consultants, in particular the M&E senior consultant.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design Implementation and Utilization
20.     The M&E system, which was developed during AICP, was located at the DOLS. The M&E and Planning
Unit provided technical support, capacity development and training in the use of the standard reporting templates
to the M&E staff in each of the three implementation agencies (DOLS, NARC and DOHS). Each implementing
partner monitored the outcomes and outputs of its component and reported the progress to the M&E Unit. In
addition the Unit was instrumental in identifying bottlenecks in disbursement and implementation, and supported
the Project Steering Committee (SC) and the Project Technical Committee (TC) through sharing information,
technical support and administrative advice. Overall, all planned targets of the visits, inspections, observations,
meetings, data collection and timely reporting were satisfactorily achieved and exceeded the targets (e.g. total of
725 monitoring activities were completed compared to 535 planned).

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

      Safeguards and Outbreak Containment Management
21.      The Project was category Type B on environmental safeguards.14 This, as with the assessment for its

12
   Information based on discussion with Project Management and national staff. The nine criteria used by the national team for identifying
the priority ZDs were selected from 52 used collectively by a number of countries. The nine criteria used are: Food Safety, morbidity,
fertility rates, zero prevalence, risk of emergence, neglected zoonotic, enzootic, global importance and finance resources nationally
available for control. The identification process followed included selection by a technical committee, presentation at a multi-sectoral
technical and other stakeholder workshop. Based on the outcome of the workshop the 6 ZDs and two (brucellosis and TB) were identified
as the priority ZDs.

   This was a condition from the Trust Fund.

predecessor AICP, was based on the updated Environmental Management Plan (EMP)15 prepared by the DOLS in
200616 The EMP (2012/3- 2013/4)17 was developed to identify the potential impacts and establish the mitigation
measures associated with the nine construction works (construction and renovation sites). These included severe
potential impacts (such as air pollution, contaminated sewage water, and exposure to chemicals) as well as minor
impacts (such as noise and dust). The EMP also proposed and the project implemented the construction of
livestock markets with provisions for lined pits for biological waste, fencing, toilets, and drainage. The other
implementation partner (DOHS) applied the health care waste management plan developed in June 2006 for the
Nepal Health Sector Program (a SWAp supported by IDA and other partners). Overall application of the
mitigation and safety measures as well as contaminant management on all of the construction sites was found
moderately satisfactory.
22.      The response of NZCP to the 216 HPAI outbreaks in 2013 was within the framework of the outbreak
containment procedures organized for each affected district through the District Avian Influenza Technical
Committee (DAITEC).18 The containment focused mainly on culling and disposal of 1.7 million birds in twelve
sites (disposal pits). Safety measures included groundwater quality testing for presence of AI virus near the
disposal pits. No water contamination with AI virus was reported.

    Financial management (FM)
23.      Although there was a gap of 12 months19 between the closing of AICP and the start of disbursements
under NZCP (July 2011 – June 2012), the dedicated project personnel who are regular GoN employees -continued
working in the planning and preparation of the NZCP. Some units also advanced GoN financial resources.
Limiting the disbursement grace period to only one month, which was a condition from the Trust Fund, was a
further challenge. The FM capacity was strengthened over time with the recruitment of Procurement, Finance and
M &E consultants. Among the three implementing agencies, DOLS and NARC performed better, while DOHS
was not as proactive and slow in implementation for most part of the project period. However, having only one
well-coordinated FM system for the whole project contributed to timely resolution of any delays caused by
DOHS. At the time of project closure (including the one month grace period) disbursement was USD 8.46 million
(85%) of the grant (table 1).

     Procurement
24.     The NZCP was a procurement intensive project. However, the limited implementation period (only 15
months available for bidding and executing procurement contracts) and the very short grace period for
disbursements (only one month) were major challenges. A further challenge was quality control. However, both
issues were resolved effectively by hiring the procurement and quality control consultants, and the close follow-
up and consultation between the World Bank Team and the project staff. As a result the procurement capacity

   Environmental safeguards have been mainstreamed in the Bird Flu Investigation, Prevention and Control Guidelines/Standard Operating
Procedures used by the Government (and formerly used for AICP) so that should any plans, studies or other project activities suggest or
propose activities with environmental implications, there will be consideration for environmental implications in the study or plan itself.

was strengthened and improved, leading to successful planning, preparation of procurement documents and
implementing procurement activities on time. All procurements (the construction works, training and capacity
development and laboratory tests on collected samples) were completed by or before March 14, 2014, and a
detailed procurement status was available for the ICR Team for review upon their arrival.

2.5 Post Completion Operation
25.     NZCP implementation was internalized within the existing government structure. The NZCP Steering
Committee (SC) and Technical Committee (TC) evolved to permanent governance and advisory bodies that
function through regular meetings (the SC meets three times each year; whereas the TC meets on a weekly basis
and also responds to emergencies). In addition, the Project Manager and selected staff members were transferred
to a permanent coordination body (The AI Control Program) under direct supervision of the DG of DOLS.
NRS 200 million have already been allocated for this function in 2013-2014 (including 50 percent for culling
compensation) and an additional NRS 100 million earmarked for 2014-2015.
26.      One of the indicators of achievement of the PDO is the current coordination activity between DOLS and
DOHS aiming to establish a One Health (OH) Hub. Actions to establish the OH Hub culminated, less than two
months after the closure of NZCP, in the formation of an OH Hub Committee (OHHC) comprising the relevant
staff from DOLS and DOHS (25 members). Based on the recommendations of the OHHC two OH Secretariats
(OHS) were established, one in each of the two departments under the direct management of the OHHC Focal
points (Focal point for DOLS Dr. Vijay Kant Jha Programme Manager Directorate of Animal Health, and Focal
Point for DOHS, Dr. Baburam Marasini, Director Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (ECDC)). The
meeting held on 16 May 2014 designated a six-people OH Guideline Drafting Committee (OHGDC) with specific
responsibility to draft the guidelines in three months for submission to the review and ratification by the Council
of Ministers. The Committee (3 from each department) will have an office at DOLS and be chaired by a Senior
Zoonosis Officer at DOHS. Five out of the six OHGC were directly involved in NZCP as trainees and as
operators/ managers of the restored laboratories and other facilities.
27.      Furthermore, capitalizing on the PDO outcome, and with the objective to scale up the project
interventions, a NZCP facilitated the development of a Concept Note for a larger livestock project. The leadership
for the preparation of the concept note was undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture Development. The concept
note aims mainly at filling the gaps identified by the OIE PVS, aligns with the Agriculture Development Strategy
(ADS) and will directly benefit from the significant institutional and infrastructural capacities20 developed through
NZCP. For example, the construction of the Quarantine station at the border21 of India and Nepal will facilitate
and speed up inspection and vaccination of livestock imported from India and will provide the District Veterinary
Office staff with a safe and efficient working environment.

3.       Assessment of Outcome

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
28.     The relevance of NZCP’s objectives, design and implementation were high. The objective remained
relevant to the Nepal Interim Strategy Note (ISN 63381) for FY 2012-13 which supported three pillars: (i)
enhancing productivity for growth, (ii) reducing vulnerabilities and improving resilience (iii) promoting access to
better quality services. NZCP supported pillar (ii) by building capacity in prevention and control of zoonotic
diseases. NZCP also reduced the likelihood and prevalence of zoonotic diseases which enables increased
productivity of livestock and thereby contributes to the ongoing WB supported initiatives such as the Agriculture
and Food Security Project, currently being implemented in 19 districts in West Nepal. The ISN cross cutting
theme of ‘fostering gender equality and social inclusion’ was attended by providing livestock health services to

rural households in which mainly women are keeping poultry. The World Bank’s draft Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Nepal identifies agricultural sector development, including livestock, as a priority. At the
global policy level, the World Bank has developed strategy documents related to One Health with the objective to
operationalize this approach. NZCP has implemented ZD prevention and control capacity building activities
under a One Health approach, which has led to a policy process of institutionalizing the approach in the GON
public and veterinary health service agencies.
29.     The project design remained relevant in building ZD prevention and control capacity as well as
supporting emergency operations. NZCP played a key role in containing 216 outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza H5N1. The World Bank’s implementation assistance was responsive to changing needs and that
the operation remained important. Three budget revisions were approved by the World Bank to adjust
procurement plans to changing requirements and to reallocate funding from training to a compensation cost
category. GON’s culling and compensation policy required substantial funding during the AI in 2013.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
30.       Project achievement rating: The PDO was substantially achieved.
31.     The Project achieved its PDO to enhance Nepal’s capacity to prevent and control ZDs under the OH
approach. This was achieved in a record short time (15 months of practical implementation period) by building
upon the institutional and organization structure of AICP and the commitment and expertise of the project staff.
The project was successful in coordinating the planned activities of three components (Animal Health, Climate
Sensitive Disease Risk Mitigation, Human Health) implemented by three sectoral partners, as well as the cross
cutting component dedicated to supporting communication and information sharing through raising awareness on
preventive practices, risk communication, Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveys and institutional
capacity building.
32.       The targeted values for the two measurable indicators were reached as follows:
      a) Confirming the six ZDs identified during project preparation (HPAI, Brucellosis, Leptospirosis,
         Toxoplasmosis, Cysticercosis, Hydatidosis (or Echinococcosis). through participatory multi-stakeholder
         assessment as described in section 2.2 Implementation. Also two additional priority ZDs (TB and Rabies)
         as well as Blue Tongue and GI Nematodes were identified. Surveillance control plans were formulated for
         the eight ZDs.
      b) Mechanisms for communication and information sharing at the national level and in the 75 districts
         developed and data collection has begun at national and district levels. The National AI Information
         Committee (NAIC) was redefined to include all ZDs.22 In addition to DOLS and DOHS the committee
         includes representatives of NARC and FAO (ECTAD-RSU).
      c) Enhanced coordination activity between DOLS and DOHS and confirmed measures to establish a One
         Health Hub (as detailed in section 2.5 Project Completion Operation)
33.     Capacity enhancement: The capacity enhancement targets for prevention and control of infectious
diseases were achieved building on the infrastructure developed by AICP. Indicators include:
         training, communication outreach, and awareness building of 54,139 (28,549 and 25,593, respectively)
          farmers in 75 districts of whom 9,717 were female participants (40% of the targeted number), which


22
   The newly emerged National Zoonoses Information Committee (NZIC) continued functioning after closing of NZCP with the same
organization as during project implementation (membership of DOLS, DOHS, NARC and ECTAD-RSU). NZIC is currently chaired by Dr.
Gita Shakya Director of the National Public Health Laboratory and membership of Manager of NZCP, AH Director of NARC, Director of
AH at DOLS, Director of Veterinary Public Health Coordinator. NZIC holds periodic meetings to share information. Although both DOHS
and DOLS have or are in the process of planning Computerized Information Management Structures (HHIS and AHIS, located at the
directorate of Public Health and Veterinary Epidemiology Center -VEC, respectively), information sharing of NZIC is still managed
through emails, messages and verbal communication.

         (as detailed in Section 2.2. Implementation above);
        benefits from capacity/ institutional enhancement were reflected in the inspection of 14,506 animals
         (more than double appraisal goal of inspecting 7000 livestock) at the model service centers;
        inspection of 14,506 livestock at model service centers and quarantine offices by project closing;
        In direct response to the poverty alleviation strategy 1243 PAF 24 Group farmers received training in
         biosecurity (exceeding the target of 1,000);
        establishment of 6 ZD surveillance plans;
        development of a system for collection/ monitoring incidence / case prevalence of priority ZDs;25
        identification of climate sensitive HPEDs by NARC;
        implementation of surveillance from 40 sentinel surveillance sites in the districts;26
        implementation of the poultry culling compensation plans and the possibilities that the approach will be
         sustained and improved; and
        increased awareness of prevention and control of priority ZDs among human health workers and general
         public as indicated by comparing pre and post KAP survey. Although the difference was very minor
         considering the very short time (two months) between the two surveys, there was a change in knowledge,
         attitude and practices (pre: 44.31 percent, 56.31 percent and 40.61 percent, versus post: 42.16 percent,
         58.78 percent and 45.27 percent for K, A and P respectively).

3.3 Efficiency
34.     The project’s efficiency was high. The economic analysis (detailed in Annex 3) related the total disbursed
project costs of USD 8.46 million to the benefits derived from the economic value stream of HPAI losses, which
were avoided from project activities in the poultry industry. This was expressed as the expected value of the
economic loss avoided from HPAI outbreaks during the two year period of project implementation (2013-14).
The actually occurred HPAI losses were assessed under the ‘with project’ scenario. Under the ‘without project’
scenario, widespread HPAI in poultry and some transmission to humans with doubling of HPAI losses was
assumed. A NPV of USD 98 million was calculated for the NZCP investment.
35.      Strong veterinary and public health service capacity is a public good and a crucially important factor in
controlling ZD such as HPAI. NZCP funding was certainly effective in strengthening the ZD control capacity and
benefits to this investment can be derived from the control of a wide array of animal diseases with knock-on effect
beyond the agricultural sector. Attributing the benefits of controlling a single disease to the costs of building and
maintaining effective veterinary and public health infrastructure would significantly underestimate the benefits of
veterinary and public health capacity development. The economic analysis in Annex 3 focuses on the assessment
of HPAI losses during NZCP. Assessed HPAI losses illustrate the economic return of strong veterinary and public
health service capacity.


23
   This number also adds on to the number of 217,082 achieved by AICP
24
   Poverty Alleviation Fund
25
   The system was developed and the first results of the sero/fecal /case surveillance were produced.
26
   20 of the sentinel surveillance sites were already functioning before the initiation of the AICP. NZCP established 16
additional sites. Further 5 sites have already been planned nest year from the GoN fiscal budget


                                                               8
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
36.      Overall rating: Satisfactory
37.      Overall the project has been rated as Satisfactory with PDO substantially achieved. This classification
rating is justified because the PDO and project design were and remain relevant. Both PDO indicators were
achieved or exceeded, as was the number of project beneficiaries targeted for outreach. In addition, 6 of the 7
intermediate outcome indicators were met or exceeded. The PDO was substantially achieved, with the One Health
approach established within government systems, and an operational protocol for inter-agency cooperation is
operable. The government response to the 2013 HPAI outbreak exemplifies the efficacy of the system. These
outcomes were delivered despite a delay in release of the funds by GON, which shortened the implementation
period from two years to 15 months. Sustainability of the project interventions are likely as the interventions are
integrated into government systems, even the culling compensation plan, which is now financed by GON.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

    i) Poverty Impact, Gender Aspects and Social development
38.      The project was developed within the context of supporting the FY12-13 Nepal Interim Strategy Note
(ISN)’s second pillar “reducing vulnerabilities and improving resilience” and its second cross cutting theme,
"fostering gender equality and social inclusion". These targets were achieved because preventing or reducing
disease afflicted losses of poultry and other livestock have directly benefited the smallholders and poor backyard
poultry and livestock producers who represent 50% of the rural households, among whom approximately 30% of
the households belong to Dalits and Janajati disadvantaged ethnic groups who live below the poverty line. The
project had an outreach in animal and human health service delivery by complementing the IDA-financed Poverty
Alleviation Fund (PAF). The outreach was through engaging PAF’s farmers in training on biosecurity. This
activity was achieved through training 1,240 (240 above the 1,000 target). In addition most of the trained farmers
or those who benefited from awareness building (total 54,139 farmers) or the rapid deployment in the 216
outbreak sites in the high-risk districts were poor backyard poultry producers. Female participants in training
were relatively significant (9,717 or about 40% of the target estimated during appraisal).

      (ii) Institutional Change/Strengthening
39.      The NZCP contributed to further enhancement of the capacities of DOLS and DOHS in preventing and
controlling zoonotic diseases. The project embarked successfully in the implementation of a very extensive
training program. This was supported by a wide communication and awareness building campaign in all of the 75
districts. In addition the project strengthened further the surveillance, disease detection, diagnosis and response
(containment or case management) capabilities of DOLS and DOHS, and improved the border quarantine and
biosecurity through the establishment of efficient and safe livestock inspection and handling capabilities. The
coordination and rapid response system developed by the project and its predecessor AICP that was instrumental
in the containments of HPAI outbreaks of 2011 and 2013 have been maintained and supported as a regular GoN
program under the direct supervision of the DG of the DOLS. Also NZCP contributed significantly to the focused
plan that was initiated by DOLS and DOHS to establish an OH Hub. A Secretariat representing both departments
was tasked with the responsibility of generating, in less than six month, a formal GoN guideline for the
nationwide implementation of the OH approach.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
40.     Beneficiary Survey. A Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey was undertaken by a consultant
company in 6 districts where NZCP was implemented to assess awareness of prevention and control of priority
zoonotic diseases among human health workers and general public. KAP data was collected twice: baseline data
and a post-training or post-awareness campaign KAP data which would enable evaluating the impact of NZCP
trainings and awareness campaigns. The survey revealed there is an increased awareness of prevention and control



                                                        9
of priority zoonotic diseases among human health workers and general public and measures taken to practice
preventions.
Time of data collection                                         January 2014                March 2014

Attitude (% of all respondents)                                    56.31                      58.78

41.     The project organized an end of project workshop on March 30-31, 2014 which was attended by
high ranking officials from many organizations including the Government of Nepal (GoN) and World
Bank. GoN appreciated the NZCP for successfully containing 216 Avian Influenza outbreaks,
constructing the model quarantine facility in Belahapur, Bhairahawa that has helped quarantine animals
at the Indian border, and completing of the first diagnostic facility at BLS2 at the Department of Health
(outstanding activity from the AICP). Moreover, the convergence of Health and Livestock Services
under the One Health approach has facilitated the survey, assessment, response to contain zoonotic
diseases. The forum was encouraged to note that district Level Avian Flu Control Committees chaired
by CDOs are now functional. GoN has consolidated its support for zoonotic diseases by allocation of
NPR 200 million for the FY 2014/15. NZCP was noted as the most successful project implemented at
the DOLS in the last decade and the collaboration between World Bank and Project teams in
implementation of NZCP despite a two year time constrained project was appreciated. In this regard, the
contribution Nepal Agriculture Research Council, Department of Livestock Services, Department of
Health, and consultants that provided NZCP with managerial, financial, technical and procurement
support/expertise was duly recognized.

4.        Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
42.      The project was considered substantial at appraisal, as acknowledged in the PAD.27 The risk was mainly
because of the AHIF Trust Fund requirement that limited the project implementation to only two years and a
grace period for disbursements of only one month. The actual disbursement period was only 15 months. Another
challenge was the multi-sectoral characteristic of the project that required full collaboration between two
Ministries (MOAD and MOHP) and two departments (DOLS, DOHS) and the Nepal Agriculture Research
Council (NARC), an autonomous organization within the MOAD. The risk mitigating factors estimated during
appraisal, however, have proven to be effective. These are: (i) the substantial experience already acquired under
the previous AICP project, (ii) the continuity of the existing implementation structure established under the
previous project, and (iii) the establishment of a facilitating unit for FM, procurement and planning/monitoring
activities.
43.      In addition, the DOLS commitment and the advance financing (FY12/13 and FY13/14) provided by the
government allowed timely development implementation plan and hiring project consultants. Moreover,
recruitment of competent M&E consultant and the strong leadership of the project Manager and his close
collaboration and consultation with the WB TTL, procurement, financial and safeguard officers turned many risk
factors into opportunities. Overall the project was able to address major risks such as the 216 HPAI outbreaks in
2013 by providing timely support to diagnosis, reporting, culling of suspected animals and compensation to
effected producers. Other risk mitigation facts expected during appraisal such as the development of the two
complementary projects AFSP through GAFSP funding and the ongoing projects/ pipeline PPCR, PAF, were still
in early phase and therefore not effective in providing any mitigation support.

44.     The strategy taken by the project to build on the gains made by the Avian Influenza Control
Project and the proactive actions taken by the project to draw up the implementation in the early phase
when the project did not receive the funds, contributed to minimizing the risk to achieving the PDO.
Further, contributions made by AICP and NZCP in the formulation of Bird Flu Act have secured
continued support from the government of Nepal to continue to address Avian Flu in particular and
Zoonotic diseases in general. Finally, the One Health Approach initiated and fostered by NZCP has
already resulted in joint collection and sharing of information and data related to zoonotic diseases.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:
Rating: Satisfactory
45.      Lessons learned from the completed HPAI project AICP with similar activities and project development
objectives were incorporated in the project design. In particular the institutional and implementation arrangements
which maintained project management units, and core staff namely the Project Director, Senior Veterinary
Officer, and technical focal points from AICP were a crucial factor for successful execution of planned activities
and achieving the development objectives. Based on the lessons from AICP, implementation capacity was
strengthened by early recruitment of management support team which comprised consultants supporting
monitoring and evaluation, procurement, financial management, training and civil works. The establishment of a
cross-cutting planning and monitoring unit responsible for project implementation via three different government
agencies in two different ministries further supported one health approach to implementing zoonosis control
initiatives. This was further enhanced by establishment of a high-level steering committee and a working- level
committee. The World Bank’s South Asia Region (SAR) was implementing a Regional Training Program in
Epidemiology and Bio-security. Although the regional project was referenced in the PAD it was not fully
integrated in the operation and opportunities for synergies were lost. Massey University was the recipient and
implementing agency of the regional project. Massey University was funded to implement collaborative
investigation projects for Zoonoses. Full integration of these activities into NZCP would have required the
development of a grant fund flow mechanism by WB SAR and MoF. This grant flow mechanism through NZCP
was not achieved and the activities therefore implemented in parallel.

     Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
46.      The Kathmandu-based TTL provided valuable support to the project management unit and regularly
facilitated assistance in FM, procurement, and safeguards by the Bank team throughout implementation. The
Bank team maintained a cross-sectoral technical team, including a Kathmandu-based Public Health Specialist and
animal health specialists based in Washington DC and Delhi who regularly monitored implementation. The FAO
regional office also supported implementation, and the project engaged the FAO investment center to carry out an
economic assessment of the avian flu outbreak in early 2014, which recommended the need to support culling
operations and formulate a policy to support zoonotic disease control. Budget revisions were conducted on a
timely basis in view of changing needs. The Bank was responsive to the emergency Avian Influenza outbreak
situation and reallocated funds to support GON’s culling and compensation policy.

     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                                        11
47.     The overall Bank performance was satisfactory. Lessons learned from AICP with regard to institutional
and implementation arrangements were reflected in the PAD. The Kathmandu-based TTL provided regular
support and the Bank responded to swiftly to changing conditions with budget revisions.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
48.      Implementation was seriously delayed by late fund disbursement. MOF disbursed funds 6 months after
the project became effective. However, preparatory planning by the project management unit was enabled by
maintaining AICP management staff within MOAD. GON set up a steering and technical committee to effectively
coordinate the project. GON maintained a high level of ownership and commitment in ZD prevention and control,
which was demonstrated by the specific budget allocation for DOLS for the current and the next fiscal year. An
institutionalization of the One Health approach to prevention and control of ZDs, as stated in the development
objective, has been initiated by the GON via a joint One Health guideline drafting committee.

     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
49.     DOLS had a high level of ownership in NZCP. The project manager remained the same throughout the
project and after completion. NZCP’s project management structure is maintained by DOLS to manage MOAD’s
Avian Influenza program. DOLS built capacities in project management, FM, procurement, and M&E, and
submitted all required reports to the Bank. DOLS lost the opportunity to enhance the technical quality and impact
of project outputs via involvement of FAO’s technical expertise in ZD control capacity building.28 NARC was
proactive in project implementation. NARC started planning and implementation in the absence of implementing
funds during the first 6 months of the project. Information sharing and coordination between NARC and DOLS
was effective. Project activities in DOHS mainly focused on procurement of diagnostic equipment and upgrading
the central veterinary laboratory to a higher biosecurity standard. This was delayed throughout the project and
only completed during the last weeks before project closing. However, by project closing, DOHS was fully
engaged in the institutionalization of the One Health Approach.

     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
50.      NZCP built the capacity for surveillance mechanism, prevention and control of zoonotic diseases,
demonstrated by successfully contained 216 AI outbreaks, and the institutional mechanisms for an effective One
Health Approach are being developed. DOLS and DOHS have assured commitment and are maintaining
coordination mechanisms that enable an effective and coordinated response to ZD threats.

6.      Lessons Learned

6.1 The following are the Key lessons learnt from NZCP
51.     Government commitment to the continuation of the investment made through other HPAI projects
was a crucial factor in achieving NZCP’s PDOs in spite of the very short implementation period (2 years
according to PAD; but actually 15 months from disbursement of funds to project closing). The project
accomplished all of its planned activities and closed without pending audit or financial reports, because the GoN

28
   FAO was implementing a HPAI control project through DOLS but was not involved in NZCP, although this was suggested
in the PAD.


                                                         12
advances financial resources for startup and planning and sustain AICP project management and staff. However,
considering Nepal’s status of political transition, short duration projects with limited grace period poses a serious
challenge, especially for procurement heavy projects.
52.     Dedication of the Project Management and staff and close collaboration with the WB. The
Contributing factors to this success is the dedication of the Project Manager and his close collaboration with the
WB’s Team and continuity of the AICP project management and staff; commitment of the GoN and its provision
of advance resources to allow for project startup and planning; and the recruitment of capable subject matter
consultants specially the M & E senior consultant. The close collaboration and interaction between the
Kathmandu-based TTL and the NZCP management and staff contributed greatly to successful implementation of
the project under its tight and very short period. The TTL was able to provide regular facilitation between the
National Team and the WB Country Team (cross cutting technical and administrative support staff)
53.      Centralized and strong M & E and Planning Unit is crucial for effective technical support. The
M&E system, which was developed during AICP, was located at DOLS. The M&E and Planning Unit provided
technical support, capacity development and training in the use of the standard reporting templates to the M&E
staff in each of the three implementation agents (DOLS, NARC and DOHS), and information and technical
advice to the Project Steering and Technical Committee. This strengthened coordination and collaboration among
the three implementing agencies.
54.      Centralized project financing, procurement and budget management system. The centralized system
at the PMU level in Kathmandu provided two benefits; reduction of transaction cost and enhancement of inter-
sectoral collaboration; both being crucial for the development of a cost effective OH approach.
55.      The KAP survey could be a strategic M&E tool. Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey was
undertaken to evaluate impact of NZCP training and awareness building. However, KAP data was collected twice
over a very short time span; and therefore the opportunity to use this important survey as a tool for assessing
project feedback from the project stakeholders was missed.
56.     Inter-sectoral collaboration and high level GoN commitment are crucial for the development and
installation of the One Health Approach. The GoN has diligently supported the establishment of the inter-
ministerial OH Hub Network, supported by two OH Secretariats one in each of the DOLS and DOHS. A Joint
Committee was assigned the responsibility to draft the OH Guideline with deadline to submit its report to the
Council of Ministers within 3- 6 months from now. However, the benefits would have been higher, if there was
collaboration between the regional projects which advocated the One Health Approach and NZCP. The inclusion
of the Nepal Agriculture Research Council both as implementation agency and their subsequent inclusion in the
Avian Influenza Surveillance Committee has institutionalized a system based approach to disease research and
monitoring.
57.     Keeping just one agency as the primary implementing partner, which is responsible for
streamlining, consolidating and submitting the budgets requests, procurement plans, and audit reports
have mitigated many coordination issues and delays. The implementation modality of AICP included two
separate independent implementing partners (DOHS and DOLS). This arrangement lead to coordination
challenges and role confusions, which often lead to delays. The final audit report for AICP from the MOHP is still
outstanding. But with NZCP, the project adopted a different approach. DOLS was the key implementing partner
for the project (as the majority of the project grant was managed by DOLS), and DOHS the co-implementing
agency. The DOLS was responsible to collect the audit reports, progress reports and procurement plans from
DOHS and submit one consolidated report to the Bank. Also, the fund flow arrangement was designed the same
way i.e. the funds were issued to DOLS, which in turn, transmitted the necessary share to the DOHS. This overall
arrangement streamlined the project activities to a great extent and was able to avoid many implementation
delays.
58.     The concluding workshop organized by Massey University in Bhutan played an instrumental role in
bringing the key regional stakeholders together and raising high level awareness on OH approach. Similar events



                                                         13
are necessary in order to reinforce the need to form and institutionalize the OH approach to address zoonotic
diseases.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies:
The Bank distributed the ICR to the Government of Nepal and the implementing partners. The comments
received indicated that the report was well accepted and there were no specific comments. The overall
contribution of the project was well appreciated by the clients demonstrated by the following positive comments
received from them
“We appreciate and thank the World Bank for making funds available for this short but high impact Project that
has produced tangible results. The NZCP is one of the projects that has performed so well with clear and
tangible results the Ministry of Agriculture as implemented in the last few years. We are pleased to inform you
that the Government of Nepal has made available NPR 95,551,000 Crores to Bird Flu Control Project for FY
2014/15 in order to support and internalize the gains made by AICP and NZCP. While we are committed continue
this support on long term basis, we would also like to highlight the importance of donor support for livestock sub
sector in Nepal. With the conclusion of the NZCP there is practically no donor support in this sector. Livestock s
an integral part of the Nepalese farming system and is well built into the local culture and is a source of
livelihood over 60 per cent of its people, particularly in the rural area. We look forward to another opportunity
to collaborate with the World Bank in this important sub sector to help the rural poor and contribute towards the
goal of Government of Nepal to alleviate poverty”.

diseases in the context of Nepal were identified and prioritized. The Avian Influenza Surveillance Committee
(AISC), chaired by the Chief of National Public Health Laboratory under the Department of Health, now includes
the Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC). The AISC is responsible for collecting, analyzing and sharing
information on zoonotic diseases under the umbrella of the One Health approach. These two activities have
directly contributed to meeting the project objectives.
61.     One major outcome of this project is the institutionalization of the One Health Approach in Nepal.
Today, the Department of Health and Livestock Services have adopted the One Health approach. The project also
contributed to the development of Animal Health Policy and Surveillance Plans for prioritized zoonotic diseases.
62.      As part of institutional capacity development, a Veterinary Standard and Drug Administration Laboratory
has been constructed at Budanilkantha; one regional laboratory constructed in Biratnagar, a new model quarantine
facility has been built at the border point between India and Nepal at Bhairahawa and District Livestock Service
Office in Kathmandu has been constructed and it is in full operation. Staff capacity, from professionals,
researchers to laboratory assistants have been enhanced through provision of training courses based on needs
assessment covering a wide range of topics from zoonosis, quarantine management, biosecurity, meat hygiene,
disease surveillance etc. Nearly 10,261staff were trained over a period of two years.
63.     The Avian Influenza Control Coordination Committee continues to meet regularly at both district and
regional levels.
Component B
64.      Implemented under the initiative of the Nepal Agriculture Research Council, research related to climate
sensitive diseases and zoonotic diseases were carried out. Findings revealed high occurrences of diseases such as
Toxoplasmosis, Brucellosis, Cysticercosis and Leptospirosis, warranting caution and further investigation on the
epidemiology of these diseases under Nepalese conditions. A total of six research grants were provided to
students for Masters Research to carry out studies on Leptospirosis, Brucellosis, H9N2, Liver fluke, Neoascaris
viulorum and Blue Tongue disease.
65.     As part of upgrading, Nepal Agriculture Research Council’s laboratories were equipped with equipment
such as microscope, incubator, PCR-1, Elisa Plate Reader, computers and generator. In addition to this, veterinary
laboratories at Tarhara, Parwanipur, Nepalgunj, Bandipur and Jumla were refurbished. A total of 1500 farmers
and 2500 students were trained on zoonotic diseases. Technical trainings were organized for 12 officers and 14
mid-level technicians. Four regional workshops were organized and attended by 302 participants. Overseas
training courses were organized for veterinary epidemiology for 16 scientists, diagnostic on emerging and
reemerging zoonotic diseases for 10 scientists, GIS and disease modelling for 4 scientists, and procurement
management training for 11 management staff were organized. Publications on zoonotic diseases, climate trend
analysis, GIS mapping of diseases were produced in addition to a TV documentary on zoonotic diseases.
Component C
66.     Monitoring of priority zoonotic diseases is being carried out on a monthly basis. Refurbishment of BSL 2
Plus laboratory has been completed. This was an activity that was supposed to have been completed under the
AICP but due to financial constraints it remained outstanding, also noted by the IEG. Today, the laboratory has
been completed and is now in operation.
67.     Guideline on animal bite management and brochures and manuals on prevention and control of Zoonotic
diseases have been developed for circulation. A Draft Act for prevention and control of infectious diseases has
been developed.
68.     Procurement of hospital equipment (ventilator, mobile X-ray, suction pump, syringe pump, and blood gas
analyzer) and laboratory equipment (nucleic acid sequencer, RT-PCR machine, freezers, microscope, auto-pipette,
and centrifuges) has been completed.
69.    Training courses have been implemented as planned, covering a wide range of topics such as prevention
and control of zoonotic diseases, nucleic acid sequencing, animal bites management etc.

             Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)
1.       This assessment is based on an economic impact assessment which was commissioned by the WB office
Nepal through FAO-TCI in January 2014. It was focused on HPAI, which is one of the 6 priority ZDs targeted by
the project because of the history and the large number of HPAI outbreaks and containment efforts that took place
during the project implementation. This was a unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness and relevance of the
project.
2.      The Nepal Zoonosis Control Project (NZCP) is a follow-on project to AICP in terms of building
veterinary service capacity to prevent and control HPAI and other livestock diseases. The GON and other
development partners have been providing their support in strengthening veterinary and public health service
capacity which has been beneficial in controlling HPAI H5N1 and other diseases. Strong veterinary and public
health service capacity is a public good and crucially important factor in controlling ZD such as HPAI. NZCP
funding was certainly effective in strengthening the ZD control capacity and benefits to this investment can be
derived from the control of a wide array of animal diseases with knock-on effect beyond the agricultural sector.
Attributing the benefits of controlling a single disease to the costs of building and maintaining effective veterinary
and public health infrastructure would significantly underestimate the benefits of veterinary and public health
capacity development. This economic analysis is focusing on the assessment of HPAI losses during NZCP.
Assessed HPAI losses illustrate the economic importance of strong veterinary service capacity.
Project Costs
3.       At project closure, NZCP costs were about USD 8.46 million financed by the Avian Human Influenza
Facility (AHIF) grant.
Project Benefits
4.      Benefits are driven by avoided losses of poultry breeding stock and subsequent production declines. For
quantifying these benefits two scenarios were considered (with and without project) in order to measure, from the
difference between scenarios, the loss avoidance.
Poultry Sector Project Benefits
5.       The analysis assesses the economic impact of occurred losses in the poultry sub-sector during the
implementation of the project. Nepal has a highly specialized commercial poultry production sector which
depends on day-old parent stock imports. Lost parent stock would result in reduced production for an extended
time period after the containment of HPAI due to the required growth period until birds are productive again and
produce production stock. A value chain model is developed to estimate the economic knock-on effects of lost
commercial poultry breeding stock. HPAI outbreaks had limited impact on native poultry production and
therefore the following analysis is focused on commercial poultry production. Before the onset of the H5N1
epidemic in 2013 the commercial poultry sector had an output of 25.4 million eggs and 1.9 million broilers. A
total production value of USD 7.4 million per week is equivalent to 2.04% of Nepal’s GDP. The main inputs in
terms of costs were feed, breeding stock, and staff. After payment of the aforementioned main inputs an
approximate gross margin of USD 1.9 million was generated per week by commercial poultry farms.
6.      More than 1.7 million poultry were culled or died during the HPAI outbreaks in 2013 (Table 2). The lost
poultry had a domestic market value of about USD 9 million. Control efforts prevented a much larger spread.
About 60% of the high value broiler breeding stock and about 85% of the layer breeding stock was saved. This
has prevented severe supply shortages of replacement breeds for poultry meat and egg production and the poultry
subsector has commenced importing breeding stock which will result in full production recovery within 6 – 9
months.
Culling upon confirmation of HPAI suspicions combined with low compensation rates are proving to be a
disincentive for farmers to report signs of HPAI in poultry. NZCP provided USD 886,000 for culling and
compensation operations on a one-time basis. This has also led to earmarking of compensation funds within the


                                                         19
GON budget (NR 110.0 million in 2013). A policy supportive of compensation has been initiated but leaves room
for improvement to reduce farmers’ reporting disincentives. Culling and compensation operations could not be
sustained from GoN budget allocations if HPAI were to re-occur at a similar magnitude as in 2013. A revision of
the compensation rate to reflect higher market values of poultry would worsen this situation.

7.       Source: FAO-TCI mission report, January 2014Commercial poultry production declined from an output value
of USD 7.4 million to USD 5 million per week from June 2013 for about 9 months (Table 3). This is due to the
loss of 40% of broiler and 15% of layer parent stock. A minimum time period of about 42 to 56 weeks is required
to resume full production of commercial poultry meat and eggs after parent stock is culled due to HPAI infection.
A period of 49 weeks is assumed with reduced output of poultry meat and eggs due to lost breeding stock (40%
broiler and 15% layer breeding stock). The poultry production value decline for a time period of about 49 weeks
accumulates to a declined output value of USD 119 million which is equivalent to 0.63% of Nepal’s annual GDP.
The gross margin decline accumulated to USD 38.8 million for a 49 week period of declined output after the
HPAI outbreak in 2013. Domestic poultry farmers’ losses were limited to the gross margin loss from declined
production. The outbreaks did, however, slow down the recent dynamic growth in commercial poultry production
and therefore have likely resulted in lost value addition opportunities. The national economy was faced with the
entire declined output value. The declined domestic poultry production value was, to some extent, likely replaced
with formal and informal imports from other countries. Nepal is a net importer of livestock and therefore also the
replacement of poultry meat with other meat substitutes has likely occurred.

8.       Poultry inventory losses of USD 9.0 million and accumulated decline of production output over 49 weeks
post HPAI of USD 119.1 million resulted in a total HPAI H5N1 related economic impact of USD128.2 million
for the commercial poultry sector during and subsequent to outbreaks in 2013.
9.        Human Health Project Benefits were not quantified although the project has had significant impact by
preventing the spread of HPAI from poultry to humans. The control of HPAI in Nepal represents a global public
good. The risk of an emergence of a human influenza pandemic is increasing with uncontrolled multiplication of
HPAI viruses in poultry and subsequent infections of humans. HPAI control measures supported by the project
are therefore reducing the global pandemic risk. Even though the risk level of the emergence of a human
pandemic influenza virus from HPAI viruses in poultry is unquantifiable and the timing of such an event is not
predictable. The costs of such an event, if it were to occur, are so high that actions to control HPAI can be
justified on this basis alone. The cost estimates for the emergence of a human pandemic strain of HPAI vary
considerably but losses to the global economy in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars have been proposed.
Therefore the project’s benefits resulting from the contribution to the global good of HPAI pandemic prevention
are not quantified within the economic analysis. This is not meant to underplay the benefits associated with
reducing the risk of a global pandemic. It prevents basing the analysis on highly speculative assumptions while
facilitating an analysis of the profitability of HPAI control within the agricultural sector. Animal to human
transmissions of HPAI has not been reported in Nepal. This shows the success in reducing the risk of human
exposure to HPAI virus. A without-project scenario would have led to wider spread of HPAI and resulted in
human cases with fatalities. The value of human life is not quantifiable and therefore not accounted for in this
analysis for the without project scenario.
10.      Other Possible Non-quantified Benefits are substitution effects between livestock subsectors. Short
time demand declines occurred due to consumers’ health risk with subsequent surplus production of poultry meat.
Demand for poultry meat substitutes such as goat, beef and pork increased. Supply of poultry meat substitutes
such as goat and pork is inelastic in the short term and therefore market prices increase which leads to increased
expenditures for urban households. Substitution effects with other livestock subsectors are not accounted for due
to a lack of available market data on price fluctuations for poultry and other meat products as well as their cross-
price elasticity.
Scenarios
11.     The ‘with project scenario’ represents an HPAI impact analysis of actually occurred losses in the poultry
sub-sector during NZCP implementation.30 This includes losses from 1.7 million dead or culled poultry which
includes the loss of 40% the broiler breeding stock losses and 30% of the layer breeding stock.
12.     Under the ‘without project scenario’ wide spread HPAI in poultry is assumed. This would lead to a
doubling of poultry losses compared to with-project scenario (Table 4). A prediction of the quantity of lost
poultry in the absence of project support is speculative. Assuming a doubling of losses in all commercial poultry
production systems appears, however, a reasonable and conservative estimate. A limited number of human cases
are assumed for the without-project scenario.

Economic Rate of Return
13.     The analysis shown in Table 5 relates HPAI control and prevention costs to the benefits in the poultry
sub-sector in 2013/14 for two year period of NZCP. Benefits are attributed to NZCP based on the NZCP share in
providing HPAI control funding to the GON. NZCP project costs contributed about 97% of all HPAI control and
prevention funds from development partners. A NPV of USD 98 million was calculated for the NZCP investment.
The market prices used for poultry products are considered to be economic prices, because the markets, for the
most part, operate freely without production quotas and subsidies for poultry or poultry inputs. Wages and other
market prices used in the analysis are also assumed to be economic prices. NZCP was also aimed at building
capacity to respond to other priority zoonotic diseases. The potential benefits of controlling other priority zoonotic
diseases are not included and therefore potentially underestimate the benefits.

14.      A sensitivity analysis concerning the mortality by HPAI in the poultry sector in the “with project”
situation during the 2013 outbreaks was undertaken and the results are shown below (Table 6). The economic
returns to the NZCP are highly robust, even under highly conservative parameters (mortality “with project”
increased by 1.44 million poultry compared to base case “without project”) that severely restrict the benefit
estimation. The results show a return to the project for the two year implementation period. Expanding the
analysis to future benefits from avoided mortality in poultry and also incorporating human health benefits would
further increase the returns to the project.

1.      No beneficiary survey per se was conducted. However, information generated through Knowledge
Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey by Development Vision Nepal (DVN) in 6 districts where NZCP was
implemented to assess awareness of prevention and control of priority zoonotic diseases among human health
workers and general public has been utilized as a proxy for beneficiary perception. KAP data was collected
twice: baseline data and a post-training or post-awareness campaign KAP data which would enable evaluating the
impact of NZCP trainings and awareness campaigns. Due to the short project duration and delays in receiving
funding from MOF the time lag between baseline and post-exposure data collection was only two months and
therefore too short to evaluate the effectiveness of NZCP activities on KAP among human health workers and the
general public. However, the results of the KAP survey are:

   The Nepal Zoonosis Control Project organized back to back workshop on the 30 and the 31st of March
    2014. The workshop was being attended by high officials from various organizations. Day one was
    chaired by the Director General of the Department of Livestock Services and day 2 by the Secretary and
    Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture Development (MoAD). From World Bank, Senior
    Operations Specialist and Task Team Leader attended the workshop. The second day of the workshop
    also marked the official closure of the project. Each component presented the progress. Summary of the
    two day back to back workshops are summarized below:Six zoonotic diseases were prioritized as the
    diseases of national interest and importance from among the list of pre-identified zoonotic diseases. The
    diseases identified as priority are: HPAI, Brucellosis, Leptospirosis, Tozoplasmosis, Cysticercosis, and
    Hydatidosis

   The Secretary and Joint Secretary both praised the NZCP for successfully containing the spread of Avian
    Flu outbreaks, 216 in total.

   The construction of model quarantine facility in Belahapur, Bhairahawa was appreciated as it has made
    quarantine of animals from India into Nepal.

   The completion of the Biosecurity Laboratory Plus 2 at the Department of Health, an activity that
    remained outstanding from the AICP was taken as a big success as it now allows diagnosis of emerging
    zoonotic diseases in the country itself.

   Over the last four years, with the initiation of AICP and further support of the NZCP there is now a One
    Health approach in operation where both Health and Livestock come together in order to survey, assess,
    respond to contain zoonotic diseases.

   The formation of district level Avian Flu Control Committee is now functional and is chaired by the Chief
    District Officer.

   The Government of Nepal’s commitment to continue to support the capacity built by the NZCP has been
    demonstrated by allocation of NPR 20 Crores for the FY 2014/15.

   The fact that the project was able to disburse 84 per cent of US$ 10 million, despite a very slow start due
    to late release of money to the project, was applauded.

   The support and continued support of the World Bank team in implementing this two year time
    constrained project was appreciated. World Bank team thanked the Project Director, Dr Indra Kant Jha,
    without whose hard work, dedication, approach and interpersonal skills, the project would not have been
    able to achieve the success it has seen today. In fact the participants recognized NZCP as one of the most
    successful projects the DoLS has seen in the last 10 years.

   Finally, the Secretary closed the workshop thanking all those involved in making Nepal Zoonosis Control
    Project a great success. They included the Nepal Agriculture Research Council, Department of Livestock
    Services, Department of Health, and consultants that provided NZCP with managerial, financial, technical
    and procurement support/expertise.

               Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR)
Introduction
1. The Nepal Zoonosis Control Project (NZCP) is a two year project which became effective on May 1,
   2012. This was a two year project with a budget of US$10 million. The project started one year after the
   conclusion of Avian Flu Influenza Control Project, also funded by the same Facility. Thus, NZCP in
   essence can be seen as a follow on project of AICP which ended on July 31, 2011.
2. The main objective of the project is to enhance the country capacity for the prevention and control of
   infectious diseases that transmit between animals and humans (zoonosis) under a One Health approach.
   This was to be achieved through the following four key project components: 1) Animal Health (US$ 5.4
   million); 2) Climate Sensitive Disease Risk Mitigation (US$ 2 million), 3) Human Health (US$2 million)
   and 4) Communication (US$0.6 million).
Implementation
3. Key implementing institution is DOLS of the Ministry of Agriculture Development, the Nepal
   Agriculture Research Council (component 2); and the Department of Health (Component 3). The project
   was managed by the DLS and all funds were managed by DLS itself. Procurement of goods and services
   for the project as well as for the health component was carried out by DLS and therefore DLS was
   financially accountable.
4. Although the project was approved in July 2012, disbursement of funds started only in January 2013.
   During this funding lag, the project worked on preparatory activities such as preparation of procurement
   plan, drafting of terms of reference for required consultants (financial, procurement, monitoring and
   evaluation), and in organizing Technical Committee and the Steering Committee which did not require
   substantial funding. This was possible as the national staff that managed the AICP was transferred to
   NZCP while they remained in the government payrolls. With funds made available the progress picked
   up rapidly.
5. While the NZCP could be seen as an extension of the AICP, the focus of NZCP was placed on enhancing
   capacities for developing surveillance, diagnosis, and laboratory testing and reporting of 6 identified
   zoonotic diseases selected during the project design.
Achievement of Project Development Objective
6. The project achieved its PDO to enhance Nepal’s capacity to pr event and control Zoonotic diseases under
   the One Health approach. This was achieved in a record of short time period of 15 months of practical
   implementation. The project was successful in securing coordination between the NARC, DoHS and
   DLS to survey, plan and control Avian Flu in particular and zoonotic diseases in general.
7. The result indicators for the project were: 1) priority zoonosis identified and prevention and control plans
   developed for animal and human; 2) mechanism developed to share information on priority zoonotic
   diseases. The achievements are as follows:
       Prioritization of six zoonotic diseases namely HPAI, Brucellosis, Leptospirosis, Tozoplasmosis,
        Cysticercosis, and Hydatidosis through participatory multistakeholder assessment and consultation.
        Also two additional priority zoonotic diseases namely Blue Tongue and GI Nematodes were
        identified. Surveillance plans have been formulated for all the eight priority diseases.
       Mechanism for communication and information sharing at the national and in the 75 districts have
        been developed and data collection has begun at the national and district levels. The National Avian
        Influenza Information Committee has been redefined to include all zoonotic diseases. In addition to
        DoLS and DoHS, the committee also includes representatives of NARC and FAO.




                                                    28
       In addition to above, the project made notable contributions in: i) completion of Biosecurity
        Laboratory level 2 plus at the Department of Health; ii) development of Animal Health Policy, iii)
        development of surveillance plans for key zoonotic diseases, iv) construction of veterinary standard
        and drug administration laboratory at Budanilkantha, Kathmandu; v) regional laboratory in
        Biratnagar; vi) one new model quarantine facility in Belahiya, Bharahawa; vii) construction of district
        livestock office in Kathmandu.
       The capacity enhancement targets for prevention and control of infectious diseases was achieved
        building on the infrastructure developed by AICP. Indicators include: 1) training and communication
        outreach and awareness building of 54,139 (28,549 and 25,593) respectively) farmers in all the 75
        districts of which 9,717 were female, exceeding the target of reaching 24,000 farmers; 2) the
        improved capacity of prevention and control of zoonosis and effective coordination among the three
        implementing partners was evident in the successful containment of 216 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks; 3)
        the inter-sectoral consultative ranking procedures and criteria used in the identification and
        prioritization of zoonotic diseases; 4) development of zoonotic disease control plan and guideline, 5)
        the number of livestock inspected at model and improved service centers and quarantine offices, 6)
        identification of climate sensitive diseases, and 7) completion of BSL 2 plus laboratory at the
        Department of Health Services.
       The economic analysis showed a total disbursement of US$8.455 million against US$ 10 million.
        The disbursement was calculated on the basis of NPR 95 to a dollar. If the exchange rate of NPR
        80.33 at the time of project agreement was to be used the disbursement would have been close to a
        hundred percent. Economic analysis of possible loss to poultry, employment and impact on tourism
        showed a net present value of USD 98 million.
       Independent survey of knowledge attitude and practice (KAP) in 6 districts where NZCP was
        implemented showed nearly 50 per cent of the people surveyed were found to be aware of Avian Flu
        in particular and Zoonotic disease in general.
Lesson learned
8. The following summarizes the lessons from the NZCP
   Government commitment to the continuation of the investment made through other HPAI projects was a
    crucial factor in achieving NZCP’s PDO inspite of the tight and very short implementation period.
   Dedication of project management and staff and close collaboration with the WB’s TTL and specialized
    administrative support and the continuation of AICP project management and staff and commitment of
    GoN and its provision of advance resources to allow for project start up and planning and support of
    management consultants made it possible achieve the project objectives and targets
   Effective day to day supervision and support from TTL is both crucial and required.
   Centralized and strong M and E and Planning Unit is crucial for effective technical support. The M and E
    system which was developed during the AICP, led by capable consultant(s), located at DoLS contributed
    substantially to the project success.
   The centralized system of project financing, procurement and budget management provided two benefits:
    reduction of transaction cost and enhancement of inter-sectoral collaboration for the development of cost
    effective One Health approach.
   KAP is a strategic M&E tool which could help evaluate the impact of initiatives such as the ones taken up
    by NZCP. But, they need to be administered at appropriate times to get reliable results that can be used
    for the future. The NZCP project being a very short duration project, suffered from the lack of spacing
    between the two surveys.

     Annex 8. Comments on Implementing Completion Report by the Implementing Agency and Partners
The Bank distributed the ICR to the Government of Nepal and the implementing partners. The comments
received indicated that the report was well accepted and there were no specific comments. The overall
contribution of the project was well appreciated by the clients demonstrated by the following positive comments
received from them.
We appreciate and thank the World Bank for making funds available for this short but high impact Project that
has produced tangible results. The NZCP is one of the projects that has performed so well with clear and tangible
results the Ministry of Agriculture as implemented in the last few years. We take this opportunity to highlight the
following key achievements:
1.    Despite a slow start initially due to internal problems related to release of funds from the Government side,
      the project made substantial physical and financial progress.
2.    Thanks to the Nepal Zoonosis Control Project, the Government of Nepal was able to control and contain the
      spread of Avian Flu in the last two years. A total of 216 outbreaks were contained successfully. This would
      not be possible if not for the capacity built in surveying and responding to HPAI.
3.    The funding support made available by the NZCP to complete the construction of Biosecurity Laboratory 2
      plus at the Department of Health Services at Teku, an activity that remained outstanding from the Avian Flu
      Influenza Project, is much appreciated. The laboratory is functional today and has built the capacity to
      diagnose.
4.    One major achievement of the NZCP is the initiation of the much needed One Health approach in Nepal to
      address zoonotic diseases. This has been demonstrated by consorted effort by the DOLS and DOHS in
      addressing avian flu outbreaks in the last 2 years.
5.    We are pleased to inform you that the Government of Nepal has made available NPR 95,551,000 Crores to
      Bird Flu Control Project for FY 2014/15 in order to support and internalize the gains made by AICP and
      NZCP. While we are committed continue this support on long term basis, we would also like to highlight the
      importance of donor support for livestock sub sector in Nepal. With the conclusion of the NZCP there is
      practically no donor support in this sector. Livestock s an integral part of the Nepalese farming system and
      is well built into the local culture and is a source of livelihood over 60 per cent of its people, particularly in
      the rural area. We look forward to another opportunity to collaborate with the World Bank in this important
      sub sector to help the rural poor and contribute towards the goal of Government of Nepal to alleviate
      poverty.
