                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to enhance the country capacity for the prevention and control of infectious diseases thattransmit between animals and humans
                         (zoonoses) under a One Health approach. This is a necessary first-step in reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases from animals to humans which will also lead
                         to increase livestock productivity and strengthen the livelihoods base for food insecure communities. This objective would be achieved through two types of
                         interventions: planning and preparedness; and prevention. If successful, the proposed project would contribute to reduce the burden of disease in animals, the
                         consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity attributable to animal and human infections in Nepal. In addition, this project will
                         specifically link up with the GAFSP-financed project that is being prepared in parallel, to supportthe realization of these outcomes in the mid- and far west regions of
                         Nepal . The project would also leverage with and contribute to enhancing the Climate Resilience Agriculture Management Information System, which is prepared by the
                         PPCR.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There was a delay in announcement and release of budget for FY2012/13 due to political impasse. Towards the end of the first trimester, the government released limited budget but
                         not exceeding two-third of the last year’s expenditure. Due to these budget related delays, the project was unable to disburse as had been planned. However the team carried out all
                         the preliminary works that would aid in the project implementation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The delay in budget release not only affected NZCP but also all the donor funded projects. As indicated above, this resulted in delays in disbursements. With budget now being
                         approved and released the project has already disbursed USD 1.5 million as at May 2, 2013.

                         Besides budgetary issues the project has made significant progress in terms of: 1) conducting trainings activities and awareness raising campaigns in all the five development
                         regions, 2) bids called for procurement of goods and services (vehicles, office equipments, IT equipments, construction works, services of consultants), and 3) MOU signed between
                         the National Agriculture Research Council (NARC). The Department of Health Services (DoHS) has appointed a focal person who will be responsible to look into the implementation
                         of health component. This appointment will facilitate finalization and submission of procurement plan for health component to WB and in facilitating implemenation.
