INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO
THE YUGOSLAV INVESTMENT BANK
FOR
INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS
January 15, 1970



REPORT AND RECOM14ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE YUGOSLAV INVESTMENT BANK
FOR INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $18.5 million
to the Jugoslovenska Investiciona Banka (Yugoslav Investment Bank) to
assist in financing the foreign exchange cost of the modernization and
expansion of three Yugoslav industrial enterprises.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.    The Bank has made thirteen loans to Yugoslavia for a total amount
of $377.2 million of which $327.6 million was held by the Bank as of
December 31, 1969. The proposed loan would be the sixth for industry
in Yugoslavia of which three totalling $60.7 million were made betx'een
1949 and 1953.  Two recent loans of $10.5 million and $16 million, made
in June 1967 and in August 1968 respectively, helped finance industrial
modernization.
3.    The proposed loan reflects a transition in industrial financing
by the Bank in Yugoslavia. For the preceding two loans a fairly
large number of projects (seven for the first loan and ten for the second)
were selected from a still larger number submitted by the Yugoslav
Investment Bank (YIB) for consideration by the Bank. Most of the appraisal
work was done by Bank Group staff, and the YIB served mainly as a conduit.
This approach had two disadvantages: the detailed appraisal of the numerous
projects put a heavy burden on staff, and the relatively small size of the
individual projects and their dispersion over several industrial sectors
made it difficult to evaluate sectoral policies properly. For the present
loan, therefore, only t1iree relatively large projects in the important
metal fabricating industry, which includes automotive production, have been
chosen. This has reduced the work of appraisal and made it possible to re-
view in some detail policies in the automotive industry. The next loan for
industry will probably take the form of a line of credit to the YIB which
would bear primary responsibility for project appraisal and supervision.
An appraisal of the YIB for this purpose is tentatively scheduled for the
first half of 1970.
4.    Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington from
December 15 to 23, 1969. Mr. Ante Zelic, Deputy Federal Secretary of
Finance, and Mr. Misa Stojiljkovic, Economic Counselor of the Yugoslav
Embassy in Washington, represented the Federal Government, and Mr. Momcilo
Pejovic, Assistant General Manager, and Mr. Pavle Pavlovic, Washington
Representative, represented the Yugoslav Investment Bank.



5.    Yugoslavia has received no IDA credits. The following is a
summary statement of Bank loans to Yugoslavia as of December 31, 1969:

6.    Six of the seven industrial projects included in Loan 504-YU are
progressing satisfactorily. One has been delayed because of difficulties
in reaching agreement with the for^-ign partner involved but agreement has
now been reached, It is early to judge the progress of the projects in -the



- 3 -
1968 industrial loan (Loan 554-YU), but these appear to
be close to schedule except for one of the ten which is
delayed by the need for additional process selection work.
The execution of the Second Railway Project (Loan 395-YU
of December 1964),, a modernization program of main lines,
has been unsatisfactory. The major part of the work started
considerably later than expected because of delays in
engineering, preparation of tender documents and bidding,
wlhich were largely due to the foreign exchange reform in
1965. Severe shortages of funds have resulted in a further
slowdown. The Yugoslav authorities have begun to remedy the
situation and have requested a postponement of the Closing
Date from December 31, 1969 to March 31, 1973. The Bank
has informed the Yugoslav authorities that it could consider
the postponement only if the steps taken are sufficiently
comprehensive to ensure the completion of the project by
the new Closing Date. In the meantime the Bank has post-
poned the Closing Date until March 31, 1970 to give the
Government time to prepare a new timetable0 The Belgrade-
Bar Railway Project (Loan 531-YU) and the Highway Projects
(Loans 485-YU and 608-YU) are progressing satisfactorily.
7.     Yugoslavia became a member of IFC on July 5, 1968.
IFC has participated in the share capital of the International
Investment Corporation which was established in December 1969
to promote and participate in international Joint ventures in
Yugoslavia. In addition, IFC is planning to invest $8 million
as a quasi-equity participation through FIAT in the Zavodi
Crvena Zastava-Fiat joint venture, I have made a separate
Report and Recommendation on that investment. Zavodi Crvena
Zastava is one of the beneficiaries of the Bank Loan now
being proposed.
8.     It is expected that loans for a telecommunications
project and a further highway project will be ready before
the end of this fiscal year. In addition, projects in
transport, tourism and industry and a multipurpose water
supply project are under preparation.

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.   A report entitled "Appraisal of Yugoslav Industrial Projects
1970" (PI-la) is attached.



Yugslav Industry
11.   Yugoslav industry has developed very rapidly since World War II
and has become the most important sector in the economy. Large
investments were made in new industrial capacity, enabling a rapid
expansion of production primarily to meet the needs of the domestic
market. From 1953 until 1°64 the average annual growth in industrial
output exceeded 12 percent. After a time, however, it was found that
in some industries the domestic market was too small to make possible
even minimum economies of scale. A reorganization and reorientation
to enable enterprises to increase their efficiency and compete more
successfully in domestic and foreign markets was considered necessary.
With regard to industry, the Economic Reform of July 1965 was designed
to curb the influence of political bodies in the direction of enter-
prises, to provide enterprises through reduction of taxes and general
contributions with the financial resources to carry out their
autonomous investment decisions, and to promote modernization of in-
dustry by orienting production and trade increasingly to western
technology and webonrn markets. In the following phase of consoli-
dation, industrial growvl slowed sharply and came to a virtual halt
in 1967. However, in 1968 expansion resumed and it is estimated that
the growth in industrial production in 1969 exceeded 12%. Industrial
exports, including mining products, increased substantially over the
last few years and now account for about 80% of merchandise exports.
Adjustments to the more severe internal and external competition are
being made partly by the modernization and expansion of enterprises,
by mergers and specialization between enterprises and by the formation
of join-b ventures inth foreign firms.  This last development has been
possible since 1967 even though all industrial enterprises in Ylugoslavia
are socially owfned and governed by workers' councils. The Zavodi Crvena
Zastava-FIAT joint venture, in which IFC proposes to participate, is an
example of this possibility. In this venture FIAT and IFC, along with a
Yugoslav enterprise and the Yugoslav Investment Bank, will share in the
profits under a contractual arrangement which also gives FIAT and the
Yugoslav investors certain rights in the enterprise's management.
The Loan
12.   The proposed loan would assist in financing the foreign exchange
cost of -the modernization and expansion of three industrial enterprises.
The total cost of the projects is estimated at US$ 125 million equivalent,
of wihich US$ 46 million is required in foreign exchange. The proposed
Bank loan of $18.5 million would provide approximately 4h% of the foreign
currency requirements. Quasi-equity investments by IFC and FIAT and
suppliers' credits would make up the balance.  The local currency



- 6 -
requirements of the projects will be covered by equity-type invest-
ments from various Yugoslav entities, a public debenture issue, loans
from Yugoslav banks and the enterprises' internally generated funds.
13.   The proposed loan, wshich would be guaranteed by the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, would be made to the Yugoslav Inves-b-
raent Bank (YIB), which has served as a conduit for all but one of the
Bank loans to Yugoslavia since 1961. YIB is the largest investment bank
in Yugoslavia, with total assets exceeding $2 billion equivalent.
Established in 1956 to replace the long-term credit department of the
National Bakds of Yugoslavia, the YIB has become more and more independent
until today the Federal Government holds cnly about one-third of its
capital and 1m% of the votes in the governing assembly.  In Jlily 1969 most
of the loans from the Federal Governiment to YIB were set aside in a
fund to be managed by the YIB and removed from its balance sheet.  A
more detailed description of the YIB is givren in Appendix 12 of the
Appraisal Report for the second industrial loan (f515-yU) dated July 30,
1968B .
14.   The loan proceeds would be relent by the Yugoslav Investment Bank
to the beneficiary enterprises lth repayment and grace periods equal
to those of the Bank loan to the YIB. The interest rate on the sub-
sidiary loans would be 8 percent.
The Beneficiaries
15.   Zavodi Crvena Zastava (ZCZ) - US$ 10 million:  ZCZ is Yugoslavia's
largest and only integrated car manufacturer.   It is planning to expand
from a production of about 56,000 vehicles and sales of $98 million
in 1963 to an output of about 200,000 vehicles and sales of $300
million in 1974. Profits are expected to increase faster than sales.
ZCZ has a competent management wThich has done well in past years in
running the enterprise and in developing it into a mature and competitive
firm. A thorough analysis of the Yugoslav car market has shown that car
sales are expected to continue their rapid growth and reach about
340,000 cars annually by 1974. It is expected that ZCZ will retain about
45% of domestic demand and continue to develop its presently small export
market.
16.   From an economic point of view the ZCZ project is well justified.
There is an import duty of 54% on automobiles but the gradual reduction
of this duty to 39% by 1973 is being considered. Actual retail prices
do not fully reflect this level of protection and are only about 10%
higher than the prices of similar FIAT vehicles in Italy.   The ZCZ-FIAT
joint venture would be one of the most important in Yugoslavia and



- 7 -
would include the participation of a private foreign firm (FIAT)
and IFC.
17.   Zeljezara Sisak (SISAK) - US$ 6.2 million:   SISAK is the largest
producer of steel tubes in Yugoslavia. The project envisages the in-
stallation of equipment for continuous casting and for separation of the
medium and heavy tube mills with the effect of increasing output and
reducing manufacturing costs. Present capacity of seamless tube pro-
duction will increase by 70 percent.  Net income, which was $1.1 million
in 1968, is projected at $5.8 million in 1973. Exports to convertible
currency countries ($2.4 million in 1968) are projected at $9 million in
1973.
18.   Industria Poljoprivrednih Masina (ZMAJ) - US$ 2.3 million:   ZHAJ
is the only producer of combine harvesters and of automobile, truck and
tractor wheels in Yugoslavia. The project is designed to increase output
of automotive wheels from 500,000 in 1968 to 2.3 million units per
year in 1973 to keep up with the expansion of the automotive industry.
Net income will rise from $1.1 million in 1968 to $2.4 million in 1973.
Procurement
19.   In view of the need for proceeding with their investment programs
according to schedule, the three enterprises are now starting procurement
action in accordance with procedures to be followed under the loan. There
will be, however, no retroactive financing.   As for the second industrial
loan (Loan 554-YU), procurement will be on the basis of proposals
from at least three qualified suppliers outside Yugoslavia in Bank
member countries and Switzerland unless this is technically impracticablc.
The Yugoslav Investment Bank will supervise this procedure. For con-
tracts above $1 million, bidding documents and proposals for awards of
contracts will also be submitted to the Bank for review and approval.
PART IV - LEGAL fDJSTRUMEINTS
20.   The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Yugoslav
Investment Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Bank, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan



- 8 -
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Loan Agreement and the draft Guarantee Agreement follow
substantlally the pattern of the agreements for the Bank's two
previous loans for industrial projects to the Yugoslav Investment
Bank.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
21. An Economic Memorandum was circulated to the Executive Directors
on May 15, 1969 with my Report and Recommendation on a Highway
Project (Report No. P-702).  A mission to review the current position
and prospects of the economy visited Yugoslavia in OctoberA\Iovember
1969 and is preparing a report which will be distributed to the
Executive Directors in February. AIn up-to-date basic data summary
is attached.
22. In mid-1968, the economy of Yugoslavia entered a phase of
vigorous expansion following a period of rather slow growth
during the previous year and a half. Gross Domestic Product au
constant prices, which had increased by less than 1 percent in
1967, rose by about 4 percent in '968 and by over 8 percent in 1969.
The revival in economic activity since 1968 was largely the result
of a deliberate policy change by the Government wjhich had fe't that
after a period of consolidation emphasis needed to be shifted to
growth. The consolidation phase was an essential feature of the
1965 Economic Reform which considerably reduced central administra-
tion of resources and established a market-oriented economy.
23.  The rapid expansion of domestic demand during 1968 which had
been stimulated by liberal credit, created some inflationary
pressure despite the considerable rise in production. Internal
prices which had been fairly stable during most of 1968, began to
increase faster towards the end of the year. This created a
growfing threat to internal financial stability causing the Govern-
ment to adopt a more restrictive monetary policy. However, the impact
of crcdi;; restrictions We5 delayecCd partly bccaulce 'f excess liquirii y
created in 1968, but also because they were not adequately supported by



- 9 -
fiscal  nd incomes policies.  Economic activity therefore continued to expand
and prices continued to rise at a considerable rate through 1969.   On the
exterral side, limitations to rapid growth also became apparent. Even though
foreign exchange earnings developed exceptionally well in the last year, they
were not able to keep pace with imports. The current account deficit increased
to a level that could probably not be sustained without creating a serious
deot problem. However, the Government expects that continued monetary restrIo-
tions will slow down economic growth and import demand sufficiently to keep
the balance of payments under control.
24. Recent economic developments have demonstrated that the reforms started
in 1965 have been successful. The decentralization of responsibilities for
economic management together with internal price adjnistments, a reduction of
taxes and some import liberalization have encouraged enterprises to become
more efficient. On the other hand, the rapid growth experienced since 1968
and the stability problems associated with it brought into the open some
structural weaknesses. Enterprises and banks, which now carry the main
responsibility for economic decisions, have only limited expenence with a
market-oriented economy and with financial management and the legal and
institutional framework through which their actions are coordinated needs
strenthening and further improvement. The Government is aware of these
deficiencies and has initiated new legislation and other actions designed
to correct them and to carry further the economic reforms.
25. Prospects for Yugoslavia's future economic development are on the whole
favorable. The countryts skilled manpower and considerable natural resources
and its proximity to the major Eiropean markets should guarantee a continuous
and strong impetus for expansion. Exports of goods and services are likely to
continue their fast growth over the next few years. Between 1969 and 1975,
gross earnings of convertible foreign exchange could rise at an average rate
of 11 to 12 percent a year. Assuming a gradual reduction of the current
account deficit, this would permit imports from the convertible currency
area to grow at about 9 percent a year. Such an increase in imports would
be consistent with a 6 percent growth rate of GDP. As population is rising
by only about 1 percent a year, prospects for further improvement in the
standard of living and, to a lesser extent, of employment, are quite
considerable.
26.  The structure of Yugoslavia's medium and long-term external debt with
the convertible currency area is rather unfavorable. More than half of the
total ($1.8 billion at the end of 1968) is at medium-term (mostly suppliers'
credits) and debt service payments, particularly for amortization, are high
having reached some 19 percent of convertible exchange earnings in 1968, and
an estimated 22 percent in 1969. Since most new credits are available only on
rather short terms, the debt structure is likely to become more unfavorable
in the short run and debt service payments can be expected to rise faster
than the total amount of debt. Thus despite growing foreign exchange earnings



- 10 -
the debt service ratio is likely to remain high and the scope for new
borrowing will be limited unless the country can obtain foreign loans on
more favorable terms or attract more foreign private investments.
27, Considering the success of recert economic reforms and the favorable
growth prospects, Yugoslavia is considered creditworthy for further Bank
lending.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGIREEINT
28. I am satisfied that the proposed Loma would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART ITII - RECOIMISNDATION
29. I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.
