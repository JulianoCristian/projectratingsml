and cold storage, grain drying\n            facilities, fruit and vegetable processing plants, dairy and\n            milk collection facilities, and meat and broiler processing\n            plants in the social sector. The less-developed Republics\n            and Province would receive half of the loan which is much\n            larger than their share of the national agricultural\n            product. 57 percent of the proposed loan would be allocated\n            to the individual farmers, and a significant part of the\n            percentage would reach the poorer farmers throughout the country."}, "docdt": "1977-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
