The financial\n            support provided through PRS03 will help finance the costs\n            of implementing key elements of these strategies, together\n            with other domestic and external financing available to\n            Government. The last in a program of three PRSOs, PRS03\n            focuses on three broad policy areas consistent with the\n            goals and strategies identified by Government in its Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy, and reflected in IDA'S Country\n            Assistance Strategy:(i) public resource management; (ii)\n            public expenditure policy; and (iii) sustainable growth.
