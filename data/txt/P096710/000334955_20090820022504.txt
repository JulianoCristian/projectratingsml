1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Lao PDR is among the world's poorest countries, according to the
Bank's Atlas estimates. It is a land-locked nation of 236,000 square km with a
population of around 6 million (2008). With an estimated per capita income of US$740
in 2008, Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in East Asia and is classified by the UN
as a Least Developed Country (LDC). Based on the World Bank's new international
poverty line of $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP terms, Lao poverty incidence was 44 percent in
2002/03. Despite being land-locked, Lao PDR has significant natural resources like
forestry, minerals and hydro-electric power with enormous trade potentials.

2.      The economy has been experiencing a surge in investment in resource
industry (hydro and mining), following the successful launch of the NT2 project in
2004. However, agriculture remains a major sector of the economy, albeit with declining
importance. It contributes around 33 percent of GDP (2008) and is employing nearly 70
percent of the labor force; the industry sector accounts for a little over 29 percent, and
services for nearly 39 percent. In terms of value at 2008 prices, Lao PDR exports mostly
minerals, while industrial goods account for almost three quarters of the total; other large
exports are electricity, garments, agriculture goods, and wood and wood products. Most
of the country's exports are destined for Thailand, Vietnam, China and Europe, as well as
Australia and Taiwan. Imports consist mostly of industrial and capital products,
petroleum, food and other consumer goods, coming for the most part from Thailand,
followed by Vietnam, India, Japan, China, and South Korea.

Poverty Reduction and Social Indicators
3.      Lao PDR's performance in growth and poverty reduction has been strong
over the last decade. Over the past ten years (1998-2007), real GDP grew by an annual
average rate of 6.4 percent - despite the sharp fall-off in growth during the regional crisis
of 1997-1999. Based on Lao PDR's national poverty line (based on minimum calorie
intake), the incidence of poverty has fallen to around 33.5 percent in 2002/03 from 46
percent in 1992/93; or from 49 percent in 1997/98 to 44 percent in 2002/03 based on the
World Bank's new international poverty line of $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP terms. The
social indicators have been improving as well, however they still remain among the worst
in the region, and the quality of measurements remains low.

4.      While social indicators are gradually improving, they remain among the
worst in the region. Overall, the Lao PDR's mixed record on social indicators reflects a
difficult transition process in the 1990s, a low tax collection effort at less than 11-12
percent of GDP until the last 2 years, and significant decentralization with lack of
adequate central oversight. Available data suggest that the Lao PDR is off track on a
number of the MDGs, including malnutrition, measles immunization, skilled birth
attendance, and some dimensions of gender equality (girl's equal enrollment in tertiary
education). Education is among the better performing sectors in Laos, at about the


1
halfway point between the 1990 benchmark and the 2015 target date. The literacy rate
for young adults (15 to 24 year-olds) is roughly on target (showing progress from the 71
percent in 1995 to 84 percent in 2005). Performance on health indicators is more mixed.

The Reform Program
5.     In 1986, the Government of Lao PDR (GOL) introduced the `New Economic
Mechanism' to move from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy. This
involved removing price controls and the GOL's trade monopoly, unifying the exchange
rate system, abandoning cooperative farming, reducing the number of State Owned
Enterprises (SOEs) and allowing private firms.

6.      The reform process has continued throughout the last 15 years. After the
Soviet Union's collapse and resultant loss of financial support in 1991, the GOL
reoriented the economy to Asian and western markets and implemented initial banking
and SOE reforms. The Asian economic crisis led to a deceleration of reforms in the late
1990s, as Laos struggled with serious macroeconomic problems. A renewed focus from
2001 onwards has led to improvements in public financial management (PFM), SOEs and
State Owned Commercial Banks (SOCBs), tariffs, pricing, trade and private sector
development. Remarkable growth has also been achieved in exports, agricultural
productivity, industry and services. PRSC1-3 made a significant contribution to this
reform program (see Box 1).

7.      The Government's medium-term strategy is to achieve rapid economic
growth with the goal of graduating from the status of least-developed country
(LDC) by 2020. This strategy has been articulated consistently in several national
strategy documents, including the NGPES, 2004, and its successor, the NSEDP, 2006-10.
The NSEDP envisages the reduction of poverty through a combination of broad-based
economic growth and focused and policy interventions. The four strategic intervention
areas of the plan are i) human development and private sector driven economic growth;
ii) competitiveness, trade and regional integration; iii) social development and targeted
poverty reduction interventions; and iv) good governance. Through these key priority
intervention areas, the NSEDP enables the evolution of the Lao PDR's economy towards
a private sector led system with modern governance, while keeping a strong focus on
human and social development. The geographical targeting of NSEDP's interventions
reflects the empirical evidence provided by the most recent household survey and the Lao
PDR Poverty Assessment. The Poverty Reduction Strategy underpins both the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the PRSO program.

Box 1. Key policy reforms implemented under PRSC1-3

Progress has been made in the public financial management reform. Budget preparation has become
more transparent and predictable. Additionally, the budget approval time has been brought forward from
October to June. The Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) has gained
momentum and is being implemented according to plan, including training and capacity building
components. Coupling the PEMSP interventions with the new provisions on centralization in the Budget
Law, makes for a very robust plan for improving public finance management in Lao PDR. Government
also made significant efforts to improve the monitoring and evaluation framework through the Public
Expenditures Review and Public Expenditures Tracking Survey.



2
The new revised Budget Law that has potential to strengthen public financial management, especially
in its currently weakest part ­ central-local fiscal relations ­ has been drafted and approved by the National
Assembly significantly ahead of schedule.

The new Tax Law and VAT Law are also significant steps to improve revenue collection and broaden
the revenue base. The VAT Law has several strong points, in particular a single rate and limited
exemptions, and the Government is working on revisions to include centralized tax payer units and review
of legal framework. Other efforts on revenue side include steady and regular increase in fuel levy,
notwithstanding oil price increases that are not subsidized in Lao PDR.

The Government has also strengthened oversight of the State-Owned Enterprises and made
significant progress in bringing state-owned utilities to the cost recovery levels. Regular and on-
schedule electricity and water tariff increases took place during PRSC1-3, moving state-owned utilities to
cost recovery levels. The Government is following the Power Sector Action Plan to ensure financial
viability of the EdL, and established a Rural Electrification Fund and drafted new water supply law. It also
introduced a forestry sector monitoring system, and Forestry Industry Restructuring plan. The international
audits were undertaken by GOL for the largest loss-making SOEs and for the State-Owned Banks, and the
largest SOEs have been restructured. The Government has also established regular monitoring of the
progress against the restructuring plans of SOEs and against financial targets established for the SOCBs.
Several steps were taken in the PRSP priority sectors (health, education, and infrastructure). During
PRSC1-3 the Government improved monitoring and timeliness of payment of salaries to teachers and
health workers. In addition, it launched pilots of school grants program and equity funds pilots for
hospitals. In infrastructure, it increased financing of the road maintenance fund to near financial
sustainability through fuel levy increases; and updated road preservation fund.

A shift in approach to the private sector has taken place during PRSC1-3 that marks an important
step in transition from a planned to a market economy. The new Enterprise Law approved last year is
based on international best practice, and implementing decrees are being drafted. The Government
presented a comprehensive strategy for private sector development and trade focusing on improving
investment climate and including reduction in cumbersome regulations and procedures at and behind the
border; it also hosted the first Lao Business Forum for private-public dialog, committed to an SME strategy
encompassing reforms in many investment climate components, such as regulation of businesses, access to
finance, enterprise taxation and accounting, and infrastructure. In financial sector, several laws and
regulations have been drafted, in order to level the playing field and provide services for domestic and
foreign, small and large businesses; these include Banking Law, Secure Transactions Law, and Decrees on
precious metals and foreign exchange.

The government has entered regional and international agreements that require increased
transparency and specific economic policies from its members. Lao PDR entered ASEAN/AFTA, and
committed to access to the WTO. It became a member of the World Customs Organization (WCO). Lao
PDR undertook a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study to find main constraints to trade and is now working
on reduction in trade regulations. Lao PDR is working on WTO accession and has made progress on its
commitments to reduce tariffs and introduce single window and other reforms.

8.      The sixth NSEDP 2006-10 and the Progress Report are viewed as a Poverty
Reduction Strategy that fulfills the main criteria: poverty focus, broad participation,
results orientation, and donor harmonization. The NSEDP 2006-10 integrates the
NGPES and builds on its participatory approach, poverty focus and to some extent results
orientation. It complies with the key features of a successful Poverty Reduction Strategy.
In particular, it went through a transparent and accountable drafting process, and
contained a small but functional monitoring and evaluation framework. It also addresses
donor harmonization issues. International non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
donors active in the Lao PDR endorsed the final NSEDP at the 9th Round Table Meeting


3
(RTM) on November 28th, 2006, and reconfirmed their commitment at the two
subsequent Round Table Implementation Meetings in November 2007 and 2008.

The Economy
9.     The Lao PDR economy grew steadily for more than a decade. Real GDP
growth averaged more than 6 percent a year in the 1990s, and further accelerated to an
average of 7.5 percent between 2005 and 2008. The contribution to this growth from non-
resource sectors1 of the economy averaged at around 5.5 percent during the same period,
with the resource sector2 contribution gradually increasing.

10.     Macroeconomic conditions have been stable during and after implementation
due to disciplined fiscal and monetary management in the aftermath of the Asian
crisis. Single digit inflation was achieved in 2004 and since been maintained. Revenues
have increased gradually throughout the 2000s, reflecting growing economy and gradual
improvements in tax collection. In recent years budget deficits have been declining and
the kip has performed steadily against the US Dollar and Thai Baht ­ and withstood a
significant appreciation as the government carefully managed the growing foreign capital
inflows and increasing value of resource outflows.

Development challenges
11.      Being a small land-locked transition economy, Lao PDR is facing a number
of development challenges. These include challenging geography with the poorest
populations living in inaccessible highlands, high poverty levels (more than 70 percent of
population are living on less than $2 a day), a mostly agrarian subsistence economy with
unsophisticated industries and significant barriers to export, weak investment climate and
entrepreneurship skills, constrained fiscal position of the Government that reduces its
ability to reform and expand social sectors spending (among the lowest in the world), and
high dependence on international aid. The PRSO series has attempted to tackle several of
these challenges through a comprehensive program of public financial management
strengthening, investment climate improvement reforms, and poverty reduction programs
support (see Box 1 on page 2).

Bank Rationale for a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) in Lao PDR

12.    The track record of adjustment lending in Lao PDR between 1989 and 2001
was uneven. Even though the WB team strongly disagreed, the World Bank Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) rated as unsatisfactory the outcome of the first three
World Bank Structural Adjustment Credits--SAC I (approved in 1989), SAC II
(approved in 1991) and SAC III (approved in 1996). According to OED's evaluation, the
SACs did not perform well--mainly due to weak Government commitment to the reform
program and weak implementation capacity. OED recommended that future policy-based
operations in Lao PDR should take on some key lessons.


1
  Light manufacturing, agriculture and industrial forestry, tourism and retail, construction, and emerging
food and nonfood processing industries.
2
  Mining (copper, gold, and other subsoil assets) and hydro electric energy.


4
13.    The Bank drew on the shortcomings of earlier budget support operations to
ensure that inter-ministerial coordination, TA and capacity limitations were
addressed. The Bank's increased confidence in the Government's commitment to the
reform program was based on the full implementation of the FMAC, approved in June
2002, to which can now be added successful implementation of PRSO1-3, approved in
March 2005, April 2006, and June 2007. Moreover, the PRSO program was based on the
Government's own poverty reduction strategy rather than on an externally imposed
framework.
           Fostering greater inter-ministerial coordination. The Government made a
              specific effort to ensure inter-ministerial coordination through the
              NGPES/NSEDP process and through the PRSO Steering Committee and
              Technical Secretariat, with representation from across Government. As
              part of the PRSO review process, Government has organized frequent
              inter-ministerial PRSO meetings, to align implementation strategies and
              discuss cross-cutting issues.
           Supporting the operation with adequate and appropriate technical
              assistance (TA). The Government continues to use FMCBC and other
              resources to support technical assistance, capacity enhancement and
              institutional development efforts. It is also making use of the PHRD grant
              TA attached to the PRSO3. Furthermore, the proposed MDTF for PEMSP
              will provide significant additional grant resources for technical assistance
              to effectively implement policies.
           Taking account of capacity limitations. To take account of capacity
              constraints, the PRSO program was designed as a programmatic series,
              recognizing the need to manage reform in a series of steps, but focused on
              medium-term outcomes and monitorable impacts.

14.     The decision to initiate a PRSO series for Lao PDR was a risky one for one
more reason. Prior to the Lao PDR PRSC1, all PRSC countries had had average CPIA
ratings above 3.2, and no country which met the criteria for LICUS had been included
among PRSC countries. Lao PDR CPIA ratings averaged 2.9 in 2004 and its track record
of reform was mixed. For the success it would require Lao PDR to live up to the PRSC
instrument's high standards in commitment and the speed of implementation of policy
reforms, intended for well performing countries with a strong track record of reform.

15.   The above risks notwithstanding, Lao PDR was considered suitable for a
PRSC due to its recent good macroeconomic performance and progress on reforms
and poverty reduction. This was specifically demonstrated by the GOL's commitment
to:
     implementing a phased reform agenda across several sectors of the economy;
     improving its performance in adjustment lending programs, including satisfactory
      completion of Financial Management Adjustment Credit actions in 2004 and
      adoption of PRSC1 prior actions;
     sound economic management over the previous decade, resulting in sustained
      growth, stable macroeconomic conditions and significant poverty reduction; and



5
       a plan to further reduce poverty and improve social indicators, the fifth National
       Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) for 2001-2005.

16.     Two important reasons for using a programmatic PRSC instrument in Lao
PDR were: the need to ensure stable progress of reforms, and the need to mitigate
risks of the Bank's involvement in the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydro electric dam
project. In order to mitigate the risks related to the project and to ensure that Lao PDR
stays on track with the structural reforms necessary to ensure poverty-reducing use of the
potential revenues, there was a need for a programmatic engagement in several policy
areas, especially on public financial management and on the growth agenda. The PRSC1
and the program for PRSC1-3 were approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on the
same day with the NT2 project.

17.     The Bank also envisaged that the programmatic approach of a PRSC would
greatly assist Lao PDR to sustain economic growth and deepen poverty reduction
efforts. In particular, a PRSC would continue the momentum and reinforce GOL
commitments to reforms. It would also encourage a cross-sectoral approach to
implementing multiple reforms, translate growth into improved social indicators, ensure
natural resource revenues contributed to poverty reduction and human development goals,
build GOL capacity and help align donor assistance.

18.     On this basis, the Bank approved an initial program of three Poverty
Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs 1-3). Following completion of the three
operations in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively the GOL received around $28 million
over three years in budget support funding from the Bank.

19.     Lao PDR has demonstrated that a PRSC instrument, coupled with strong
technical assistance program, can have a significant positive impact on a LICUS
country performance, and bring about a stable progress on policy reform. The
commitment and ownership of the operation by the Government grew steadily over its
course, and performance improved significantly. At ICR, Lao PDR's CPIA rating is at
3.3, and the country is firmly on path of reforms, stable macroeconomic conditions, and
steadily improving outcomes.

Contribution of the PRSC to higher level objectives
20.     The PRSC was a key tool to implement the Bank's new Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Lao PDR. The CAS sought to sustain the GOL's recent
development progress by selectively targeting NGPES priorities for further reform. The
PRSC was designed to help the GOL to make measurable progress against the NGESP
priorities identified in the CAS, including strengthening PFM, improving resource
allocation to pro-poor development priorities and sustaining growth through better
resource generation. It was also central to implementing CAS objectives of building GOL
capacity, improving cross-sectoral reform dialogue and sharing analytical work.




6
1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
21.     The PRSOs aimed to improve public resource use, increase social service
spending and sustain economic growth. To achieve this, three ambitious PDOs were
established:
    1. Public resource management: ensure efficient management of public sector
       resources, by strengthening public expenditure management and maximizing the
       effectiveness of public resources to achieve development goals. Areas targeted for
       improvement included the allocation, execution and monitoring of central and
       provincial public expenditures; fiscal discipline; SOBs, SOEs and utilities.
    2. Public Expenditure Policies: increase the poverty reduction impact of public
       spending to enhance access and quality of basic education and health services and
       improve roads, water supply and sanitation services for the poor. This supported
       NGPES pro-poor priorities and the MDG target to graduate from a Least
       Developed Country by 2020.
    3. Sustained Growth: an increase in available resources is necessary to achieve
       NGPES objectives by promoting a stronger private sector, greater trade volume
       and sustainable management of natural resources.

22.   Key indicators were aligned to NGPES and CAS objectives, as well as AAA
work. To meet the indicators, the GOL was required to:
     improve financial management capacity, align expenditure with medium term
      priorities and enhance budget execution and the procurement system;
     strengthen the banking sector by improving SOCBs management;
     reduce the number of SOEs and SOE losses and increase net profits;
     increase cost recovery in electricity and water utilities;
     increase: budget share to health and education; use of health services; school
      enrollments; electricity, water and road access; and timeliness of civil service pay;
     reduce import tariffs in line with AFTA and the barriers to establishing a
      business; and
     mobilize natural resource revenue and implement sustainable forest management.


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
23.     The PDOs and key indicators did not change over the life of the series.
However, actions and prior actions were refined during PRSOs 2 and 3 to better reflect
the frontier of reform, and the findings of recent AAA work, in a way that is consistent
with the PRSCs guidelines.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program
24.    A cross sectoral approach was taken under PRSC1-3 to address multiple
policy areas based on CAS and NGPES objectives. The policy areas selected for
reform were:


7
         strengthening public financial management and the banking sector;
         improving SOE performance and financial sustainability of utilities;
         aligning and monitoring pro-poor NGPES priorities;
         sustaining growth through private sector development;
         accelerating regional and global integration; and
         improving natural resource management.

25.   The PRSOs supported the implementation of key GoL programs and
development priorities, including:
     the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) - which
      aims to improve PEM and work towards international financial standards. The
      PRSOs supported the PEMSP by providing technical assistance (TA) and setting
      actions related to its development and implementation;
     the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - increasing social spending as a
      result of the PRSOs assisted the GOL to meet MDGs, which demands
      extraordinary efforts to reduce poverty and improve the health and education
      status of the population by 2015.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas
26.      There were no revisions to the policy areas during the series.

1.6 Other significant changes
27.    As confidence grew in the GOL's performance throughout the series, donor
involvement intensified. PRSC1 was funded solely by the Bank, while the European
Commission (EC) and Japan played consultative roles. In February 2007, after the GOL
had completed PRSC1 and 2 prior actions, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation
(JBIC) signed an agreement for a concessional loan of 500 million yen (around US$4.2
million) for PRSO2. The EC has also committed Euro 3 million to support PRSO3
implementation. Grant based TA to build capacity for the Public Expenditure Review
(PER) and PEMSP was provided by Japan, the EC, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) for PRSOs 2
and 3.

28.      During PRSO2, the GOL finalized a new Poverty Reduction Strategy, the
National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) for 2006-2010. The NSEDP
integrates the NGPES and builds on its participatory approach and poverty focus. It was
approved by donors and international NGOs in November 2006. The strategic
intervention areas include: (i) human development and private sector driven economic
growth (ii) competitiveness, trade and regional integration; (iii) social development and
focused poverty reduction interventions (including geographic targeting of the 47 poorest
districts); and (iv) good governance. These strategic areas were developed in consultation
with the Bank and were generally consistent with the reforms being pursued under the
PRSO series.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance

29.     The implementation of PRSO program had to overcome significant
challenges, through enforced dialog and parallel support. Lao PDR is a small low
income country, with limited civil service and severe budget constraints. The capacity of
the government to understand the instrument as well as implement complex reforms was
extremely limited, exacerbated by poor intra-governmental coordination. At entry,
Bank's knowledge of the country was based on missions from HQ, and the understanding
of Government's priorities and constraints was relatively limited. Through a program of
close monitoring, gradually building an in-country team and acquiring of the local
knowledge through the presence on the ground and extensive AAA work, the team has
achieved significant improvements in performance. One of the main factors to this was
realization of importance of TA in implementing PRSCs in countries with severe capacity
constraints (see also the next section).

30.     As a result of above efforts, implementation progress was faster during
PRSO3. Program performance improved with each operation, leading to all actions and
triggers for all three operations having been met by the end of the series. The approval of
PRSC1 was contingent on completion of 10 prior actions. Under PRSO2, one action was
waived, and the progress on four other prior actions was delayed; but all 11 initial prior
actions were subsequently achieved during PRSO3. In PRSO3, one trigger was met ahead
of schedule and at a higher level than was originally expected. Due to this
overachievement, another trigger (on financial information systems and budget reports)
was substantially modified. A list of all completed prior actions is at Annex 2.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

31.     Efforts to mitigate the above shortcomings of the previous budget support
operations have been successful during implementation of the PRSOs 1 to 3,
especially on greater coordination and provision of TA. First, the inter-ministerial
agency coordination has been improved through the PRSO process and related dialog;
this resulted in a process that was comparatively more owned and efficient. Second, the
impact of provision of technical assistance in selected areas has been clear in public
financial management component: progress on this component has been faster and more
profound in comparison to other areas that enjoyed less of such support (for example,
banking reform).

32.     However, the PRSO1-3 series had not fully taken into account the existing
capacity limitations at entry. While the programmatic series has been more beneficial
than a self-standing operation would have been, the Government's capacity to implement
reforms may have been over-estimated during the design of the first programmatic series.
Structural reforms during transition from planned to a market economy, such as SOE
reform and Banking sector reform, need to be accompanied by several parallel processes
before they can be successful. Such processes require building understanding of the
meaning of these reforms, and building support within different parts of the Government.
This suggests a sequence that needs to be followed: improved monitoring, setting targets
and monitoring achievement of such targets, building incentives system to achieve targets
within the public sector, and finally implementable actions. Building capacity to perform
in such complex reforms during this sequence is key to success of these reforms.

33.      The programmatic commitment and dialog resulted in enhanced inter-
ministerial coordination. Over the course of the series, the level of efficiency across the
government improved, leading to the achievement of particularly good outcomes in trade
liberalization, SOE performance and restructuring of utility tariffs. This coordination also
demonstrated higher levels of government ownership of PRSO3. Nevertheless, there is
still a need to support ministries in understanding the meaning of reforms and in building
support within different parts of the government. On the whole, a programmatic series
was more effective in this regard than separate stand alone operations would have been.
Growing ownership of PRSO reforms supported the implementation process. The
Ministry of Finance (MOF) demonstrated solid leadership and focus in chairing the
PRSO Steering Committee, as well as a good vision to assist other ministries to
implement reforms. To ensure dialogue across sectors, the PRSO Committee was
supported by a Technical Secretariat with representation from a range of ministries.

34.     The benefits of greater focus were recognized. The high number of actions and
triggers was making it difficult for the GOL to concentrate on key reforms and effectively
coordinate issues across ministries. With the consensus of the GOL, the Bank reduced the
number of prior actions from 11 in PRSO1 and PRSO2, to 7 in PRSO3), allowing a
clearer focus on results. PRSO instrument's embedded flexibility was used to refine
actions and triggers to suit conditions on the ground. For example, a few actions were
moved to subsequent operations where sufficient progress had not been achieved. This
provided the opportunity to consider why progress was slower than anticipated and
remedial action taken (including greater AAA work or TA support). It was noted that
actions and prior actions could have been worded more flexibly and indicatively to
support better outcomes rather than fulfilling the matrix to the letter.

35.     A sound assessment of risks was undertaken during the design phase, and
these were relatively well mitigated. The PRSO was originally assessed as a high risk
program, given Lao PDR's past uneven adjustment lending track record, high fiduciary
risks, the lack of accountability of provincial authorities to the centre, fiscal challenges,
and severe civil service capacity constraints. Efforts to mitigate the shortcomings of
previous adjustment credit operations were reasonably successful, especially
improvements in ministerial coordination and TA provision. As a result, the GOL were



10
able to meet all actions and triggers and the level of some risks were downgraded. The
main risks and their evolution are outlined in Box 2 below.

Box 2: Main Risks to the first PRSO series
The following risks were identified in the design phase:
Risk 1: The GOL's commitment to past reforms has been uneven, resulting in poor policy
implementation and weak accountability. Mitigation: Recent growing momentum and commitment to
broad-based reforms; the wide NGPES participatory process and sustained GOL involvement in PRSO
development; commitment to world trade integration.
Risk 2: The weak PFM system leads to high fiduciary risk. Mitigation: GOL commitment to implement
PEM reforms; satisfactory implementation of FMAC; the PEMSP work; commitment to an NT2
framework for social spending revenues.
Risk 3: Provincial autonomy hinders implementation of national polices and equitable resource
distribution. Mitigation: a review of the decentralization process and GOL commitment to PFM reforms.
Risk 4: Short-term fiscal unsustainability could result in the diversion of PRSC funds (not
earmarked) to cover losses from the budget, SOCBs and SOEs. Mitigation: GOL commitment to
achieve budget sustainability; measures to improve budget oversight; restructuring and external audits of
SOCBs.
Risk 5: Severe civil service capacity constraints, due to the lack of qualified personnel and low pay
and incentives, leads to weak administrative ability. Mitigation: Acknowledgement of this problem by
the GOL in the NGPES; the explicit focus on capacity building in the CAS.


REDEFINING THE RISKS IN PRSO3
As a result of additional efforts to build capacity and increase commitment, the risks at completion
were somewhat different and re-prioritized, as government-related risks declined in probability and
importance. As a result, after progress was made during the first two operations, the Bank reduced the
seriousness of some risks. The order of the risks was revised as follows:
Risk 1: Weak PFM and high fiduciary risk;
Risk 2. Severe capacity constraints;
Risk 3: Provincial autonomy and inadequate accountability/monitoring hinders equitable spending;
Risk 4: Fiscal risks could result in diversion of PRSO funds; and
Risk 5: Earlier uneven commitment to reforms could result in poor performance.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
36.     As is standard practice for PRSCs, the impact of the series was evaluated in
accordance with an M&E framework. Performance was monitored with reference to
the PRSO Program Matrix, which was updated annually to reflect progress against
actions, macroeconomic developments and the pace of NGPES/NSEDP implementation.
A comprehensive set of outcomes indicators also helped to measure GOL progress in
meeting actions and triggers.

37.    The explicit strategy of the PRSO series and accompanying analytical work
has been to identify and fill key knowledge-gaps with an emphasis on joint work
with other development agencies so that there is buy-in on the diagnosis. The results
of this AAA process were used for building a consensus on policy reform, sector
investments, and harmonization of donor assistance in key areas and are reflected in the
NGPES and NSEDP as well as their implementation. The program included a Country


11
Procurement Assessment Review (2002), a Poverty Study (2002), a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (2002), a Public Expenditure Review (2002), a Poverty-
Environment Nexus Study (2002), and more recently by the Country Economic
Memorandum (2004), Lao Poverty Assessment, Public Expenditure Review, Poverty and
Social Impact Analysis, the first Public Expenditure Tracking Survey; the Diagnostic
Trade Integration Study; and an Investment Climate Assessment. These studies have been
prepared by Bank staff in collaboration with Government. Several of the studies have
been completed in collaboration with other donors including the IMF, ADB and EU. In
2004, the National Statistics Centre (NSC), ADB, SIDA and the Bank agreed on the Lao
PDR Poverty Assessment (LAOPA), which provides analytical support to monitor
NGPES/NSEDP implementation and assisted the Bank to review PRSO progress.

38.     Monitoring and evaluation was sometimes impeded by data availability.
There is a general lack of reliable data in Lao PDR. During the series, the Bank worked
towards improving the standard of data, including a TFSCB project and a push for joint
analytical projects with donors. The regular release of the Public Expenditure Tracking
Survey (PETS) and Public Expenditure Review (PER) data starting from 2007 will
improve the quality and availability of information in future. To mitigate this, PRSO
objectives could have been more aligned with AAA work to help achieve and monitor
actions and triggers.

39.    The Bank and other donors monitored progress through continuous dialog
and supervision missions. This helped to identify areas in which the GOL required
additional support to achieve outcomes, harmonize donor priorities and ensure that
research and analytical resources were used more efficiently. The IMF continued to
conduct bi-annual macroeconomic assessments and regular discussions took place with
donors through Round Table Meeting sub committees.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation
40.    The Bank is currently implementing the second PRSC series, PRSOs 4-7.
These operations will run between FY2007/8 and FY2010/11, with annual Bank
financing of around US$10m. PRSO4-7 was presented to the Board for approval in May
2008 and is consistent with the NSEDP.

PRSOs 4-7 was designed to reflect lessons learned in the first three operations. To
increase the effectiveness of PRSO 4-7 triggers and actions are:
     structured in line with the four pillars of the NSEDP, but do not attempt to fully
       cover the whole plan, and instead help the GoL prioritize its reform agenda;
     accompanied by increased TA to build capacity;
     designed to lead to the achievement of monitorable outcomes and focus on a four
       year program of deliverables rather than year-on-year actions; and
     intended to have lasting effects in improving mechanisms and incentive systems.




12
41.    PRSO4-7 builds on the achievements of the previous series, deepens structural
reforms on public financial management, and expands the reforms on supporting the
delivery of further benefits in two broad categories:
     (i) Investment Climate, Competitiveness, and Business Development; and
     (ii) Public Finance Management and Improving Service Delivery.

42.    Donor involvement in developing the second series is strong. The EC, Japan
and other donors are heavily engaged in the design of PRSO 4-7. The GoL has recently
signed grant agreements with a range of donors to establish multi-donor trust funds to
provide grant-based TA for the PEMSP and trade related reforms (these MDTFs are
administered by the Bank).

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
43.     The objectives of the first PRSO series were highly relevant to country
priorities. The PRSO was designed to be aligned with the Lao PDR National Growth and
Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) which was discussed by the IDA Board of
Directors as a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in March 2005. Over the course
of the series, the GOL's development challenges did not change markedly. After the
GOL incorporated the NGPES main principles into its medium-term strategy (NSEDP6),
it became a new Poverty Reduction Strategy (NSEDP/PRS) in late 2006 (it was
subsequently discussed by the IDA and IMF Boards of Directors in June 2008 together
with the Annual Implementation Report). The GOL implemented the PRSO in close
consultation with the Bank to ensure objectives remained appropriate and to allow for
actions to be revised according to conditions on the ground.
44.     PRSO objectives were also consistent with Lao PDR's global priorities. In
particular, the PRSO supported steps towards regional and global integration as a means
to achieve broad-based growth and alleviate poverty. This included assisting the GOL to
make further progress towards WTO accession and reduce trade barriers.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
PDO 1: Public Resource Management - Ensure efficient management of public sector
resources
45.    Over the series, key building blocks needed for a robust PFM and
governance framework were established. These included: more timely budget
appropriations; streamlined budget preparation; more transparent budget papers; progress
to a centralized Treasury, a modernized chart of accounts and improved procurement
processes. A new Budget Law is expected to improve central-provincial fiscal relations
and was approved by the National Assembly (NA) ahead of schedule. The new Tax Law
and VAT Law are big steps towards improving centralized revenue collection.

46.    Progress was made towards meeting HIPC indicators. PFM outcomes were
not fully realized as measured by HIPC indicators, although all but two HIPC


13
benchmarks are expected to be met by end-2009 and further progress will be measured by
PEFA indicators. Key areas of PFM requiring further development include effective
budget classification, monitoring and execution systems and audit capacity. Fiduciary
risks remain high and improving PFM will require significant and sustained capacity
building over time.

47.     Steps were taken to strengthen the fragile banking sector. Satisfactory
achievements were made through an overall reduction of NPLs, implementation of
international audits and basic central oversight mechanisms and engagement of
international financial advisers to build capacity. Despite this progress, the overall
outcome rating for banking reforms was downgraded to partially satisfactory as the new
flow of NPLs for Lao Development Bank (LDB) exceeded the 15 per cent target set by
the BOL. At ICR, NPLs are at 4.2 percent, partly due to the efforts under PRSO1-3.
However, much higher level of TA support is necessary in the future if the capacity and
performance of the banking sector is to be lifted and to attract higher levels of private
investment.

48.    The operations assisted the GOL to markedly improve oversight and
performance of SOEs. Reforms implemented by the GOL resulted in higher revenues
and net profits, decreases in loss making SOEs and restructuring of the four largest SOEs.
Combined losses of the four SOEs targeted for restructuring in PRSC1 have decreased
from 265 billion kip to 73 billion kip.

49.      Financial sustainability outcomes of state owned electricity and water
utilities progressed to a highly satisfactory level. This followed the introduction of
tariff adjustments to help achieve cost recovery levels. As a result, cost recovery in utility
increased from 83 percent to 90.5 percent and the proportion of water utilities operating
at full cost recovery rose by 24 percent to 35 percent. The government is following the
Power Sector Action Plan to increase financial viability of the EdL, established a Rural
Electrification Fund and drafted a new water supply law.

PDO 2: Public expenditure management ­Increase the poverty reduction impact of
public spending
50.      The performance orientation of the GOL improved, most notably through
the introduction of new accounting systems to track spending in education and
health. Taking 2006 and 2007 as a baseline, it will be possible to assess whether
additional resources, including future NT2 revenues, are being aligned to priorities. A
PER and a PETS will allow better measurement of the funding levels actually reaching
front line service delivery units.

51.    Solid progress was made towards increasing access to social services and
infrastructure. The timeliness of salary payments to health workers and teachers
improved and schools grants programs and hospital equity funds were piloted in some of
the poorest districts. A fuel levy was increased to fund an updated road preservation fund
and all routine road maintenance, resulting in a four percent increase in useable tarred
roads.


14
52.     However, further work is needed to improve social outcomes for the poor.
Despite these actions, overall progress in decreasing the gap in service delivery to poor
and non-poor has been uneven. While performance was good against infrastructure
indicators and budget allocations to health and education slightly exceeded PRSO
baseline indicators, it is still a major concern that spending on basic education and health
remains low and heavily reliant on external financing.

PDO 3: Sustainable growth ­ An increase in available resources is necessary to achieve
NGPES objectives
53.     The government performed particularly well in this area, with highly
satisfactory progress towards regional and global integration. New enterprise and
customs laws based on international best practice in business regulation are being
implemented. Integration is progressing well with momentum towards WTO accession,
commitments to introduce an ASEAN single window and ratification of AFTA tariff
reductions by the NA (with full transit to new tariff schemes by 2009).

54.    Positive reforms were developed to better manage natural resources and
GOL revenue targets were exceeded for the first time. Reforms included a forest
industry restructuring plan to rationalize industrial capacity and resource supply. This
plan helped government revenues to exceed projections for the first time ­ up from 11
percent in 2003/04 to 12.1 percent in 2005/06. Revenue projections for 2006-07 are set at
13.2 percent which is significantly higher than the target of 12.4 percent.

55.    Measures to promote a sustainable forest industry exceeded PRSO targets.
Coverage of sustainable forest management increased from 100,000 hectares in 2001 to
around 635,000 hectares in 2006 ­ this is well in excess of the PRSO target of 528,000
hectares in 2007. It is important that the GOL enforces this policy to prevent
encroachment into protected areas.

56.     Important breakthroughs were achieved to improve private sector
development and extend Lao PDR's transition from planned to market economy.
The GOL finalized a comprehensive private sector development and trade strategy to
improve the investment climate, has committed to a SME strategy and drafted laws and
regulations to level the playing field and provide services for domestic and foreign, small
and large businesses. Other important first steps include the increased share of banks'
credits to private sector and a large reduction in the time required to start a business from
198 days in 2004 to 103 days in 2006. Further work is needed beyond this series to
remove other major barriers to private sector investment, such as high operating costs and
regulatory burdens.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Ratings: Satisfactory




15
  57.     The overall satisfactory rating is a sizeable achievement considering the high
  risks identified by the Bank at the beginning of the series. The rating is based on GOL
  performance against the 40 indicators of which: 5 were rated as highly satisfactory, 23
  were satisfactory and 12 were partially satisfactory. No indicators were rated as
  `unsatisfactory'. See Table 1 for a summary of the ratings for each policy area.

  stage and is proceeding as planned. As a result, several HIPIC indicators had been completed and achieved their targets at ICR (see

  3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
   (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
  58.     The poor have benefited most from economic and social developments.
  Results of recent AAA work conducted by the Lao PDR country team shows that the
  poor have benefited most from economic growth and social and infrastructure
  improvements, and poverty has reduced most in the poorest districts. This work also
  reveals that while ethnic minorities are still the most disadvantaged, they gained more on
  average than other groups.

  59.     The number of poor people has decreased and key social indicators have
  improved. The number of poor people in 2005 had declined by 870,000 people due to
  rising living standards since 1992/93. The number of child and maternal deaths also
  decreased over this time. Projections suggest that the overall poverty headcount will fall
  from 33 percent in 2002/03 to 31 percent in 2005, and the proportion of the population
  living on $1 a day or less is projected to fall from 23 per cent in 2003 to 14.4 per cent in
  2007.

  60.      Qualitative data shows that the gap in access to education and health
  facilities between priority and non-priority districts seems to be reducing. Road and
  health coverage is improving in these areas, but more needs to be done to the assist the
  poor to meet health and education costs and to access land (source Participatory Poverty
  Assessment II 2006). Overall progress has been made in increasing school enrolment
  rates for girls, but more progress has been achieved in for the majority ethnic group.

  61.     The 2007 Poverty and Social Impact Assessment was developed to improve
  understanding of the impact of poverty reduction strategies on local communities
  and ethnic groups. It concludes that reforms are needed to allow for greater flexibility
  at the local level to respond to communities' needs and to reduce the negative impacts of
  economic development on vulnerable areas (including land rights, planning and
  budgeting and environmental protection). PSIA also found that there is an ongoing need
  to gather and disseminate evidence on poverty trends and the impact of poverty reduction
  programs.

  (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
  62.    The PRSO process has enhanced the GOL's capacity to implement
  cross-sectoral reforms and to coordinate issues across ministries. The provision of
  TA has resulted in basic strengthening of organizational capacity in some sectors, such as
  financial management. Another positive impact is increased GOL engagement in the
  development agenda and improved policy dialogue and coordination on poverty
  reduction issues between the government and donors. In effect, these changes have


  17
strengthened the GOL's overall capacity to develop and implement reforms. This is one
of the major strengths of this type of support mechanism - stand alone, sector specific
programs are generally unable to achieve these types of organizational changes.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
63.     The operations produced a number of positive, unintended impacts that will
inform future reform programs in Lao PDR. First, the GOL gained a better
understanding of the usefulness of taking a strategic approach to reforms. For example,
the ministries that adopted a sector strategy were able to progress their reform agendas
more quickly and effectively. As a result, sector strategies are now being developed and
adopted more widely across ministries. Second, the Bank is now more aware of the true
extent of GOL capacity needs, which has highlighted the importance of capacity building
to the quality and speed of reform. As a result, future operations will be supported by
greater levels of TA from the Bank and other donors. Third, greater insight was gained
into the existing political constraints and the impact this can have on the pace of reforms.
In particular, it became clearer as to which reform areas the GOL is most committed.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
64.     Stakeholder workshops led to the development of Partnership Principles to
strengthen and harmonize donor support for future operations. Two stakeholder
workshops (involving the Bank, GOL and donors) were held in 2007 to discuss lessons
learned from the implementation of the PRSC1-3 (these are discussed more fully in
Section 6 on `Lessons Learned') and ways forward for PRSO4-7. A significant outcome
was the development of Partnership Principles to improve the coherence, consistency and
predictability of Development Partner (DP) support to the GOL (see Box 3 for more
detail on the Partnership Principles). This will enhance the effectiveness of DP support to
the NSEDP and PRSO4-7, as envisaged in the Vientiane Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness. The DPs committing to these principles are Japan, the EC, Australia, and
the Bank.

Box 3. Partnership Principles
The aim of the Partnership is to:
        Assist the GOL to design and achieve triggers, actions and outcome indicators by strengthening and
        harmonizing DP support;
        Focus on implementation performance, particularly direction and pace of reforms;
        Achieve consensus among DPs on the design of successive annual operations; and
        Improve dialog with stakeholders via an agreed work plan, involving coordinated missions, regular DP
        meetings and progress report to the GOL led Roundtable.

The Partnership will be driven by the following principles:

Ownership: The DPs recognize that the PRSO program is led by the Government and is based on its reform agenda
elaborated in the NSEDP. The DPs play a supporting role as partners to GOL in providing financial and technical
support to advance its reform agenda and implement the NSEDP;

Coherence: The design of triggers and actions of successive annual Policy Action Matrices should be driven by the
GOL. DPs will strive to ensure final triggers and actions take into account the steadiness of the direction of reforms,
capacity to implement, and ability to provide timely TA. The Policy Matrix will be the common framework for
monitoring and assessing progress.




18
Consistency: There should be one Policy Action Matrix with accepted triggers and monitoring indicators that will:
         Enjoy GOL ownership, be aligned with NSEDP, and represent a shared intention of a multi-year program;
         Represent a key element of the multi-year program and contribute significantly to the expected outcomes;
         Allocate resources and WB/DP experts to supervise implementation during annual preparatory missions;
         Have technical assistance provided for actions and triggers;
         Give priority to cross-sectoral issues.

Criticality: DPs share common recognition on triggers critical for each tranche release (disbursements). The actions in
a Policy Action Matrix aim to complement triggers and move the reform agenda forward.

Predictability: Provision of predictable budget support to GOL each year is important. While budget support levels
depend on GOL performance in meeting triggers in the Policy Action Matrix, DPs acknowledge that the PRSO series is
an ambitious reform agenda which requires flexibility to ensure program stability.

Timeline: PRSO4-7 are annual operations to provide budget support to GOL in line with its financial calendar.

Support: PRSO support will be in the context of DP's country strategy or bilateral cooperation program. DPs can
provide three kinds of support: (a) financing budget support through transfers to government account either directly or
via a trust fund arrangement with the WB; (b) providing technical assistance to GOL to achieve annual triggers and
actions either directly or through multi-donor trust funds; and (c) other forms of assistance provided by DPs to
influence achievement of triggers/actions.

Communication: DPs will "speak with one voice" to GOL and take a consistent approach to communication ie regular
meetings, joint missions and timely briefings. The WB Task Team Leader will lead joint missions and consult DPs as
appropriate. DPs will inform partners of bilateral PRSO-related discussions with GOL.

Measuring Results: Monitoring of results will occur at the following points in the PRSO program:
        prior to confirming the tranche release, triggers and actions will be monitored. Besides these fixed tranches,
        some DPs may consider additional disbursements based on indicators;
        after the tranche release, an evaluation, given information available, will be undertaken to assess progress
        towards outcomes (via Implementation Status Report);
        after program completion, an evaluation of lessons learned and progress on outcomes will be conducted
        based on program experience and success (via an Implementation Completion Report).


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Ratings: Low

65.     The progress achieved on development outcomes is expected to be sustained.
The GOL is committed to a strategy to ensure development outcomes stay on track, as
explicitly set out in the NSEDP for 2006-2010. The GOL is fully engaged in processes to
build on existing reforms, including the development of PRSO 4-7. The GOL is also well
aware of the economic and social risks if fiscal discipline and commitment to reforms
were to weaken.

66.     At the time of the ICR it is clear that the progress on outcomes accelerated
and continued after PRSO1-3 implementation. However, due to its reliance on the
natural resource sector, the Lao PDR economy is susceptible to external shocks. Falling
prices for commodities, particularly copper and gold which account for more than half of
total exports, will have a significant impact on fiscal policy and potentially on social
sector spending. Declining global demand for Lao exports could further reduce revenues
and exacerbate this impact. Greater donor support for fiscal gaps may be necessary to
keep reforms on track and address real sector impacts. These risks are being addressed in
the currently ongoing PRSO5 operation and within the context of the global financial
crisis.


19
67.     Capacity building in the macroeconomic management of non-natural
resource sectors will be necessary to ensure sustainable development and poverty
reduction. Preparation is necessary to counter potentially adverse effects on inflation, the
real effective exchange rate and growth of the rest of the economy. In this context, the
NSEDP appropriately proposes to strengthen the framework of monetary management at
the Bank of the Lao PDR (BoL). It would be advisable that the instruments provided to
the BoL be market-based and that extensive technical assistance be sought.

68.     The GOL is conscious of the risks to the environment posed by rapid growth.
The government has committed to further natural resource management reforms under
PRSOs 4-7 and a framework for managing the impact of the NT2 hydropower project.
Given Lao PDR's significant natural resources and under-developed non-natural resource
sectors, managing the trade-off between growth and environmental protection will be a
significant challenge.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Ratings: Satisfactory

69.     A high level of Bank scrutiny was applied to ensure Quality at Entry. A
formal Quality at Entry Assessment was not conducted during the first PRSO series.
However, the country conditions (including results of AAA work) and risks were highly
scrutinized by the Bank prior to PRSC approval to ensure the environment was suited to
commencement of the first series.

70.      The Bank concluded that a PRSC in Lao PDR was ambitious and high risk,
but the potential returns were high. The potential returns were considered to justify the
risks, including sustained poverty reduction, economic growth and achievement of MDGs
(see Box 1 for more detail on the risks). Post-implementation it is evident that taking
these risks was not only justified but also highly beneficial for speeding up reform
progress, increasing commitment to reforms, building inter-governmental linkages, and
enhancing donor coordination.

71.    A comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy was established.
Given the fiduciary risks, macroeconomic conditions were carefully considered using
IMF assessments and PFM was identified as a major reform area in the operations.
Capacity constraints were taken into account by selecting Lao PDR as a pilot country for
a Capacity Enhancing Strategy, also devoting a CAS pillar to Capacity Building.
Dedicated accounts and additional reporting requirements put in place to ensure Bank
funds were used by the GOL for their intended purpose.




20
72.     The objectives of the first PRSO series were highly relevant to country
priorities. The PRSO was designed to be aligned with the Lao PDR National Growth and
Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) which was discussed by the IDA Board of
Directors as a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in March 2005. Over the course
of the series, the GOL's development challenges did not change markedly. After the
GOL incorporated the NGPES main principles into its medium-term strategy (NSEDP6),
it became a new Poverty Reduction Strategy (NSEDP/PRS) in late 2006 (it was
subsequently discussed by the IDA and IMF Boards of Directors in June 2008 together
with the Annual Implementation Report). The GOL implemented the PRSO in close
consultation with the Bank to ensure objectives remained appropriate and to allow for
actions to be revised according to conditions on the ground.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Ratings: Satisfactory

73.     A key strength of the operations was the effective dialogue between the Bank
and the GOL. By building strong relationships and engaging in regular communication,
the Bank ensured that the program stayed focused on the reform agenda and could access
support when necessary to implement actions. The satisfactory completion of the first
PRSO series could not have been achieved without the major efforts Bank staff put into
the dialogue.

74.     Effective Bank oversight helped the GOL to mitigate risks and produce
results. As the Bank was well aware of the high risks involved, it ensured that regular
progress monitoring was undertaken, including through frequent missions to identify
concerns and develop workable solutions. After realizing the importance of local
engagement, the Bank moved the TTL to the field, who combined a smaller and more
effective team from the neighboring country offices (and eventually Vientiane office).
This meant that lagging performance in some areas was recognized early, allowing for
the application of corrective measures. This support greatly assisted the GOL to meet all
actions and triggers and over-achieve against some PRSO3 triggers.

75.    Efforts to improve dialogue resulted in greater donor involvement and
harmonization of resources. The steps taken to enhance communication with DPs
helped to reduce overlap and inconsistencies between other development programs and
PRSO objectives. This is reflected by the involvement of co-financiers in PRSO2 and
PRSO3, commitments to further harmonize donor strategies and involvement of a wider
range of donors in the design of the second PRSO series.

76.    The Bank's supervisory role was supported by sound M&E arrangements.
Existing and ongoing AAA work aided the Bank to monitor and evaluate progress against
outcome indicators. Efforts were made throughout the series to improve the range and
quality of data to monitor PRSO outcomes, including the implementation of public
expenditure tracking surveys, implementation reports from ministries and SOE and
SOCB audit reports.



21
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

77.     The Bank's satisfactory performance resulted in the completion of an
ambitious reform program. Assisting the GOL to achieve a satisfactory end-of-series
performance rating is a significant achievement, considering the ambitious range of
reforms, the high risks and capacity constraints of the GOL. It is also based on
satisfactory ratings for program supervision and assessing quality at entry.
5.2 Borrower Performance
Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

78.     The GOL also completed the series to a satisfactory standard. This assessment
is based on the completion of all actions and triggers and the achievement of a
satisfactory end-of-series outcome rating. This performance is to be commended, given
the complex nature of reforms and the capacity constraints faced by the GOL.

79.     Strong GOL commitment helped to build momentum and lift performance
across the government. The program would not have succeeded without GOL
ownership of the reform program, empowerment of ministries and engagement in dialog
about priorities and progress with the Bank and other donors. The high level of
commitment shown, led to the Bank lowering the level of risk posed by the GOL's past
uneven reform performance from the highest risk in PRSC1 to the lowest in PRSO3 (see
Box 1).

80.     The MOF demonstrated solid leadership in chairing the PRSO Steering
Committee and building ministerial understanding of reforms. The PRSO Secretariat
played a key role in the day-to-day coordination and cooperation between ministries.
Ministries were also assisted to articulate sector strategies to better understand the
meaning of reforms and to implement them more efficiently. Performance by individual
ministries improved markedly throughout the series, as evidenced by the greater speed
and quality of reforms in PRSO3.

81.    Key development milestones were achieved by the GOL during the series.
These include progress towards a stronger public financial system and better management
of resources leading to higher budget revenues and more efficient SOEs and utilities. Key
steps needed to unlock the investment climate reforms were also taken. Combined with
improved government coordination mechanisms and increased confidence of donors, the
GOL in a good position to tackle further reforms.
6. Lessons Learned
82.    The Government and development partners' teams have taken stock of the
lessons learned from implementation of the first programmatic series of operations
in Lao PDR, PRSO1-3. The discussions of lessons learned took place during the dialog
on PRSO1-3, as well as during retreat that took place in Houayxay of Bokeo province



22
(see Box 1), the administrative capital of Bokeo province in the Lao PDR. Some of the
lessons learned are:

       Recognizing the benefits of greater focus. The second PRSO series need to be
             focused in only two or three policy areas, and have less triggers and
             actions. The PRSO1-3 teams perception is that the coverage of the PRSOs
             was too ambitious for a government in a Low Income Country Under
             Stress (LICUS) county, with small public sector, severe capacity
             constraints and low level of inter-agency coordination;

       Identifying and addressing the critical capacity constraints. Take into account
              the small size of the Lao PDR program and opportunity costs of the WB
              team in pursuing an overambitious budget support operation. In addition,
              every action or trigger should be accompanied with TA or other WB
              program in order to achieve outcomes.

       Fostering ownership by aligning with national development objectives. The
              reform areas to which the Government has not fully committed or that do
              not have enough capacity or champions in the Government that are able to
              lead reforms should not be included, while the dialog in these areas should
              continue through other instruments, such as AAAs and capacity building
              activities;

       Shifting the focus to outcomes. The emphasis should be shifted from actions and
              triggers to outcomes and indicators, leading to a more streamlined policy
              matrix of maximum 6 triggers and 12 actions. Relying on outcomes will
              also allow to focus on achieving outcomes through a coherent and well-
              timed program, rather than focus on having an action in each sub-sector
              every year;

       Maintaining flexibility in order to achieve these outcomes. Triggers and
             actions should be worded more flexibly and indicatively, to allow for
             adjustments along the way that would lead to better outcomes rather than
             fulfilling the matrix to the letter. The Government should also get credit
             for reforms that lead to the outcomes, even if these were not initially
             envisioned in the matrix;

       Aligning AAA work with PRSO objectives will help achieve actions and
              triggers and lead to a more meaningful dialog on many issues.

83.     These lessons, combined with the multi-donor PRSO team views, have laid
the basis for criteria to be used for the next series of operations in deciding which
triggers and areas of interventions to include. In PRSO 4-7, triggers do not attempt to
fully cover the whole NSEDP agenda, but help GOL prioritize the reform agenda. They
are flexibly formulated and focus more on a four-year program deliverables rather than
on particular year-by-year actions. They are critical to the achievement of the series


23
outcomes-- namely growth, poverty reduction, and macro stability --and are all
accompanied by TA.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies ­
84.    Lessons learned were discussed by the GOL, the Bank and the participating
donors at a stakeholder workshop in mid 2007. The GOL team took an active part in
discussions and had clear views on the successes and failures of the first PRSO series.
The government's main concerns related to the feasibility and costs of implementing a
broad reform agenda as opposed to concentrating on several priority areas. Specifically:
     Sector coverage was too wide. In countries with small IDA programs, sectoral
       coverage should be limited to reflect government capacity and WB staffing
       constraints. Future operations should focus on priority sectors from PRS/NSEDP,
       and prioritize within sectors based on analytical work (such as the recent PER);
     The number of triggers and actions was too high (42 under PRSO2, reduced to
       38 in PRSO3). Future operations will reduce the number of actions to concentrate
       on the most critical actions with the clearest government ownership. In addition,
       the focus will be deepening current reforms in priority areas rather than trying to
       do too many things in too short a time;
     There needs to be flexibility in formulating actions and triggers. For true
       government ownership, the sequencing and timing of specific policy actions
       should be contingent on steady progress in the broad policy areas central to the
       PRS rather than to strict adherence to particular phraseology.
     Actions and triggers should drive towards the main goals of the PRS/NSEDP
       (growth, poverty reduction, and macroeconomic stability), and should not cover
       the government's core day-to-day business. Instead, the program should help the
       GOL to build country systems needed to improve the market economy; and
     Technical assistance has an enormous impact on the quality and depth of
       reforms. The TA that underpinned the PFM reforms was critical to their success.
       In other areas, the lack of such assistance combined with capacity constraints
       hampered progress. In future, TA should accompany each action along with a
       principle of mutual accountability that encourages the Bank to provide TA and, if
       such support is not provided, to take it into account in evaluating the country's
       performance on the PRSO.

85.      In addition, the GOL also expressed the following views on the PRSC1-3:
         Detailed prior sector dialog is essential for designing programmatic series of
         PRSC operations. The efforts to make the next series of PRSOs fully aligned with
         6th NSEDP have been noticed and are appreciated.
         Capacity of GOL officials working on PRSO, and high level of their rotation
         made it more difficult to implement PRSC1-3, and thus the Bank team needs to
         pay special attention to capacity when discussing triggers and actions, as well as
         to help Government build necessary capacity to implement policy reform.


24
         Technical assistance for PFM has had an enormous impact on the quality and
         depth of reforms, in other areas the lack of assistance has hampered progress. TA
         should be provided for each action by the Bank or donors. Where TA is not
         provided, this should be taken into account when performance is evaluated.
         Coordination between the PRSO Secretariat and the sectoral ministries has
         improved significantly over the course of the implementation.

86.      Bank comments:
The Bank took into account the lessons from PRSO1-3 in terms of the required depth of
the sectoral dialogue in designing the second programmatic series of PRSO4-7. The Bank
further notes that during the course of the implementation, the PRSP process gained more
momentum in the country, resulting in NSEDP6 2006-10 being a good practice PRS (as
acknowledged by the JSAN discussed by the WB Board in June 2008). Current PRSO4-7
preparations are more inclusive and are allowing for greater GOL ownership in the
design; as a result, during supervision missions of PRSO4 and PRSO5, the Government
has acknowledged that the series is fully aligned with the new NSEDP6/PRS.
The Partnership Principles (Box 3 and paragraph 64) have already improved
communication between DPs and the GOL during the second programmatic series. As
lack of capacity impeded PRSC1-3 progress, there is a much stronger emphasis on TA
provision in PRSO4-7, including by encouraging other donors to provide support. The
Bank agrees that inter-ministerial coordination improved markedly over the course of the
series, reflected in increased progress in PRSO3. By the end, all sectors were operating
much more effectively, but further support may be necessary in future. Continued efforts
by the MOF to improve collaboration between ministries are encouraged.

Japan reviewed the ICR, welcomed the ICR process, but did not provide specific
comments.

Annex 3. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

EC's comments to the March 2009 Implementation Completion Report, Vientiane,
18th May 2009

The European Commission (EC) started providing general budget support to the
Government of Lao PDR (GOL) with a EUR 3 million tranche disbursed in 2008,
following the joint assessment of the Third PRSO. Although our focus in the Third PRSO
was on public finance management, private sector development, trade and health, the
decision of the disbursement was based on in our opinion overall satisfactory progress of
the Government in completing the triggers and actions of the operation, beyond the
sectors mentioned. The following comments to the ICR report on the series of three
PRSO concern only the Third PRSO.

The achievements of the Third PRSO are well captured in the ICR, specifically in Box 1
pages 2 and 3. Concrete results achieved during PRSO 3 include the reduction of fiscal
deficit, the revision of the Budget Law, the strengthened oversight of the State-Owned
Enterprises and the adoption of a new Enterprise Law, an important step in continuing the
shift from a planned to a market economy. Those achievements combined with the
Government's commitment to the reforms were very encouraging for us and resulted in a
further four-year commitment to support the implementation of PRSO 4 to 7.

The EC sees performance and results as the core of a budget support operation. Hence,
the progress on the Programme Development Objectives presented in the ICR is of
particular interest to us. We concur with the assessment presented on the basis of the
established indicator system. However, we would like to flag limitations in the
formulation of some of these indicators which must be taken into account for the
interpretation of the current assessment. This is particularly important for the health
sector for which there seem to be persistent difficulties for example regarding the relative
increase of the sector budget or the percentage of birth deliveries attended by trained
personnel: despite nominal progress, both still remain at low levels.

The EC gives special attention to the social sectors in the PRSO. Our budget support is
meant to help GOL efforts towards increasing service delivery in the social sectors. In
line with this approach, the EC has chosen a set of performance indicators for the
disbursement of a variable tranche on top of a fixed tranche, starting from PRSO-5. The
EC hopes that this performance-based approach will be more widely accepted within the
PRSO, by GOL and the other partners, reflecting a shift from processes and outputs to the
results and outcomes of the operation.

The EC agrees with the points raised by GOL especially on ensuring greater alignment of
the PRSO with the NSEDP and limiting the coverage of the PRSO to priority sectors.
Conscious of existing capacity constraints within GOL when undertaking the major
reforms proposed under PRSO, the EC provides complementary technical support. This
is specifically the case for Public Finance Management, Trade, Private Sector, Health and



30
Education. However, the EC has also noted that some specific actions have been brought
on the way by GOL without major external support, e.g. the initial work on the budget
norms, and we take this as a positive sign that GOL has started building up capacities and
setting priorities. In this light, we look forward to continuing our support to this
programme with increased GOL ownership and leadership, and with a clear focus on
results.
