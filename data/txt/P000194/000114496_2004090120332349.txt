Re:
Credit No. 1862 BU (Health and Population Project)
Amendment to the Credit Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") for the 
above-referenced Project between the Republic of Burundi (the "Borrower") and the 
International Development Association (the "Association") dated February 9, 1988.
We are pleased to inform you that the Association agrees with the Borrower's 
request dated April 4, 1989, to increase the amount of Special Account A from $600,000 
to $900,000.
Consequently paragraph 1 (c) of Schedule 4 to the Agreement is amended by 
substituting in line 4 the words "$900,000" with "$600,000".
Please confirm your agreement to this amendment by signing and dating the form 
of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
