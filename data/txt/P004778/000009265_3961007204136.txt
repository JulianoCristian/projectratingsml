MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Thailand
Railway Efficiency Improvement Project (Loan 2872-TH)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Thailand - Railway Efficiency Improvement
Project (Loan 2872-TH), prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. The Borrower did
not contribute Part II.
The main project objective was to achieve immediate improvements in the railway's operations
and finance. Together with follow-up initiatives, the project was expected to make the railway
operationally efficient and financially viable. Project benefits were to become apparent within two
years. Further, the project was to demonstrate the impact of operational improvements on railway
finances and to become the foundation for a major railway reorientation. Project components were
technical assistance, training and procurement of diverse goods.
Implementation lasted more than six years. There was a time over-run of 100%. While most
project items were implemented, actual project costs are not available.
Regarding the railway's financial position, the PCR has nothing positive to report. The PCR
notes increases in traffic and productivity. There is little evidence that such improvements were
attributable to the project. But these are signs that project components such as Technical Assistance
in marketing and Operations Control Systems were timely and also that management's will and
capability exist to reorient the railway towards solvency.
Project outcome is rated as marginally satisfactory on balance. The institutional development
impact is modest. Sustainability is uncertain due to the railway's policy environment and road
competition.
No performance audit is planned.

RAILWAY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2872-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Thailand Railway
Efficiency Improvement Project for which Loan 2872-TH in the amount of US$13.0
million was approved on September 15, 1987. The loan was closed on December 31,
1993, three years behind schedule. The undisbursed balance of US$1,568,070.25 was
caniceled on May 6, 1994, whichi was the date for the last disbursement.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the
East Asia I Department (EAIIN) with the assistance of a consultant.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final supervision
missioni of the project in May 1993, and is based, inter alia, on the Loan and Project
Agreemenits; the Memorandum of the President; supervision reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda. There was no Staff
Appraisal Report prepared since this was a Technical Assistance Project.

RAILWAY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2872-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
The immediate objective of the Project was to assist the State Railway
of Thailand (SRT) in achieving certain improvements in its operations and financial
position. It was reasoned that if it could be shown through such a relatively small project
(in terms of cost) that tangible operational and financial benefits were possible, then the
Government and SRT would be more receptive to a larger project with a longer term
objective. This objective would be to turn SRT into an operationally efficient and
finanlcially viable railway.
Implenientation Experience
Implementation was, with one exception, routine. The Project initially
included a component to develop and implement a passenger "Seat Ticketing and
Reservation System" (STARS), and for tile necessary hardware procurement. The SRT
decided during implementationi, however, to contract the system on a "turn-key" basis.
This decision, and the subsequent pre-qualified bidders received no objection from the
Bank.  However, as a result of representations made to the Bank on behalf of a firm,
the Bank requested that SRT pre-qualify that firm. SRT did not agree to this request,
and the component was removed from Bank financing. These events considerably
delayed the implementation of STARS.
A further decision was made by SRT to use the STARS mainframe
computer as the mainframe for the Bank sponsored Operations Control System (OCS)
development. This meant that contracting specifications for OCS could not be finalized
until the STARS system had been contracted. As a result, OCS development was delayed
significanltly, however, the introduction of both the STARS and OCS systems is expected
to have significant long term benefits to the operational efficiency of the railway.
Since the Bank's long term objective was to improve the operational and
finanicial performance of SRT and to set the stage for a larger project whichi would assist
in making SRT more commercially oriented and financially viable, the Bank agreed to
extend the Project's loan closing date for a third time in order to have the opportunity



- iii -
to work with the Government and SRT in the development of a Long Term Master
Development Plan Study for the railway. This Study attempted to forecast the role of
the railway in the Thai transport system in the next century. While the Bank did not
agree with some aspects of the Study, there was agreement with the conclusion
conceriniig the need for chaniges in the SRT organization and the way in whichi the
railway is regulated. Further analysis is needed to determine the specific changes that
should be made, but the implementation of the agreed upon chaniges would form the
foundationi for any future Bank lending program to SRT.
Stistainability
All of the goods procured should maintaini an acceptable level of net
benefit during their economic lives. Sustainability of the technical assistance and training
componenits will vary. Long term benefits should be realized from the MIS assistance.
Freight marketing techniques learned by SRT should have long-ranginig effect. Withill
the Civil Engineering Department, certain maintenance techniques learned should have
similar effect, but the planniniig systems introduced have questionable long-term impact.
Findings and Lessons Learned
There were a number of findings and lessons whicih resulted from this
Project. These included:
(a)    Althoughi relatively small in cost, this Project was very diverse in nature.
It included technical assistance, traininig and goods procurement whici
involved a great number of SRT  offices. To ensure that these
components were implemented in full concert with one anothier, and with
the Project objectives in mind, was too great a task for periodic visits by
Bank personiel. Furthermore, it may be too muchi to expect that the
Borrower could effectively manage the project along these lines witilout
a prior firm commitment.  As a result, componenits were implemented
to a large degree as separate sub- projects, with relatively little
coordination.   This led to a lack of highi level direction withiln the
components, resulting, in certain instances, in less thani fully effective
implementationi (vis a vis the objectives). Such projects require an active
management organizationi to oversee implementationi. This function
should be assigned to a senior level manager withini the Borrower's
organization, who has the time in his work schedule to do justice to the
assignment. Consideration might also be given to providing techilical
assistance to this manager.
(b)   The Project was designed in concert with a Gesellschaft fur Techliischle
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) project, with the two being complementary and
carried out at the same time. While relations between the Bank and GTZ



- iv -
personnel were good, there may have been better cooperation between
the implementing parties. Consultants working under GTZ financing had
no reason to be cooperative with Bank staff. Although such cooperation
oftentimes did exist, the Bank's and GTZ's projects were, in large
measure, run as separate projects rathier thani as parts of a whole. There
may have been improved success overall if one of the lending agencies
had some degree of responsibility for the whole project, but at the time,
SRT did not want either the Bank or GTZ to have that function and
insisted that it be done by SRT.
(c)    In certain cases, some of the technical assistance consultants on this
project attempted  to introduce techniologies witliout adapting such
technologies fully to meet SRT's conditions and environment. In the
worst case, this can have a negative effect on project objectives,
althoughi in this case the results were not quite as dramatic. Improved
project managemenit as outlined in a) above would have helped this
situation. In addition, techniical assistance and traininig terms of reference
must be prepared in such a way so as to minimize the potential of this
problemr.

Backlgrou nd
1.           SRT has recently celebrated its centeninial anniversary. During most of
its Ihistory, it has served the people of Thailand well while generatinig sufficient profit to
sustain its operations. As with the world experience, SRT experienced virtually a
monopolistic position in the transportation sector in Thailanid during the earlier years. As
a result, the Royal Thai Government highly regulated the operations of SRT. The railway
became an instrument of Government policy.
2.            Again following the world experience, SRT began receiving formidable
competitioni from the highiway sector. Small and efficient trucking and bus operations
began offering service-oriented transportation alternatives, which were financially viable.
It became evermore difficult for SRT to compete withi these companies, largely due to
two problems. Firstly, the Railway was handicapped by the Governmenit regulations in
place, especially related to tariff and wage rate setting. Secondly, SRT remained an
instrumenit of Government policy, with considerable interference from the Government



-2-
in its operations, and without the incentive or experience to operate efficiently from a
financial point of view.
3.             In  1974, SRT  experienced  an operating  loss. Its operating  ratio
(expenses/revenues) rose from 88.6 % in 1973 to 106.1 % in 1974. For the twenty years
henice until today, SRT has been operating in a loss position. Unider legislation, the
Government must make payment each year to SRT in an amount eqjual to its operatiig
loss from the previous year.
4.             Third class passenger service represents more tlhan 70%  of SRT's
business in terms of train kilometers. During the period 1970 to 1990, third class
passenger fares decreased (on a constant Baht basis) by almost 50%  (based on a trip
distance of 500 km.). Similarly, freight tariffs fell almost 50%  (Class 4 freight over a
distance of 500 km.). These tariff rates are largely due to Governmienlt regulation.
5.             During this period (1970-1990), SRT received, and continiues to receive,
contlictinlg directives from tile Governmenlt. On the one hanid, land transport bureaucrats
require services for the public good, at rates perceived as politically acceptable (but at
lower thani cost). On the other hand, the financial bureaucrats insist thlat SRT lower its
operating losses. In the world context, SRT has met the service demanlds quite well. By
most measures, its productivity levels are acceptable.  Efforts at decreasing operatiig
losses have concentrated mostly on staff reductions.  During this twenty year period
numbers of employees fell by about 22%, while over the same period numbers of
passengers transported rose 64% and freight tonnage transported grew by 80%.
6.             SRT continues its attempts at balancing these contlicting signals from
Government today. It was withill this context that the Railway Efficienicy Improvemenit
Project was developed.
Previous Bank Involvemenit
7.             The Bank has been involved with railway developielint in Thailand
through five previous loans. The last project, Railway Project V, closed during 1984
(PCR #6163, April 1986). A planned sixth railway project was shelved at the green cover
stage in 1983, primarily because the Government would not agree to substantial tariff
increases proposed by the Bank. The Bank considered these inicreases necessary to
improve SRT 's financial position.
Proiect Objectives
8.             The immediate objective of the Project was to assist SRT in achievinig
certain inprovements in its operations and financial position. It was reasoned that if it
could be showin through such a relatively small project (in terms of cost) that tangible
operational and financial benefits were possible, theni the Governiiiiet and SRT would



-3-
be more receptive to a larger project with a longer term objective. This objective would
be to turn SRT into an operationally efficient and financially viable railway.
9.            Within the immediate objective of this Project was included the need to
identify those market segments which SRT could effectively and profitably serve, and to
strengthieni SRT's ability to compete with other modes. The Project was aimed at: (a)
realigninig railway services to match changing demand; (b) increasinig marketing and sales
efforts; and (c) reducing costs per traffic unit through cost reduction and efficiency
improvements.
Project Design
10.           Following is a summary list of the major project componienits whicih were
planiied:
(a)    Technical Assistance and Training:
i.    Freight traffic marketing skills;
ii.    General Management Information Systems planining;
iii.   Operations Control System development;
iv.   Invenitory & Materials Managemenlt System development;
v.    Seat Ticketing and Reservations System development; and
vi.    Civil Engileerinig methodology and plannilng.
(b)    Procurement of Goods:
i.    Yards and line radio systems;
ii.    Computer Equipment (associated with Techinical Assistance
packages);
iii.   Passenger coach bogies;
iv.    Track maintenance equipment;
v.    Mobile Wagon Repair Truck; and
vi.    Diesel engines and turbo chargers.



- 4 -
11.            By design, the Project was fragmented according to SRT's immediate
needs. Each component was relatively well defined, with specific goals in mind. The
goods procurement componenits were aimed at meeting immediate operational needs. The
largest of the technical assistance/training packages was in the area of managemenlt
information systems, aimed primarily at the development of systems to improve
operational efficiency. The remainder of the technical assistance/trai niing componenits
were designed to improve specific management skills.
12.            In general the packages were well designed and defined. For the techilical
assistance program, there was a slight deficiency in defining the level of techilology
adaption required to suit the organizational environmenit. Also, in the managemenit
systems area, there was not enoughi effort to define implementatioll organizationi.
GTZ Proiect
13.            The Bank's Project was designed in concert with a technilcal assistance
project carried out under German fundinig. This project provided assistance to SRT in the
following areas:
(a)    Passenger marketing;
i.    Marketing planniniig & policy;
ii.    Mechaniical shop maniagemenit;
iii.    Air brake conversion program; and
iv.    Stores maniagemenit.
14.            The Bank and GTZ projects were not designed with major organizationial
interfaces between the two.  In retrospect, it. would have been beneficial if a new
organizationial unit such as a project office had been defined to ensure close cooperation
between the two projects. Instead, both projects were maniaged and coordination was to
be provided by the Policy and Planning Bureau. This coordination was at times not as
effective as it could have been.
Proiect Implemenitation
Technical Assistance and Training
15.            Freight Traffic Marketing Skills. The consultant worked well with tile
Freight Marketing personnel, and there was a higih degree of techilology transfer.
Significanit gains were realized in the effectiveness of the freight marketing organizationi,
includinig its ability to assess customer needs and to plan for future requirements. A unit



- 5 -
(block) train container operation was created and continues to operate satisfactorily.
Training programs for 100 Traffic and Marketing personnel were carried out with a
perceived higih degree of success.
16.           General Management Information Systems Planning. This componenit
was largely aimed at defining management reporting from the STARS and OCS systems
(below). Implementationi will be done by SRT subsequent to full implementation of these
two systems.
17.           Seat Ticketing and Reservations System  Developmenit.  This system
developmenit was originally designed to provide for computer hardware purchase and
technical assistance in developing the software. SRT subsequently decided, however, to
contract "STARS" on a "turn-key" basis. This was accepted by the Bank, but later there
was disagreement on the firms to be pre-qualified. This conflict resulted in the STARS
package being removed from  Bank financing whicih caused considerable delay in
contractling for STARS.
18.           Subsequently, SRT decided to use the mainframe computer to be supplied
under STARS as the mainframe for the Operations Control System  (OCS) and tile
Inventory and Materials Management System (IMMS), both of whiclh were under Bank
filancing. This lead to considerable additional delay to the contracting of these latter two
systeis, as an agreement with the STARS contractor had to be signed before
specifications for the other two systems could be finalized. The net result was a delay of
over tllree years to the OCS system development.
19.           At thle time of writing this report, the STARS system  hias been
implemilented at all of SRT's stations. There remain some data communications problems,
andcl not all of the batch reports have been implemented.
20.           Operations Control System Development. After the considerable delay
in contracting for this system, the software is now complete and tested, and field
impleimentationi is underway. Several hardware problems are being experienced, but
shoul(d be resolvable by SRT. This system  should lead to considerable operational
efficiency gains, but it is too early to evaluate the results.
21.           Invenitory & Materials Management System Development. Because of
the lengthy delays withini the MIS development area, caused by the STARS delays noted
above, and because of the lack of sufficient SRT resources to support simultaneous
developmenit of STARS, OCS and IMMS, it was decided by SRT to defer IMMS
developienit, and therefore to delete IMMS development from the Bank's project. The
Bankl supported this decision.
22.           Civil Engineering  Methodology  and  Planning.   This  program
concentrated on four major areas: a) track and track maintenance standards; b) track



-6-
maintelalace planning; c) machilnery requirements and usage planinilig; and d) bridge
maintenance planning and procedures. Althiough some useful techniology transfer took
place, the overall benefits of this package are limited. It appears tilat in many cases
techinologies introduced were not adapted well enough to suit the local organizatiolial
env ironniienit.
Procurement of Goods
23.            Railway Line Radio System. It had been originally planined to introduce
a tull train radio system on one or two selected test track sections. The intentioni was to
proviide SRT withi experience on such a system, in order for thern to evaluate the
potential of a full (system-wide) train radio system. During the project period, however,
SRI' decided it wanted full implementationi immediately. The Banlk tully endorsed this
positioln.
24.            At the time of writing, 400 base radios have been installed (mainly at
stations), and 337 mobile radios are being installed on locomotives and diesel rail cars.
Althiough too early to measure, it is anticipated there will be significanit improvemelits
realized in train operating efficiency and safety.
25.            Yard Radio Systems. Base radio stations and hanid-portables have been
installed at Bangkok, Bang Sue and Mae Nam  yards, to improve yard operating
capability. Impleimentationi went well, and no problems were reportedl. SRT reports that
a decrease in accidents at these yards has been noted, and that there is an increase in the
capacity and throughiput times at these yards (quantifiable data not available). There are
no plans, however, to introduce the systein at other (smaller) yards.
26.            Computer Equipment.   This componienlt included  procuremenlt of
terminials and data communlications equipmenit required by the OCS system. There were
significanlt changes from  the original specifications caused by the decision to contract
STARS on a turn-key basis, and by the earlier than anticipated implemlienitationi of the
fiber optics line on SRT's right-of-way. The success of this componienit canilot be
evaluated until the OCS system has been fully operational for a period of time.
27.            Passenger Coach Bogies.  178 passenger coachi bogies hiave been
purchased and installed on older 3rd Class coaches. This has resulted in extended coacil
life, amid has elevated the maximnum speed capability of these coaches from 70 kph to 100
kphi (imax. 120 kph).
28.           Track Mainteniance Equipment. Three ballast regulators and one ballast
tamper have been procured and are in service. These have lead to imnprovements in track
maintenance productivity and quality. Corresponding procurement of track maintenlanice
workshop equipment, planined under the project, was carried out locally by SRT using
thieir owIn funds.



29.            Mobile Wagon Repair Truck.  This vehicle, and its equipment, is
intended to effect more timely repairs of locomotive break-downs in service, or of
accidents. The result is improved operating efficiency and gains in locomotive in- service
times. The truck is operational, but has not yet been licensed for road transport.
30.            Diesel Engines & Turbo Chargers. SRT has purchased and installed 106
new diesel engines for locomotives, of which 18 were financed by the Project. The life
of the corresponding locomotives has been increased accordingly by at least 10 years.
31.            The Bank also financed the purchase of 50 turbo- clharger units, which
have now been installed. This has put back into service several locomotives whiclh had
been awaiting these parts.
Other Project Work
32.            In addition to the planned work, the Bank assisted SRT in other ways
during the project period. Firstly, the services of a railway consultant was provided for
4 monitils to assist in project implementation and to act as an adviser to the General
Manager.   Secondly, the project review  missions assisted SRT in future strategic
planninilg. Thirdly, the Bank lent good support to the Long Range Master Developmenit
Plan Study carried out by the Thailand Development Researcil Institute for SRT. This
latter study was aimed at a partial restructuring of SRT, and at this tine is still under
active review by SRT Executive Management. All of this additional work has proved
valuable in progressing the project's objectives.
33.            Since the objective of this Project was to begin to improve the operational
and ftinanicial performance of SRT and to set the stage for a larger project whichi would
assist in m1akinig SRT more cominercially oriented and finanicially viable, the Bank agreed
to extend the Project's loan closing date for a third time in order to have the opportunity
to work with the Goverinenit and SRT in the development of a long term master plan
for the railway. Both the Govermnenlt and the Bank believed that SRT was important to
the Thai economy, but each wanted to study the issue to determine the specific role that
the railway should play in the Thai transport system in the next century so that future
railway investments would be properly focused.
34.            The Long Term Master Development Plan Study concluded that there
would be a very sharp increase in SRT passenger demand over the next 20 years, and
a lessor but still significant increase in freight demand over the same period. The Study
also concluded that there must be some fundamental chaniges in the SRT organization and
environimiienit if SRT is to benefit from this increased demand. While the Bank does not
completely agree with the conclusions reached concerninlg the increased demand for rail
traffic, we are in complete agreement on the need for changes in the SRT organizatioln
and the way in which the railway is regulated. Further analysis is needed to determine



the specific changes that should be made, but the implementation of the agreed upon
chianges would form the foundation for any future Bank lending program to SRT.
Project Results
35.            Both passenger and freight traffic continues to grow on SRT in terms of
passenger-km and ton-km in the range of 2% and 5 % respectively. Staff productivity in
terms of traffic units per employee has also grown at an annual rate of about 5 %. Thlese
improvements are due in part to the Project. The first component of the immediate
objective (improvement in operations) has been met. There as yet is no significant
improvement in SRT's financial position, although in time sucIl items as operational
efficiency improvements due to the OCS system should assist this position. It is not
possible at this time, however, to confirm that the second componenit of the immediate
objective (improvement in finanlcial position) has been met, but this is largely the result
of the Government not being willinig to provide the management of SRT with significant
control over either the operating revenue (tariff setting) or operating costs..
36.           It is likewise too early to determine if the long-range objective of turnilig
SRT' into an operationally efficient and financially viable railway can be met. It is
discouraging to note, however, that the momentum towards financial reform has all but
ended. Whereas the Thai Cabinet previously agreed on a policy of having the
Govermnent compensate SRT for the cost to provide the non-commilercial services that
the Government requests (through a mechanism called Public Service Obligations (PSOs))
for this policy has not been implemented. There does not appear to be any significaiit
effort at this time to implemenit a PSO for SRT.
Proiect Sustainability
37.            All of the goods procured should mainitain an acceptable level of net
benefit during their economic lives. Sustainability of the technical assistance and traininig
componienits will vary. Long term benefits should-be realized from the MIS assistance.
Freight marketing techniques learned by SRT should have long-raniginlg effect. Within
the Civil Engineering Department, certain maintenance techniques learned should have
similar effect, but the planning systems introduced have questionable long-term impact.
Banlk Performance
38.           The Project was well-conceived, and the Bank's personinel performed
well during implementation. This was a difficult Project to supervise, however, due to
the nuinber of technically unrelated components. There was perhaps not enough time
spent on supervising the individual components, and as such some components were
designed and implemented without due regard to the Project's objectives. An example
is the Freight Marketing technical assistance, where the consultant worked closely with
SRT in setting up a unit (block) train operation for containers. Operationally this has



- 9 -
proven very successful, with the customer's needs being met to a high degree of
reliability. There is good cause to question, however, if SRT is recovering costs from
this operation.
Borrower Performance
39.           The Borrower performed well throughout the life of the Project. SRT
persoinel were very cooperative with Bank personiel, and SRT staff assignment for
implementation was adequate. Because of the fragmented project, however, and the large
number of SRT departments involved, the Borrower might have been more diligent in
overall maniagement of the Project.
Project Relationship
40.           As noted above, relations between the Borrower and the Bank were good
throughiout the Project. The Bank personnel reacted well to SRT's needs, and SRT
personilel were always cooperative with supervision missions.
41.           The Project was designed in concert with a GTZ project, with the two
being complemenitary and carried out at the same time. While relations between the Bank
and GTZ personnel were good, there may have been better cooperation between the
implemilenltinig parties. Consultants working under GTZ financing had no reason to be
cooperative with Bank staff. Although such cooperation oftentimes did exist, the Bank's
and GTZ's projects were in large measure run as separate activities, rather than as parts
of a whole. There may have been improved success overall if one of the lending agencies
had some degree of responsibility for the whole project, but at the time, SRT did not
want either the Bank or GTZ to have that function and insisted that it be done by SRT.
Consultinig Services
42.           Generally, the consultants involved in the Project performed well. in
some cases, however, there was not enoughi effort made by the consultant to adapt his
techniology to suit SRT conditions. This was especially true in the MIS and Civil
Enginieerinlg componenits. In the Freight Marketing component, there was some deviation
from the defined terms of reference, which required contract extensionls to rectify.
