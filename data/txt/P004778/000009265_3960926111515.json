The core activity involves a\n            major technical assistance and training program\n            concentrating on reducing the operating cost per traffic\n            unit through more efficient operations and increasing\n            revenue.  The benefits of this project should become\n            apparent in about two years, and will become the foundation\n            for a major reorientation of the State Railway of\n            Thailand's (SRT) operating and maintenance procedures.\n            To that end, the project involves a major component of (a)\n            technical assistance for a management information system,\n            freight and passenger marketing, equipment rationalization\n            and procedures to improve the planning and operations of the\n            mechanical and civil engineering departments.  In addition,\n            the project provides (b) training of railway staff in the\n            areas of the technical assistance already mentioned as well\n            as (c) acquisition of computer hardware and software.\n            Economic benefits under the project are expected from:  (a)\n            improved efficiencies in railway operations; and (b)\n            reduction in SRT's losses, initiating the process of\n            making SRT into a viable state enterprise."}, "docdt": "1987-08-20T00:00:00Z"}
