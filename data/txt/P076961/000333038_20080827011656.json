outcomes were moderately satisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory; and the Borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The first\n            lesson is that a clustering approach emphasizing\n            collaboration among members of a grouping to achieve\n            objectives that are beyond the capabilities of individual\n            farmers or exporters is a requirement in horticulture.\n            Delivery of services for promotion - research and extension\n            - remains an important role for the public sector. However,\n            to keep up with the continual changes in the horticultural\n            market, the public sector cannot afford to stay behind in\n            terms of service quality. Experience in the project suggests\n            also that improving marketing and production requires a good\n            mix of both soft and hard assets. Performance evaluation has\n            proved to be a challenging task for the project. There is a\n            need for a more systematic approach in assessing performance\n            if Export Promotion and Development (EPD) activities are to\n            have a substantial impact on Jordan's horticulture competitiveness."}, "docdt": "2008-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
