development objective of the\n            Horticultural Exports Promotion and Technology Transfer for\n            Jordan is to improve horticultural export marketing by pilot\n            testing: a) a system of outgrower farming between large and\n            small/medium scale farmers (henceforth called outgrowers;\n            and b) the building of the technological capacity of\n            farmers, especially the outgrowers. There are four project\n            components. The first component finances the creation of a\n            specialized department in the Jordan Export Development and\n            Commercial Centers Corporation (JEDCO) focusing solely on\n            the promotion of horticultural exports. It also provides\n            limited support to the Agricultural Marketing Department\n            (AMD) in its role on collecting and relaying market prices\n            to farmers, collecting statistics on production and export\n            volumes, lobbying for export-friendly policies, and\n            regulatory functions. The second component finances adaptive\n            technology development and transfer, capacity buildigng for\n            small and medium scale farmers, and technology transfer\n            specialists. The third component supports quality testing\n            and certification of export produce. The fourth component\n            funds the project coordination unit."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
