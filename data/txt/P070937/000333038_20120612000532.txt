Objectives. As of March 31, 2012, 168 Full Time Schools have been created through the
Project, and a total of 45,199 student places have been added (96 percent of the target).

2,506 teachers (31.8 percent above the target).

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to finance: (i) existing and newly created
additional in-service teacher training courses, which require (a) additional expenditures
such as the per-diem and travel cost of the trainees, rental of facilities, seminar or
workshop materials, and administrative support, and (b) the contracting of more teacher
trainers than estimated at the beginning of the Project; and (ii) additional technical
advisers hired to work in the preparation and supervision of works at Full-Time Schools.
