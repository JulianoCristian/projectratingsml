                         Implementation Status Overview
                         On October 20, 2009 the Board of Directors approved an Additional Financing (AF) in the amount of US$ 29.9 million for the Project and the extension of its closing date until
                         December 31, 2012. The purpose of this AF was to address the financing gap arising from the increase in project costs associated with a change in the Government of Uruguay's
                         strategy on civil works for Full Time Schools and the significant escalation of construction costs in Uruguay. In terms of implementation, the project is progressing well towards
                         achieving its Project Development Objectives. As of October 2010, 135 Full Time Schools (FTS) have been created through the Project. Since the project started, a total of 37,230
                         student places have been added in FTS (79 percent of project target). Student enrollment, as of May 2010 was 32,804 students. While continuing in-service training for teachers in
                         FTS, the Project supported during 2010 in-service training activities for 1,898 teachers who work in regular schools in the country.
