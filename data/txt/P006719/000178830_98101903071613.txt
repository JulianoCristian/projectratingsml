INTERM\ATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO COLOMBIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FOR THE FIFTH RAILROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$18.3 million to
the Colombian National Railways (CNR).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The loan would be the fifth Bank loan to the CNR. Three of the
four previous loans financed the building and equipping of the Atlantic
line which has given Colombia access by rail to the Atlantic Ocean.
These loans were made in 1952, 1955 and 1960, respectively, and totalled
US$46.3 million equivalent. The fourth loan of US$30 million equivalent,
made in 1963, was devoted to rehabilitating the other lines and operating
facilities of CNR and increasing the carrying capacity of the whole system.
3.        The loan now proposed would continue the process of rehabili-
tating, modernizing and increasing the capacity of the CNR, which in turn
will lead to a progressive increase in earnings and move the CNR closer
to achieving financial viability.
b.        Apart from the Bank's lending to the CNR, the Bank/IDA have also
been active in financing highway development in Colombia, having provided
loans totalling US$86.35 million equivalent between 1951 and 1961. A
project for a further loan of US$17.2 million equivalent is being presented
together with the proposed loan to the CNR.
5.        The project was appraised in December 1967.   Negotiations on
the proposed loan took place in Washington June 10-14, 1968. The CNR was
represented by Dr. Javier Ramirez, General Manager, and Dr. Jose Arturo
Garcia, Financial Manager. The Government was represented by Dr. Bernardo
Garces, Minister of Public Works and ex-officio Chairman of the CNR.
6.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits to Colombia as of June 30, 1968:

2/ Excludes US$i44.5 million for Loans  534 C0, 536 Co and 537 CO, which
have been signed but have not yet become effective.
7.        Twenty-three loans have been completely disbursed and four have
been repaid in full. On the remainder, disbursements are proceeding
normally except on Loan 345 CO (Acerias Paz del Rio, S.A.). The
Executive Directors recently approved an extension of the Closing Date
on this loan by one year to October 31, 1969 to allow for further dis-
bursements, mainly of,contract retentions.

8.        Together with this report I am submitting to the Executive
Directors a proposed loan of US$17.2 million to the Republic of Colombia
for the Fifth Highway Project.  These two loans, if made, would raise the
Bank's total lending to Colombia to US$535.5 million. In the near future
I expect to present to the Executive Directors a loan of about US$7.6 million
to the Government for Secondary Education and a loan of about US$16.0 million
for Power Interconnection.
9.        IFC has made 21 investments and underwriting commitments in 13
enterprises in Colombia totalling US$lb.7 million.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
10.       The main features of the proposed loan are as follows:
Borrower:           Colombian National Railways (CNR).
Guarantor:          Republic of Colombia.
Amount:             The equivalent in various currencies of
US$18.3 million.
Purpose:            To continue the process of rehabilitation,
modernization and expansion of the CNR's
facilities in accordance with its Investment
Program for 1968/72. The loan would finance
the procurement of rails and accessories,
ballast cars and maintenance equipment,
machinery and tools to equip workshops,
components to modernize rolling stock and
consulting services to assistmainly in track,
workshop and operating areas where CNR is
still lacking in experience.
Amortization:       Loan would be for a term of 20 years, includ-
ing a 3-year grace period ending in 1971.
Repayment would be in thirty-four semi-annual
installments from October 1, 1971 to April 1,
1988.
Interest rate:      6-1/b percent.
Commitment charge: 3/A percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Fifth Railroad
Project" (TO-652a) on the Project is attached.



- b -
12.       The CNR is an autonomous Government entity established in
December 1954 to link the independent railway lines, built largely to
serve river traffic, into a single network with access to the Pacific
Ocean through the Port of Buenaventura. In 1961 a major extension was
completed with Bank assistance to provide the first through-railway con-
nection to the Atlantic at Santa Marta. Substantial traffic by road and
water from the Atlantic ports of Barranquilla and Cartagena is also trans-
ferred to the new line at points along its route.
13.       The Project represents the first three years of CNR's Five-Year
Investment Program, 1968-72, which in turn has grown out of a Ten-Year Re-
habilitation Program, covering 1963-72. The first Five-Year Program, 1963-
67, fell behind because of inadequacies in financing and execution which
the Government and the CNR have taken steps to correct. The current Pro-
gram will continue the rehabilitation process. Total expenditures under
the Five-Year Program as agreed by the Bank and CNR are Ps 1.3 billion
(US$81.0 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$45.2
million equivalent. On the basis of the economic analysis, the total bene-
fits accruing directly to the CNR would provide a return of 15 percent on
the investment required for the Program.
14.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at Ps 1.0 billion
(US$61.9 million equiivalent) with a foreign exchange coniponent of US$38.7
million equivalent. The loan would cover 07 percent of the foreign exchange
component, with the balance being covered under long-term supplier credits
which have already been obtained. These credits cover the procurement of
60 diesel locomotives from Spain (US$9.6 million) and 1,200 freight *cars
from Mexico (US$9.8 million); there is. also a contingency allowance of
US$1 million. Association of the Bank loan with these funds from other
sources will allow the execution of a larger project with a correspondingly
greater impact. The local currency component will be covered out of the
Government's budgetary allocations to the CNR.
15.       The principal items to be financed by the proposed loan are
410 kms of track, 110 ballast cars and track maintenance equipment, work-
shop equipment and tools, parts for passenger cars, rail cars and freight
cars, freight handling equipment, telecommunications equipment, signalling
and other railway material, and consulting services. All contracts pro-
posed for Bank financing will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. The bulk of the orders are expected to be placed in
the United States, Western Europe and Japan.
16.       The proposed loan includes US$6.6 million for the procurement of
track (rails and accessories). The Government and CNR have been negotiating
with various countries to purchase these items in exchange for surplus
coffee. If satisfactory arrangements for the procureriient of these rails
and accessories from alternative sources are concluded, the Bank would can-
cel the amount then remaining .n th-; catevory unless at that time it
received acceptable proposals for en loymei)t of these funds elsewhere
in CNR's investment program.



17.       The CNR in the past several years has not been able to generate
the internal resources necessary to finance its investment program and to
service outstanding debt. While some tariff increases have been put into
effect to cope with increasing operating costs, dependence on Government
contributions has not lessened significantly. In view of the high backlog
of rehabilitation needs, this dependence is expected to continue but to be
reduced during the Project period.
18.       The CNR and the Government would agree to take all steps re-
quired to cover its costs out of its revenues and to generate sufficient
funds to meet its debt service requirements and to finance in due course
some of its investment requirements,and to that end gradually to increase
the return on its net fixed assets in use to 6 percent per annum by 1976.
Assets would be revalued periodically to reflect changes in their current
values.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Colombian
National Railways, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Colombia and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section b(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
20.       These draft Agreements contain the covenants normally included
in railroad projects. The Bank would be entitled to cancel the portion of
the loan allocated to and not required for the purchase of track (Sec-
tion 2.03 of the Loan Agreement). The agreement on building up CNR's
earnings,as summarized in paragraph 19 above, is set forth in Section 5.07
of the Loan Agreement.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
21.       The judgments provided in the section on the Colombian economy
in the recent President's Report on the Development Finance Companies
Project (P-592, May 2, 1968) continue to be valid.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:



-6-
RESOLUTION NO.
Approval of Loan to the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia
in the amount of the equivalent of US$18.3 million to be
guaranteed by the Republic of Colombia
RESOLVED:
THAT the Bank shall grant a loan to the Ferrocarriles Nacionales
de Colombia to be guaranteed by the Republic of Colombia, in an amount in
various currencies equivalent to eighteen million three hundred thousand
United States dollars (US$18,300,000), to mature on and prior to April 1,
1988, to bear interest at the rate of six and one-quarter percent (6-1/4%)
per annum, and to be upon such other terms and conditions as shall be
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
form of Loan Agreement (Fifth Railroad Project) between the Bank and
Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia, and the form of Guarantee Agreement
(Fifth Railroad Project) between the Republic of Colombia and the Bank,
which have been presented to this meeting.
