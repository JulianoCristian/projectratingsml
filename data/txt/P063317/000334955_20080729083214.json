Colombia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: balancing participatory\n            approaches and the need for focused objectives - the open\n            participatory approach adopted for project preparation\n            ensured support for its subsequent execution but also\n            pressed for ample objectives to encompass wide ranging\n            interests. As seen earlier, focusing objectives is crucial\n            to increase effectiveness and sustainability of project\n            outcomes but implies ruling topics out. Balancing the two\n            requires building stakeholder understanding of the issue, so\n            as to adequately channel expectations into focused\n            agreements. Seeking to adapt a national biodiversity policy\n            framework to a six year project geographically too ambitious\n            undermines achievement of outcomes. Co-coordinated donor\n            investments and actions, in particular under a programmatic\n            approach, should be actively sought to help strengthen the\n            impact of single interventions. Results-framework and\n            M&E schemes critically affect output-outcome and\n            component linkages few and synthetic indicators focusing on\n            how outputs lead up to desired outcomes help overcome\n            segmented approaches to project implementation. As a first\n            generation GEF project seeking to promote public and private\n            conservation and sustainable use efforts in the Colombian\n            Andes, including mainstreaming biodiversity considerations\n            in sectoral practices and policies, the design of a useful\n            M&E framework proved to be a challenge that was not surmounted."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
