Based on lessons learned, that scientific technical\n            assistance needs to be based on the recognition, and respect\n            of autonomous indigenous decisions, particularly as it\n            concerns their traditional methods to conserve, and manage\n            biodiversity, the need to ensure adequate, and transparent\n            mechanisms for conflict resolution, is imminent. Mitigation\n            plans suggest: 1) the development of a continuous process of\n            information, training, and evaluation with the indigenous\n            groups, farmers, and conservation/scientific groups, to\n            protect territorial integrity, and initiate environmental\n            education with the agricultural communities; 2) provision of\n            training programs to communities, to raise awareness of the\n            biological value within their territories, and of associated\n            social pressures. Norms for the use of resources shall be\n            discussed, and prepared between communities, and local\n            authorities alike; 3) in coordination with indigenous\n            experts, and scientists, identify the botanical species\n            traditionally used for medicinal purposes, to ascertain\n            universal medical uses, build logistical support, and\n            process information; and, 4) development of knowledge\n            exchange programs, as well as promotion of native\n            traditional production systems, such as home gardens, to\n            build medicinal centers of traditional knowledge to assist\n            patients, and, promote marketing of medicinal plants."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T10:42:00Z"}
