F. Results Framework Analysis

Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The project development objective is to increase conservation, knowledge and sustainable
use of globally important biodiversity of the Colombian Andes. Specifically, the project
will:




                                          - ii -

1. Support the development of a more representative, effective, and viable Andean
    protected area system;
2. Identify conservation opportunities in rural landscapes, develop and promote
    management tools for biodiversity conservation;
3. Expand, organize, and disseminate the knowledge base on biodiversity in the Andes to
    a wide audience of stakeholders and policy makers, and implement monitoring tools;
    and,
4. Promote inter-sectoral coordination to address some root causes of biodiversity loss in
    the Andes.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
The project's original logical framework focused mainly on activities and outputs, with 40
product indicators (see Annex 2). To more comprehensively measure achievement of
objectives, Bank efforts at midterm review refocused M&E design on measuring GEO
progress resulting in the following adjustments: i) concentrating biannual supervision on 15
intermediate outcome indicators deemed most representative of increased biodiversity
knowledge, conservation and sustainable use, and ii) developing 6 new outcome indicators
to capture aggregated improvements in biodiversity knowledge, conservation and use
practices, using the 40 product indicators as input (see sections 1.3, 2.3 and Annex 2 for
details).

The following table includes the 15 intermediate outcome indicators reported as of 2005 in
project Implementation Status Reports:

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
a. Country and sector background ­ At the time of appraisal, Colombia was already recognized as a
megadiverse nation with one of the highest concentration of species per surface area (Mittermeier 1998) and the
Andes identified as the richest biogeographical region in the country given its number of distinct ecosystem types,
each of which is remarkably diverse due to great fluctuations in altitude, climate and geology. The high
conservation priority assigned to the Colombian Andes was based on its biological richness1 and on the existing
pressures on its biological integrity. Threats included the impact of human interventions2 , ranging from
agricultural activities to illicit cropping and the associated degradation and loss of natural habitats and soil erosion.
Regional planning did not internalize biodiversity concerns and only 7% of the Andes was under some sort of
protection regime, declared as a category of protected area. A preliminary review of incentives for biodiversity
conservation indicated that there was a comprehensive set of instruments on the books but their application had
been inconsistent. Full documentation of Colombia's biodiversity was lacking, with inventories and field surveys
still required to overcome the pervasive deficit of good knowledge and support its dissemination and use by
decision-makers.

b. Institutional and policy framework ­ The institutional framework for biodiversity in Colombia created
through the country's 1991 Constitution and Law 99/93 included: i) the Ministry of Environment (MMA); ii) 33
Regional Autonomous Corporations (CARs) responsible for regional environmental management, 18 of which in
the Andean region; iii) the National Parks Administrative Unit (UAESPNN) created within the Ministry to
develop and manage Colombia's protected areas; and iv) 4 related research institutes to support scientific,
technical decision and policy-making processes, including the Alexander von Humboldt Research Institute on
Biological Resources (IAvH). This decentralized system for environmental management was conceived to include
local and regional authorities, private and public universities, NGOs and others. By 1999 UAESPNN had
supported the establishment of the National Protected Areas System, comprising different categories of protected
areas, from regional to local and from public and private to collectively owned, while seeking to improve their
conservation effectiveness by involving local communities and a diversity of methods such as collaborative
management, as part of its policy on Social participation for conservation in place at appraisal. In this regard,
indigenous groups were constitutionally recognized as key players in the management of biodiversity areas.

The National Biodiversity Policy (MMA, 1997) was developed within the context of the Biodiversity Convention
ratified by Colombia through Law 165/94. At the request of MMA, the IAvH led the formulation process of the
Policy's associated instruments comprising the National Biodiversity Report, Strategy and Action Plan (1998),
which prioritized three lines of action: conservation, equitable and sustainable use, and improved knowledge. The
National Biodiversity Report identified the Andean region as the leading regional priority in terms of biodiversity
use. Subsequently, MMA established biodiversity conservation in the Andean region as a top environmental
priority for the National Development Plan (NDP) 1999-2002 that included a Strategic Plan for Environment
(`Proyecto Colectivo Ambiental') with three main objectives: i) conservation and restoration of priority areas
within strategic ecoregions; ii) promotion of environmental sustainability of economic sectors; and iii) promotion
of sustainable regional and urban development. Moreover, in August 1999, the MMA published its National
Strategy for the Conservation of the Andes, which sought to ensure strategic GEF intervention in the region to
avoid irreversible loss of globally significant biodiversity. Four GEF proposals were designed to address
immediate priorities, including the project in question as a national `umbrella' project3, conceived to launch in the



1Of the five biogeographical regions in the country (the Amazon, the Caribbean, the Pacific, the Orinoquia and the Andean regions), the
Andes has the highest number of species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians.
2About 70% of Colombia's population was estimated to live in this region at the time of appraisal, which had resulted in the transformation
of about two thirds of the region's natural habitats.
3The umbrella project was to be complemented by three regionally-based interventions: in the Colombian Massif, the Sierra Nevada de
Santa Marta and the Serranía de la Macarena, to implement regional systems of protected areas.


                                                                    1

Andes the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan referred to above4, whose formulation the IAvH had
led. Consequently, given the policy-making nature of the MMA and IAvH's expertise and administrative
autonomy5, the Minister of Environment delegated full responsibility for the project in the IAvH in September
2000.

c. Rationale for Bank assistance ­ The rationale for Bank assistance was stated in the 1997 CAS (Document
number: 17107-CO). The CAS identified protection and conservation of the environment as one of the major
themes of assistance, noting that the country was listed as one of the worldwide priority areas for conservation of
flora and fauna. According to the CAS, "inadequate management of natural resources has led to a growing
deterioration as seen by the loss of biodiversity, deforestation...endangered strategic ecosystems, soil degradation,
highly polluted rivers, canals and wetlands". The project contributed to the CAS's strategic focus on sustainable
development/protection and conservation of strategic ecosystems; improving the effectiveness of the recently
introduced decentralized system for environmental management; and promoting employment opportunities for the
poor through environmentally sustainable projects.

d. Consistency with GEF policies ­ The project was set to support the following key elements of the GEF 1998-
2002 Operational Strategy in place at the time of appraisal: Andean Region use of biodiversity, increased
awareness, policy reform, capacity building, sectoral integration, and financial sustainability. Specifically, it
supported biodiversity conservation and sustainable use in forest and mountain ecosystems (ecosystems under
Operational Programs 3 and 4 respectively) as well as the cross-sectoral area of land degradation. The project also
sought to address issues of agrobiodiversity that were endorsed as a GEF Priority by the III Conference of the
Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Buenos Aires (1996).

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project development objective was to increase conservation, knowledge and sustainable use of globally
important biodiversity of the Colombian Andes6. Specifically, the project would:
     1. Support the development of a more representative, effective, and viable Andean protected area
          system
     2. Identify conservation opportunities in rural landscapes, develop and promote management tools for
          biodiversity conservation
     3. Expand, organize, and disseminate the knowledge base on biodiversity in the Andes to a wide
          audience of stakeholders and policy makers, and implement monitoring tools, and
     4. Promote inter-sectoral coordination to address some root causes of biodiversity loss in the Andes

Key indicators included the following:
     a. 6 regional active networks of protected areas established in project conservation zones
     b. Participatory management plans for 50% of existing national protected areas within the project
          conservation zones prepared and implemented
     c. 50% of remaining ecosystem types per ecoregions represented in protected areas




4These instruments included long (25 years), mid (10 years) and short (4 years) term actions to implement the National Biodiversity
Policy, agreed upon through a participatory process involving environmental and social NGOs, indigenous and afrocolombian
communities, CARs, research institutes, the National Planning Department, the MMA and other ministries such as Agriculture,
Mining and Energy, and Foreign Trade.
5The IAvH is a non-profit, private civil corporation, attached to the Ministry of Environment, with administrative autonomy, legal
personality and its own net worth, whose mission is to promote, coordinate and carry out research that contributes to biodiversity use.
Pursuant to corporate by-laws, its duties include "obtaining, storing, analyzing, processing, providing and disseminating basic
information on biodiversity, ecosystems, resources and processes to manage and exploit the Nation's renewable natural resources",
among others.
6For the purposes of the project, the Colombian Andes were defined as the areas encompassing over 500 m in the Eastern, Central
and Western mountain ranges, excluding a small number of other high altitude areas such as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta or the
Sierra de Macarena, already targeted by specific GEF projects as mentioned above.


                                                                 2

    k. Inclusion of biodiversity considerations in the MoE, environmental licensing, TORs and on
         guidelines of infrastructure, mining, energy and agricultural projects

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The PDO/GEO was not revised. The original project's logical framework included 40 key performance
indicators focusing mainly on activities and outputs. At MTR and as shown below, thirteen of these 40
indicators were adjusted and the remaining twenty three7 indicators left unchanged. In addition, six new
outcome indicators were developed to focus M&E on project results (see Sections 1.7, 2.3, 3.2 and Annex 2):

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The intended main beneficiaries were government agencies responsible for managing Colombia's natural
resources and their non-governmental partners (peasant and sector organizations, network of private reserves,
environmental and social NGOs working locally, regional universities) through new management tools. Rural
and indigenous populations in prioritized conservation zones would also directly benefit through project support
for more sustainable use of biological resources. In addition, the project's investment in the creation and
dissemination of knowledge would be of value to decision-makers and the scientific community both globally
and nationally.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Project Conservation Zones and Protected Areas (US$12.53 million, 41.8% of estimated
total project cost; GEF US$ 3.22 million corresponding to 37.1% of GEF grant)
This component would promote the consolidation of Colombia's National Protected Areas System within the
Andean region (comprising National Natural Parks and protected areas of regional and local character,
including private reserves), by testing some of its elements in key areas. Activities would be supported at two
levels: the protected areas level (areas officially declared under a protection category) and the conservation
zone level (extended geographic regions containing PAs). Existing protected areas would be strengthened
through the participatory design and implementation of their management plans. New protected areas would
be established as needed and their management plans designed and implemented in a participatory manner.
To enhance protected area management and biodiversity conservation in the Andean region, the landscape
surrounding selected protected areas would be addressed through the participatory design and
implementation of conservation zone plans. 11 Conservation zones encompassing a representative sample of
the Andean ecosystems and biodiversity were identified, of which 5 were selected for Phase 1
implementation spanning over the project's first three years11. Activities would expand to the remaining 6



8Active conservation processes referred to 3 criteria: management plans implemented; interinstitutional coordination and social
participation.
9This included products covered by agreements entered into by the IAvH and its partners.
10Information management referred to i) entities linked to the Biodiversity Information System (through data provision and
management).
11First phase conservation zones meant the following geographic areas in the Andean Region: (i) Northeastern páramos and moist
forests; (ii) Alto Putumayo; (iii) Dagua-Calima-Paraguas corridor; (iv) Altiplano Cundiboyacense; and (v) Los Nevados Park and


                                                               4

conservation zones during Phase 2 (the last three years)12, subject to the achievement of targets set for the
end of Phase 1 related to the completion of 15 outputs (i.e. establishment of 22 new protected areas,
fulfillment of 4 rural landscape surveys, 4 biodiversity assessments, among others).

Component 2: Andean Region Use of Biodiversity in Rural Landscapes (US$8.47 million, 28.2% of
estimated total project cost: GEF US$ 4.3 million, 28.7% of GEF grant)
This component would lay the groundwork to promote long-term biodiversity conservation in transformed
landscapes still providing habitats and/or corridors for biodiversity. In the same conservation zones targeted under
Component 1, the project would specifically support: assessments of conservation opportunities in transformed
landscapes; development of management tools for biodiversity conservation in rural landscapes (biological
corridors, enrichment of grassland, complex production systems such as shade coffee and live fencerows);
dissemination of management tools developed during project; development of a system of institutional and
economic incentives, including the design of a funding mechanism to promote markets for biodiversity goods and
services.

Component 3: Knowledge Base for Decision Making, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$5.6 million, 18.7%
of estimated total project cost; GEF $3.1 million corresponding to 20.7% of GEF grant)
 This component would support and expand existing efforts to improve knowledge and monitoring on the
 different aspects of the region's biodiversity, its species, ecosystem fragility and protection needs, as well as to
 address the lack of sufficient knowledge and deficient scientific information on Andean biodiversity to set
 conservation priorities and make decisions at the national and regional scale. Subcomponents included:
 biodiversity assessments; building a decentralized biodiversity information system; implementing a
 dissemination and public awareness program; and implementing an indicator system of biodiversity state-
 pressure-response.

Component 4: Intersectoral Coordination (US$ 0.86 million, 2.9% of estimated total project cost; GEF
US$0.5 million corresponding to 3.3% of GEF grant)
Under this component, studies and training would be provided to relevant government agencies and the private
sector to promote the inclusion of biodiversity goals in sector development plans for the Andes. This would be
accomplished through coordination with Colombian Ministries, sector associations and economic conglomerates,
and monitoring biodiversity trends in large-scale development projects.

Component 5: Project Management and Monitoring (US$ 2.54 million, 8.5% of estimated total project
cost; GEF US$1.54 millions corresponding to 10.3% of GEF grant)
This component would finance project administration and coordination (staff, office costs, travel and other
administrative expenses, as well as annual audits), and a system to monitor project implementation.

1.6 Revised Components
Project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes




neighboring coffee-growing area, or any other conservation zone in the Andean Region that could, with the agreement of the Bank,
replace those listed above. First phase protected areas within these zones meant the following National Natural Parks: (i) Cocuy;
(ii) Tamá; (iii) Pisba; (iv) Los Nevados; (v) Otún-Quimbaya; and (vi) Isla de la Corota, or any other protected area in the Andean
Region that could, with the agreement of the Bank, replace the protected areas listed above.
12 Second phase conservation zones meant any of the following geographic areas in the Andean Region: (i) Cuchilla de los
Cobardes and Chicamocha canyon; (ii) Rusia Páramo and the Quercus forest of Santander; (iii) Patía Valley and neighboring western
Andes mountain range; (iv) Carare-Opón; (v) Tatacoa desert; and (vi) Dry forests of the Cauca canyon in Antioquia or any other
conservation zone in the Andean Region that could, with the agreement of the Bank, replace those listed above. Second phase
protected areas meant any existing protected area in a second phase conservation zone, or any new protected area which would be
established pursuant to component 1 of the project.


                                                                 5

a. Project Adjustment ­ The midterm review recommended to focus project activities and investments
taking into account i) the execution lags under component 1, ii) the nature of the IAvH as a centralized
research institute, and iii) the need to strengthen results dissemination/knowledge transfer and focus M&E on
achievement of outcomes (see Section 2). Consequently the project experienced the following adjustments:
  i. Consolidation of activities in First phase conservation zones ­ in line with project design, whereby
       midterm review would assess if the expansion of activities to the remaining 6 conservation zones was
       warranted for (based on the achievement of pre-determined benchmarks), activities for Phase 2 were
       confined to first phase conservation zones. Targets for the establishment of protected areas and regional
       protected area networks under component 1 had not been achieved due to administrative inefficiencies
       (see Section 2.2e); thus, activities continued in first phase conservation zones, considered successful but
       requiring additional time to provide full benefits. La Isla de la Corota was replaced as a first phase
       protected area by the Iguaque Flora and Fauna Sanctuary as approved by project team.
 ii. Scope of activities ­ IAvH's ability to help implement the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
       Plan was limited considering its centralized and research-oriented nature (see Sections 1.1 and 2.1-2.2).
       Therefore the scope of certain activities under project components was adjusted, as reflected in the
       project indicators described in Section 1.3:
         -   Components 1 and 2 ­ regarding the development of a system of institutional and economic incentives
             (Component 2), IAvH's role in providing technical input to the creation of such system was
             emphasized, instead of implementing the system itself. This was also the case for the establishment of
             new protected areas (Component 1), where IAvH's technical input rather than PA declaration was
             underlined.
         -   Components 3 and 4 ­ the scope of efforts to monitor the application of the national biodiversity
             policy (Component 3) and to monitor biodiversity trends in large-scale development projects
             (Component 4) was also narrowed. The latter was adjusted to design an early warning system to
             identify possible threats from sectoral development projects, to be presented as an independent project
             to other financing sources. Both activities were considered to exceed the possibilities of a single
             project and therefore their financing and implementation should be shared with other ongoing
             and/or future initiatives.
iii. M&E adjustments ­ these changes in geographic coverage and scope of activities, together with MTR
       recommendations to strengthen knowledge transfer through education-communication strategies and
       steer M&E away from outputs, resulted in adjustments to key performance indicators as described in
       Section 1.3. In addition, as mentioned in Section F, biannual supervision after MTR focused on 15 of the
       40 key performance indicators as adjusted, deemed most representative of increased biodiversity
       knowledge, conservation and sustainable use (reported as of 2005 in the Implementation Status Reports).

b. Implementation arrangements
     i.  Concentration of activities in UAESPNN and IAvH ­ a highly decentralized scheme was designed for
         project execution, building upon existing institutional strengths of the entities involved. Activities
         under components 1 and 2 were to be carried out through grants which different organizations would
         apply for accordingly (UAESPNN, CARs, NGOs and community groups). As such, the IAvH would
         coordinate and manage project funds and interventions to be implemented regionally and locally by
         subgrant recipients. Components 3 and 4 would be directly executed by the IAvH. In practice,
         implementation of activities in the six targeted protected areas under component 1 was assumed in its
         entirety by the UAESPNN as head of the National Protected Area System, and for reasons analyzed in
         Section 2, the supervision of remaining activities under components 1 and 2 was concentrated in the
         IAvH and their execution carried out with regional and local partners.
    ii.  Financial arrangements
         -    Administration of National Parks subgrant ­ in light of the changes described above, a trust fund not
              provided for in project design was set up for UAESPNN to administer resources for protected area
              activities under Component 1.
         -    Change in trust fund denomination ­ in 2003, the GEF introduced the change in trust fund
              denomination from Special Drawing Rights to US dollars.


                                                           6

        -    Reallocation of grant proceeds ­ in October 2007, the Bank agreed to reallocate proceeds between
             categories of items to be financed, to strengthen environmental education/communication activities as
             recommended by supervision missions (implemented by means of consultants' services13).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The following key factors positively contributed to project preparation:

a. Consistency with overall strategies/priorities ­ the fact that project design and objectives were consistent
with country and sector priorities, as well as CAS and GEF strategies, contributed to the ample institutional
support from National Environmental System (SINA) actors obtained for its implementation.

b. Soundness of background analysis ­ the project design built on technical studies financed by the GEF
Project Preparation Grant (previously PDF Block B) and other partners, including: i) biological analysis
assessing the representation, conservation/transformation and protection status of 21 identified Andean
ecosystems; ii) socioeconomic diagnoses of project zones; and iii) a review of the environmental management
sector. These studies contributed to an adequate selection of zones for project intervention given their importance
for biodiversity conservation purposes and socioeconomic feasibility for component 1 and 2 activities. In
addition, biodiversity knowledge gaps and the need to organize available information were identified and
resulted in key activities designed under component 3.

c. Participatory approach ­ GEF preparation resources also financed a broad consultative and participatory
process with local communities, central and decentralized authorities, national and international NGOs,
universities and productive associations that helped verify the outcomes of the social analysis and assured the
observance of stakeholders' priorities as well as their support.

The following key factors negatively affected project design:

d. Multiplicity and complexity of objectives ­ although consistent with current priorities for biodiversity
conservation at appraisal, GEO and its 4 specific objectives each involved far-reaching goals and activities
resulting from the project's conception as the tool to launch the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan
for the Andes. The participatory exercise to adapt both the Strategy and its Action Plan to a six year project
specifically for the Andes involved representatives from nearly 20 institutions from the academic, government
and non-governmental sectors to prioritize actions and work zones, all of which helped press for ample
objectives to encompass wide ranging interests. As stated in the project's external evaluation (Uribe, 2007)14 "the
coincidences between the objective of the [Biodiversity] Convention and the objective of the project are evident",
an indication that too broad a purpose had been attributed to the operation in its design. Among others, this
resulted in project adjustment as discussed in section 1.7, and also had implications on achievement of outcomes
as discussed in section 3.




13This included reallocating: i) US$1,174,586 to Category 2 (Consultants' services) and ii) US$149,200 to Category 5 (Fund
subgrants) to cover the difference between the amount allocated to this category in SDR (corresponding to US$800,800 in Schedule 1
of the amended Grant Agreement) and that included in the PAD and resulting Agreement No.06-01-24843-0339CE entered into by
the IAvH and the Biotrade Fund (totaling US$950,000). These resources were deducted from Categories 1 (Goods), 3 (Operating
Costs), 4 (Subgrants) and 6 (Unallocated).
14In November 2007, the IAvH hired two external evaluators to assess the project's contributions to national commitments under the
Convention on Biological Diversity and to the postulates of the National Biodiversity Policy. To do so, well qualified and
acknowledged environmental specialists in Colombia, Eduardo Uribe Botero and Antoine Cleef, undertook project documentation
review, interviews with PCU staff and field visits to 4 project sites in Boyacá and Quindío, publishing the resulting evaluation reports
in December 2007.


                                                                    7

e. Multiplicity and segmentation of components ­ 18 subcomponents under 5 components were identified to
support objectives, making project execution complex given limited time and resources. More importantly, the
multiplicity of components contributed to segment project implementation, reinforced by the M&E focus on
products/outputs by component rather than on outcomes contributing to GEO achievement (see sections F, 1.3
and 2.3).

f. Underestimation of key risks ­ the project identified key risks regarding: i) political support, ii) stakeholder
interest (from decision-makers, sectoral agencies, etc.), and iii) long-term financial sustainability. However, the
following can be said about their assessment:
   i. Political support ­ this risk was underestimated as negligible, as the GoC had actively participated in
       project design and was expected to continue so during implementation. For reasons explained in
       Section 2.2, a more defined mitigation measure such as establishing a specific role for MMA in project
       execution would have been key to ensure its support until closing.
  ii. Stakeholder interest ­ this risk was estimated as moderate and to mitigate it, target groups would be
       identified and the benefits of changed practices presented to them. This proved insufficient to guarantee
       their interest given, among others, staff turnover. Underestimating both risks i) and ii) resulted in the lack
       of project marketing strategy that would have been useful from its start, including more robust budget
       allocations to component 4 and to dissemination activities under components 2 and 3, which accounted for
       2.9 and 4.2% of total project costs, respectively.
 iii. Long-term financial sustainability ­ not achieving financial sustainability was considered a moderate risk,
       and consequently less attention was paid to the effective design of financial mechanisms (a fundraising
       unit in PCU identified as a mitigation measure was not implemented). Confidence in budgetary allocations
       by CARs and fundraising activities in protected areas, particularly National Natural Parks, overrode
       institutional weaknesses in fundraising and lobbying.

2.2 Implementation
Key factors contributing to successful implementation

a. IAvH's high quality research ­ As one of Colombia's main research institutes on biological resources since
1995, the IAvH has set up a team of highly qualified researchers under four main programs (biodiversity
inventories, conservation biology, use and valuation, and policy and legislation) and two cross-cutting programs
for information and training. It has engaged in several research projects with national and international
organizations resulting in quality products following recognized technical standards, all of which has been
recently acknowledged by an influential regional newspaper granting the IAvH an award for its exemplary career
in national biodiversity conservation. Project activities supporting the expansion and improvement of the
country's biodiversity knowledge base benefited from this institutional strength.

b. Active participation and commitment by direct beneficiaries ­ the implementation of biodiversity
conservation management tools and incentives in rural landscapes and protected area buffer zones encountered
initial resistance from some local authorities, producers and communities. However, field training and visits to
pilot project sites turned direct beneficiaries into active participants in conservation activities once they became
aware of the local benefits that conservation could bring about. Their commitment was key to test innovative
incentives implemented by the project such as a payment scheme for environmental services in one targeted
watershed.

c. Dutch participation ­ the government of the Netherlands played a key role in project implementation as one
of its main co-financiers. In keeping with the Paris Agreements and given the comprehensive nature of the
project, resources from the Bank and the Netherlands were invested in a complementary manner and allowed for
increased and uninterrupted flow of funds. In addition, Embassy representatives facilitated high-level dialogue
between the MMA and the EA when institutional relations were tense due to political reasons outside project
control. A Tripartite Committee set up to facilitate joint project planning and supervision helped maximize
reporting efforts by PCU and enhance supervision given technical complementarities between project evaluators.


                                                           8

Key factors hindering implementation

The scope and complexity of the project proved to be a real challenge to the IAvH, as stated in section 2.1,
given that achieving its objectives called for the active participation and commitment from numerous actors.
Traditionally weak public inter-institutional coordination, particularly in the SINA, demanded active support
from the PCU and its field staff to promote dialogue. The following key factors hindered implementation:

d. Decentralized project implementation by a centralized implementing agency ­ implementing the highly
decentralized grant scheme described earlier for project execution was a challenge for the IAvH as a centralized
research institute with limited competencies regarding protected area consolidation and sector policy dialogue
(see Section 1.1b) It involved numerous partners with dissimilar administrative capacities, which was also
demanding in terms of capacity-building and coordination efforts. Several activities designed to be led by CARs,
NGOs and other partners were eventually taken up by IAvH for administrative efficiency reasons, but given its
weak lobbying capacity as a research institute, decision-makers at all levels were unevenly and insufficiently
engaged.

e. Slow learning curves in UAESPNN ­ as mentioned earlier, the UAESPNN took on the execution of
activities in targeted protected areas under component 1 as head of the National Protected Area System.
However, its centralized contracting scheme whereby activities in each National Park are approved at the
central level, delayed contract approval and subsequent budget execution. Park Chiefs normally
administering limited resources were unfamiliar with procurement requirements and associated paperwork,
and lack of sufficient administrative staff in UAESPNN's legal department contributed to administrative
inefficiencies. Moreover, the technical content of each contract was initially cleared and its execution audited
by IAvH, considerably straining the inter-agency dialogue. Mitigation measures to streamline procedures
included: transferring technical quality accountability to the UAESPNN; more actively involving its staff in
project technical and steering committees; and additional training to park and IAvH personnel in the
preparation of POAs, bidding documents, financial reports and monitoring tools. Finally, given disbursement
lags in UAESPNN's subgrant accumulated since 200215, the project set up a Joint 2006-2007 POA between
UAESPNN and IAvH which enabled the latter to directly execute non-disbursed resources in activities
prioritized with UAESPNN, the Bank and the Dutch Embassy (e.g. project results dissemination,
environmental education, biodiversity information system).

f. Staff turnover ­ changing personnel in government agencies, from management to technical staff particularly
in the CARs, hindered project implementation in several areas as activities and targets agreed upon with previous
delegates were not prioritized by subsequent decision-makers and agreements had to be rebuilt. This was the
case for the declaration of a protected area in Alto Putumayo agreed upon during project preparation with Cofan
indigenous authorities (cabildos) who later changed in their entirety, which, together with public order
disruptions in the area, made it necessary to find alternate sites for the establishment of a new national protected
area. The same was true for the planned activity discussed with Cundinamarca's CAR and the CVC to create
regional reserves in a dry ecosystem, not supported by the new administrations. This implied searching for
alternatives such as finding second choices for protected area declarations.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Project design included a monitoring and evaluation plan that would allow tracking the evolution of
biodiversity in project areas as well as project performance and impact.




15Administrative inefficiencies outside UAESPNN's control also contributed to disbursements lags under this component, including
the implementation and selection process of the subgrant trustee between 2002 and 2003, which took over a year to become fully
operational and the change in trust fund denomination from SDR to US dollars, which delayed Bank disbursements between March
and May 2004.


                                                                9

a. Biodiversity M&E system
    i. Design ­ a system comprising simple and complex indicators was laid out to monitor biodiversity
        characteristics alongside socioeconomic and institutional conditions in selected areas, and to relate
        observed changes to project interventions.
   ii. Implementation and use ­ Under component 3, a system of state-pressure-response indicators was
        developed by the IAvH with a view to provide information on the status of Andean biodiversity, the
        pressure-exerting factors and the policy actions set out to achieve the desired biodiversity scenarios.
        The system was successfully piloted to prioritize conservation areas in the jurisdiction of
        Cundinamarca's CAR, in the Iquaque-La Rusia-Guantiva oak forest corridor and in the coffee-
        growing region (Eje Cafetero). These and other exercises applying biodiversity state-pressure-response
        indicators            in          selected           Andean             areas        are           available            at
        http://www.humboldt.org.co/humboldt/mostrarpagina.php?codpage=5000312,                             including          the
        methodological sheets describing each indicator. In addition, through a tool called INFORMAR
        `Municipal and Regional Information related to Biodiversity in Colombia', the project collected data to
        build biodiversity baselines and socioeconomic indicators linked to municipal statistics and maps.
        Resulting information was initially compiled and published as a book, INFORMAR Andes, distributed
        to 14 CARs acting in the area. It is now available for authorized researchers as an online application at
        http://intranet.Humboldt.org.co/indicadores/informar.html. Synthetic indicators to analyze the
        transformation of sub Andean forest fragments between 1985 and 2000 and its relation to human
        activity were also developed with the National Program for Human Development16. Although the
        biodiversity state-pressure-response M&E strategy seeks to build regional indicator systems adding up
        to a countrywide structure to monitor to the application of the National Biodiversity Policy, under the
        project its scope was limited following midterm review advice on insufficient budget.

b. Project M&E system
 i. Design ­ As for project performance, the M&E plan included in the corresponding PAD Annex foresaw
      a system comparing planned versus executed activities and outputs using measures of effectiveness,
      efficiency and timing. The system would also evaluate impacts based on the project's logical framework,
      complemented with indicators of productivity (cost/benefit) and quality (planned vs. obtained technical
      standards per output).
ii. Implementation and use ­ Although IAvH set up a planning and M&E system administered by its
      planning office, project design lacked adequate arrangements to ensure that desired variables were
      actually measured. As stated in previous sections, the project's logical framework focused mainly on
      activities and outputs, with 40 product indicators that did not comprehensively measure achievement of
      objectives. Bank efforts as early as May 2003 to remedy a weak and unclear M&E design to measure
      GEO progress resulted in the adjustments referred to in Sections F and 1.3 adopted after midterm review,
      namely: i) focusing biannual supervision on 15 indicators deemed most representative of increased
      biodiversity knowledge, conservation and sustainable use, and ii) developing 6 outcome indicators to
      focus M&E on aggregated improvements in biodiversity knowledge, conservation and use practices and
      their sustainability, using the 40 product indicators as input. However, having the 6 formulas listed in
      section 1.3 was insufficient to guarantee that these indicators were actually incorporated into M&E
      processes by project partners, including the IAvH as research institute normally operating on an output
      base. The intended impact evaluations were not undertaken, partly due to the M&E emphasis on outputs
      (see Annex 2 for details on achievement of outputs), and the 6 outcome indicators agreed upon were
      measured only on project closing.




16This program is a joint initiative between the National Planning Department, the Colombian Presidential Agency for Social Action
and International Cooperation and the United Nations Development Program, established to strengthen regional and local authorities'
social development programs. It aims to support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals locally and assist national
efforts to monitor and evaluate progress.


                                                                 10

     The project used several mechanisms to monitor progress: i) software to administer management data, ii)
     annual operating plans with timetables and targets, and iii) meetings with regional and component
     coordinators to prepare progress reports presented on an annual basis at first and biannually since 2006 to
     the Bank, upon approval by IAvH's General Assembly and Board of Directors. Progress reports were
     based on information from contractors and grant recipients working under different components. A
     protocol for archiving documents was developed by IAvH.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Four safeguard policies (Indigenous people, Natural Habitats, Gender Issues and NGO Involvement) applied
to the project as identified in the PAD. Comprehensive studies were also carried out for Involuntary
Resettlement17 and Environmental Impacts for selection of priority areas. As of 2004, PSR-ISRs reported on
compliance with four safeguards: Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats, Forestry and Indigenous
Peoples.

a. Environmental safeguards ­ the project was rated B category as no major adverse environmental impacts
were expected from a design that would increase conservation, knowledge and sustainable use of globally
important biodiversity of the Colombian Andes. The technical studies referred to in Section 2.1a enabled the
selection of areas representing the wide range of Andean ecosystems and established their importance for
global conservation purposes. Compliance with policies on Natural Habitats and Forests was ensured through
the preparation and implementation of management plans for targeted protected areas (existing and new) and
their surrounding regions. Land management tools and conservation incentives applied in rural landscapes
promoted the protection and rehabilitation of natural habitats and integrated forests into farming practices in
a more sustainable manner. In addition, biotrade initiatives supported by the funding mechanism set up by
the project were screened to guarantee their positive approach to natural resource management.

b. Social safeguards ­ social assessments and participatory consultations for project design and
implementation sought to guarantee its participatory approach to biodiversity conservation, sustainable use
and knowledge in the Andean region.
     i.    Indigenous peoples ­ the project complied with OP 4.20 requirements in place during preparation
           and later OP 4.10 provisions throughout its implementation. Free, prior, and informed consultations
           with the 5 Indigenous peoples present in two project conservation zones, namely the Alto Putumayo
           and the Northeastern Páramo and humid forests, resulted, on the one hand, in broad community
           support to the project by the 4 Indigenous Peoples located in the Alto Putumayo18, and on the other,
           in the exclusion of U'wa territories. As for the Cofan, Siona, Kamsa and Inga peoples in the Alto
           Putumayo, project activities were consistent with their Life Plans and supported ongoing initiatives
           to protect and maintain the integrity of their territories. A participatory approach, respectful of
           traditional knowledge and cultural conditions, prevailed during project intervention in the area.

     ii. Gender issues and NGO involvement ­ an equal opportunities approach was implemented for on-the-
           ground activities particularly under components 1 and 2, where many small to medium-sized
           landowners in protected area buffer zones included women with children who were actively involved
           in environmental education efforts and the implementation of land management tools. As for the
           PCU itself, about 85% of the team members and researchers benefiting from IAvH grants were



17The project adopted UAESPNN policy on social participation in conservation (1999) based on respect for acquired rights, among
other principles, and established a strategy to ensure stakeholder involvement in the design of regional protected area systems, in the
identification of new protected areas and in the promotion of sustainable productive activities and conservation incentive systems.
Eligibility criteria for project activities supporting private or regional reserves and biotrade initiatives included having no impact on
land tenure or land use situation of local people. Finally, the national protected area that was to be declared in Cerro Patascoy was
uninhabited due to its difficult access and interrupted relief.
18The Cofanes expressed their interest in project support for the process they had been leading for over two years to protect the
Cerro Patascoy located in the Alto Putumayo Zone 2 to enable the protection of an area with high biodiversity of global importance
and a significant source of water and medicinal plants for these indigenous peoples.


                                                                     11

         women. With regards to NGOs, the project identified over 400 of them working in the Andes during
         preparation, and engaged in consultations with a large number of them for project design. 57 NGOs
         directly executed activities in components 1, 2 and 3 under the project's decentralized grant scheme
         and most of them provided in-kind cofinancing. Their views were taken into account during self
         evaluation exercises and project performance monitoring, as well as during technical discussions and
         trainings under component 4 in the case of sectoral organizations and productive associations.

c. Fiduciary compliance ­ the project complied with fiduciary policies as shown by procurement and
financial management reviews, as well as semiannual audit reports on project implementation. From its onset,
an action plan for compliance with fiduciary regulations was drafted by IAvH with Bank assistance, whereby
the project coordination unit was staffed with an appropriately qualified and experienced procurement officer
and financial management specialists, who received training on Bank requirements and procedures
throughout the project. The financial management software, Novasoft, was acquired and implemented by
2006. At the end of 2005, the IAvH's administrative staff undertook functions previously carried out by the
PCU as they were incorporated into the Institute's Financial and Administrative Coordination and Legal
Units. POAs, terms of reference and selection processes by IAvH were examined and approved by the Bank
pursuant to the Grant Agreement and Operations Manual.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
A follow-up operation was not expected for this project and although a plan was not formally presented by
IAvH upon project closing, supervision missions over the last year discussed strategies for post-completion.
Consequently, certain activities and outputs have set up arrangements to ensure their continuity after project
completion. These arrangements by IAvH and project partners comprise: i) 2008 budget allocations by
UAESPNN to continue implementing strategic lines included in the National Natural Parks' management
plans developed with project support; ii) budget and cofinancing agreements with 3 private and public sector
users19 to ensure continuity of the Biodiversity Information System and its staff; and iii) guaranteed financing
for the Biotrade Fund set up under component 2, totaling over US$ 4.6 million from 3 sources (the Dutch
Embassy, IFC and Petrotesting Colombia), to continue lending to biotrade initiatives. Subject to the
signature of cooperation agreements, IAvH would provide technical assistance to CARs and other actors
investing in protected area management and conservation tools in rural landscapes, including the GEF-
financed National Protected Area and Biodiversity Conservation Trust Fund, which have expressed interest
in such support. In addition, a national project was recently approved by the GEF Council for work program
inclusion in April 2008, to mainstream biodiversity in Colombia's coffee sector. It will build on the tools and
lessons learned from the landscape-based management approaches developed in coffee-growing areas by this
project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Increasing conservation, knowledge and sustainable use of globally important biodiversity of the Colombian
Andes continues to be relevant to achieve country environmental sustainability objectives, which the Bank in
turn has continued to support through its recently approved Country Partnership Strategy (2008-2012). The
2006-2010 National Development Plan establishes six central themes to guide environmental management in
Colombia, three of which closely related to the GEF/WB operation: i) biodiversity knowledge, conservation
and sustainable use; ii) sustainable productive processes; and iii) environmental planning in land
management. In particular, the consolidation of the National Protected Area System is highlighted as an
important approach to conservation. The Government's midterm policy-guiding document "Colombia Vision
2019" also includes biodiversity knowledge, conservation and use as a key strategy for the promotion of



19Agreements have been signed with the following partners: the World Bank (for US$66,000), CIEBREG (to sponsor 1 junior
researcher) and INVEMAR (to sponsor an engineer for 9 months, half-time).


                                                            12

sustainable development. It establishes targets for the consolidation of the Biodiversity Information System,
in situ conservation in the framework of the National Protected Area System and sustainable use of
biodiversity products, among others. As for the National Biodiversity Policy (1997), the project's external
evaluation concluded that its "four components...directly contributed to compliance of the country's
commitments under the Biodiversity Convention and to the development of the strategies of the National
Biodiversity Policy" and its associated instruments, which continue to be in force. Finally, in light of GEF
focal area strategies and strategic programming for GEF-420, the project continues to have high overall
relevance. The decentralized and participatory approaches for protected area management also continue to be
relevant, as evidenced by their promotion in country and sector strategies for environmental sustainability
and their application by other environmental authorities and projects.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
The project completed the majority of its activities and there is enough evidence of its contribution to
increase conservation, knowledge and sustainable use of globally important biodiversity in the Colombian
Andes (see Annex 2 for details).

a. A more representative Andean protected area system was supported - as a result of the project
ecosystem representation has increased in the 7 WWF/World Bank ecoregions targeted for intervention.
96.4% of remaining ecosystem types in these ecoregions is now represented in protected areas and only the
semiarid open and low bush forest in the Valle del Cauca Dry Forest ecoregion is not. This was possible
through the establishment of different categories of protected areas supported by project (see Annex 2, Table
1) totaling 85 new protected areas declared. Enhanced conservation has resulted from the expansion of the
National Protected Areas System enabled by the project as follows: i) the creation of one new national park:
Selva de Florencia, ii) the declaration of 3 regional PA: Barbas-Bremen and the Distritos de Manejo
Integrado Berlin and Alicante, and iii) the establishment of 81 private reserves. One national park (Orito­
Ingi Ande) was proposed but approved by GoC after project closing in June 2008, totaling 88,134 additional
protected area hectares. In the framework of UAESPNN's policy for Social Participation in Conservation, a
methodology to design protected area management plans was validated by the project in 6 selected National
Protected Areas21 and later applied by the UAESPNN to the remaining national protected areas under its
jurisdiction.

The project supported efforts to consolidate 6 regional networks of protected areas22 through: i) biological
diagnoses for the selection of priority conservation objects and areas; ii) dissemination of tools and
assessments developed under different project components; and iii) active participation by project experts in
the workshops and technical discussions held in the framework of these networks. With project assistance,
private reserves also developed and applied management plans and joined the Civil Society Reserves
Network (RRSC) through 5 Andean nodes strengthened by the project to interact with regional protected area
networks. Moreover, private conservation efforts were enhanced with project support for community-based




20The project directly contributed to Biodiversity Long-term Objectives 1 (to catalyze sustainability of protected area systems) and 2
(to mainstream biodiversity in production landscapes and sectors) by strengthening terrestrial PA networks (Strategic Program 3),
strengthening the policy and regulatory framework for mainstreaming biodiversity (SP 4), and fostering markets for biodiversity
goods and services (SP 5).
21The National Natural Parks Pisba, Iguaque, Cocuy, Tama, Nevados and Otun-Quimbaya applied the following three-step planning
route: 1) Description ­ diagnose the PA (characterize existing productive systems, actors and socioeconomic factors in buffer zones
and identify biodiversity threats), identify conservation objects and objectives for action, and measure management effectiveness for
each area through WB/WWF adapted tracking tool; 2) Prospective territorial planning ­ zone the PA, regulate land uses and
activities, and adjust PA limits, and 3) Strategic action ­ determine strategic lines for the implementation of PA management plans
(knowledge generation, use agreements, institutional strengthening, strategic alliances for territorial planning, among others to reduce
ecosystem degradation).

                                                                   13

initiatives to declare Areas of Importance for Bird Conservation (AICA)23. 40 AICA were declared during
project execution for the Andean region. For details on relevant outputs, see Annex 2, Table 1.

b. Conservation opportunities in rural landscapes were identified and management tools for
biodiversity conservation were piloted ­ as a result of the project, the conservation opportunities identified
in rural landscapes through biodiversity and socioeconomic assessments were translated into management
tools and incentives applied in pilot sites, including a national biotrade program. Their widespread promotion
and sectoral adoption, including by environmental authorities, is still pending.

Management tools designed and applied24 in 10 pilot sites resulted in 332 ha and 239.6 km of improvements
in 274 farms. Complementary strategies to reinforce management tool implementation included a
participatory communication and capacity-building strategy with beneficiaries, as well as nurseries
specializing in native species          25  and agreements with communities for sustainable resource use and
management based on characterizations of local practices. These management tools enhanced the ecological
connectivity of over 4,000 ha. of remnant forest patches in intervened watersheds and farms. As for
incentives to promote private conservation efforts, 3 were successfully piloted, including a national scale
program supporting biotrade. Property tax exemptions and water payments to farmers implementing
conservation activities were tested by the project. Despite their limited coverage (101 farms in one
municipality benefiting from tax exemptions and 8 farms in 1 watershed receiving periodic payments from
4,500 downstream users), their operation has continued after project completion due to beneficiary
commitment. Moreover, the Payment for Environmental Services pilot was recognized by the Center for
International Forestry Research (CIFOR) as an important example of applied local economic incentives. The
biotrade program supported 90 companies in the 5 priority value-chains identified. A web-based observatory,
OBIO, was set up to provide practical company, market and technology information related to biotrade
http://www.humboldt.org.co/obio. The program's funding mechanism, the Biotrade Fund, was successfully
designed and implemented, having supported 23 biotrade initiatives by December 2007 with US$654,027
and leveraged additional resources to continue operating independently from project. Finally, 10 offices in
CARs were supported to promote local green market initiatives.

The project successfully proved the economic, environmental and social feasibility of management tools and
conservation incentives. However, the pilot nature of their implementation did not enable their regional and
national dissemination and adoption. The consolidation of regional systems of incentives by CARs and other
competent authorities was not achieved as designed in PAD, in partly due to concentration of activities in
IAvH.

c. Biodiversity knowledge base was expanded, organized and disseminated to stakeholders ­ enhanced
biodiversity knowledge and monitoring has been achieved through: i) an Andean biodiversity baseline
completed with data from 9 biodiversity assessments and 2 land cover map updates; ii) fieldwork training in
collection management and data processing to 89 partners institutions; iii) a biodiversity state-pressure-
response indicator system piloted to prioritize conservation areas in 3 project zones; and iv) a decentralized
Biodiversity Information System (BIS) bringing together 16 information networks, 50 specialized databases



23 Although not considered an official protected area category, the declaration of an AICA, normally a local initiative, can contribute
to the subsequent declaration of a local or regional PA, as was the case for DMI Alicante in Antioquia and the National Park Selva de
Florencia in Caldas. In support of these areas, the project developed population studies, inventories, and conservation and restoration
strategies in 15 AICA in 9 regions. Technical appraisals complemented local initiatives for declaration as well as 2 courses on bird
recording and identification, for inventory and monitoring purposes.
24Biological corridors, live and mixed hedgerows, agroforestry systems, multipurpose forests, enclosed and enriched forest remnants,
plus management plans for threatened species.
25The project developed an innovative methodology to accelerate natural forest succession. A large number of diverse native species
in different succession stages and varied growth patterns were planted in nurseries. When transferred to farms, they enabled growing
woodlands with the structure and species composition of old forests in short timeframes. This methodology will be adopted in two
climate change projects by CORNARE and IDEAM.


                                                                  14

and 171 organizations contributing data for the Andean region at http://www.siac.net.co/Home.php, based on
similar international initiatives adjusted for national operation. The system's decentralized features allow for
independent data management by partner institutions, helping to increase their confidence in the system and
enabling more databases to be linked.

The following examples illustrate key contributions to increasing biodiversity knowledge: the 2000 and 2005
Andean ecosystem maps26 were used as input for the Colombian Ecosystem Map published in 2007; the
collection of 13 Red Books on threatened species published as a collective effort between project partners,
served to issue two decrees officially declaring over 390 of them threatened, with defined use prohibitions;
and as for the information system, an innovative database on traditional biodiversity uses and knowledges
`Yoscua' was established and linked to the BIS, expanding on related research carried out by the project.

These efforts towards systematic data gathering and monitoring were complemented by an environmental
education/communication strategy in formal and non-formal settings that disseminated biodiversity
information to the general public, children and specialized audiences through 12 communication products
and strategies (see Annex 2, Table 3 for details). However, the lack of a marketing strategy for project results
has weakened the widespread adoption of quality knowledge-based products by decision-makers, and more
needs to be done with a view to compile a portfolio that can easily `be sold' to different potential users.
Access restrictions to certain products, like the biodiversity indicator system, still persist.

As for institutional strengthening, the project's external evaluation by Uribe (2007) concludes that IAvH
increased its capacity and leadership as a main source and manager of biodiversity information in Colombia,
internationally consolidating it as a reference for global biodiversity information systems.

d. A systematic approach to inter-sectoral coordination was adopted - as recognized by the project's
external evaluation, "the Andes project is the first systematic and sustained effort of the SINA seeking to
intervene and influence the design of policies, regulations, programs, etc., of different economic sectors".
Technical input to enhance inter-sectoral coordination on a sound scientific basis include: i) a methodology
for the inclusion of biodiversity considerations into Impact Evaluations for environmental licensing and
Strategic Environmental Assessments, the latter applied by the MMA in its assessment of liquid fuels, ii) 43
biodiversity-oriented policy adjustments for agriculture, mining, energy and transport; iii) input for 8 national
regulations, including 6 bills passed to Congress; iv) the design of an Early Warning System for biodiversity
impacts from large-scale development projects, and v) training on proposed adjustments offered to Ministry
representatives and productive associations. Key decision-makers, however, were not engaged in these
efforts and inter-sectoral coordination was not adopted as a regular practice, largely owing to factors
highlighted in Section 2 regarding limited lobbying capacity by the IAvH and a weak coordination culture in
Colombia's public sector in general. The effective implementation of project proposals and the degree to
which they helped increase sector awareness on biodiversity importance was not monitored by the project.

3.3 Efficiency
The scope of this analysis is constrained for several reasons: i) incremental costs were used instead of
traditional measures of efficiency such as NVP or ERR at appraisal; ii) multiple products of varied nature
obtained under project components and subcomponents make it difficult to define units of inputs or outputs
for cost comparison; and iii) no adequate economic data was collectable for Components 1, 3 and 4, while
biodiversity-friendly production activities under Component 2 were not accompanied by farm productivity
nor cost-benefit data collection, except for the Biotrade Fund which analyzed ROE (Return on equity), ROA
(Return on Assets) and profit margin of potential client companies and their business plans.




26These maps received an honorable mention under the research category awarded by the Fundación Alejandro Angel Escobar, a
Colombian NGO supporting scientific progress in benefit of local communities since 1955.


                                                               15

Based on the incremental cost analysis undertaken for project preparation (see Annex 3 for details), the
incremental global benefits estimated at appraisal were achieved through the GEF Alternative, with less
resources invested by the project to enhance sustainable conservation of remaining natural habitats in the
Andes (US$3.15 million less were spent under component 1), given an important modification in baseline
scenario estimates regarding UAESPNN investments in the National Protected Area System (between 2006
and 2007, the Unit was allocated 21.8% more resources to invest in the National Protected Areas System27).
Moreover, less GEF resources in the amount of US$0.24 million were spent under components 2 and 3,
mainly due to a substantial increase in counterpart financing for activities under both, contributing to achieve
and even surpass targets set out under the project's logical framework leading to enhanced capacity-building
and expanded knowledge base (see Annexes 2 and 3 for details). As for intersectoral coordination, although
GEF resources were slightly increased to finance this component (from an estimated US$0.50 to an actual
US$0.51 million), total spending was actually reduced by an approximate 13% (from an estimated US$0.86
to an actual US$0.75 million). Costs for project management increased by 50%, with US$ 0.19 million
additional GEF resources employed to finance staff, office costs and other administrative costs.

As for the project disbursement performance, an indication of reduced efficiency was the continuous lag
between expected and actual disbursements throughout its implementation mainly due to administrative
inefficiencies described in Section 2.2b for Component 1 execution. Mitigation measures to streamline
administrative procedures enabled full grant disbursement, but several planned activities in National Natural
Parks for 2007 were cut back (namely, activities included in Park management plans regarding visitor
carrying capacity studies and septic pit and power plant installations that did not compromise project goals).
The graph in section I above illustrates this lag.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project was and remains relevant to biodiversity conservation efforts in Colombia. It applied enhanced
management tools for the National Protected Areas System, supporting its consolidation with key technical
input. It piloted innovative approaches to reinforce public and private conservation efforts in protected areas
and transformed landscapes, as well as improved the knowledge-base and its availability for public
consultation. It did not achieve the promotion of inter-sectoral coordination that would address root causes of
biodiversity loss, mainly due to design shortcomings described in section 2.

However, the project failed to engage key decision makers at the local, regional and national levels,
including the MMA, to ensure adoption of its outputs, placing increased biodiversity conservation and
sustainable use at significant risk (see section 4). Moreover, an important missed opportunity was ensuring
IAvH's long term viability, as for the six years the project lasted a large part of its budget depended on GEF
resources, causing important staff cut-backs upon project completion.

Therefore, the ICR team rates overall outcome as moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

a. Poverty impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social development ­ most project activities in rural landscapes,
including protected area buffer zones, involved middle to low income level beneficiaries, including a number
of women and children who benefited from environmental education and training in management tool
implementation. Although on a small-scale, social capital increased in rural areas intervened as a result of the
project's participatory approach to on-the-ground conservation efforts. Examples include the organization of



27Although not directly attributable to the project, the increase in resources allocated to the UAESPNN by the central government is
due to its improved institutional and administrative capacities to execute resources and the Dutch negotiations with the MAVDT to
strengthen the Unit's personnel and operational budget.


                                                                   16

4,500 downstream water users in the Chaina watershed to pay 7 families for their continued upstream
conservation activities, the creation of NATIVA ­ a private association assembling biodiversity goods and
services producers seeking to promote biotrade, and locally-based initiatives to promote AICA declarations.
Equally important, traditional biodiversity uses and knowledge was employed as a complementary
management tool seeking to recognize historical and cultural elements in private conservation efforts. A
network of researchers including indigenous peoples retrieved and documented traditional biodiversity uses
and knowledges, helping to create the `Yoscua' database. It contains over 1,400 files on biodiversity uses by
90 Colombian ethnic groups and 346 information sources, including local testimonies, favoring the exchange
of traditional knowledge through modern methods. In addition, Cofan indigenous peoples participated in the
development of an inventory on traditionally-used flora and fauna, in the design of a management plan for
the use of medicinal flora, and in the publication of an intercultural botanical survey. Finally 3
agrobiodiversity surveys completed in each Andean mountain range sought is valuation as a source of food
security; 4 events mainly involving women were held to promote seed and recipe exchanges encouraging the
use of native, locally cultivated plants, many of which endangered.

b. Institutional Change/Strengthening ­ enhanced institutional capacities were brought about in particular
for the UAESPNN, which gained key administrative skills through the implementation of Bank fiduciary
requirements. The Civil Society Reserves Network which brings together private reserves and their owners
was strengthened through the consolidation of 5 of its nodes to enable interaction with regional protected
area networks. As for SINA enhancement, despite administrative difficulties described in section 2, effective
cooperation was eventually achieved between key actors such as IAvH and UAESPNN, and to a lesser extent,
between IAvH and CARs through the provision of quality information for regional protected area networks
led by the latter. The project's systematic approach to inter-sectoral coordination sets an example for the
manner in which technical data can serve to inform sector policy design. Information exchange was also
strengthened in the framework of Colombia's National GEF Committee, chaired by the MMA and attended
by the GEF implementing agencies in the country and its political focal point at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. This exchange enabled ongoing and future biodiversity-related initiatives to learn about tools and
lessons under the High Andes operation, later to be adopted by projects to mainstream biodiversity in coffee
and cattle ranching sectors, as well as by the National Protected Area Conservation Trust Fund. Moreover,
aligned Bank and Dutch investments strengthened the application of Paris Agreements' in Colombia.
However, project unintendedly caused IAvH budget reliance on project resources that forced staff cut-backs
on project completion.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Results of key stakeholders interviews
As of July 2007, the IAvH carried out beneficiary surveys and stakeholder workshops. Participants in focal
survey groups included local landowners and governmental staff in two of the main areas of action, a group
of environmental authorities at the regional level, and the technical staff of the implementing institution. Key
stakeholders interviewed were six National Parks Chiefs and a representative from the UAESPNN's regional
management office, as well as local inhabitants, municipal authorities and staff, NGOs, private enterprises,
local teachers and artisans.
a) Local stakeholders were oriented more towards the landscape management tools strategy, with which
    they had been closely acquainted. Although technical terms were not necessarily incorporated in their
    daily life, there was a general concern about advances in characterizations and especially its significance
    in terms of biodiversity richness, for regional pride.

b) Municipal officials in charge of environmental matters had been used to reforestation programs, where
    small trees were planted at low densities, implying high maintenance costs over three or more years. The
    new technique proposed, based on the recovery of bigger seedlings for planting at high densities, allowed
    rapid tree growth and thus instant credibility at every level.

c) Implementation of biological corridors and other management tools was deemed successful by donors,
    local population, local or regional environmental authorities, academic institutions and others. Still,


                                                       17

    some weakness was perceived in the strengthening of local capacity, which would enable to continue this
    actions as the project is finished.

d) Staff implementing the project at IAvH stressed the fact that technical basis for action is important,
    but local and regional participation can enhance results. When supporting regional processes, there was a
    substantial effort to adapt to local or regional dynamics, but some obstacles were not surmounted, due to
    political stances affected by some of the project's targets. This situation implied searching for
    alternatives which not always complied with all technical definitions and restrictions, such as finding
    second choices for protected area declarations. Difficulties arose because in the project design the
    implementing agency was the sole responsible for completion of the project's objectives and targets, thus
    assigning a technical role to the coordinating office.

e) National Parks Authority participants reviewed aspects of implementation, concluding the following
    main findings:

         1. The GIS tools applied during the project for map updating, along with the boundary stones built,
             were critical for parks delimitation, giving much needed consistence with zoning proposals made
             by the regional autonomous corporations and municipalities and allowing for conflict resolution
             with them and landowners.
         2. A positive strategy for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in or around the Park
             areas was to link activities such as ecological restoration, watershed management plans and
             sustainable practices in productive systems to communities inhabiting the area. Relations
             between civil society and institutions collaborating towards these goals will be beneficial for
             every agent implied.
         3. Well-known methodologies applied to planning and monitoring, allowed for a strengthening of
             technical capacity, reflected in the systematic structure of management plans and yearly
             operation plans.
         4. Participation by the Park's chiefs and staff in the management plan construction granted a fine-
             tuned diagnosis and the appropriation of actions proposed.
         5. Effective participation processes, including both planning agreements and the financial support
             needed for attaining proposed actions, are significant for success.
         6. The quality of information on biodiversity, as well as good cartography is the basis for the
             advancement of decision making regarding conservation areas.
         7. In regional processes, the exchange of information is crucial, and this was obtained with the
             establishment of a regional node of the Biodiversity Information System.
         8. There was a slow development of national guidelines on conservation categories, giving way to
             myriad denominations according to the local or regional authorities promoting their creation.
         9. Municipalities are open to conservation efforts, despite some technical deficiency.
f) Municipality of Filandia participants stressed that biodiversity characterization permitted
    identification of negative effects caused by forest fragmentation, and later in, showed the way for
    outlining biological corridors and other management tools adapted to the cattle ranching productive
    system common in this area. The native tree nursery, especially created for the purpose of obtaining good
    quality and a wide variety of native tree species (498), was the core of the management tools. Support
    from the municipality to this endeavor also allowed regional recognition for environmental protection,
    attracting ecotourism and developing local guide capacity.

g) Chambery watershed area participants pointed that landowners learned to read the landscape
    configuration including and beyond their property. After the project, people talked easily about
    connections in the landscape, hedgerows establishing bridges for the protection of native animals.
    Exchange tours between the implementation areas were instrumental for comprehension of this initiative.

Stakeholder's workshops
A total of five workshops were carried out in the project zones, with 113 participants from different
institutions. The participants agreed on:
a) A high completion of the project's objectives, obtained with institutional and community participation.

                                                       18

b) A high number of participants (42%) perceived the project's contribution to the knowledge,
    conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity as high, while a further 32% considered it was medium,
    whereas 19% and 2% considered it was low or very low (5% did not answer). They reported that
    knowledge on biodiversity increased both for scientists and the general public, but assessed this
    endeavor as low because this inventory is far from being completed due to this country's high
    biodiversity.

c) Clear methodologies for conservation objectives in protected areas or rural landscapes, linked to a
    change in local attitudes, were deemed crucial for a high grading in the project's contribution; medium
    grades referred to the requirement of environmental education to consolidate conservation processes; a
    low assessment implied that further work is needed to create more effective incentives and new areas to
    be declared for conservation.

The project's contribution to sustainable use was highly recognized in relation to participative local
processes in traditional knowledge of species and in the creation of value-chains for the commercial
exploitation of biodiversity. As further time is needed to consolidate value-chain processes, this was
considered a medium grade, whereas a low contribution was assigned to the development of guidelines for
sustainable use and management.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

The project faces significant uncertainties for the sustainability of its outcomes and although arrangements
are in place to guarantee the short to midterm operation of certain outputs (see Section 2.5) the following
risks are foreseen, with insufficient mitigation measures in place to address them:

a. Government ownership and institutional commitment ­ the UAESPNN as head of the National
Protected Area System has not only demonstrated its financial commitment to support project outputs
(resources amounting to roughly US$300,000 have been secured in 2008 to implement six strategic lines
prioritized in the management plans of intervened National Natural Parks), but has also adopted the
methodology for participatory management plan design and implementation, including economic instruments
and production/market-oriented strategies in buffer zones for enhanced PA management. It is not likely for
UAESPNN to change a successful methodology in constant evolution since 1999 and consequently not
allocate resources to its implementation after 2008. This minimizes the risk that enhanced protected area
management as supported by the project will not be furthered. The same is true for the biodiversity
knowledge base expanded and organized under project, as it remains an objective aligned with the IAvH's
mission and functions. The biodiversity monitoring system has been partially adopted by UAESPNN and
several partners of the Biodiversity Information System have pledged their support to its continued operation
through financial and in-kind contributions. However, the remaining project outputs contributing to enhanced
biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, namely under components 2 and 4, have not been endorsed by
key decision-makers to allow for their far-reaching implementation. The project provided evidence of
management tools' biological effectiveness and economic feasibility, but their scaling-up requires
government ownership from national, regional and municipal authorities, some of which are simply unaware
or insufficiently informed of their existence. As for sectoral policy-screening tools, valid representatives to
enable high-level inter-sectoral dialogue such as MMA management were not sufficiently engaged in their
development. Other technical and methodological advancements as summarized in previous sections,
including communication products and environmental education strategies, are at risk of falling into disuse if
their promotion is not sustained.

b. Financial viability ­ closely related to institutional ownership of project outputs contributing to increased
biodiversity knowledge, conservation and sustainable use in the Andean region, is their financial viability.
Additional resources, including sufficient human resources, are required to promote their active use and the


                                                       19

only secured source of public funding depends on UAESPNN's budget. Other government resources to
consolidate decentralized protected area systems, conservation tools and incentives will depend on political
commitments mainly by CARs with varying technical and financial resources to sustain and/or expand
project's pilot efforts. This includes existing legal uncertainties for them to invest in private conservation
incentives. Contributions from municipal and provincial authorities are feasible yet subject to active
promotion of project's results, an activity which will largely depend on IAvH's shrinking budget.

Although incentives and management tools can continue to operate with support from landowners and
surrounding communities, as demonstrated in the Chaina watershed, it involves costly technical assistance
and initial set up (including dissemination efforts) as incurred in by other related GEF projects. The recently
closed regional project, `Integrated Silvopastoral Approaches for Ecosystem Management', demonstrated
that considerable financial and technical support is needed for the establishment of silvopastoral systems and
different biodiversity-friendly arrangements in cattle ranching farms. Solid contributions cannot be expected
from NGOs working locally, whose own financial sustainability is not always assured. Therefore designed
incentive measures and piloted management tools lack financial security for their application after project
completion.

In turn, the Biodiversity Fund ­ which is financially viable ­ may encounter future difficulties in placing its
resources given the fact that it only finances companies comparatively more developed and financially
solvent. The more incipient initiatives need support from the biotrade program in order to develop business
plans and strengthen entrepreneurial skills, yet the program is also depending on IAvH's much more limited
resources to expand its services. In addition, due to political reasons outside project control, the Green
Markets program in the MMA has closed down, weakening the biotrade program. The green market offices
in CARs can offer support but their limited capacity and continuity may eventually be at risk, as was the case
in the CRC, where the office was shut down by the new administration.

c. Stakeholder support ­ although as indicated in previous sections, stakeholder support in particular from
rural communities was a key factor contributing to successful implementation, the pilot nature of on-the-
ground interventions is insufficient in scale to promote national or even regional adoption beyond project
completion. Resource use agreements, nurseries and other complementary management tools could also fall
into disuse. On the contrary, private reserves are not likely to be sold and employed for other non-
conservation purposes, as their existence is strongly supported by the RRSC and more recently by the
National Network of Agritourism and Ecotourism Services, Agroecotur, to enhance their capacity for related
services.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank's performance during identification, preparation and appraisal of the project is considered
moderately satisfactory. Project was highly relevant in light of existing country, CAS and GEF priorities and
benefited from sound background analysis which provided a complete review of economic, financial, social
and environmental issues in the Andean region, complemented by consultations with relevant stakeholders.
However, shortcomings in its design referred to in Section 2, including a weak M&E system,
underestimation of key risks and insufficient budget allocations to dissemination activities, contributed to
place outcome sustainability at significant risk.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                       20

Supervision was conducted by TTL and field team in the Colombia office and mainly biodiversity/natural
resource specialists from the region joined its missions, carried out regularly twice a year with office sessions
and field visits with PCU team, co-financers, partner institutions and on-the-field beneficiaries. Procurement
and financial management issues were reviewed ex ante and ex post by Bank specialists, with action plans
developed and tracked when adjustments were called for. A comprehensive midterm review took place in
May 2005 with an external evaluation team and project partners, specifically promoting: i) the consolidation
of interventions in First Phase conservation zones; ii) increased interaction between project components,
including through an enhanced communication/education strategy to enable knowledge transfer; iii) M&E
focus on outcome evaluation through no more than 8 formal indicators; and iv) a revision of the scope of
certain activities as described in Section 1.7. In addition, follow-up meetings held between missions as of
2006 closely monitored disbursement progress, particularly under component 1 given accumulated lags.
Tripartite meetings with the Government of the Netherlands were conducted once a year or as needed and the
Bank played an important role in facilitating agreements to help ensure Dutch contributions. Frequent
training was held for PCU's procurement, legal and financial staff and no-objections were granted promptly.
Sector manager calls for task team re-composition and timely back-to-office reports were attended with the
inclusion of M&E and communications specialists and through on-time PSR/ISR submissions in keeping
with standards. However, design shortcomings made it difficult to resolve threats to project sustainability and
the team may have acted too slowly or ineffectively to formally adopt the necessary changes, most of which
identified as early as 2005.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As stated, Bank performance was less than satisfactory in assuring quality at entry, although its specialized
support and flexibility during implementation, providing assistance in technical and procedural matters as
well as seeking to overcome obstacles, were important features of its performance during supervision.
However, the team was unable to remedy design shortcomings that impeded a more thorough connection
between project components and outcomes.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Significant turnover in the Ministry of Environment, including its merger with the Ministry of Economic
Development, negatively affected its involvement with the project, as fewer human resources were available
to devote to active participation and feedback for project implementation. However, the UAESPNN as head
of the National Protected Area System remained actively involved and committed throughout
implementation to apply project methodologies and approaches, although not without hesitation regarding
management of productive areas in National Park buffer zones. It overcame administrative inefficiencies and
obstacles in its relation with IAvH that hindered project execution particularly under component 1, and thus
contributed to enhance biodiversity conservation and sustainable use through improved PA management.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

IAvH was able to carry out project until completion with committed and quality staff, despite changing
national coordinator three times. As highlighted in Section 2, IAvH ensured high quality technical
information to support the different project activities and undoubtedly contributed to enhance biodiversity
knowledge and its availability, as a result of its research under the project and its organization in a
decentralized information system. It complied with Bank procedures, maintained strong financial and
procurement management, adopted suggestions for improvement and constantly supervised progress to


                                                      21

guarantee output quality. Its failure to adequately involve key decision-makers to support project outcomes,
including within the MMA, and to transfer outputs to the SINA for their broad adoption relates to its nature
as a research institute and to project design shortcomings discussed in previous sections, for which the
agency cannot be held accountable.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Despite modest commitment to the project at the central level, mainly from the MMA due to wide ranging
factors, a committed and quality-oriented implementing agency enabled completion of all project outputs and
partial achievement of project objectives, responding with professionalism to a challenging project.

6. Lessons Learned

Several lessons have been learned from project design and implementation, particularly regarding factors
discussed in section 2 related to the multiplicity and complexity of project objectives and components, as
well as beneficiary and stakeholder involvement:

a. Balancing participatory approaches and the need for focused objectives ­ the open participatory
    approach adopted for project preparation ensured support for its subsequent execution but also pressed
    for ample objectives to encompass wide ranging interests. As seen earlier, focusing objectives is crucial
    to increase effectiveness and sustainability of project outcomes but implies ruling topics out. Balancing
    the two requires building stakeholder understanding of the issue, so as to adequately channel
    expectations into focused agreements. Seeking to adapt a national biodiversity policy framework to a six
    year project geographically too ambitious undermines achievement of outcomes.
b. Trade-offs between administrative efficiency and institutional adoption of outcomes ­ IAvH's
    designation by the MMA as implementing agency enhanced administrative efficiency given the
    Institute's legal status and its strong financial management skills. Where possible, these arrangements
    whereby resource execution is governed by private law but their use is decided upon with public
    authorities should be employed. However, in seeking efficiency, correspondence between project
    objectives and institutional functions should be ensured. IAvHs role within the SINA is to provide
    knowledge-based outputs to inform decision making, especially by the MMA as head of the SINA and
    responsible for defining the country's environmental policy. The research-oriented nature of the IAvH
    may have influenced a project design favoring outputs, segmenting implementation and overlooking
    political marketing of results to key institutional stakeholders to focus instead on comprehensive, quality
    assessments of study objects. However, Bank teams and project designs must ensure that policy makers
    are held accountable for interventions which seek to mainstream biodiversity considerations in
    productive landscapes and sectors. UAESPNN's adoption and regular use of methodologies developed
    under component 1, including its budget allocations to continue activities in the 6 National Natural Parks
    targeted by the project, illustrate how in spite of administrative inefficiencies and slow learning curves
    inherent to most public authorities, investing in their direct execution of project activities can result in
    long-term adoption of project outcomes.
c. Results-framework and M&E schemes critically affect output-outcome and component linkages ­
    few and synthetic indicators focusing on how outputs lead up to desired outcomes help overcome
    segmented approaches to project implementation. As a first generation GEF project seeking to promote
    public and private conservation and sustainable use efforts in the Colombian Andes, including
    mainstreaming biodiversity considerations in sectoral practices and policies, the design of a useful M&E
    framework proved to be a challenge that was not surmounted.
d. Donor coordination ­ coordinated donor investments and actions, in particular under a programmatic
    approach, should be actively sought to help strengthen the impact of single interventions.
e. Adequate risk assessment and sustainability mechanisms ­ the risks identified during preparation
    should be closely screened and candidly evaluated, so as to ensure that project implementation focuses


                                                        22

    on developing adequate mitigation measures and sustainability mechanisms from the start, if deficient.
    This was the case for a fundraising unit in the PCU which was never developed and the self-financing
    mechanisms each component would attempt to put in place which were not monitored, among other risk
    mitigation and sustainability measures included in project design which proved insufficient. Midterm
    review provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the project's
    sustainability strategy, which should include:
       i. Building community-based ownership ­ documenting processes throughout project implementation
          helps increase their continuity under changing institutional conditions, including staff turnover
          affecting partner support. However, gathered information must be disseminated in forms
          comprehensible to different audiences to build an understanding of the project's objectives and
          expected outcomes. Yet, since dissemination is not enough to warrant adoption and use, field
          training and visits to successful sites are key to ensure community-based ownership. This strategy
          proved successful in turning local actors into advocates of land management tools and conservation
          incentives, once their benefits were evident. Therefore, project design should allocate sufficient
          resources for this type of support-building strategies. It is in this manner that civil society can be
          empowered to press for the continuity of successful institutional actions.
      ii. Developing institutional alliances and engagement ­ in addition to community-based ownership,
          institutional commitment to project objectives and results is critical for sustainability. Enough time
          should be invested in building alliances with management and technical staff in key partner
          institutions, through their active involvement in preparation and execution and the provision of
          sufficient training given slow learning curves. This is successfully illustrated by UAESPNN's
          incorporation of project results, compared to other authorities less involved in activity
          implementation and now less committed to their continuation.
f. Linking biodiversity knowledge production with conservation and sustainable use practices
    requires a different phased approach ­ a more effective phased approach to increase biodiversity
    knowledge, conservation and sustainable use implies separating stages and even operations for the
    implementation of activities aimed at each. In this manner, initial stages should focus on generating
    knowledge to design and pilot tools to enhance public and private conservation and sustainable use
    practices. Knowledge gained in such a first phase would provide solid M&E evidence for a second phase
    scaling-up. Implementing these activities in parallel, as was the case for the project under review, scatters
    efforts with little impact; opportunities for sustainability such as allowing more/separate time and
    resources for results marketing and adoption by key actors are missed.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Project Conservation Zones and Protected Areas
This component addressed the need to develop an integrated National Protected Areas System (NPAS) with a variety of
protection categories at regional and local levels, and tested key elements of this government strategy in targeted
protected areas. It financed technical studies presented by the IAvH as input to strengthen the legal framework for the
National Protected Areas System28, contributed to the participatory design and implementation of management plans for
6 selected National Natural Parks and enabled active participation by the IAvH in efforts to consolidate Regional
Protected Areas Systems and declare new protected areas, including private reserves and community-based initiatives.

28 Although not included as a Key Performance Indicator, important outputs under this component were legal studies on regional categories of PA, including
forest reserves created by previous legislation, and technical studies to identify conservation gaps in the National Parks System and assess the effectiveness of
conservation strategies in regional protected areas. These were inputs for UAESPNN's ongoing efforts to issue regulations on the National Protected Areas
System to remedy current legal gaps.
29Indicators 1-3 in the project's logical framework (1. 100% of the ecosystem types represented in the Protected Areas System, 2. Increased conservation,
knowledge and Andes representing the APAS, and 3. Adoption of biodiversity friendly guidelines) were set to measure achievement of GEO independently
from components and were monitored in the Implementation Status Reports (see Section F, Indicator 1).
30The regional networks supported include:
1.     Northeastern páramos, First Phase Conservation Zone 1 ­ technical support was provided to formulate the 10 year Action Plan for the Regional Protected
       Area System promoted by the CARs and regional governments sharing jurisdiction over the area, including the completion of a baseline for existing
       biophysical information. The establishment of a biological corridor between the National Parks of Tamá, Cocuy and Pisba was supported under this
       component.
2.     Alto Putumayo, First Phase Conservation Zone 2 ­ geographical, ecological and socioeconomic studies helping to identify conservation objects were
       financed, as well as legal support for the design of a regional network with new PAs including a National Park to be declared in 2008 (see footnote below).
       26 indigenous territories in Putumayo were supported to title and expand their land in the Ukumari Kankhe and Sibundoy Valley.
3.     Valle del Cauca network in First Phase Conservation Zone 3 ­ technical support was provided to consolidate the Regional Protected Area System
       promoted by the CAR holding jurisdiction over the area, and to formulate the Department's Biodiversity Action Plan together with regional universities,
       local NGOs, WWF and UAESPNN.
4.     Altiplano cundiboyacense, First Phase Conservation Zone 4 ­ CARs and other organizations working in the area were supported to develop biophysical
       and socioeconomic assessment tools to prioritize conservations areas, including actions in key wetlands. A strong institutional network was not
       consolidated as in other areas.
5.     Eje Cafetero network in First Phase Conservation Zone 5 ­ the establishment and advertisement of the Regional Protected Area System comprising the
       Nevados National Park was supported through focal species population studies to define conservation priorities for the declaration of new PA, biotic
       assessments in 3 natural parks (Campoalegre, Tatamá and Otún-Quimbaya), legal and technical assessment regarding the creation and categorization of
       new PA. IAvH also participated in the formulation of its action plan.
6.     Huila network, partially covered by Second Phase Conservation Zone 5 ­ at the request of the corresponding CAR, this component supported the design
       of a Regional Protected Area System and undertook biophysical assessments to assist priority site selection.
31The declaration of one National Natural Park, the Orito-Ingi Ande in Alto Putumayo supported by the project and its partners in the area (WWF and municipal
and indigenous authorities) was approved by GoC in June 2008. In addition, 2 Regional protected areas were established in project zones (Regional Park
Barbas-Bremen and the Berlin Integrated Management District, plus 1 regional PA declaration outside project zones (DMI Alicante) supported by the project
for its declaration of an AICA.
32Biological assessments and management plans were developed for private reserves with project support, including enhancing their capacities in ecotourism-
related services.
33Original target included ecosystems in the 9 WWF/WB ecoregions identified as overlapping with the Andes as defined for this project. Actual target is
calculated for the 7 ecoregions targeted for intervention after midterm review, coinciding with First Phase Conservation Zones.

Component 2: Andean region use of biodiversity in rural landscapes
This component promoted biodiversity conservation and sustainable use in rural landscapes in the Colombian Andes by
identifying conservation opportunities in selected sites and piloting tools and incentives to encourage private
involvement in their achievement. Assessments financed by this component on the state of biodiversity in rural
settings34 allowed for the selection of intervention areas with high conservation values and socioeconomic feasibility. A
set of management tools were tested and disseminated, and legal and technical options to trigger private conservation
efforts studied ­ some effectively implemented including a biotrade program to market biodiversity goods and services
and finance eligible initiatives. Table 2 shows relevant outputs achieved compared to those committed in the original
project design or as adjusted during its implementation (see Sections 1.3 and 2.3).

344 Andean production systems were assessed in 9 rural landscapes; biodiversity use and management practices were characterized; threatened species were
identified and listed in Red Books; traditional biodiversity uses were inventoried and systematically organized for dissemination; agricultural biodiversity
opportunities were assessed in each Andean mountain range, among other assessments sponsored by this component.
35Management tools applied with regional and local partners included: biological corridors, live & mixed hedgerows, agroforestry systems, multipurpose
forests, enclosed and enriched forest remnants, and management plans for threatened species. Complementary tools included: 7 nurseries specializing in native
species, protein banks and local use agreements (see below). A participatory communications strategy facilitated negotiations with private landowners and
resulted in agreements and contracts signed for tool implementation. The project's main nursery in Filandia fostered 2,100,000 plants pertaining to 101
botanical families, 236 genera and 498 species, 358 of which were trees and 147 endangered species.
36The strategy included: community training in the establishment of nurseries with high Andean species; workshops on environmental education; fieldtrips with
communities and authorities to sites successfully applying tools; and valuation of cultural biodiversity uses and traditional knowledge to include species of
interest to landowners and communities. Mainly the people of Carmen de Carupa, Chíquiza, Filandia and Villa de Leyva benefited from training and
community newsletters. Learning materials and their protocols were prepared and applied, including a scale model for landscape and watershed interpretation in
Cane-Iguaque and Fúquene.
37 Incentives included: silvopastoral systems for cattle ranching and organic fertilizers for potato cropping conversion; property tax exemptions ­ applied as of
2005 in 101 farms in the municipality of Filandia implementing biodiversity-friendly management tools; payments for environmental services ­ in place in
Chaina watershed (buffer zone of National Park Iguaque) where 4,500 downstream water users pay a regular fee through their monthly water bills to upstream
landowners applying conservation tools. These incentives were presented to Andean CARs and the MAVDT.
38A biotrade program was set up with 3 lines: market research, business-oriented capacity-building and a web-based service platform. Under its research line,
23 products were assessed and 5 value-chains prioritized (natural ingredients for the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food industries; tropical ornamental plants;
native fruits; fibers and seeds for crafts; and ecotourism); 90 companies were supported in their business plan formulation; and 1,256 commercial partners have
registered in the program's databases by December 2007. The biotrade observatory (OBIO) has nearly 8,500 visitors per month, 43% of which entrepreneurs,
36% researchers and 21% students.
39Agreements for sustainable resource use signed with local communities include: 1. Bejuco artisans in Quindío; 2. Cofan indigenous peoples in the Ukumare-
Kankhe resguardo (medicinal and useful flora); 3. Fúquene fisherfolk and artisans (fish and wetland flora); 4. Communities in Salento (medicinal flora); 5.
Indigenous artisans in Caldas (native seeds and fibers); 6. Afrocolombian communities in Valle del Cauca (useful flora and fauna, wild and cultivated); 7.
Peasant communities in San Fernando, Pasto, Nariño (hedgerow flora); 8. Peasant communities and potters in Villa de Leyva and Ráquira, Boyacá (useful and
hedgerow flora); 9. Peasant communities in Chambery, Caldas (useful and hedgerow flora); 10. Peasant communities in Nima, Valle del Cauca (useful and
hedgerow flora). 11. Peasant farmers in Garagoa, Boyacá (agrobiodiversity).

   Component 3: Knowledge base for decision making, monitoring and evaluation
   This component strengthened institutional abilities to collect, expand, organize and disseminate information on the
   Andean biodiversity through: i) biodiversity assessments and related training to research partners, ii) the organization of
   a Biodiversity Information System, and iii) a state-pressure-response indicator system. Efforts towards systematic data
   gathering and monitoring were complemented by a dissemination and public awareness campaign to different audiences.

   42Previous land cover map of the Andean region (Etter 1998) used a 1:1,500,000 scale that resulted in less ecosystems identified for country and the Andes.
   2000 and 2005 updates identified 141 additional ecosystems using a 1:250,000 scale.
   43Data collected and linked to municipal data and maps was initially published as a book, INFORMAR Andes, and sent to 14 CARs; the application is now
   available online for authorized researchers. Using the indicator system, priority conservation areas were identified for the area under Cundinamarca's CAR
   jurisdiction, the Corredor de Robles (Eastern Andean chain) and the coffee-growing areas. Synthetic indicators were produced for the Andean region with the
   National Program for Human Development and a multitemporal analysis (1985-2005) was carried out to analyze changes in sub-Andean forest fragments and
   their relation with human activity.
   44In total, 50 biodiversity databases were linked to the System and 171 organizations contributed information by December 2007. 7 information products are
   available: 1) Colombian Species catalogue, 2) Electronic biota, 3) Biodiversity in numbers; 4) Biodiversity knowledge indicators, 5) Simple information
   resource search tool, 6) Information service for species with commercial potential, and 7) Yoscua local biodiversity uses and knowledge.
   45As described in Section 1.3, four original indicators (Promotional material for practices and management tools for biodiversity conservation in rural
   landscapes produced; Active internet WebPages, electronic publication and newsletters addressed to decision-makers, scientists and general public; 30 articles
   published in national news media; and 4 Andean biodiversity field guides published) were aggregated into this single formulation.
   46Following midterm review recommendations, Second Phase communications strategy concentrated on disseminating project results to different audiences and
   implementing a specific communication-education campaign with rural participants to increase management tool appropriation (see Table 2 above). The mass
   communications campaign included 12 products/tools: biological group exhibits (1 on toucans; 1 on birds of prey; 1 on birds in Oxford, 1 itinerary biodiversity
   trailer exhibited in botanical gardens, zoos, parks and other public spaces); IAvH showings; an eco-store with promotional material operating; and 9 published
   communication products from the different project components, aimed at the general public, children or specialized audiences ­ 88 books, 5 bird song guides,
   66 brochures, 10 banners, 7 posters, 2 ecotourism maps, 37 webpages & electronic newsletters, 23 thematic videos and 45 videoclips, 15 of which regularly
   broadcasted on national TV.
   47Two original indicators (Biodiversity information kits distributed amongst 1,000 schools in project zones & 100 schools trained for the design and
   implementation of schoolyard ecology projects) were aggregated and replaced following midterm review recommendations to shift focus from school ecology
   to formal and non-formal environmental education in support of other components, in particular to reinforce the implementation of land management tools in
   rural landscapes.
   48First phase outputs included 50 environmental school projects in Antioquia and Quindío applying biodiversity-related considerations. It involved working
   with existing inter-institutional committees for environmental education, namely the Bogota chapter, to promote biodiversity-oriented curricula and training
   teachers. 303 school and college teachers participated in 6 workshops and field visits. The environmental education strategy was published on CD and website

4943 policy adjustments proposed for the mining & energy (8), transport (3) and agricultural (24) sectors, 20 of which were adopted mainly for agriculture; 8
proposals had a general, non-sectoral application. Policy instruments for which technical input was provided included: the 2002-2006 and 2006-2010 National
Development Plans, the policy-guiding document "Colombia Visión 2019" and 6 bills passed to Congress (on páramos, forests, water resources, fuel alcohol,
the Rural Development Statute, among others). A national agrobiodiversity program was designed; guidelines for the inclusion of biodiversity in municipal
territorial planning were published with the National Institute on Geography.
50Policy adjustments and early warning system were presented in sectoral committees (mining & energy, transport & infrastructure and agricultural committees),
as well as other project results were presented in technical meetings and studies groups in corresponding entities.
51Original indicator No. 40 (after MTR adjustments No. 36) `Effective operation of project office' is discussed in Annex 3.
52Related outputs included: commercial policies in the agricultural sector reviewed ex ante for their impacts on biodiversity and methodology for the inclusion
of biodiversity criteria in Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) designed and applied with the MMA in the liquid fuels SEA.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Based on the incremental cost analysis undertaken for project preparation, the following can be said about
the global benefits achieved under the GEF Alternative, as indicated in the PAD, Annex 4:

Project Conservation Zones and Protected Areas
7 indicators included in the project's logical framework for component 1 aimed at promoting the
consolidation of the Colombian National Protected Areas System have been met, as adjusted by MTR when
project was downsized to consolidate activities in First Phase conservation zones and adjust to IAvH's nature.
Moreover, the amount of private reserves consolidated by the project doubled what was estimated at
appraisal for the GEF alternative and a higher ecosystem representation rate was achieved for the ecoregions
finally intervened, enhancing the sustainable conservation of remaining natural habitats in the Andes,
identified as one of the project's main global incremental benefits. This was done with less GEF resources
than initially estimated (US$ 12.53 million were calculated at appraisal for this component, while at closing,
actual costs amounted to US$9.38 million), mainly due to project downsize but also to the budget increase
the UAESPNN was able to negotiate with the National Planning Department and the Ministries of Finance
and Environment (between 2006 and 2007, the Unit was allocated 21.8% more resources to invest in the
National Protected Areas System53). In this regard, the project was more efficient than expected to obtain the
incremental benefits anticipated.

Andean Region Use of Biodiversity in Rural Landscapes
The 10 indicators included in the project's logical framework (as adjusted by MTR) for Component 2 have
been met. Conservation opportunities in transformed landscapes were assessed and management tools as well
as institutional/economic incentives for biodiversity conservation in rural landscapes were piloted, using less
GEF resources than estimated at appraisal. Actual costs financed by the GEF were US$0.13 million less than
initially calculated (from an estimate of US$4.3 to US$4.17 million), mainly due to a nearly 224% increase
in counterpart financing under this component and project downsize. In addition, the small grant fund
established to promote biodiversity-friendly activities leveraged US$4.66 million from national and
international sources for its sustainable financing after project completion.

Knowledge base for decision making, monitoring and evaluation
The 12 indicators included in the project's logical framework (as adjusted by MTR) for Component 3 have
been met, with those regarding training and linked databases surpassed, contributing to achieve the
anticipated incremental benefits regarding capacity-building and expanded scientific knowledge base. The
Biodiversity Information System registered 6,600 monthly visits by December 2007, and the state-pressure-
response indicator system received 3.655 visits between March 2007 and January 2008, enhancing
information dissemination and accessibility. These results were also possible with US$0.11 million less GEF
resources and a 22.8% increase in counterpart funding.

Intersectoral coordination
The 3 indicators included in the project's logical framework (as adjusted by MTR) for Component 4 have
been met, although as discussed in section 3, intersectoral coordination to address the root causes of
biodiversity loss was not adopted as a regular practice, and the incremental benefits assessed at appraisal
regarding the replication of experience gained throughout the Andes region and increased awareness of
environmental issues, were not achieved. Although GEF resources were slightly increased to finance this




53Although not attributable to the project, worth noting is the increase in resources allocated to the UAESPNN by the central
government, due to its improved institutional and administrative capacities to execute resources and the Dutch negotiations with the
MAVDT to strengthen the Unit's personnel and operational budget. In addition, worth noting is the reduction in deforestation rates in
Colombia as registered in the World Development indicators 2007, which went down from 150,000-250,000 hectares per year as
estimated at appraisal, to less than 101,000 hectares per year.


                                                                29

component (from an estimated US$0.50 to an actual US$0.51 million), total spending was actually reduced
by an approximate 13% (from an estimated US$0.86 to an actual US$0.75 million).

Project management
The indicator set out to measure progress under Component 5 (Effective operation of project office) was
achieved, insofar as it enabled a satisfactory implementing agency performance, as assessed in section 5.
However, actual costs for project management increased by 50%, with US$ 0.19 million additional GEF
resources employed to finance staff, office costs and other administrative costs, including annual audits. As
for the project disbursement performance, an indication of reduced efficiency was the continuous lag
between expected and actual disbursements throughout its implementation mainly due to administrative
inefficiencies described in Section 2 for Component 1 execution. Mitigation measures to streamline
administrative procedures enabled full grant disbursement, but several planned activities in National Natural
Parks for 2007 were cut back (namely, activities included in Park management plans regarding visitor
carrying capacity studies and septic pit and power plant installations that did not compromise project goals).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Key stakeholders and focal groups' interviews

Methodology
A qualitative and participative methodology was applied, in which an exploration of stakeholder's views about the
project was made towards identifying the situation before and after the project, the lessons learned, as well as
difficulties encountered and recommendations; and steps followed since its inception. Semi-structured interviews were
made with key stakeholders and with focal groups. Based on these data, comparative analyses are carried on, trends are
recognized and a synthesis is obtained. Participants in focal groups included local landowners and governmental staff in
two of the main areas of action, a group of environmental authorities at the regional level, and the technical staff of the
implementing institution. Key stakeholders interviewed were all six National Parks Chiefs and a representative from the
regional management office; also, local inhabitants, municipal authorities and staff, NGOs, private enterprises, local
teachers and artisans.

Results of key stakeholders interviews
National Parks Authority participants reviewed aspects of implementation, concluding the following:
In the institutional arrangement for the project's development, functions assigned in technical issues should have been
the responsibility of the central parks authority since the inception of the project. Strengthening in administrative
capacities both in each Park and in the central unit is crucial for the timely completion of paperwork so that field
activities can be accomplished satisfactorily. The GIS tools applied during the project for map updating, along with the
boundary stones built, were critical for parks delimitation, giving much needed consistence with zoning proposals made
by the regional autonomous corporations and municipalities and allowing for conflict resolution with them and
landowners. A positive strategy for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in or around the Park areas is to
link activities such as ecological restoration, watershed management plans and sustainable practices in productive
systems to communities inhabiting the area. Relations between civil society and institutions collaborating towards these
goals will be beneficial for every agent implied. Well-known methodologies applied to planning and monitoring,
allowed for a strengthening of technical capacity, reflected in the systematic structure of management plans and yearly
operation plans. Participation by the Park's chiefs and staff in the management plan construction granted a fine-tuned
diagnosis and the appropriation of actions proposed. After the mid-term review, procuring the effectiveness of
conservation, actions were concentrated identifying four strategic lines of action: research and monitoring, restoration,
GIS tools and watershed management plans.

In the participatory design of conservation areas, main issues were recognized:
Effective participation processes, including both planning agreements and the financial support needed for attaining
proposed actions, are significant for success. The quality of information on biodiversity, as well as good cartography is
the basis for the advancement of decision making regarding conservation areas. In regional processes, the exchange of
information is crucial, and this was obtained with the establishment of a regional node of the Biodiversity Information
System. There has been a slow development of national guidelines on conservation categories, giving way to myriad
denominations according to the local or regional authorities promoting their creation. This situation is difficult for an
organized management at the regional level, complicated by the fact that no cartography is available at this scale. In a
regional coordination stance, scarce or uneven information and dynamics of conservation areas is the rule; this should
not hinder conservation efforts but rather open participation to allow this development at their own pace. Municipalities
are open to conservation efforts, despite some technical deficiency.

The relationship with the network of civil society protected areas was successful in attaining not only the project's
targets but also additional accomplishments. Thus, 81 new reserves were created, and in this process, characterization
advanced, management plans were made and began their implementation. Strengthening was also for decentralized
management by regional nodes and their participation in conservation areas design roundtables (SIRAP). Concerning
landscape management tools, the network now applies concepts and practice to their own reserves; the network also
helped with some technical exchange tours for landowners and institutions, designing educational materials for this
purpose.

Conservation at the species level was especially encouraged by the management plans of endangered or flagship species,
and by the red books collection, which assembled a substantial number of experts and academic institutions. These
published materials were used by regional autonomous corporations and other authorities for controlling and promoting
conservation of these endangered species.

Individual perspectives from several local stakeholders were oriented more towards the landscape management tools
strategy, with which they had been closely acquainted. Although technical terms were not necessarily incorporated in
their daily life, there was a general curiosity about advances in characterizations and especially its significance in terms
of biodiversity richness, for regional pride. This was sometimes reflected in the local school teachers who changed their
activities to include "biodiversity days" in which school children would plant trees in biological corridors, and to adopt
these corridors in monthly walks with children. Municipal officials in charge of environmental matters had been used to
reforestation programs, where small trees were planted at low densities, implying high maintenance costs over three or
more years. The new technique proposed, based on the recovery of bigger seedlings for planting at high densities,
allowed rapid tree growth and thus instant credibility at every level. Implementation of biological corridors and other
management tools was deemed successful by donors, local population, local or regional environmental authorities,
academic institutions and others. Still, some weakness was perceived in the strengthening of local capacity, which
would enable to continue this actions as the project is finished.

Results of focal groups interviews
The municipality of Filandia, located in the central Andean chain, was important for conservation because two large
forest areas with high biodiversity value were in this area. Biodiversity characterizations permitted identification of
negative effects caused by forest fragmentation, and later in, showed the way for outlining biological corridors and other
management tools adapted to the cattle ranching productive system common in this area. The native tree nursery,
especially created for the purpose of obtaining good quality and a wide variety of native tree species (498), was the core
of the management tools. Support from the municipality to this endeavor also allowed regional recognition for
environmental protection, attracting ecotourism and developing local guide capacity.

Further north, the Chambery watershed area had a different landscape configuration, with smaller properties, high
transformation and forest fragmentation. There, characterizations showed high biodiversity values in riverine forests,
indicating the direction of management tools implementation by connecting small forest patches and riverine areas
mainly with hedgerows, silvicultural and agroforestry arrangements, and forest enrichment. Landowners learned to read
the landscape configuration including and beyond their property. Before, hedgerows were just property demarcations
and forest patches were useless nuisance. After the project, people talked easily about connections in the landscape,
hedgerows establishing bridges for the protection of native animals. The motto "making conservation productive" was
thoroughly appropriated by local inhabitants owing to teamwork forged with the technical assistants. Exchange tours
between the implementation areas were instrumental for comprehension of this initiative, removal of barriers and
skeptical positions and their adoption by landowners as a useful tool. The communications strategy applied both at the
beginning of the project and later on, for exchange tours and diffusion on a national scale had to adapt different tools for
each scale, including written, graphic and audiovisual materials. Biodiversity values were made evident and
sustainability assured.

Staff implementing the project at Instituto Humboldt stressed the fact that technical basis for action is important, but
local and regional participation can enhance results. Some directors of regional institutions were supportive of the
project's objectives, while others openly admitted not having any interest in them, weakening institutional relations
regarding the appointed goals. When supporting regional processes, there was a substantial effort to adapt to local or
regional dynamics, but some obstacles were not surmounted, due to political stances affected by some of the project's
targets. This situation implied searching for alternatives which not always complied with all technical definitions and
restrictions, such as finding second choices for protected area declarations. The National Parks Authority was in charge
of implementing the management plans for the six andean parks, a target which met with substantial delays and
hindrance. Difficulties arose because in the project design the implementing agency (Instituto Humboldt) was the sole


                                                             34

responsible for completion of the project's objectives and targets, thus assigning a technical role to the coordinating
office. To avoid further strain, during the second phase of the project this technical responsibility changed, giving way
to a steering committee.

An ecosystem approach and adaptive management concepts should be more actively involved in project implementation.
Also, some provision has to be made towards establishing a firm basis for sustainability of actions. A fundamental
achievement of the project has been the methodological developments made in every component, such as in biodiversity
inventories, where a manual was devised and an active capacity building program was applied while carrying out field
characterizations. Standardized procedures are instrumental for diffusion of knowledge. Valuable information has been
organized and disseminated by complementary actions: a decentralized information system devised for the free
exchange of data on biodiversity and publishing available information on native species in the field guide collection.
These goals were attained with the cooperation of academic institutions and other research groups, national and
international.

Administrative rules deriving from the operation manual were applied, with some complications arising from the
learning process necessary for compliance in the part of every person involved, both on the technical or administrative
staff. Nevertheless, institutional strengthening was acquired and procedures are currently applied.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Methodology
The methodology for assessing stakeholder's perspectives about the project had a double approach, one on a regional
basis, for those components directed towards the whole Andean region, and a complementary vision from local case
studies, where components developed particular actions in the selected zones of the project. A participatory research
strategy was applied, in which every type of stakeholder is included, without being exhaustive in terms of every
possible person or institution that had an interaction with the project. This strategy involved: a) discussion and analysis
of changes observed as a result of project implementation b) a complementary focus on the process necessary to achieve
results, and c) lessons learned.

Pre-designed open format questions were applied for each participant in the workshops, to obtain the following
information: a) general information about actions, dates, and participants b) results with a percentage of achievement,
difficulties encountered and sustainability of actions c) three main lessons learned in each process d) suggestions for
future projects based on the above e) stakeholder perception about the contribution of each action in three main lines:
knowledge, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. A collective discussion and deliberation followed, in
which conclusions were obtained.

All participants agreed on a high completion of the project's objectives, obtained with institutional and community
participation, which allows for a general sense of ownership of proposed goals and actions and thus, their sustainability.
An explanation for actions qualified as having a medium to low completion dwells on the necessity of further time to
consolidate certain processes, or on a slow diffusion of results to some groups of participants.
Workshop topics        Conclusions
Difficulties           1. Comprehension of objectives and community participation in the first stages of the project
                       2. Delays in field activities due to administrative procedures
                       3. Social and political unrest
                       4. Slow information processing resulting in delays in dissemination to stakeholders
                       5. Weak support from certain managers affecting local processes and possibly their continuation
                       6. Weather conditions constraining certain field actions
                       7. Environmental education strategy and other materials were received with considerable delay
Lessons learned        1. Participatory processes involving both institutions and persons in a learning-by-doing and
                       communications strategy with straightforward terms and actions resulted in high understanding
                       and appropriation
                       2. Coordinated institutional alliances were successful because they were based on mutual
                       respect, complementary actions and financial support, and mutual learning by technical
                       exchange
                       3. Local stakeholders, such as landowners and students, discovered biodiversity in their richness,
                       value and conservation possibilities
                       4. Project design should consider institutional competence to carry out project's objectives
                       5. To avoid double functions and staff, institutional strengthening can be obtained when the
                       project's administrative, legal and financial responsibilities are in charge of the current
                       institutional staff.
                       6. Rules and procedures established by the project were beneficial for institutional organization.
                       7. Technical advances obtained during project development were instrumental for
                       accomplishments in the institutional mission.
                       8. Establishing alliances with local and regional partners (governmental and NGOs) is an
                       effective strategy for success.
                       9. Social and cultural dimensions in dissemination, education and public conscience should be
                       more relevant both for project design and during implementation
Recommendations        1. Continue interdisciplinary actions carried out by different institutions
                       2. Consider longer periods for the monitoring and evaluation of actions in project design
                       3. Continue diffusion of results to a wider audience, implementing the communications strategy
                       4. Maintain institutional relations while inviting other participants

A high number of participants (42%) perceived the project's contribution to the knowledge, conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity as high, while a further 32% considered it was medium, whereas 19% and 2% considered
it was low or very low (5% did not answer). They reported that knowledge on biodiversity increased both for scientists
and the general public, but assessed this endeavor as low because this inventory is far from being completed due to this
country's high biodiversity. Clear methodologies for conservation objectives in protected areas or rural landscapes,
linked to a change in local attitudes, were deemed crucial for a high grading in the project's contribution; medium
grades referred to the requirement of environmental education to consolidate conservation processes; a low assessment
implied that further work is needed to create more effective incentives and new areas to be declared for conservation.
The project's contribution to sustainable use was highly recognized in relation to participative local processes in
traditional knowledge of species and in the creation of value-chains for the commercial exploitation of biodiversity. As
further time is needed to consolidate value-chain processes, this was considered a medium grade, whereas a low
contribution was assigned to the development of guidelines for sustainable use and management.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Instituto de Investigación de Recursos Biológicos Alexander von Humboldt was designated as executing
agency for the Project "Conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Colombian Andes", being the
institution assigned by the Ministry of the Environment for all matters related to biodiversity according to the
Convention of Biological Diversity signed by Colombia.

The Ministry of the Environment appointed the Instituto Humboldt as project designer in 1998, in
compliance with the ratification and implementation of the Convention of Biological Diversity that had
begun in 1994. A group of researchers and institutions was assembled, with previous knowledge and studies
in the Andean region; this allowed bringing relevant experience for structuring the project, and selecting
main areas.

At the time of appraisal, the Instituto Humboldt gave its pledge to an important challenge for the
environmental sector as a whole, that is, making biodiversity a household concept and highlighting its
importance for a country rich in natural regions; also, stressing the special treatment for the Andes region,
which required emergency measures on account of its population being concentrated in this area, causing
rapid transformation of natural landscapes. Besides the environmental sector, other productive sectors were
concerned: mining and energy, agriculture and transport were the main forces driving change, especially
around main cities or in vulnerable mountain areas such as the "páramos". In this respect, the project was
innovative by widening the range of actions taken in order to enhance protection and sustainable use of
biodiversity. Many of the organizations and professionals thus summoned will no longer be able to ignore the
environmental costs of production, or the advantages and benefits derived from the goods and services
provided by biodiversity.

General lessons learned

The overall experience of the project regarding biodiversity issues is that scientific assessments and
methodological developments can be effectively combined with social, cultural, political and economic
aspects in order to achieve beneficial changes in the landscape, both in protected areas declaration and
management, as well as in conservation and sustainable use in rural areas by committed organizations and
people, which have to be mobilized.

Many former studies had focused on detailed scientific observations which laid the ground for this more
action-oriented project. In order to achieve the expected results, it was necessary to keep the rigorous aspect
of scientific data and analyses, but it was essential to include innovative methodologies adjusted to the
conditions observed in rural areas, such as the relative importance of cattle ranching, coffee-growing and
mixed cropping found in the Colombian Andean region. In each of these productive systems, management
tools were designed and implemented with highly satisfactory results and replicas. Nonetheless, besides the
outstanding documentary and actual evidence of the outputs by component, there is a still incipiently
measured outcome which in the near future should bear fruit: capacity­building activities were widespread
and involved a great number of persons and organizations operating in the local and regional levels. This
endeavor involved the dissemination of biodiversity concepts, as well as methodologies developed over the
course of the project, many of which were structured or adjusted with partners, enhancing appropriation. The
technical staff realized early in the project that in order to widen the general population's acquaintance with
biodiversity and the incorporation of management tools in everyday practice, there should be a dissemination
of the proposed actions by multiple ways. This was reflected in the communications strategy and in
workshops, seminars, field visits, congresses, tutoring and assistance with teachers and other interested
parties.




                                                        38

The political context for the environmental sector changed from the time of appraisal and through the
execution of the project, mainly reflected in the loss of political relevance by the environmental sector, at the
expense of housing and regional development issues assigned to a Ministry formerly in charge only of
environmental aspects. Thus, the project's initial design was more ambitious in its involvement of a strong
environmental sector which would adopt many of the project's results and engage other ministries and
sectors towards biodiversity conservation.

The Instituto Humboldt's performance

Effect indicators were designed for the project, in order to summarize the main accomplishments regarding
general thematic areas. Thus it was established that 9,8 million hectares had conservation scenarios designed
in a participative way within the protected areas component, which amounts to the 34,4% of the Andean
region. 88,134 hectares were declared as new protected areas, both by official entities (80,444 ha) and by
civil society organizations (7.690). Moreover, 464,539 hectares belonged to Park areas for which
management plans were designed and implemented in the six National Parks selected for the project. The
management tools applied in rural landscapes were established in 332 hectares and 239.6 km, enabling the
connection of 4,025 hectares of forest remnants. As stated above, considerable attention was given to
capacity building activities in which 17,929 persons and 1,850 organizations participated, mostly in themes
related to rural landscapes, such as design and implementation of management tools, sustainable use of
biodiversity, biotrade, incentive measures, biodiversity characterizations and threatened species management
plans. The knowledge base was considerably expanded, which is recorded in 947 main products including
books, software developments, technical documents, audio and video records, and maps. The Information
System on Biodiversity has been instrumental to compile and link 171 organizations which contribute and
manage information on biodiversity. Regarding the intersectoral coordination, 43 policy papers or documents
were designed and 50% have been included in some plan, program, and policy paper or sector guidelines.
The evaluations at the end of the project have been satisfactory in terms of the Institute Humboldt's
performance to achieve the above results.

Component 1: Andean protected area system more representative, viable and effective.

The determining factors under the protected areas component were: sound ecological basis for defining and
designing conservation options; a participation strategy with local populations and their willpower for
conservation actions; institutional arrangements respecting competence and enhancing individual abilities for
complementary performance; and full conscience by institutions or projects that process dynamics will vary
according to local conditions and cannot be forced. Representation of ecosystem types per eco-region in the
protected system was increased by including local, regional and national areas in different conservation
schemes, private and official. Private conservation initiatives were pioneering, as an essential and
complementary strategy for regional conservation initiatives. New areas were created, regional nodes
strengthened, characterizations carried out, management plans designed and implemented and capacity
enhanced towards ecotourism development for this network's sustainability.

Component 2: Conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in rural landscapes

The high degree of transformation in the Andean region required visible tools established in the landscape,
which unlocked previous skeptical positions and enabled a smoother process with stakeholders.
Environmental education, biodiversity use co-management, incentive measures design and biotrade support
activities were pivotal for acceptance and integration of the proposed strategy. Committed participation was
contrived with the appointment of regional coordinators and an institutional roundtable for future projection
of actions.

Component 3: Knowledge base of biodiversity expanded, organized for decision making, evaluation of
impacts and disseminated to stakeholders

This component sought to complement base lines while strengthening capacity in the Institute and partner
organizations. Capacity building was a good strategy for strong institutional alliances during project
execution and for a substantial advance in the national biodiversity inventory. The knowledge base was
complemented by an indicator system coupled with spatial analyses, which has shown its power for policy
action proposals, with further promise for biogeographical analyses. A network of databases was also created
to compile previously dispersed or unavailable information, to enhance effective decision-making.

According to regional conditions and project implementation requirements, the communications strategy
involved the media, institutional or community stakeholders, focused on local and regional diffusion,
emphasizing results on webpages, newspapers, bulletins, radio, television, books and other media. Despite
somewhat short budget assignments for the original dissemination goal, the Humboldt Institute effectively
spread biodiversity themes in the general public, mainly through a national television campaign launched
with the Ministry of the Environment.

Component 4: Intersectoral coordination.

Considerable vigor was brought into play in order to achieve proper diffusion and later on, engagement on
the many propositions contrived. The flow of information, the discussions with several groups of
stakeholders according to their respective sectors or interests, the study groups, seminars and courses,
complemented by field visits, were instrumental to get a proper hold of themes and the respective
advancement in the relevant groups. All of these contributed to design policy papers coordinated with
pertinent agencies; regardless, this effort sometimes does not yield the expected fruit, as not every one of the
documents produced may have been incorporated and subsequently applied. This situation, however,
emphasizes that technical papers will need a stronger political support for their wide-ranging use.

Component 5: Project management and project monitoring
Constant supervision of activities and special attention given to its compliance with proposed objectives were
crucial throughout the implementation period. There was continuous follow-up also taking into account the
coherence between components as regards outcomes. The role played by the regional and local stakeholders,
on one part, and on the other, the World Bank and the Dutch Embassy staff, was significant to improve
performance while adapting to regional conditions and the project development, while still fulfilling the
proposed objectives. The technical proficiency brought by the Bank's experts in the missions enriched
discussions and redirected some areas without losing the projects' consistency.

The project's permanent follow-up was provided for by a system for planning, monitoring and evaluation,
designed and applied with the help of the planning office in the Humboldt Institute. In general, the simpler
the monitoring scheme the easier to concentrate on the project's activities development towards the desired
outcomes. Training for regional partners in these aspects was also crucial to obtain targets.

The project's M&E system design attempted an impact assessment that project design had not incorporated
in all its complexity and methodological aspects, including the fact that impact measurements are usually
accomplished after the execution has finished. Subsequently, many efforts were directed to comply with the
Bank's requirements, especially at midterm review, with the incorporation of 6 outcome indicators. The main
results have been included in the previous section on the Institute's performance.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The National Parks Administrative Unit
The General Director of UAESPNN has addressed the following letter to the project's TTL (original in
Spanish), officially translated as follows:

Bogota, D.C.

Mr.
JUAN PABLO RUIZ SOTO
Natural Resource Management Specialist
World Bank
Bogota

Dear Mr. Ruiz:

The implementation of the subcomponent of the GEF Andes project aimed at consolidating a more
representative, viable and effective National Protected Area System, which concentrated its efforts in the
national parks Iguaque Flora and Fauna Sanctuary, Otún-Quimbaya Flora and Fauna Sanctuary, Los
Nevados National Natural Park, Tama National Natural Park, Pisba National Natural Park, and El Cocuy
National Natural Park, allowed for significant progress in the definition of methodological aspects, capacity-
building and training of public officials in the formulation processes of protected area management plans,
which were replicated as useful tools in the entire national system.

Equally, said management plans allowed for the definition of strategic lines on issues such as research and
monitoring, ecological restoration, strengthening and structuring of a geographic information system, buffer
zone definition and demarcation, watershed zoning and management, and mitigation of threats and
pressures. The implementation of these strategic lines allowed the National Parks Unit to position itself
institutionally and socially in favor of an improved protected area management, in line with our national policy
on "Social participation in conservation".

The project's contribution to the improvement of infrastructure and the acquisition of supplies and equipment
was highly significant, which substantially improved the operative and logistic capacity of the areas, resulting
in enhanced management and increased institutional presence locally and regionally.

Finally, an important added-value worth mentioning is the project's impulse to learning and training
processes for protected area officials, with emphasis on administrative issues for the implementation of Bank
financed projects.

In summary, the contributions by the GEF Andes project meant an important administrative, technical and
political enhancement aimed at improving institutional capacities for the protection of high mountain
ecosystems in the country.

Sincerely,

Original signed by

The Embassy of the Government of Netherlands

The Dutch government has been co-financing the Andes project through two different activities for a 6
six year period. In accordance with the Paris Declaration, the project was an example of program
financing and coordination between the World Bank and the Dutch Embassy in Bogotá.

The products of the project have been evaluated in a very positive way, identifying quality and
innovation, but also with too much emphasis on simple project implementation and too little on
support and demand at the political level. The development of management tools for biodiversity
conservation in rural landscapes, inter-sectoral coordination, promotion of green markets and the
creation of a knowledge base for decision making are good examples of products with great quality
and innovation.

During 2007 the Dutch development cooperation decided to start sectoral support to the National
Development Plan and its environmental chapter. Results of the Andes project are being taken into
account in this support. The sectoral program is an effort to balance the political, institutional and
operational levels of the Dutch development cooperation.

1. Legal status                            The protected area is not gazetted

Does the protected area have legal status? The government has agreed that the protected area should be gazetted but the process has not yet begun


                                            The protected area is in the process of being gazetted but the process is still incomplete


Context                                    The protected area has been legally gazetted (or in the case of private reserves is owned by a trust or similar)           3


2. Protected area regulations              There are no mechanisms for controlling inappropriate land use and activities in the protected area


                                           Mechanisms for controlling inappropriate land use and activities in the protected area exist but there are major
Are inappropriate land uses and activities problems in implementing them effectively
(e.g. poaching) controlled?
Context                                     Mechanisms for controlling inappropriate land use and activities in the protected area exist but there are some
                                           problems in effectively implementing them                                                                                  2


                                            Mechanisms for controlling inappropriate land use and activities in the protected area exist and are being effectively
                                            implemented

3. Law
enforcement                                 The staff have no effective capacity/resources to enforce protected area legislation and regulations


Can staff enforce protected area rules well There are major deficiencies in staff capacity/resources to enforce protected area legislation and regulations (e.g. lack
enough?                                     of skills, no patrol budget)


Context                                    The staff have acceptable capacity/resources to enforce protected area legislation and regulations but some
                                           deficiencies remain                                                                                                        2


                                            The staff have excellent capacity/resources to enforce protected area legislation and Regulations

4. Protected area objectives                No firm objectives have been agreed for the protected area

Have objectives been agreed?                The protected area has agreed objectives, but is not managed according to these Objectives


Planning                                    The protected area has agreed objectives, but these are only partially implemented


                                            The protected area has agreed objectives and is managed to meet these objectives                                          3


5. Protected area design                    Inadequacies in design mean achieving the protected areas major management objectives of the protected area is
                                            impossible


                                           Inadequacies in design mean that achievement of major objectives are constrained to some extent
Does the protected area need enlarging,
corridors, etc., to meet its objectives?
                                            Design is not significantly constraining achievement of major objectives, but could be improved                           2

                                          A management plan is being prepared or has been prepared but is not being implemented
Is there a management plan and is it being
implemented?                              An approved management plan exists but it is only being partially implemented because of funding constraints or
                                          other problems                                                                                                              2

Planning                                  An approved management plan exists and is being implemented

Additional points                         The planning process allows adequate opportunity for key stakeholders to influence the management plan

                                          There is an established schedule and process for periodic review and updating of the management plan                        +2

Planning                                  The results of monitoring, research and evaluation are routinely incorporated into planning

                                          A regular work plan exists but activities are not monitored against the plan's targets
Is there an annual work plan?
                                          A regular work plan exists and actions are monitored against the plan's targets, but many activities are not completed


Planning/Outputs                          A regular work plan exists, actions are monitored against the plan's targets and most
                                          or all prescribed activities are completed                                                                                  3


9. Resource inventory                     There is little or no information available on the critical habitats, species and cultural values of the protected area

Do you have enough information to         Information on the critical habitats, species and cultural values of the protected area is not sufficient to support
manage the area?                          planning and decision making                                                                                                1


Context                                   Information on the critical habitats, species and cultural values of the protected area is sufficient for key areas of
                                          planning/decision making but the necessary survey work is not being maintained


                                          Information concerning on the critical habitats, species and cultural values of the protected area is sufficient to support
                                          planning and decision making and is being maintained

10. Research                              There is no survey or research work taking place in the protected area
Is there a programme of management-       There is some ad hoc survey and research work                                                                               2

                                             There is considerable survey and research work but it is not directed towards the needs of protected area
                                             management


Inputs                                       There is a comprehensive, integrated programme of survey and research work, which is relevant to management
                                             needs

11. Resource management                      Requirements for active management of critical ecosystems, species and cultural values have not been assessed

                                             Requirements for active management of critical ecosystems, species and cultural values are known but are not being
Is the protected area adequately managed addressed                                                                                                                 2

(e.g. for fire, invasive species, poaching)? Requirements for active management of critical ecosystems, species and cultural values are only being partially
                                             addressed

Process                                      Requirements for active management of critical ecosystems, species and cultural values are being substantially or
                                             fully addressed

12. Staff numbers                            There are no staff

Are there enough people employed to          Staff numbers are inadequate for critical management activities
manage the protected area?                   Staff numbers are below optimum level for critical management activities                                              2
Inputs                                       Staff numbers are adequate for the management needs of the site
13. Personnel management                     Problems with personnel management constrain the achievement of major management objectives

                                             Problems with personnel management partially constrain the achievement of major management objectives                 2
Is the staff managed well enough?
                                             Personnel management is adequate to the achievement of major management objectives but could be improved

Process                                      Personnel management is excellent and aids the achievement major management objectives

14. Staff training                           Staff are untrained

                                             Staff training and skills are low relative to the needs of the protected area                                         1
Is there enough training for staff?
                                             Staff training and skills are adequate, but could be further improved to fully achieve the objectives of management

Inputs/Process                               Staff training and skills are in tune with the management needs of the protected area, and with anticipated future
                                             needs

15. Current budget                           There is no budget for the protected area

                                             The available budget is inadequate for basic management needs and presents a serious constraint to the capacity to

      III. Management Practices Applied

      12.a. Within the scope and objectives of the project, please identify in the table below the management practices employed by
      project beneficiaries that integrate biodiversity considerations and the area of coverage of these management practices? Note:
      this could range from farmers applying organic agricultural practices, forest management agencies managing forests per Forest
      Stewardship Council (FSC) guidelines or other forest certification schemes, artisanal fisherfolk practicing sustainable fisheries
      management, or industries satisfying other similar agreed international standards, etc. An example is provided in the table
      below.

56Direct coverage refers to the area that is targeted by the project's site intervention. For example, a project may be mainstreaming biodiversity into
floodplain management in a pilot area of 1,000 hectares that is part of a much larger floodplain of 10,000 hectares.
57Using the example in footnote 5 above, the same project may, for example, "indirectly" cover or influence the remaining 9,000 hectares of the
floodplain through promoting learning exchanges and training at the project site as part of an awareness raising and capacity building strategy for the
rest of the floodplain. Please explain the basis for extrapolation of indirect coverage when completing this part of the table.

IV. Market Transformation and Mainstreaming Biodiversity
13. a. For those projects that have identified market transformation as a project objective, please describe the project's
ability to integrate biodiversity considerations into the mainstream economy by measuring the market changes to which the
project contributed.

The sectors and subsectors and measures of impact in the table below are illustrative examples, only. Please complete per the
objectives and specifics of the project.

 N.A.                     N.A.                          N.A.             N.A.               N.A.

13. b. Please also note which (if any) market changes were directly caused by the project.


                                                               58

    Market transformation was not a project objective, although inter-sectoral coordination was to be promoted to address root
    causes of biodiversity loss. This resulted in technical input provided to sector policy design and in training offered to public and
    private actors in the mining/energy, agriculture and transportation sectors. Regarding activities to mainstream biodiversity in
    rural landscapes, these were pilot experiences to test management tools and incentives, which did not pretend market impact.

    V. Improved Livelihoods


    14. For those projects that have identified improving the livelihoods of a beneficiary population based on sustainable use
    /harvesting as a project objective, please list the targets identified in the logframe and record progress at the mid-term and
    final evaluation. An example is provided in the table below

    VI. Project Replication Strategy

    15. a. Does the project specify budget, activities, and outputs for implementing the replication strategy? Yes___ No_X__

    As explained in the project's Information Completion Report No.74/2008, certain activities and outputs have set up
    arrangements to ensure their continuity after project completion (PA management plans; Biodiversity Information System;
    Biotrade fund). In addition, several methodologies have resulted from project implementation which will enable replication of
    activities such as PA management plan design and implementation; rapid biotrade product assessments; acceleration of natural
    forest succession through nurseries; biodiversity assessments and characterizations, etc.

    15. b. Is the replication strategy promoting incentive measures & instruments (e.g. trust funds, payments for environmental
    services, certification) within and beyond project boundaries?
    Yes_X__ No_ __

    If yes, please list the incentive measures or instruments being promoted:

    On a pilot scale, project promoted property tax exemptions in 1 municipality and payments for environmental services in 1
    watershed, which continue to operate after project completion. In additional, a national biotrade program set up to provide
    company, market and technology information support continues to operate, including a funding mechanism.

    Data is not available for project start or at midterm because these indicators were developed after midterm review and following
    MTR recommendations.

    II. Enabling Environment

    For those projects that have identified addressing policy, legislation, regulations, and their implementation as project
    objectives, please complete the following series of questions: 18a, 18b, 18c.

    The project sought to promote inter-sectoral coordination to address root causes of biodiversity loss in the Andes, and given the
    research-oriented nature of the lead Executing Agency, this would be accomplished through studies and training to relevant
    government agencies and private sector actors. A project component was designed to accomplish this objective and its outputs
    are related to technical input and training for sector policy adjustments. However, as discussed in the project's Information
    Completion Report No. 704/08, the use and enforcement of policy adjustment proposals was not monitored by the project.
    Therefore, the tables below were not completed at work program inclusion or at midterm review.

    15. d. Please complete this table at project closure for each sector that is a primary or a secondary focus of the project.

IX. Other Impacts

17. Please briefly summarize other impacts that the project has had on mainstreaming biodiversity that have not been recorded
above.

As described in the project's Implementation Completion Report, the Andes project is the first systematic and sustained effort of
the country's National Environmental System seeking to intervene and influence the design of policies, regulations, programs,
etc., of different economic sectors, and as such, it sets an example for the manner in which technical data can serve to inform
sector policy design. In addition, subject to the signature of cooperation agreements, the Executing Agency would provide
technical assistance to regional environmental authorities and other actors investing in protected area management and
conservation in rural landscapes, including the GEF-financed National Protected Area and Biodiversity Conservation Trust Fund,
which have expressed interest in such support to replicate tools and incentives to mainstream biodiversity in
productive/transformed landscapes.
