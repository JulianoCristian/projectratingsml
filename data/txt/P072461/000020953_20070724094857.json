The lessons\n            learned included: 1) Extremely weak capacity remains a\n            critical development issue facing Timor-Leste, which cannot\n            be resolved in the short term and this project needs to be\n            seen as taking a small step in the process of capacity\n            building; 2) Post-conflict settings are not conducive to\n            designing, preparing and implementing operations to support\n            human resources development, especially when there is an\n            external transitional authority charged with government\n            responsibilities. In such environments, task teams need to\n            maintain a high degree of flexibility with respect to\n            specific components and implementation timings; 3) A phased\n            approach to the strengthening of government capacity with\n            simple and manageable outcomes which would build on and\n            strengthen each other to achieve sustainability in the\n            overall objectives; 4) The project benefited from the\n            continuity of having the same task manager from the start to\n            finish. This has also helped maintain the momentum; 5) The\n            numerous changes in government counterparts challenged the\n            task team to maintain the project on-track; and 6)\n            Considerable time and effort are required to develop and\n            build up the human resource base, strengthen public\n            institutions and transfer knowledge."}, "docdt": "2007-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
