The project\n            achieved most of its major objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was substantial, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, while encouraging results have\n            been obtained from the group approach to extension, the full\n            advantages will only be realized if JT/JTAs are better\n            trained in the principles and techniques of the group\n            approach. Second, farmer training needs to be greatly\n            expanded with course curriculum designed to provide both\n            increased knowledge in new technologies and more fundamental\n            principles of agricultural production processes. Third,\n            special attention is required to introduce mechanisms to\n            strengthen and formalize research-extension linkages.\n            Fourth, increased emphasis has to be given to the\n            utilization of modern media production technologies. Lastly,\n            bidding documents and land availability for physical work\n            should be ready before negotiations and pay sufficient\n            attention to the implementing agency's capacity to\n            supervise the quality of construction works."}, "docdt": "1995-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
