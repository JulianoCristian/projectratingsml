  the second phase of an IDA-supported introduction of the\n            Training and Visit (T&V) extension system in Nepal.\n            This phase will reorganize and strengthen agricultural\n            extension services in 11 administrative districts in the\n            Terai with the objective of achieving early and sustainable\n            improvement in agricultural productivity.  The project will\n            aim to establish a T&V extension infrastructure which\n            will promote the adoption of low-cost and labor-intensive\n            agricultural practices, and sound irrigation water\n            management, thus facilitating better cropping patterns,\n            greater crop diversification and more efficient fertilizer\n            and water usage.  The project will also provide for training\n            of staff and monitoring and evaluation of project activities."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
