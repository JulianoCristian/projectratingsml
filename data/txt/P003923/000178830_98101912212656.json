Development Project in\n            Indonesia. The institutional objectives of the Project were:\n            (a) to support integrated infrastructure development\n            planning and programming in JABOTABEK and urban transport\n            programming in Special Capital Region (Daerah Kusus Ibukota-\n            DKI) of Jakarta; (b) to increase DKI-Jakarta's\n            technical capabilities in preparing and implementing road\n            construction, and road rehabilitation and maintenance\n            programs; (c) to improve traffic management in JABOTABEK;\n            (d) to improve the Borrower's policies, operations and\n            regulations for public transport; and (e) to prepare for\n            future integrated development programs in the urban sector.\n            The performance of the Bank was generally satisfactory.\n            Borrower\u2019s performance was satisfactory. The most important\n            lessons of the project were: (a) one of the key lessons with\n            regard to project management is that existing structural\n            units should be strengthened to implement project components\n            effectively and required to coordinate among themselves,\n            with assistance from the Project Management Unit (PMU); (b)\n            well defined and focused training programs linked to the\n            implementation of project components produce results; (c)\n            building new roads may be less expensive than widening\n            existing roads; (d) support for integrated infrastructure\n            developing planning and programming has to develop network\n            plans and programs, and  provide technical training; (e) it\n            is the view of the Borrower that \"in-house\" TA to\n            agencies committed to the TA provides greater transfer of\n            knowledge than TA where consultant services are provided to\n            produce a stand-alone study; (f) social dimensions of\n            implementing public transport and parking policy changes\n            pose greater challenges than the physical ones; and (g) land\n            acquisition and resettlement have to be an integral part of\n            project design."}, "docdt": "1997-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
