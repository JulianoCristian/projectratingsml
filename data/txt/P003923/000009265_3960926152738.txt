INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$150 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE JABOTABEK URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$150 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan would have a term of 20 years including five years' grace, at the
standard variable interest rate, and would assist in financing the
Government's efforts in urban infrastructure and institutional development,
with particular emphasis on urban transport in the Jakarta Metropolitan
Region. A part of the loan proceeds (US$89 million equivalent) would be
onlent to DKI-Jakarta for a term of 20 years including five years' grace at
10% interest. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  Indonesia's urban areas and its major cities in partic-
ular, face the dual problems of accommodating some two million additional
persons each year on average over the next two decades (about two-thirds of
the total population growth and many of them poor), and surmounting
considerable underinvestment in urban infrastructure which limits services to
industry and residents. Expenditures today are 75% funded by Central
Government (GOI). In order to increase local government participation with a
view to improving expenditure efficiency and resource mobilization, all GOI
urban projects will in future be based on an irtegrated infrastructure
expenditure program and resource mobilization a.ad development plans.
Jabotabek, the metropolitan conurbation (population 9 million) consisting of
the Special Province of DKI-Jakarta, the municipality of Bogor and the
urbanizing districts of Tangerang and Bekasi, is the first metropolitan area
to be addressed under GOI's new urban policy regime.
3.        Key Sector Issues.  Urban sector issues reflect four major themes:
(a) projections of public expenditure on urban infrastructure indicate a need
for even greater levels of investment, rehabilitation, and operations and
maintenance (O&M); (b) in view of GOI's resource constraints, more efficient
programming and much greater participation by local governments in planning,
*       funding and implementation are needed; (c) sector policies and planning
require strengthening; and (d) the sector's weak, fragmented institutional and
financial arrangements require consolidation and better coordination. Serious
infrastructure deficiencies in Jabotabek are in flood protection, water supply
and sanitation (now being addressed by various donors, including the Bank
which expects to assist DKI-Jakarta with an urban water resources management
project under a second proposed Jabotabek urban development project in the
near future), and the region's highest priority, urban transport. Urban
transport subsector issues include the lack of secondary arterial road
capacity, insufficient serviced land, inadequate public transport programs
including the uncoordinated planning of railway, bus and traffic systems, and
weak institutional capacity. While recent privatization of the GOI urban toll
road program should reduce public funding and improve timing of such high-cost
facilities, heavy investment in the State Railway's costly Jabotabek commuter



railway service has begun without full consideration of alternative lower-cost
bus solutions. Specific road capacity problems include inadequate traffic
management and pedestrian facilities, inadequate demand restraint or provision
for transit vehicles on congested streets, and lax observance of traffic
regulations. Motor vehicle registrations in Jakarta (already 34Z of the
nation's total) are increasing over 102/year. In 1982 studies indicated that
over 60X of the arterial road links in the city were operating under
unacceptably congested conditions during peak travel periods. Public
cransport conditions are also deficient with low-quality, overcrowded services
and with the publicly-owned bus company in Jakarta suffering severe
operational and financial difficulties despite a recent fare increase.
4.        Bank Strategy and Subsector Strategy.  The rationale for Bank
involvement in the proposed project follows from the Bank's sector and
subsector strategies which focus on the following objectives: (a) to improve
expenditure efficiency in urban infrastructure (and urban transport in
particular) through an integrated planning and programming approach including
the strengthening of GOI's urban policy framework to include urban transport
matters; (b) to increase local government's financial commitments and
technical capabilities consistent with GOI's objective of devolving more
development responsibility to local governments; (c) to improve traffic
maragement and road network conditions; and (d) to improve public transport
conditions with particular emphasis on the regulatory environment and the
finAncial condition and operational efficiency of public bus companies.
Ongoing projects have laid the institutional foundation for progress on the
sector and subsector objectives. Development in Jabotabek will be based on
growth strategies and spatial plans formulated under Loan 1336-IND (Second
Urban Development) including emphasis on an east-west development pattern to
counteract current, environmentally harmful southerly growth. The compre-
hensive five-year expenditure program and related revenue plan compiled under
the proposed project will form a basis for future Bank projects in Jabotabek
including the above-mentioned Second Jabotabek Urban Dev,Lopment (Water
Resources) Project.
5.        Past Experience in Implementing Bank Strategy.  Since 1975 the Bank
has financed ten completed and eleven ongoing urban and transport projects in
Indonesia (including five involving DKI and one knvolving urban transport in
regional cities). The combined experience of this program was embodied in a
recent sector loan (No. 2816-IND) which is assisting GOI to implement new
national policies intended to strengthen central and local agencies to address
sector issues through (a) strategic guidance, and detailed criteria and
procedures for integrated planning and programming of investment and O&M
expenditures by local governments; (b) improved local resource mobilization
(mainly through property taxes and user charges); (c) improved central-local
grant and loan finance mechanisms; and (d) local government institutional and
manpower development. Sector policy development and program coordination and
monitoring is now directed by a high-level coordinating team (Tim Koordinasi)
chaired by the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and including
key agencies from the Ministries of Finance (MOF), Home Affairs (MHA) and
Public Works (MPW). With studies and technical assistance funded from Loan
2049-IND (Jakarta-Cikampek Highway), COI has begun to (a) place more emphasis
on cost-effective traffic management and public transport solutions, and (b)



- 3 -
improve institutional capabilities for urban transport planning and
financing. Relative responsibilities between central and local governments
for investment and O&M in the metropolitan road system are being clarified
through an ongoing classification of the roads. DKI-Jakarta's ability to
carry full financial responsibility for these functions and other urban
services is good and would be greatly strengthened in the near future through
implementation of the Property Tax Improvement project under Loan 2816-IND.
Experience with implementation in Jakarta was generally good where DKI-Jakarta
bad strong comitment and close control over project management. Loan 2632-IND
(Jakarta Sewerage), an MPW project, hqs encountered severe delays due in part
to lack of DKI-Jakarta's substantial involvement. The project has recently
been restructured to enable DKI-Jakarta to fully participate in its
implementation.
6.        Project Objectives.  The project's objectives are to: (a) support
integrated infrastructure development planning and programming in the
Jabotabek region and urban transport programming in DKI-Jakarta in particular;
(b) increase DKI-Jakarta's technical capabilities in preparing and implement-
ing road construction, and road rehabilitation and maintenance programs;
(c) improve traffic management in the region; (d) improve Government's
policies, operation and regulations for public transport; and (e) prepere for
future integrated development programs in the urban sector.
7.        Project Description.  The project would finance technical
assit!ance, physical works and training and would be executed mainly by DKI-
Jakarta together with MPW's Directorate General Bina Marga (DGBM) and MOC's
Directorate Ceneral Land Transport (DGLT). Technical assistance would be
provided for advisory services in (a) Jabotabek expenditure programming,
revenue improvement and financial management, transportation planning, traffic
management and demand restraint; (b) public transport policy development end
bus company restructuring; (c) air pollution monitoring; and (d) preparation
of future urban infrastructure projects in metropolitan and large cities.
Physical components would include (a) major upgrading of about 90 km of
primary and secondary arterial roads and four major intersection (flyover)
improvements; (b) a four-year program of traffic management measures (signals,
pedestrian improvements, signing and marking, and bus priority measures);
(c) a four-year program of road maintenance; (d) about 35 km of urban
development roads in sparsely developed areas; together with (e) technical
assistance for project management, and engineering design, O&M and
construction supervision services. Training would include strengthening of
traffic and transportation engineering and traffic regulation enforcement
courses and institutions with assistance from consultants.
8.        The total project cost and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank operations
in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A Staff Appraisal
Report No. 7056-IND dated February 15, 1988 is being distributed separately.
9.        Actions Agreed.  GOI has strengthened Tim Koordinasi to address
urban transport policies and issues, and confirmed DGLT as lead agency for
vehicle emission control institutional development. An agreement between DKI-



Jakarta and DCBM concerning respective functional responsibilities for urban
roads has been signed. As conditions of effectiveness: (a) Tim Koordinasi
would adopt an urban transport action plan for Jabotabek agreed at negotia-
tions; and (b) a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank would be
signed between GOI and DKI for onlending US$89 million of he loan to DKI.
Assurances were obtained that GOI would: (a) prepare an integrated urban
transport plan for Jabotabek by March 30, 1990 and derived bus, rail and other
transit mode action plans by March 31, 1991; and (b) implement (i) an agreed
bus transport action plan; and (ii) agreed traffic and public transport
institutional development programs in acordance with timetables satisfactory
to the Bank. Assurances were also obtained that GOI would cause the
respective agencies to: (a) prepare an integrated five-year expend.ture pro-
gram (including environmental protection measures) for Jabotabek by March 31,
1989; and (b) implement a revenue improvement plan for DKI-Jakarta. In
addition, confirmation was obtained of: (a) project management End land
acquisition/resettlement arrangements; and (b) terms of reference and
recruitment schedules for all technical assistance and training assignments.
10.       Benefits and Risks.  The project is expected to improve trarnsport
and traffic conditions in Jakarta through reduced congestion and travel times,
and improved traffic management and enforcement as well as road safety in
Indonesia's largest metropolis. The project would have significant institution
building benefits as well as longer term benefits from implementation of the
GOI urban sector development policies. The quantified transport cost
reductions are estimated to yield a weighted economic IRR of about 40Z. There
would also be less quantifiable benefits such as the environmental protection
measures and expenditure programming process supported by the project which
should contribute to greater urban efficiency. Project implementation risks
are expected to be minimal given the proven capability of the principal
executing agencies (DKI-Jakarta and DGBM) to build and upgrade road
infrastructure. The main risks lie in improving public transport programs and
operations. The Jabotabek Railway project and its components would be
reviewed prior to further new commitments by GOI. Consultants will be
appointed to assist DGLT in strengthening the bus companies in accordance with
GOI's action plan and performance would be monitored closely by GOI. PreDara-
tion of an integrated infrastructure program for Jabotabek may prove risky due
to the extensive coordination and key policy decisions required. This risk is
expected to be minimized by the supervision to be given to the task by Tim
Koordinasi.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
