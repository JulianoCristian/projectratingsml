                    ACCESS PROJECT (REAP)
                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A.     SUMMARY
1.     This restructuring paper is in response to a request from the Government of Mongolia
(GoM) made through a letters dated August 17, 2011 and September 6, 2011 from the Ministry
of Finance. The request is to reallocate savings within the project for a modest scale-up in the
smart subsidy program under Component A: Herders’ Electricity Access of the project; and
provide sufficient time to implement the proposed change, so that the GoM can successfully
achieve the target established in the national 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification Program, which
aims to provide rural herder families with access to modern electricit services with solar home
systems (SHSs).


PROJECT STATUS
2.     Background: The objective of the Renewable Energy and Rural Electricity Access
Project (REAP) is to increase access to electricity and improve reliability of electricity services
among the herder population and off-grid soum centers. The project consists of the following
components:

Component A: Herders’ Electricity Access
Component B: Soum Center Electricity Service
Component C: Institutional Capacity Building

3.     The project is co-financed by the International Development Association (IDA), the
Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Government of The Netherlands (GoTN) along with
funding from the GoM. The project was approved by the World Bank Board on December 19,
2006, made effective on May 4, 2007, and was formally restructured previously on August 5,
2009.


4.      Summary of Implementation Progress: Although the project experienced initial
implementation delays, REAP is on target to either achieve or exceed many of the established
results indicators following the previous restructuring.   Component A: Herders’ Electricity
Access has already recorded 51,188 SHSs by July 8, 2011, and is expected to distribute 65,400
solar home systems (SHSs) at its current pace, thereby surpassing the 50,000 SHS project target
by thirty percent. As a result of REAP’s contribution, the GoM would have provided over
98,000 SHSs to herders as a part of the national 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification Program.
Furthermore, REAP is on track to establishing at least two Sales and Service Centers (SSCs) in

                                                1
each aimag so that the impact of these investments can be maximized. Under Component B:
Soum Center Electricity Service, REAP has helped rehabilitate thirty soum mini grids, and have
installed fifteen Renewable Energy Technology (RET) systems1 with a majority of them fully
commissioned. The Aimag utilities are helping operate the utilities in soums that are not
connected to the grid. Work is underway to develop utility management systems in select soums
to enable them to recover operational and maintenance costs in order to sustain the investments.
Component C: Institutional Capacity Building is also progressing with various capacity building
activities taken place to date.



5.     As of August 3, 2011, REAP has disbursed US$12,040,722, including US$3,468,511
from the IDA Credit, US$2,572,271 from the GEF grant, and US$ 5,999,940 from the grant from
the GoTN. There is neither overdue audit, nor outstanding financial management, nor safeguards
issue with regards to the project.


    PROPOSED CHANGES
6.     Purpose: To reallocate funds within REAP to increase the smart subsidy under
Component A: Herders’ Electricity Access in order scale-up the number of SHSs sold; an
provide sufficient additional time for implementing the proposal, so that the national 100,000
Solar Ger Electrification Program target can be achieved.

7.      Rationale: In 1999, the GoM initiated the national 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification
Program to provide SHSs to herder families throughout Mongolia by 2010. From 2000 to 2005,
the government, with the assistance of a couple of bi-lateral donors, delivered 32,922 SHSs.
However, its expansion was limited since most of these SHSs did not include any degree of cost
recovery; and questions regarding sustainability arose since aftercare services were not made
available once the SHSs were delivered. Furthermore, the distribution network for SHSs was
also limited to the GoM network of soum administrations.

8.      In order to scale-up the expansion of herder electrification in a sustainable manner, the
GoM worked with the World Bank to design the Herders’ Electricity Access component under
REAP in 2006. REAP included several innovative features to address some of the shortcomings
in the existing national 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification Program. Under REAP, cost recovery
and affordability were balanced through a $160 per SHS cost buy down subsidy that was funded
through GoM funds and a grant from the GoTN; while herders were required to cover the
remaining cost of systems with their own funds. Moreover, REAP expanded the distribution
network for SHSs to reach herders in remote areas in Mongolia’s vast and sparsely populated
regions. In addition to the existing GoM network of soum administrations, REAP also

     The initial project target was to construct 20 RET systems, but the GoM connected five of the selected soums to
     the national grid along with the 10 others previously targeted for grid electrification. Therefore, REAP
     constructed 15 RET systems (four systems out of IDA/GEF/GoTN financing and 11 systems out of GoM
     funds). The installed capacity increased in some of them reflecting the higher electricity demand in those
     specific soums.

                                                         2
developed a network of certified private dealers as well as Sales and Service Centers (SSCs)
throughout the country. The SSCs are also expected to play an instrumental role in providing
after sales care of the SHSs – enhancing the sustainability of the investments made under the
project. REAP targeted the sale of 50,000 additional units through the project. Combined with
the SHSs already distributed by the GoM prior to REAP, there would be nearly 83,000 SHSs
distributed as a part of the 100,000 Solar Ger Program.

9.      REAP in on track to significantly exceed the target for SHSs established under the
project. The project has sold 51,888 SHSs by July 8, 2011, surpassing the initial project target of
50,000 units. With the currently allocated funding levels, REAP has the capacity to sell over
65,000 SHSs through the project. As a result, the total SHSs supplied under the 100,000 Solar
Ger Electrification Program would reach in excess of 98,000 units2, just shy of the national
program target of 100,000 units.

10.     Given the current progress, the GoM wishes to successfully complete the 100,000 Solar
Ger Electrification Program with the support of REAP. It is estimated that with REAP’s
contribution, the national SHS total will be 98,322 units – 1,678 units short of reaching the
national target. Therefore, the GoM has requested the reallocation of project savings towards the
smart subsidy program under the Herders’ Electricity Access component so that REAP certified
private dealers can sell additional units to make-up the shortfall.

11.     Proposal: The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has identified $290,560 in savings in
the IDA grant within REAP, which the GoM proposes to utilize to fund an additional 1,816
SHSs. These additional SHSs would enable the GoM to achieve the 100,000 Solar Ger
Electrification Program target. The funds would be reallocated from within the IDA grant
towards the existing smart-subsidy program. Furthermore, the REAP will require a six month
extension of its closing date to June 30, 2012, in order to provide sufficient time to distribute
SHSs through the ongoing bulk procurement as well as the additional units through private
dealers. This will also require the reallocation of an additional $50,000 for the PIU to manage
the project during the extended period, which is also proposed to be funded from savings in the
IDA grant within REAP.

12.    The proposed change will not alter the project goals or its components, which will remain
unchanged. It will utilize the existing smart-subsidy mechanism under REAP with only the
funding sources for the additional SHSs changed from GoTN to IDA funds. The existing
disbursement/funds flow arrangements for the smart-subsidy program will continue to be
applied.            Further       details       are       available      in      Annex         I.

                                 Reallocation of Funds
      RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR RURAL ELECTRICITY ACCESS PROJECT (REAP)


1.      The Herders’ Electricity Access component in REAP was designed to contribute towards
the national 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification Program in Mongolia through the sale and
distribution of 50,000 solar home system (SHS) units. The project is exceeding expectations and
is on track to sell as much as 65,400 SHSs based on the current sales trajectory. Combined with
the units that were distributed prior to REAP, the total SHS units distributed as a part of the
national 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification Program will reach 98,322. The GoM is keen to
increase the sales by at least an additional 1,678 SHS so that the national target can be achieved
through REAP.

2.      The GoM is proposing to utilize savings in the project and reallocate them within REAP
to scale-up sales in order to achieve the target number of units. They informed the Bank that the
private dealers certified under REAP would be in a position to sell the additional units, if the
existing subsidy was extended to cover these new SHSs. The subsidy is US$160 per SHS unit.
Up until now, the SHSs were subsidized through the grant from the GoTN, which is now fully
disbursed. Therefore, the GoM is proposing to reallocate US$290,560 of savings from the IDA
grant to cover the sale of 1,816 SHSs. This is expected to fill the existing gap in SHS sales in
order to achieve the national target, with 138 SHSs to spare as a contingency measure.

3.       The GoM is proposing to reallocate a total of US$290,560 in savings from four sub-
components towards the existing smart-subsidy sub-component (A4a).         Currently the smart-
subsidy sub component (A4a) is funded only through the grant from the Government of The
Netherlands (GoTN), in which the subsidy allocation is fully disbursed. Adjustments would be
made to the co-financing share as necessary to reflect the impact of the transfer from the IDA
grant, if applicable. Changes in cofinancing shares are not retroactive.

4.      The four subcomponents where funds would be reallocated from are as follows:

     a. Sub-Component B5: Rehabilitation of Soum Center Power Grids has US$22,874 in
        savings as the originally envisaged work under this sub-component is already completed.
        Therefore, the indicated funds are available for reallocation.
     b. Sub-Component B6: Renewable or Renewable- Diesel Hybrid System has US$102,558
        in savings as the originally envisaged work under this sub-component is already
        completed. The co-financing percentages should be changed to reflect the proposed
        reallocation in IDA grant funds under this sub-component since it is co-financed by IDA,
        GEF, GoTN, and GoM.




                                                4
   c. Sub-Component B2: Soum Center Capacity Building has savings of US$ 124,252 that
      can be reallocated from the IDA grant towards the smart-subsidy. The remaining
      activities under this sub-component will be fully funded by the GEF grant.
   d. Sub Component C2: National Policy and Regulation has US$40,875 in savings that can
      be reallocated from the IDA grant towards the smart-subsidy. The co-financing
      percentages should be changed to reflect the proposed reallocation in IDA grant funds
      under this sub-component since it is co-financed by IDA, GEF, and GoM (in-kind).

5.     In order to implement the scale-up as well as to successfully complete the ongoing bulk
procurement, the project will require an extension of its closing date of the IDA credit and the
GEF grant from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012. The revised project implementation
schedule developed by PIU is included in the project files.

6.      The extension of the project closing date will require the PIU to operate for an additional
six months in order to continue to oversee the implementation of REAP. In order to fund the
PIU operation cost (Sub Component C.1 Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation) for
the extended period, savings in the amount of US$50,000 from Sub Component C2: National
Policy and Regulation in the IDA grant will be utilized to finance Incremental Operating Costs,
including staff salaries. The co-financing percentages will be revised to reflect the proposed
reallocation in IDA grant funds under this sub-component C.2.

7.      The proposed restructuring will not change the goal of the REAP nor alter any of the
project components. Instead, it will reallocate savings towards the existing smart-subsidy sub-
component to further scale-up results that have already surpassed initial expectations. The
reallocated funds will not negatively impact any of the ongoing or expected activities under these
sub-components.

8.     The restructured project will utilize the existing implementation arrangements under
REAP. It will utilize the existing smart subsidy mechanism, with the only exception being that
the subsidy for the new units sold will be funded from the IDA grant resources rather than from
the GoTN grant. It will also follow the already established disbursement arrangements.
Financial management of the smart subsidy under the IDA grant will follow similar procedures
as with the GoTN funded smart subsidy, and the Financial Management Manual has been
updated to reflect the new source of funds for the smart subsidy program.

9.     As a result of the reallocation of funds from the IDA grant within REAP, the current and
revised financing by source is presented in Table 1, and the current and revised disbursement of
IDA, GEF and the GoTN grants are shown in Tables 2-4.
