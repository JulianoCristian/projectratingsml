                         The development objective of the proposed project is to increase access to electricity and improve reliability of electricity service among the herder population
                         and in off-grid soum centers.

                         The global environment objective is to remove barriers to the development and use of renewable energy technologies in grid and off-grid connected systems
                         and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. The rehabilitation of the soum mini grid will further reduce diesel fuel consumption of the hybrid systems with
                         additional CO2 emissions reduction benefits.
                         Has the Global Environmental Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PDO: The project has achieved, and in some instances, surpassed most of its original targets, and progress toward meeting the PDO is highly satisfactory. Under the herder
                         electrification component, the objective of increasing access to electricity to herders has been surpassed with nearly 55,000 herder families (currently 54.4% against the project target
                         of 50%) having received solar home systems (SHS). Following a recent six month extension of the closing date, the percentage could reach 62%. This will help the Government of
                         Mongolia (GoM) mostly complete the 100,000 Solar Ger electrification initiative, and will enable them to turn their focus on the 2020 target of universal rural electrification.
                         Furthermore, the establishment of Sales and Service Centers will continue to ensure sustainability of the investments. To meet the objective of increasing access in off-grid soum
                         centers, the project has rehabilitated 30 soum distribution systems, and has installed 15 Renewable Energy Technology systems with most fully commissioned and functioning well,
                         with a relatively small number of them that were financed by GOM requiring some corrective measures to achieve full functionality. Sustainability is being further promoted with the
                         institutional capacity building component, which has trained some 400 people.

                         GEFDO: Progress toward removing barriers to the development and use of renewable energy technologies is going well as stated above. Emissions of carbon dioxide are very likely
                         being reduced, although the total will not be calculated until the conclusion of the project after all systems have been operating.
