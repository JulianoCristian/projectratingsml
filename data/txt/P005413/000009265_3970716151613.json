electrical and mechanical industries (EMIs), encourage\n            Moroccan commercial banks to be more active in term\n            financing of industry, and strengthen ODI in its role of\n            industrial promotion.  To achieve these objectives, the\n            project will consist of:  (i) a line of credit of $22\n            million on-lent by participating commercial banks to finance\n            about 40 eligible EMI sub-projects.  It will also include\n            (ii) a subsidiary loan to ODI of $3 million, comprising $2.8\n            million for financing minority equity participations by ODI\n            in eligible EMI enterprises, and $200,000 to improve\n            ODI's market analysis capability in the EMI area\n            through sub-sectoral studies."}, "docdt": "1984-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
