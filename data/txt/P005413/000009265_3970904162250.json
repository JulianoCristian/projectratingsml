to be more active in term\n            financing of industry, and strengthen ODI in its role of\n            industrial promotion.  To achieve these objectives, the\n            project will consist of:  (i) a line of credit of $22\n            million on-lent by participating commercial banks to finance\n            about 40 eligible EMI sub-projects.  It will also include\n            (ii) a subsidiary loan to ODI of $3 million, comprising $2.8\n            million for financing minority equity participations by ODI\n            in eligible EMI enterprises, and $200,000 to improve\n            ODI's market analysis capability in the EMI area\n            through sub-sectoral studies."}, "docdt": "1984-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
