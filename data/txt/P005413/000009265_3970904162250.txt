KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL INDUSTRIES PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:        The Kingdom of Morocco
Amount:          US$25.1 million equivalent, including the capitalized
front-end fee.
Terms:           17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate. The Government would bear the
interest and foreign exchange risks on the Bank loan.
On-lending       i)  $22 million of the Bank loan would be on-lent to
Terms                 Moroccan commercial banks at the Bankk interest rate
prevailing at loan signature, and would be repayable
according to a composite amortization schedule,
reflecting the amortization of sub-loans extended by
the coimercial banks. The interest rate on sub-loans
to EMI borrowers would be the current minuum
effective rate on long-term industrial loans. The
terms of sub-loans would reflect the economic life of
sub-projects, with a maximum maturity of twelve years,
including a maximum grace period of up to three years.
ii)  $3 million of the Bank loan would be on-lent to the
Office pour le Developpement Industriel (ODI), at the
Bank interest rate prevailing at loan signature, with
a maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
Project          The project's objectives are to support the development of
Description      electrical and mechanical industries (EMIs), encourage
Moroccan commercial banks to be more active in term
financing of industry, and strengthen ODI in its role of
industrial promotion. To achieve these objectives, the
project would consist of;
i)  a line of credit of $22 million onrlent by
participating commercial banks to finance about 40
eligible EMI sub-projects; and
ii) a subsidiary loan to ODI of ¢3 million, comprising
$2.8 million for financing minority equity
participations by ODI in eligible EMI enterprises, and
$200,000 to improve ODI's market analysis capability
in the EMI area through sub-sectoral studies.

(ii)
EMI investments under the project will create about 1,500
jobs. The project would provide an opportunity for
commercial banks to improve their capabilities for economic
and market analysis, and contribute to increasing tern
financing by conwercial banks. ODI's policy framework
would be improved under the project, and its capability in
the EMI area would be strengthened. 7he main risks under
the project concern the receptivity of the comnercial banks
to the financing scheme and on-lending conditions, their
ability to appraise sub-projects and follow procurement and
disbursement procedures under the loan. These risks are
expected to remain minimal, as the participating commercial
banks have confirmed their interest, developed sub-project
pipelines, demonstrated appraisal capability, and are
familiar with Bank procedures for procurement and
disbursements.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The following report appraises a project designed to provide
institutional support and finance to Morocco's Electrical and Mechanical
Industries (EMIs). The ground work for the project was laid down by a Bank
subsector review of EMIs 1/ prepared in 1980-81, following a report on EKI
development strategy prepared jointly by a consulting firm and the Office pour
le De'veloppement Industriel (ODI) in 1976-78.
1.02     The proposed Bank loan of US$25.1 million to the Kingdom of Morocco
would consist of:
(i)  a line of credit of US$22 million to be onlent through selected
co-mercial banks to EMI enterprises for eligible subprojects;
(ii)  a subsidiary loan of US$3 million to ODI for financing equity
participations in eligible EMI subprojects and technical assistance
for carrying out EMI sub-sectoral studies.

II. THE ANUFACTURING SECTOR
Performance
2.01     The manufacturing sector has played a significant role in Morocco's
development. Its contribution to GDP has remained stable, at about 17X since
1975. Employment in the sector accounts for only 8% of total employment, with
about half the jobs in the modern sector and half in small-scale and artisanal
industry. The growth of manufacturing value added slowed from 72 p.a. in real
terms in 1973-77 to 1.6% p.a. in 1978-1982, as a result of increasing
financial constraints and the limitations of a development strategy based on
import-substitution. Until the early 1980s, the sector remained oriented
towards the domestic market for consumption goods which became gradually
saturated, and import-substitution investments were the major feature of
Morocco's industrial development. The sector as a whole contributed
substantially to balance of trade disequilibrium, with imports of intermediate
and capital goods more than offsetting the locally produced import substitutes
(consumer goods). Preliminary results for 1983 indicate the resumption of a
more dynamic growth (4% p.a. in real terms), due in part to a reorientation of
the sector from the saturated domestic market towards exports. In the 1970's,
exports of manufactured products remained at 8 to 10% of manufacturing output
and did not develop to a substantial extent, with the exception of traditional
exports such as textiles, carpets, leather goods, and phosphate based
products. Since 1979, however, manufacturing exports (in particular
phosphoric acid and clothing) have risen, from a small base, steadily by 24%
p.a. and reached DH 5.5 billion in 1982. As a result, the share of
manufacturing in total exports increased to an average 38% in 1979-81 from 25Z
in the mid-seventies, and reached 45% in 1982. This trend was maintained in
1983 and in the first half of 1984 which saw a strong growth of manufacturing
exports (particularly phosphoric products). 7he following table summarizes
these trends by major sub-sector:

Priorities of the 1981-85 Plan for Industry
2.02     The 1981-85 Plan's strategy for industry has emphasized the need to
promote an outward-looking development, to create employment at low costs, to
alleviate the constraint put on industrial growth by the imports of EMI goods,
and to reform accordingly the industrial incentives framework. An
acceleration of industrial exports has been the first objective of the new
Plan, the other major objectives being the promotion of labor intensive
investments and the selective development of engineering industries for the
efficient substitution of imported EHI goods. To achieve its objectives, the
Plan has focused its programs and policies on the:
-    continuation of "sectoral programs" for resource-based industries
producing high value-added exports (phosphate derivatives) or basic
commodities substituting for imports (cement, sugar) and for
smal l-scale labor-intensive industries;
-    revision of the protection framework and of the investment and export
incentive codes to encourage exports, domestic resources use,
low-cost employment creation and mobilization of private and foreign
capital;
-    improvement and simplification of the administrative procedures
regulating export activities and foreign capital transfers; and
-    increased use of domestic goods in investment projects.
The sub-sectoral allocation of investment reflected the Plan's emphasis on
exports, with 55% of total investment for phosphate derivatives and textile
and leather mainly (table 2.2). Engineering industries were given higher
priority than in the past, with 15% of total industrial investments as
compared to a 9% share in 1975-1980.

2.03     Constraints on the domestic market or resource availability have
restrained further rapid development of technically simple or resource-based
industries, in particular food industries and construction materials. The
best prospects for growth, besides exports of phosphate derivatives industries
and textiles, are the engineering industries where a substantial potential
remains for efficient import-substitution, export sub-contracting, transfer of
technology and employment creation. The priority given to selected
engineering industries by the Plan is justified by their relative labor
intensity and efficiency at low scale of production, the general upgrading of
technological level in manufacturing associated in their development, and by
the need to reduce the large trade gap of the EMI subsector and permit a
resumption of total manufacturing investment without endangering the balance
of payments situation. The Bank has fully supported this priority in its
subsector review of EKIs (para. 1.01) and its sector dialogue with the
Government.
Industrial Investment Prospects
2.04     As foreseen by the Plan Review completed in 1982 by the Bank, actual
levels of manufacturing investments have been substantially lower than
projected by the Plan; in particular, the phosphate processing investments
have been stretched over a longer period than anticipated by the Plan, to
reflect changes in world market expectations for that sector, and other public
projects postponed. Approved and actual investments averaged respectively 2.7
and 2.1 billion DH p.a. during 1981-83, as compared to 4 billion DR p.a.
projected by the Plan. The private sector's share increased steadily, from
73Z in 1980 to 96% in 1983; the engine for growth and investment has been
mainly exports in chemicals and textiles/leather, which increased very rapidly
in recent years beyond the Plan's targets. The export prospects for food
industries, and substantial opportunities for further import-substitution in
the engineering industries above all, have led the private sector, in
particular foreign investors (see para. 2.09), to sustain a high or increasing
level of investments in these two subsectors, as can be seen in table 2.3
below:

2.05     A conservative review of the projectb (both public and private)
identified in the Plan, combined with an assessment of future investments by
the private and foreign sectors, indicate that, on average over the period
1985-1987, approved investments in manufacturing are likely to reach at least
DH 2.0 billion p.a., and that non-SSI investment is likely to average DH 1.74
billion p.a., of which DH 320 million (US$38.5 million) in EtIs. With a
conservative implementation rate of 75Z, the foreign exchange requirements for
manufacturing investment (excluding SSIs) would total US$285 million during
1985-1987, of which US$45 million at least would be needed for the engineering
industries.
Sectoral Constraints and Adiustment Program
2.06     The critical constraints to the growth of manufacturing, and
particularly export production, have been in the areas of protection policy,
industrial incentives and administrative barriers. Most of the constraints
that were identified by the Bank's Review of the Engineering Industries I1 and
which are being addressed under the ITPA Loan (see para. 2.08) have limited
the possibilities of growth of the manufacturing sector; namely;
(a) The large increase of imports of EMI goods induced by investment
growth, such as in 1974-77 and 1981-1982, has constituted a
structural factor of balance-of-payments disequilibrium; the trade
deficit in EMI goods represented 82% of total trade deficit in 1977,
and two-thirds in 1982 and 1983. The large balance of payments
deficit has limited imports of equipment and raw materials for
industry, and hence investment and growth.
(b) The pervasive lack of well-trained technicians and foremen in
manufacturing has been detrimental to the growth of productivity and
limited the possibilities of technological diversification.
5c) The protection and investment incentive systems have had a negative
impact on competitiveness, and encouraged inefficient enterprises in
industries producing consumer goods and durables and intermediate
products.
(d) Foreign investments had been limited as a result of administrative
red-tape and the "moroccanization" policy introduced in the early
1970's.
2.07     As a result of these deficiencies, a bias against export production
evolved during the 1970, and there was a tendency to encourage uncompetitive
and inefficient enterprises in industries producing consumer goods and
durables for a limited and protected local market. Following a detailed
Bank-supported study of effective protection and industrial incentives,
carried out by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism 2/, the
1/ See Chapter II of Report No. 3233-MOR, Review of the Engineering
Industries.
2/ Report No. 4893-MOR, "Morocco: Industrial Incentives and Export
Promotion" of January 11, 1984.



-6-
Government undertook a far-reaching reform program in 1983. The principal aim
of the program is to introduce structural changes to eliminate the bias
against export production, lower manufacturing costs, and hence lay the basis
for further and increased industrial growth.
2.08     This program is supported by the Bank's Industrial and Trade Policy
Adjustment Loan (Loan No. 2377-MOR, for $150.4 million, approved in January
1984), and covers measures to reform the systems of export incentives, import
protection (tariffs and quantitative restrictions), fiscal incentives,
financial policy (interest rate policy and export credits), and price controls
(liberalization of prices). Overall, the program of adjustment is being put
in place according to schedule for nearly all the measures. In particular,
the Government, in implementing a flexible exchange rate policy has devalued
the dirham by 17% since August 1983. A general reform of the special customs
regimes is being prepared. Administrative barriers have been reduced through
removal of export certificate requirements for a number of products, and
special customs programs have been introduced to assist exporting firms. In
the area of protection policy, progress has been considerable. First of all,
the special import tax (levied on nearly all imports) has been reduced from
15% to 1C%, and its progressive elimination is expected within two years. Ihe
maximum level of customs duties has been reduced to 60%. At the same time,
the Government has effected a significant liberalization of quantitative
restrictions on imports by eliminating import licensing requirements for
several products. A comprehensive program for fiscal reform is being
prepared, and price controls have been removed on several manufactured
products. As a result of these measures, increased exposure to competition is
expected to lead to greater efficiency in Moroccan industry.
2.09     The other constraints to the growth of manufacturing (the lack of
well-trained technicians, foremen and skilled workers, and inadequate
incentives to foreign investors), which had limited the possibilities of
technological diversification, are being progressively addressed. There has
been a recent expansion of technical training capacity and the current
emphasis is on vocational training (a Bank loan for a first Vocational
Training Project is planned for FY85). A new industrial investment code,
which removed past barriers to foreign investment, was published in 1983. As
a result, the share of foreign investments in approved manufacturing
investments doubled to 20% in 1983; more significantly, the share of foreign
investment reached 28% in approved investments for engineering industries,
thereby substantially increasing the likelihood of technological upgrading and
transfers.
Bank Operations and Strategy for Industry in Morocco
2.10     As of June 30, 1984 the Bank had financed 14 operations in the
industrial sector, for a total of $526 million, representing about a fourth of
Bank/IDA lending to Morocco. In addition, IFC had financed 6 industrial
projects, for a total of $47 million, including t12.5 million in equity
investments. Past Bank lending for industry focussed on strengthening the
Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE), the major source of
industrial medium-term credit in Morocco, which received 9 loans (of which 8



- 7 -
are fully disbursed - see para. 4.05). 7he Bank also made 2 loans in 1979 and
1981 to support the formulation and implementation of an integrated package of
policy support, technical assistance, and credit for the development of
small-scale labor-intensive industries (SSIs); the first SSI-loan is fully
disbursed. Commitments under the SSI-2 loan have been slow mainly because of
a decline in SSI investment demand. At the Government's request, $30 million
of the original loan amount was cancelled in June 1984. fThe loan is now
expected to be fully committed and disbursed by the original dates expected at
appraisal. 1ko previous projects supported Morocco's strategy of increasing
in-country processing of phosphates in order to meet changing market demand,
and another contributed to efforts to develop an efficient cement industry
with a significant impact on pricing policies.
2.11     Given the importance for Morocco of achieving its ongoing adjustment
program, the Bank strategy for industry is essentially policy-oriented, and
focusses on the basic priorities which are to: develop exports and support
efficient imDort-substitution on the one hand; and reform the institutional
and financial framework for industry on the other (see Chapter IV). This
strategy is based on a number of sectoral studies completed in the last 2-3
years on Industrial Policy and Export Incentives, the review of the Financial
Sector, and the review of the SSI and Handicraft sector 1/. More
specifically, the Bank strategy and lending aims at: (i) reducing protection
and improving the incentive framework to encourage exports and foster the
efficiency of import-substitution industries; (ii) strengthening, and filling
the gaps in, the industrial structure in subsectors with development potential
(e.g. EMIs, SSIs, energy-efficiency); and (iii) expanding the capacity and
increasing the efficiency of the financial system for resource mobilization,
term financing and project promotion. These areas are also the priority areas
of the Government, and are expected to provide the basis for Bank financing in
the medium-term.

III. THE ELECTRO-MECHANICAL INDUSTRIES (EMIs)
Structure, Characteristics and Performance
3.01     The development of electro-mechanical industries represents an
essential step in the industrialization process, as they constitute the first
step in the transformation of metallic minerals, provide the development and
fabrication for all metal products, and establish a crucial link between the
end-product assembly industries and the industries producing components and
sub-assemblies. Among the subsectors constituting the EMIs (listed in Table
3.1), the subsectors of basic metals, machinery, and measuring equipment are
generally underdeveloped in developing countries because of their high quality
standards or complex technological requirements.
3.02     The modern ElI subsector in Morocco has remained under-developed, as
compared to other industrial subsectors, and represents only 18Z of industrial
value-added. *The following table summarizes the structure of the modern ElI
subsector:

(*) Estimates
The modern sector is composed mainly of small enterprises (with less than 50
workers), which represent 70Z of the EMI enterprises. In addition to the
modern sector, EMIs comprise some seven thousand artisans providing a further



10% to the modern EKI output, and mostly producing traditional or substandard
metal products for household consumption. A majority of enterprises and
employment is concentrated in the subsector of metal products producing
primarily consumer goods. The EKI sector is dominated by the private sector,
with a minor but significant influence ef foreign partners and technical
staff.
3.03    After a sustained output growth of 1OZ (in real terms) over
1973-1978, mainly in the subsectors of metal products, electrical goods and
machinery, EKIs experienced a slow-down in 1979-1983 (2.6% p.a. in real
terms), mostly due to the decrease of activity in the important subsector of
transport equipment assembly. The stagnation of national income under the
1978-1980 Austerity Plan, and the decline of value-added and income in the
agriculture/mining and the housing/construction sectors in 1980-1982 (-1.22
and -2.6% p.a. respectively) which have been major customers of cosmercial
vehicles, were the major reasons -for the decreased production of transport
vehicles; in particular, production of commercial vehicles dropped from 4,580
units in 1978 to 2,400 units in 1982. This decline had a marked effect on the
foundry subsector of which the vehicle industry is a major customer. On the
other hand, electrical industries continued to grow steadily (18.5% p.a. in
1973-1978, 3.2% p.a. in 1979-1983). Preliminary results for 1983 indicate the
resumption of higher growth in EMIs (+4.6% in real terms), in particular in
metal structures, railways rolling stock, mechanical works, electrical
industries (except cables), and non-ferrous foundries; platework, ship-repair,
metal products and household appliances stagnated, while ferrous foundries and
vehicle assembly continued to decline.
3.04     The EKI sector has been essentially inward-oriented, with negligible
exports (see para. 3.05). It has developed principally in import-substituting
assembly industries producing consumer/durable goods and relying largely on
imported components. As a consequence of the focus on assembly activities,
value-added has remained low at an average of 25% of gross output, and the EKI
sector remained under-developed, representing only 2.9% of GDP and 17.8Z of
manufacturing value-added; a comparative analysis of Morocco's industrial
structure with the industrial structures of a group of countries similar to
Morocco in population size, income level and manufacturing orientation shows
that, given the country's size and level of development, the EMI sector should
"normally" (i.e. by comparison to similar countries) contribute about 57 to
GDP and about 24Z to manufacturing value-added 1/.
3.05    The under-development and inward-orientation of the sector has
generated an EMI trade deficit representing two-thirds of Morocco's overall
trade deficit, thus putting a heavy pressure on the balance of payments
1/ See World Bank Research Project "Patterns of Industrial Development"
(RPO 671-05).

(table 3.2). Capital goods represented more than 60Z of total EMI imports,
constituting the most important single item contributing to the overall trade
balance deficit. Intermediate EMI products (essentially iron/steel long and
flat products) and EMI consumption goods/durables (principally cars and
components) have shared equally the other 401. EMI exports have been
negligible, averaging over the past five years 3.5% of the sector output and
1.5% of total Moroccan exports, and peaked at USg30 million in 1982 with the
resumption of traditional exports of lead ingots and the emerging exports of
automobile subassemblies (radiators and bodies), electrical and electronic
components (cables, hardware, transistors and semi-conductors) and some
capital goods (lifting/handling machinery).

Subsectoral Patterns
3.06     EMIs producing consumer goods and durables and their intermediates
(metal products, household utensils and appliances, hardware, furniture,
private cars assembly, TV/radio assembly), which represent 45% of EMI output,
have met about 70% of the domestic demand for these products, and have been
characterized by large reliance on imported inputs and low intra-sectoral
integration. The shortcomings of consumer/durable goods EMIs stem mainly from
the high diversification of the product-mix and fragmentation of the domestic
market (in particular private cars, TV/radios, appliances), and also from gaps
in the production structure (in particular electrical and electronic goods).
The following table summarizes these sub-sectoral patterns.

3.07     local capital goods and supplies industries, which currently meet
only 10-15% of the demand for these goods, have not been encouraged to develop
c-ommensurately to their markets. This has been partly due to the low
effective protection (para. 3.19) and the procurement policies of public
enterprises which have favored turn-key contracts with foreign suppliers.
Nevertheless, these adverse circumstances led existing industries to be
generally efficient and relatively labor-intensive. The competitiveness of
these industries stems essentially from the productivity of labor as compared
to its overall cost (one-third of the European average), which offsets the low
scale of operations and the duties and taxes levied on imported components and
materials.
3.08     The subsector of iron/steel foundries, which should have been the
backbone of EMIs de:-velopment, represents only 3% of EMIs output, meeting only
the demand for low-grade castings. The major reasons for this are: the
shortage of skilled labor and foundry specialized workers and the dearth of
qualified technicians and engineers; inadequate technology; and the decline of
the automotive industry after 1977 (para 3.03).  The Government is aware of
the problems in this area, and is evolving approaches to encourage foundry
development.
Development Potential and Strategy for the Engineering Industries
3.09     Morocco has a substantial potential and a comparative advantage for a
selective development of its EMIs. Labor productivity (measured by value
added per worker) in EMIs is relatively high, at about US$7,100 as compared to
about US$3,000 in Tunisia in 1981. The domestic market for electrical goods



- 12 -
has reached the "critical mass" level 1/, and is still partly untapped; the
labor force is productive, easily trainable and relatively cheap; technical
support from foreign partners or advisors has been effective, if limited in
extent, and has contributed to good management in a number of efficient
enterprises; and the proximity of the country to the Middle-East, sub-Saharan
Africa and the EEC has permitted it to obtain preferential access to these
markets and has facilitated the transfer of recent technologies from the
EEC 2/.
3.10     The comparative advantages of Morocco have been harnessed by
exporting handicrafts and SSIs (metal products and household utensils) and by
joint ventures or foreign firms subcontracting for the export of automobile
and electrical/electronic components. With new liberal policies and
procedures towards foreign investments (para. 2.09), Morocco has begun to
attract other subcontracting activities for exports in light evgineering and
sub-assemblies industries; in particular, the recent Integration-Compensation
law for the automotive assembly industry (whereby local assemblers should
increase, within 3 years, the rate of integration of local parts to at least
40-5oz, with the possibility of achieving such rates through "compensation"
exports of local parts to be bought back by the foreign suppliers of CKD
kits 3/) is encouraging foreign suppliers of the automotive industry to
establish new subcontracting industries in related activities and in promoting
exports accordingly.
3.11     There is also a large potential for efficient import-substitution in
capital goods and supplies using simple or intermediate technologies. Capital
goods identified for extensive import-substitution are tnose which have
domestic markets large enough to sustain economic operations and which are
adapted to the country's primary needs and present technological capabilities;
this group comprises principally steel structure and platework, non-automotive
agricultural machinery (ploughs, harvesters, trailers, pumps), thermal
equipment (industrial boilers, furnaces, condensers, driers), lifting and
handling machinery (belt conveyors, cranes), railroad freight cars, and
selected electrical machinery (generators and motors, switchboards/gears,
control/command panels). Local production of capital goods reached about
DH 1400 million (US$265 million) in 1981; corresponding imports in 1981-1983
averaged DH 4500 million p.a. (US$800 million), of which one-fourth could be
produced locally without major difficulties. Morocco's comparative advantage
1/ The contribution of electrical industries to GDP (0.58X) remains markedly
below the contribution of such industries in similar developing countries
where it averages about 0.8%. Moreover, per capita consumption of
electrical goods is estimated at about US$20 in Morocco as compared to
US$35 in Tunisia; taking into account the levels of GDP per capita in
these 2 countries (US$860 and $1,420 respectively) and the elasticity of
demand to income of about 1.5 for these goods, the official consumption
remains markedly below the potential demand (which is met partly by
unregistered imports).

female labor has displayed remarkable skill at low cost.
3/  "Completely-knocked-down" kits of parts for assembly abroad.



- 13 -
in this area would be to substitute efficiently for imports of low and
middle-technology capital goods, and to develop progressively and selectively
the production of certain capital goods of higher technology. It is
estimated, on the basis of a conservative projection of Gross Fixed Capital
Formation averaging DH 16 billion per year in 1985-1987, that imports of
capital goods would continue at a rate of about DH 3.7 billion p.a. (US$450
million), including DH 1.5 billion p.a. for capital goods of low and middle
technology which could be largely produced by local industries through a
promotion and expansion program of ENIs.
3.12     The broad priorities selected by the 1981-1985 Plan for the
development strategy of engineering industries are:
(i) the standard capital goods and supplies for industrial investment and
rural development;
(ii) the foundries; and
(iii) the commercial vehicles and their parts and components.
Capital goods and supplies industries constitute within the engineering
industries a clear priority for development, in view of the pressure of
corresponding imports on the balance of payments and of the resulting
constraints put on future industrial investment and development by the
shortcoming of local industries to supply a substantial share of these goods.
Given the very wide range of products, activities and technologies encompassed
by the capital goods industries, the selective development of these industries
would be guided by clearly defined intra-sectorial sub-priorities reflecting
both the country's general needs, -capabilities and comparative advantages.
The promotion of projects and the development strategies in the capital goods
industries would be articulated on the following intra-sectorial
sub-priorities:
Ist - Ferrous foundries, for the production of high-quality mechanical
castings;
2nd - Agricultural equipment and machinery, with the focus on: disc
ploughs, mechanical seeders and fertilizer sprayers, irrigation
pumps, harvesting machinery (except combines) and straw-bailers, tank
and bulk trailers, and tractors if mechanization policies for
agriculture are eventually implemented;
3rd - Diversification of platework industries, with a view to produce, or
further substitute to imports of; industrial boilers and ovens, heat
exchangers and driers, condensers, large tanks and vessels,
shutterings and scaffolds;
4th - Electrical machinery (for distribution, command and power), with the
priority on: motors and alternators, distribution cables and
transformers, switchboards and control panels, electro-pumps,
electro-generating groups;



- 14 -
5th - Hoisting and handling equipment for construction, public work and
mining, such as: small cranes, excavating machinery, dumpers, cement
mixers, winches, overhead cranes, lifters, conveyors, stackers,
gzinders and crushers, rotating drums; and
6th - Wood-working machines (planers, saws, lathes, combines).
The following list of products and goods has been identified by the Ministry
of Commerce and Industry for promotion and development in the coming years and
reflects the priorities and suggestions of the sub-sectoral development
strategy developed by the Bank in its Review of EMIs.

EMI Investments and Project Pipeline
3.13     EMIs have maintained their approved investments at an annual average
of DH 300 million (US$58 million) during the period 1980-1983, representing
about 12% of total approved investments in manufacturing (para. 2.04); with
the publication of the new Investmeait Code and its beneficial impact on
foreign investments in Morocco's EMIs (para. 2.09), approved EMI investments
increased by 19% in 1983 to DH 345 million, and by 52X in the first quarter of
1984. The Ministry of Industry and the appraisal mission both projected on a
conservative basis that approved investments in EMIs would average DH 320
million p.a. du-ing 1985-1987 (excluding projects meeting the criteria 1/ of
I/ Projects with a maximum investment cost of DH 6.5 million and a maximum
capital cost per job of DH 110,000.



- 15 -
the SSI projects financed by the Bank), and the rate of implementation of
these approved investments would average 65%, leading to foreign exchange
requirements for implemented EMI projects of at least US$15 million per year
(para. 2.05).
3.14     After the Bank's EMI sector report was discussed in Morocco, a number
of financial institutions became interested and active in identifying EMI
projects and investors for term financing. The Office pour le Developpement
Industriel (ODI), a public agency for industrial promotion has focused its
promotion efforts on the EMI subsector since 1980; its pipeline for the period
1985-1987 comprises 10 projects, all for capital goods and components, with a
total cost of US$55 million requiring credits totalling US$27.5 million
(Annex 1). Concurrently, some six commercial banks have developed, in the
perspective of a Bank-financed project for EMI development, pipelines of
subprojects in this subsector. As indicated in Annex 1, these pipelines
contain a total of 27 subprojects, most of them from two banks (BCM and BMCE)
specialized on the EMI subsector, with a total cost of US$25 million and
credit requirements of US$15 million for a 12 to 18 month commitment period
(excluding subprojects to be approved in 1984 and those contemplating
financing from BNDE). Assuming conservatively that about two-thirds of these
investments will be actually implemented during 1985-1987 and that credit
needs for ODI-promoted projects will be provided equally by BNDE and the
commercial banks, long-term financing needs for EMIs by commercial banks would
total at least US$25 million in 1985-1987.
Subsector Constraints and Issues
3.15     Within the set of issues affecting the industrial sector (paras. 2.06
and 2.09), the issues and constraints which until 1983 hampered more
particularly the development of EMIs were:
(a) the weakness of the institutional framework in providing; (i)
engineering capacity indispensible for higher local participation;
.i) the standards and quality control required for higher
intrasectoral integration; and (iii) credit facilities for selling
local capital goods on terms competitive with foreign suppliers;
(b)  the shortage of skilled labor and supervisory staff at shop-floor
level, most particularly for mechanical skills;
(c)  the discriminatory treatment given before 1983 to foreign investment,
and thus to technology transfers, by the Investment Code; and
(d)  the bias of the protection structure and practices against the
production of intermediate and capital goods (see para. 3.19).
The absence in Morocco's institutional framework of administrative units
responsible for industrial policy and planning and for establishing industrial
standards hampered the promotion of higher efficiency and intrasectoral
integration in EMIs, and the rationalization and specialization of markets and
product-mix. Moreover, the participation of local engineering industries in



- 16 -
large contracts and projects was made difficult by the lack of local
engineering capability (required to prepare large tenders in packages
specifically designed for local and foreign suppliers respectively) and
appropriate suppliers credits. Moroccan producers of capital goods could not
offer to investors the medium/long-term credit facilities similar to the
attractive foreign suppliers credits generally available for large turn-key
contracts, and were thus generally excluded from large projects.
3.16     The shortage of skilled labor and of supervisory staff (foremen and
technicians) has been a critical constraint on the development and operations
of EMIs. The respective proportions of supervisory staff and of skilled
workers in the total EMI labor force are about half those generally observed
in other countries with well-established EKIs; the gap is less critical in the
electrical and capital goods industries and most acute in the basic metal
industries (foundries). The output of EMI-skilled labor from the education
and vocational training systems should increase substantially through
education projects assisted by the Bank and bilateral sources. The
availability of supervisory and skilled staff trained in mechanical skills
will remain a constraint on EMIs development, and particularly on the
diversification of these industries into new or more complex activities, but
this would be addressed by the new training capacity to be created (as under
the proposed vocational training project, for which a Bank loan is programmed
in FY85).
3.17     These constraints and issues have been, or are being, progressively
removed in the course of continuous project and sector dialogue between the
Government and the Bank during the period 1982-1984, as already described in
Chapter 2. More particularly:
Ci) an industrial planning and policy unit was created in April 1983;
this unit has been active on, and will be instrumental in, generating
sub-sectoral development strategies, promoting rationalization and
specialization of markets and product-mix, and establishing policies
and guidelines for higher local integration;
(ii) with the new 1983 Investment Code, the share of foreign investments
in investment agreements in the engineering industries jumped from
less than 10% to 28% in 1983 (para.2.09);
(iii)  medium-term suppliers credit facilities were created by the Central
Bank in August 1982 for the marketing of local capital goods; and
(iv) the creation of a specialized unit for industrial standardization and
quality control is being prepared by the Ministry of Industry with
bilateral assistance 1/.
1/ To respond to the most urgent needs, a quality control laboratory for
foundries was established in 1983 with UNDP financing.

3.18     To address the constraint of limited engineering capacity, the MCI
created in October 1981 an engineering firm (AGA) specialized in the
preparation of public tenders and designs for sugar mills (which are public)
and other agro-industries. The Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) which
has the largest investment program in industry (phosphate-processing chemical
plants) has created also in 1981, in joint venture with a European engineering
firm, an engineering affiliate (Societe Marocaine de Realisations Techniques
et d'Ingenierie - MAROTEC) staffed with 25 engineers and 30 technicians with
the responsibility to prepare all engineering for the Maroc-Phosphore III and
IV units (investments would total DH 5,500 million in 1983-87), and afterwards
to contract out detailed engineering. As a result of these actions, the
design and implementation of large public and semi-public projects will no
longer be achieved only through turnkey contracts awarded to foreign firms
which had neglected to involve substantially the local firms. The overall
local cost content of such projects (sugar mills, OCP chemical units) is
expected to double from 20-301 to 40-60& of total costs, as a result of a
substantially higher participation of local engineering industries.
Import Protection for Engineering Industries
3.19     Protection to industry in Morocco is provided through tariff duties
differentiated on a product basis, combined with a system of quantitative
restrictions whereby imports are classified into 3 groups: list A of goods
freely imported; list B of imports submitted to import licensing; and list C
of prohibited imports. During the industrialization period of the seventies,
tariff and quantitative restriction protections were granted to most new
enterprises in order to reserve the domestic market for the local industry.
The structure of duties is typical of other developing countries, with higher
duties charged on consumer goods and end-products, and lower duties on
intermediate and capital goods. For EMI products, some 94% of the number of
tariff positions have ranged between 0 and 40%, with 60% of the number of
positions between 5 and 20% and another 12% of EMI tariff items (mostly iron
and steel raw materials) exempted from duties. In particular, duties below
2OZ have been levied on 85% of capital goods imports in value; 20% of these
imports were exempted from duties and the Special Import Tax (agricultural and
fishing equipment) and another 10% of capital goods imports were exempted from
duties only (imported machinery for projects approved under the Investment
Code). In addition to tariff protection, quantitative restrictions have been
applied on imports, focussing essentially on consumer goods and end-products
(60% of imports in lists B and C in 1982, and 85% in 1983) rather than
intermediate goods (35% of imports in lists B and C in 1982, 50% in 1983) and
capital goods (22% of imports in lists B and C). The impact of these
protection patterns on EKIs was demonstrated by the Bank-supported study of
effective protection (para. 2.07); the effective protection rate 1/ on EfI in
1978-79 had averaged 1.32, ranging from about 1.5 for consumer goods to 1.3
for intermediate products (foundries and components) and to 1.06 for capital
1/ Defined as the ratio between value added at domestic prices and value
added at border prices. It summarizes the overall effects of protection
on the inputs and output of an economic activity. An effective protection
rate of 1.5 means also that *1.5 of domestic value added is required to
save $1 of imported value added.



- 18 -
goods (commercial vehicles essentially, dumpers). Taking into account the
foreign exchange rate devaluation of 1982-83, these effective protection rates
are estimated for 1982 to have averaged 1.14 over all EMIs, ranging from 1.3
for consumer goods to 0.92 for capital goods.
3.20     In order to foster the growth of an efficient and export-oriented
manufacturing sector, the Government has launched since 1983 the program of
reform measures, which is being supported by the Industrial and Trade Pblicy
Adjustment Loan (ITPA) (see paras. 2.07 and 2.08). As part of the reform
program, and in order to promote the creation of internationally competitive
industries, the Government has agreed to apply the following principles in
considering requests for additional protection for new investments, including
new EMIs projects:
(a)  protection will generally be given only through tariffs and not
through quantitative restrictions; in the exceptional cases where
quantitative restrictions are considered necessary, these will be
limited to a period of three years;
(b)  while a level of tariff protection in excess of 25% may be accorded
during the first three years after project completion, tariffs would
be set at a level not in excess of 25% thereafter; and
(c)  protection along the lines of (a) and (b) above will only be accorded
to new products whose profitability is demonstrated after rigorous
economic and financial analysis by the Ministry of Industry. It is
also understood that the anti-dumping provision, as defined by GATT
to protect industry against unfair or subsidized competition, could
be applied for these new products.
These principles would apply to financing of EMIs under the proposed project.
Subprojects benefitting from local content legislation or similar measures
(such as the Integration-Compensation law, see para. 3.10) would not be
eligible for financing if these measures have the effect of extending
protection beyond these guidelines.

IV. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Introduction
4.01     Morocco's financial sector comprises 15 commercial banks, five
specialized institutions and two saving banks. Medium-and long-term financing
is provided to private investors principally by three institutions, the
agricultural credit bank (CNCA), the housing and tourism bank (CII) and the
industrial bank (BNDE), all of which have received Bank loans. The Banque du
Maroc (BdM) is Morocco's central bank. A capital market located in Casablanca
plays a limited role.
Financial Intermediaries
4.02     Commercial Banks.  As shown in table 4.1 below, the total assets of
Morocco's 15 commercial banks increased steadily by 17% p.a. since 1978 to DH
36.5 billion ($4.5 billion) at the end of 1983. Sight deposits averaged 72%
of total deposits during the 1978-83 period, and short-term lending 91% of the
loan portfolio to the private sector. The degree of concentration is high:
two banks (BCP and BCH) accounted for 44% of total assets at the end of 1982,
and six others for another 47%. BCP is Morocco's leading commercial bank with
the largest assets (more than DRI 5 billion at end 1982), and the largest num-
ber of branches and depositors. BCP is also the leading bank for SSI lending,
in particular because of its wide regional network. BMCE, second largest
commercial bank with total assets of DH 6.2 billion at end 1982, is the
leading bank for financing external trade activities. BCM is Morocco's third
largest commercial bank in terms of asset size (DR 4.3 billion at end 1982)
with a clientele comprising mainly medium and large enterprises. Morocco's
banking network is well developed and the number of branches totalled 643 in
1982. More than half of the branches are concentrated along the Atlantic
coast, with 25% of the branches and 42% of the deposits in Casablanca.

4.03     Co,mercial banking activities are tightly regulated by the Central
Bank and constrained by reserve requirements. Credit ceilings are imposed to
control the growth of the money supply. The banks are required to hold 30% of
their sight and term deposits in Treasury bonds, to maintain a minimum rate of
reserves of 0.5% of total liabilities, a minimum ratio of 5.25% between their
equity (capital and reserves) and total liabilities, and to limit the maximum
exposure to a single customer to 10% of their equity. To stiwulate
medium-term lending, the banks have an obligation to convert a minimum of 6%
of their liabilities into medium and long-term credits, of which 4.5% into
rediscountable mediumr-term credits to industry, and 1.5% into medium and
long-term housing credits. Any medium and long-term lending above these
minimum requirements is exempted from the credit ceiling and can be
rediscounted with the Central Bank.
4.04     As shown in table 4.2 below, commercial bank lending is predominantly
short-term: the commercial banks supplied 87% of short-term financing in
1981-1983, and outstanding short-term credits reached DH 15.2 billion ($1.9
billion) at the end of 1983. Despite BdM's incentives, the banks continued to
limit their medium and long-term lending operations to industry and several of
them did not reach the mandatory minimum ratio of 4.5% in recent years.
Although medium and long-term outstanding loans by commercial banks more than
doubled since 1979 to reach DR 2.1 billion ($295 million) at the end of 1983,
their share in total medium and long-term credit outstanding increased only
marginally from 16% in 1979 to 19% in 1983. Outstanding medium and long-term
credits by comercial banks include the financial instruments (bond issues
principally) lent to the specialized institutions (in particular BNDE) which
increased from DHl 337 million (*63.2 million) in 1981 to DH 609 million (g97.1
million) in 1982.

4.05     BNDE. BNDE is Morocco's industrial development bank.  Th Moroccan
Government directly controls 34X of BNDE's equity and indirectly another 16X
through publicly contrclled institutions. Foreign shareholders (mostly banks
and IFC) hold 24Z of the share capital, the rest being distributed among
private Moroccan shareholders. ENIDE has substantially recovered from serious
financial difficulties in 1981-1982 and remains a strong financial institution
with a solid experience in project appraisa:   These difficulties were brought
about principally by the high cost of large Eloating rate Euro-currency
borrowings contracted to finance excessive commitments which more than doubled
from 1979 to 1981. Following intensive supervision by the Bank in 1982, a
comprehensive package of measures was agreed upon prior to effectiveness of
the Bank's BNDE IX loan (2037-MOR) of $70 million. PPAR No. 1805, dated
NDvember 23, 1977, covers the fifth loan to BNDE (Ln. 736-11R). The PPAR was
generally appreciative of BNDE's institutional achievements, but singled out a
few areas for improvement. The two main points were the need for more
realistic interest rates, and the dangers inherent in financing large public
sector projects in which BNDE's influence on project design is marginal. They
were taken into account in preparation of future projects; lending rates have
been revised upward, and BNDE now applies the same appraisal criteria to all
projects it finances, public or private, and whether or not financed under a
Bank loan.
4.06     During the commitment period of the proposed loan (1985-1987), BNDE
will continue to use its foreign exchange resources in particular the
BNDE-IX 1/ Bank loan to finance EMI projects. BNDE's direct medium and
long-term credit to industry is projected to reach between 30X and 40% of
investment credit to industry in the next three years, leaving ample room for
other sources of term credit to industry, in particular commercial banks. The
proposed loan would foster greater competition between BNDE and commercial
banks. This increased competition is expected to stimulate BNDE's efforts to
strengthen its pipeline of projects and to lead to a more efficient allocation
of term resources to industry.
4.07     ODI. The Office pour le Developpement Industriel (ODI) is a
Government agency, established in 1973 to promote private and foreign
partnership in industrial projects, take equity participations in projects
with high economic priority, provide technical assistance to its subsidiaries
and other private enterprises, and carry out sector studies. Chapter V
reviews in detail ODI'; structure, performance and operating prospects.
Financing of Industrial Investment
4.08     Financing of Industry.  As shown in table 4.3 below, various sources
of funds are available for financing manufacturing investment. About 45% of
total investment in manufacturing is financed by equity. Outstanding medium
and long-term credit to manufacturing amounted to DH 1.94 billion ($241
1/ The loan is expected to be fully committed by the end of 1985 ($38 million
was uncommitted as of December 1, 1984).

million) at the end of 1983, and is provided mainly by BNDE and commercial
banks. BNDE's share in investment credit to industry was 42% in 1981 2/, with
the rest distributed between commercial banks (24%), suppliers credits (15%),
and leasing (10%). Equity participations in industry are made mainly by ODI,
SKI and BNDE, their investment portfolios were respectively at DH 544 million
($87 million), DR 238 million ($38 million) and DH 125 million ($20 million)
at the end of 1982. There is currently no private investment bank in
Morocco. However, IFC has been pursuing a dialogue with interested
counterparts on establishing a venture capital company during the last few
years.As shown in table 4.4 below, outstanding credit to manufacturing is
mainly short-term. Short-term and medium/long term credit represented
respectively 64% (DR 5.4 billion) and 26Z (DH 1,9 billion) of total
outstanding credit to manufacturing at the end of 1983. The distribution of
short and medium/long-term credit among sectors is uneven. Medium-term credit
represents a relatively high share of total outstanding credit in chemicals
(59%) and food processing (29%), reflecting recent large investments in
phosphate processing plants and in sugar mills. Short-term credit prevails in
traditional sectors like textiles (77%) where a large share of investment is
financed by equity.
1/ Preliminary data indicate a decline of BNIDE's share to about 25% in 1983.

4.09     Financing of EMIs.  Within industry, EKIs are the third largest
recipient of credit (DH 1.3 billion at the end of 1983), behind food and
textiles industries. However, EMIs have received relatively less medium and
long-term credits than other sectors (except construction materials), since
only DR 252 million or 19% of total outstanding credits to EKIs were medium
and long-term credits at the end of 1983 compared to 59% for chemicals, 29%
for food processing, and 23% for textiles. This relatively low priority given
so far by financial institutions to EMIs results to some extent from the
technical complexity of EKI projects. To support the priority assigned by the
Government to EMIs' development, the proposed project aims at increasing
medium and long-term resources for EMIs and at strengthening the appraisal
capabilities of the financial institutions involved in their financing.
Sector Constraints
4.10     Morocco's national savings rate which reached 19% of GPD in the
mid-seventies fell to 11% in 1980-82, and became increasingly unable to cover
investments which averaged 23% of CDP during the same period. The main source
of the decrease in savings were high budget deficits which brought about a
negative Government savings estimated at an average -3% in 1980-82. The gap
between the rates of savings and investment was primarily covered by external
borrowings and reflected in deficits on the current account of the balance of
payments which averaged 13% of GDP in 1981-82. Since Morocco's external
financial situation suggests a limited access to foreign funds in future, it
has become essential to address the issues of increased national savings,
decreased Treasury deficits and greater efficiency of financial intermediation
in order to avoid severe reductions in the investment ratio and their impli-
cations for future economic development. With the objective of addressing
these issues, the Bank has carried out a review of the financial sector in
1983-84. This study assesses the policy environment and formulates recommen-
dations for increasing the level of domestic savings, decreasing Treasury
deficits and improving the efficiency of financial intermediation through
policy reforms in the areas of interest rates, credit policy and capital

market development. The conclusions of the Bank review, summarized below,
have been discussed with the Government, and a reform program in the financial
sector, which could be supported by a possible Bank loan, is being evolved.
4.11     Increasing the Rate of National Savings.  Increased private savings
will depend essentially on improved policies for mobilizing the financial
resources of households and enterprises. The interest rates on term deposits
of three to six months have been negative in real terms during the past ten
years and comparison with other middle income countries (Portugal, Tunisia)
shows that there is still room for raising the ratio of money and quasi-money
to total GDP. Recouimendations to increase the mobilization of savings include
raising interest rates on time deposits, promoting the opening of new bank
offices, encouraging the use of checks and diversifying the range of financial
instruments directly available to savers (e.g., Treasury bonds, bonds issued
by development finance institutions and guaranteed by the Government,
introduction of bonds at variable interest rate). Development of the capital
market through fiscal incentives, like the diminution of the witholding tax on
dividends, should also make a significant contribution to raising the level of
financial savings and ensuring their effective use.
4.12     Decreasing the Treasury Deficits.  Since access to external funds
will be more difficult in future, the Treasury will either have to meet its
needs through faster growth of the money supply with the risk of accelerating
inflation, or to reduce its needs drastically, so as not to crowd out credit
to the productive sectors. Several measures were recommended for reducing the
budget deficit, increasing public savings and improving the mobilization of
the Treasury financial resources. These measures include: (i) continuing
current efforts to control the growth of personnel expenditures in the Central
Government; (ii) gradually reducing the budgetary impact of subsidies on con-
sumer goods and trim operating subsidies for enterprises; (iii) improving the
efficiency of the authorities in collecting taxes and managing the tax system;
(iv) financing a greater proportion of the Treasury deficit by selling short-
term instruments on the money market, and issuing public debt instruments with
competitive terms; (v) reforming the system of exchange risk coverage to
lessen the cost to the Treasury and pass on a larger share of the risk to the
financial intermediaries and the ultimate borrowers; and (vi) clearing up the
arrears of public sector enterprises to alleviate the serious cash-flow diffi-
culties they cause to their suppliers and clients. These measures would help
to better control Government revenues and expenses, develop the money and
capital markets, bring about a net increase in financial savings, and
alleviate the deposit banks' obligation to purchase Treasury issues.
4.13     Improving the Efficiency of Financial Intermediation.  The allocation
of credit in the economy is strongly influenced by selective credit policies
operating through a number of instruments; exemptions from lending ceilings,
rediscounting beyond the normal ceiling, allocation of funds on preferential
terms to the specialized financial institutions, special rediscount rates,
differentiation of lending rates set by the authorities, and government
subsidies. The benefits attaching to such selective credit impose high costs
on the Treasury, the Bank of Morocco, the banking system, depositors, and the
recipients of nonrselective credit. They also contribute to the fragmentation
of the financial market and create distortions that have negative consequences
for efficient utilization of financial resources. New credit policies recom-
mended by the Bank to lower their cost and lessen the differences they create



- 25 -
between different types of credit, include: (i) the progressive reduction of
the differences between preferential and non-preferential interest rates; (ii)
the elimination of interest rate subsidies for industry and housing credits;
and (iii) improving access to credit of small and medium enterprises.
4.14     Specific recommendations were also made to develop medium and long-
term lending by commercial banks. A major cause for the limited role played
so far by the commercial banks in this area appears to be the higher spread
(6-7Z) that commercial banks enjoy on short-term credits compared to medium
and long-term credits (about 2X). This results from the low interest rates
(about 4%) paid on the Treasury issues which commercial banks are required to
subscribe to for at least 30% of all their deposits (para 4.03). Since term
resources bear an average cost of about 10%, the banks' average intermediation
spread on medium-term is lower; this discourages them from attracting time
deposits. Other factors explaining the limited interest of commercial banks
in term lending include their unwillingness to assume the greater risk
inherent in medium and long-term operations, and the administrative delays
that sometimes result from the requirement that BNDE review and endorse all
medium term loans to industry before they become eligible for rediscount. To
address these issues the Bank report made several recommendations designed to
increase the mobilization of savings while making term-lending more attractive
to commercial banks. These measures include inter-alia:
(a) the liberalization of interest rates on time deposits with maturities
of twelve months or more to increase the mobilization of long-term
resources;
(b)  an adjustable interest rate for medium and long-term credits to
permit a more flexible link between interest rates and inflation;.
Cc) a reduction of obligatory placements by the banks in low-yield
Government securities.  This reduction would increase the profit
margin of commercial banks on time deposits: the mandatory ratio of
30% currently imposed on all deposits would be maintained on sight
deposits, reduced to 15% and 10% respectively on time deposits of
three and six months, and eliminated on time deposits of twelve
months and more. Thus, the level of mandatory placement requirements
at low interest rates imposed on the banks would be relatively lower,
and the proportion of funds available for lending at attractive terms
relatively higher in time deposits than in sight deposits; and
(d) the progressive liberalization of bank commissions.
These measures are expected to offset the profitability differential in favor
of short-term credit and make time deposits and term lending more remunerative
for commercial banks. In line with these recommendations, the proposed loan
would extend an attractive spread and other incentives which are expected to
make commercial banks more responsive to long-term industrial financing (para
6.07).

Interest Rates and Cost of Capital
4.15     The Interest Rate Structure.  The Government determines interest rate
ceilings on both deposits received and loans granted by financial institutions.
The interest rate structure was overhauled on April 1, 1982 in consultation
with the IMF, and subsequent adjustments were made in September 1983. The new
structure is detailed in Annex 2. Interest rates were increased on the
average by one percent on term deposits to attract more savings, and lending
rates by 2% because of higher inflation and increased cost of borrowing for
financial institutions. As a result, term deposits increased by 25% in 1982,
as compared with only 12% for sight deposits. However the global savings rate
of the economy remained too low to sustain the growth of investment (para
4.10), and additional measures to increase the mobilization of savings were
recommended by the Bank (para 4.11).
4.16     Cost of Resources.  The cost to the commercial banks of local
currency resources varies widely depending on their maturity: sight deposits
yield no interest, except for repatriated savings of Moroccan workers abroad
(8% p.a.) and insurance companies (4% p.a.); short-term deposits yield from
4.5% p.a. for one-month deposits to 10.5% for 18 month deposits, and there is
no ceiling for deposits maturing beyond 18 months. The basic rediscount rate
of the BdM is 7%, with some exceptions for commercial paper for agriculture
and exports (5%). Local currency bonds carry interest rates up to 11.5% p.a.
and can be issued only by specialized financial institutions (CIH, BNDE, CDG,
CNCA) and large public enterprises. Direct borrowings abroad by specialized
institutions must be approved by the Government, which bears the exchange risk
but not the risk on variable interest rates.
4.17     Nominal and Effective Lending Rates.  The maximum rates charged-by
commercial banks on rediscountable loans were increased in 1982 and 1983 to
10% from 9% p.a. for short-term loans, and to 12% from 10% for medium-term
loans. BNDE, the major source of industrial financing, now charges 14% for
all its loans, (except for leasing where the rate is 15%). The effective cost
of capital (after commissions and taxes of about 2%) for industrial projects
approved under the Investment Code vary from 14% whether financed by
rediscountable medium-term loans from commercial banks or by BNDE 1/, to 16%
when financed by direct long-term loans from commercial banks. The effective
cost of capital for Bank-financed EMI subloans will be at least the minimum
ongoing effective rate paid for long-term loans to industry (at present BNDE's
rate of 14%).
4.18     Interest rates have been positive in real terms in recent years, with
the exception of 1981. Inflation as measured by the cost-of-living index
remained constantly below 11% during the period 1978-1981 (except for 12.5% in
1981), and has been declining thereafter (10% and 6.5% in 1982 and 1983
respectively). The current effective rate of 14% is expected to remain above
the projected inflation rate averaging 9.5% p.a. during the commitment life of
the proposed project (1985-1987).

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. The Participating Commercial Banks
5.01     Six commercial banks would participate in the proposed loan:  Banque
Commerciale du Maroc MM), Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur (BMCE),
Banque Marocaine pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (BMCI), Credit du Maroc
(CDr), Compagnie Narocaine de Credit et de Banque (CMCB), and Societe Generale
Marocaine de Banques (SGMB). These banks had total assets of DR 19.6 billion
($3.1 billion) at the end of 1982, representing 66% of Morocco's commercial
banks' total assets. As in the case of other commercial banks (para 4.02),
their assets are mainly short-term loans and their liabilities sight
deposits. They are efficiently and profitably run, their management is of
good quality and generally free of major Government interference.
5.02     Profitability.  As indicated in Annex 3, the profitability of
commercial banks has been satisfactory during the 1980-1982 period. The ratio
of profits before taxes to total assets (1.1Z) compares favorably with that of
several OECD countries. mhis is mainly due to the high spread of
intermediation of commercial banks which averaged 5.0X in 1980-82. The ratio
of operating costs to total assets which averaged 3.1% during the same period
is in line with the 2.5% to 3.5% ratio achieved in most OECD countries.
However the level of provisions is relatively high compared to other countries
and the equity base generally lower, indicating that part of the provisions
should be considered as reserves and a higher share of profit should be
allocated to reserves in order to increase the ratio of equity to total
assets. The sizeable profit margin shows that there is scope for increasing
rates on time deposits and expanding medium-term credit activities by
c-omercial banks despite the higher risk and less attractive margins attached
to these activities. The profitability of the six commercial banks
participating to the proposed project compares favorably with the rest of the
banking system. Their average ratio of profits before taxes to total assets
reached 1.3Z in 1982 as compared to 1.1% for the overall commercial banking
system, and their net profits ranged from DH 8.0 million ($1.28 million) to DH
33.4 million ($5.3 million), averaging between 0.55Z and 0.85% of total assets.
5.03     Appraisal Capability.  The appraisal capability of commercial banks
is satisfactory. The commercial banks have developed a substantial experience
in project appraisal for the medium-term loans for industry rediscounted with
the Central Bank after review and approval by BNDE, as well as under the
Bank-financed SSI loans.  In 1982, nine commercial banks appraised 281 SSI
projects representing a total investment cost of DH 214 million ($36 million),
out of which 135 were financed under the Bank-financed SSI-1 project by
subloans totalling $16.8 million, and appraised according to the guidelines of
a stardard comprehensive format which had been prepared by the Bank. The six
banks which would participate in the proposed project are among the most
active in term lending to industry and have competent staff to appraise
projects. The appraisal mission reviewed several appraisal reports 1/
1/ Project File, item 3.



- 28 -
prepared by the six barks for rediscountable medium-term loans and for SSI
projects in the EMI sector, and found that their quality is generally
adequate. Other appraisal reports of medium-size projects in the EMI sector
reviewed during negotiations indicated that the appraisal standards of some
commercial banks, in particular BMCE and CDM, need further strengthening in
particular concerning the quality of their market analysis and economic
appraisal. Each participating bank has at least three financial analysts, two
economists/market analysts and two engineers assigned to project appraisal.
In addition, one bank (CMCB) has created an Industry Department with seven
sectoral divisions, including an EMI division staffed with competent financial
analysts and economists and an EMI engineer; another bank (BMCI) has hired a
consulting engineering firm on a permanent basis to advise on the technical
viability of the projects it finances. The review by the Bank of all EMI
subprojects submitted under the proposed loan would ensure an adequate quality
control of appraisal reports prepared by the commercial banks. Moreover, the
subsector studies in the EMI sector which ODI would develop under the project
would help the banks in their market analysis (para 6.13).
5.04     Previous Bank Operations with Commercial Banks.  The Bank has made
two loans (amounting to $57.1 million net of cancellations) for the financing
of SSI projects through commercial banks and BNDE.  The SSI 1 loan (1687-MOR)
of $25 million was channelled through nine commercial banks and BNDE. The
loan was fully committed before appraisal estimates, and closed in July 1984.
The SSI 2 loan (2038-MOR) of $70 million which became effective in February
1983 is being channelled through eleven commercial banks and BNDE.
B. Office pour le Developpement Industriel (ODI) 1/
a. Structure and Organization
5.05     Statute and Role.  ODI is a public autonomous agency created in 1973
whose main responsibilities have been to (i) undertake project pre-feasibility
studies to assist potential investors; (ii) provide technical assistance to
enterprises (SSIs in particular); (iii) promote the association of the
Moroccan private sector with foreign partners; and (iv) take equity
participations in priority projects which may have difficulties at the outset
in attracting private shareholders. ODI thus combines the role of a public
industrial extension service agency providing non-commercial services,
including technical assistance, and the role of an investment bank providing
equity funds and management consulting. ODI currently receives limited
Government funding, principally to compensate for its public service
activities.
5.06     Management and Staff.  ODI's Board comprises the Prime Minister
(Chairman), the Minister of Industry (Vice-Chairman) and other ministers and
representatives from institutions like BNDE and CDG. A four-member Executive
1/ This section is largely based on the findings of a report on ODI prepared
by the Bank at the request of the Bank by the Minister of Comerce,
Industry and Tourism. The report, which consists of a financial and
institutional appraisal of ODI, is available in the project file, item 4.



- 29 -
Coumittee is headed by the Minister of Industry and includes representatives
from the ministries of Finance, Plan and Agriculture. Due to the senior
Government positions of most of its members, it has been difficult to convene
regular Board meetings in recent years. ODI's Policy Statement, to be
approved by ODI's Board before loan effectiveness, would be useful in
delegating authority to ODI's Executive Committee (para 6.17). ODI's
management comprises a Director-General and a Secretary-General. The present
Director-General has occupied various senior positions in the Government
(Director of Industry, Secretary of State to Economic Affairs) before his
current appointment in 1977.   He has developed a sound organization and
closely follows-up every project financed by ODI. The Secretary-General, de
facto a Deputy Director-General, coordinates ODI's operations and works in
close consultation with the Director-General.
5.07     ODI's organization chart is simple and well tailored to ODI's needs.
It comprises five technical (food processing, textiles, ENIs, chemicals, and
SSIs) and three general departments. The Finance Department, in charge of
ODI's financial management, follow-up of participations and review of
financial appraisals of projects, is well organized and is currently
strengthening its capacity to review financial appraisal of projects. The
Promotion Department, well staffed with nine professionals, and ODI's five
foreign offices focus on the identification of foreign and local investors,
and have contributed to the realization of many industrial projects with
foreign partnership in Morocco. The SSI -Technical Assistance Department,
which comprises 12 Moroccan professionals, assists SSIs in organizing their
production process and trains entrepreneurs in basic accounting and
management. Among the technical departments, the strongest are the Textile
(five engineers and four economists) and Food processing (four engineers).
The Chemical Department is understaffed and weaker.
5.08     The EMI Department, headed by an experienced engineer has been
instrumental in the promotion of EMI development. ODI funded and directed in
1976-78, with the assistance of consultants, a major study of EMI development
strategy which led to the identification of promising ideas for the
development of capital goods industries. In addition to its direct
participations in four ODI-sponsored projects, it promoted several innovative
projects undertaken by the private sector and benefiting from the department's
technical assistance. The department has prepared 14 pre-feasibility studies
for projects capable of attracting private investors and representing an
investment of DH 40.8 million ($6.8 million). ODI's dynamic role in the
identification and promotion of EMI projects is unique in Morocco, and would
be essential for the successful implementation of an EMI-focused development
program. However, ODI's EMI department is understaffed with only three
engineers and two temporary young analysts. In order to fully develop its
potential, it needs to strengthen its engineering and project appraisal
capacity (para 6.18).
5.09     i)  Extension Activities of ODI. They mainly comprise project
studies, technical assistance to enterprises, and promotion of local and
foreign partnership in industrial projects. ODI's technical departments
usually undertake a study on a particular project at the request of the



- 30 -
Government, a private entrepreneur or ODI's management. The completed study
is either filed until investors show enough interest, or the project may be
implemented with an ODI equity investment if capital subscriptions from the
private sector prove to be insufficient. The technical part of ODI's project
studies is generally adequate. The quality of the market and financial
assessments needs to be substantially improved; the subsector studies to be
prepared by ODI with the assistance of specialized firms and financed under
the proposed project will help ODI in this respect (para 6.15). In addition,
ODI offers technical assistance to SSIs and to the firms where it holds
minority equity participations; this assistance, generally well received by
the entrepreneurs, is effective, in particular for technical and management
problems. The legal and fiscal assistance to enterprises could, however, be
improved.
ii) Investment Activities. While the 1973-77 period was for ODI a
period of intensive investments in large public projects promoted on behalf of
the Government, it has adopted, since the appointment of the new Director-
General in 1977, a new policy aimed at: (a) restraining carefully the growth
of its operating costs; (b) focussing on the identification of private and
foreign investors; and (c) investing selectively in a limited number of small
and medium scale private projects through minority participations. ODI
closely supervises its majority participations, through its representatives on
their boards, and provides them with advisory services remunerated by
management fees.  Its affiliates are in close contact with ODI's staff and
report on their activities every quarter. ODI has initiated a budget control
system for each of its participations, comprising the review of annual plans
of activities and financial forecasts and the preparation of monthly
statements which would allow ODI, and more importantly the company itself, to
monitor the implementation and achievements of the planned activities.
5.10     Pblicy.  The review of ODI's activities and procedures has identified
the need for a Policy Statement providing detailed guidelines for its
operational and financial policies. ODI's Pblicy Statement would be a
comprehensive and essential document to allow ODI to play effectively its role
of industrial promotion and development, to maintain ODI's financial soundness
and to ensure the quality of projects financed (para 6.17). It would also
constitute a clear framework to guide the actions and plans of ODI's
management and staff, and would be useful in delegating authority to ODI's
Executive Committee by the Board (para 5.06). Recommendations in the critical
areas of Ci) operational policy, in particular scope of activity and
procedures for selection of projects; and (ii) financial policy and
objectives, were discussed with ODI's management during the appraisal
mission. ODI's management sent to the Bank for comments a preliminary draft
of the Policy Statement partly based on these discussions. Bank comments was
conveyed to ODI to permit the preparation of a final draft before
negotiations. This final draft, which reflects most of Bank comments was
reviewed during negotiations and found satisfactory. The approval of the
Policy Statement by ODI's Board will be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan.



- 31 -
b. Financial Performance
5.11     As a public autonomous agency, ODI has a commercial accounting system
with a balance sheet and an income statement, and like all public agencies, it
presents an annual budget and financing plan for approval by the Ministry of
Finance. However, ODI's accounts have not been independently audited, and the
financial control by the Government 1/ does not provide a full analysis of the
equity portfolio, with in particular an opinion on the adequacy of the level
of provisions. To correct this situation, ODI's accounts will be audited as
of 1984 by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank (para 6.17).
5.12     Profitability.  As detailed in Annex 4, ODI's income statement
reflects ODI's activities as a financial intermediary and as a technical
assistance agency: revenues from investment activities consist mainly of
dividends, interest on capital loans and management fees; technical assistance
and promotion activities, however, are not compensated by direct beneficiaries
but by limited Government allowances. Operating expenses are mostly salaries,
and financial charges have been small. ODI's internal revenues covered 82Z of
total expenses, and Government transfers were limited to an average of DH 7.8
million p.a. during the 1980-1983 period. Government transfers, which have
allowed ODI to provide efficient industrial promotion and technical assistance
services, should gradually disappear as ODI's income from investments will
increasingly cover its technical assistance and promotion costs, and generate
sufficient cash for new investments (para 5.15). Moreover, ODI's has moved
since 1983 toward more rigorous financial practices such as the build-up of
provisions for foreign exchange losses (DH 4.7 million) and losses on equity
(DH 3.6 million). These sound practices are expected to continue, and
independant auditors will review ODI's accounts as of 1984 and assess the
adequacy of the level of provisions.
5.13     Financial Position.  ODI's unaudited balance sheets for the 1980-1983
period are detailed in Annex 5. ODI's total assets of DH 635 million ($79
million) at the end of 1983 comprise essentially equity participations for DH
557 million ($69 million) and capital loans for DH 49 million ($6.1 million);
total liabilities comprise essentially Government funds for DH 558 million
($69 million), which are not repayable to the Government and can be considered
as equity, and a loan from the European Investment Bank for DR 29 million
outstanding ($3.6 million). Total assets increased by only 13% between 1980
and 1983, as a result of ODI's new policy of minority investments in a limited
number of private projects; ODI's annual investments decreased from an
average DH 95 million during 1973-77 to DH 33 million in 1980-83. This new
policy permitted ODI to finance its new investments entirely from its internal
funds in 1983, as compared with an average 46% in 1980-82. ODI is expected to
continue this policy and gradually become completely independent from
Government funding of its investment (para 5.17). The Policy Statement would
reflect this orientation.

c. Portfolio.
5.14     Quality of Portfolio.  The equity portfolio comprises 33
participations, of which eleven in agro-industries (5Z of total portfolio),
six in EKI enterprises (6%), four in chemical and para-chemical industries
(602), nine in textile enterprises (28X) and three in engineering and
financial institutions (12). The financial yield of the investment portfolio
averaged 1.6X during the 1980-1983 period. This rather low return is due to
ODI's past policy of taking majority participations in large risky projects
during the period 1973-77. 7he investment portfolio is heavily concentrated
in four large public companies where ODI holds more than 502 of the capital
and which represented 83Z of ODI's portfolio at the end of 1983. CIOR, the
largest ODI's single participation (36% of portfolio) 1/, has suffered heavy
foreign exchange losses on external borrowings, but it has good prospects and
should start paying first dividends in 1986; IODZ, a textile project (27% of
portfolio) has become profitable in 1983 following a major restructuring
initiated by ODI and backed by BNDE, but is not expected to pay dividends
before end 1988 given high differed depreciation resulting from past losses;
SNEP (17% of portfolio) has been profitable since 1982 after having
experienced various difficulties due to inadequate design and is expected to
pay its first dividends in 1986. SIMEF, an EKI project (3% of portfolio),
should start paying dividends in 1985. Annex 6 reviews in detail the results
and operating prospects of each of those four companies. Since 1978, ODI has
concentrated its investments in smaller private sponsored projects where it
usually takes minority participations which are generally below DH 2 million
($0.3 million) and 252 of project equity, and thus represent much lower
risks. As a result, the private sector portfolio increased from DH 14.8
million ($3.4 million) or 3% of total portfolio in 1980 to DH 40.4 million
($5.0 million) at end 1983 (7Z of portfolio).
d. Prospects
5.15     The period 1984-1988 should  bring to ODI a desirable independence
from Gover nent subsidies and a continuing improvement of its financial
situation. ODI's projected income statements detailed in Annex 7 show that
the income from portfolio should increase by 72% between 1984 and 1985 and
expand regularly thereafter to reach DH 27.6 million in 1988. Moderate
Government transfers of DH 6.9 million, representing 23% of ODI's average
total income, are still provisioned for 1985 and 1986, to enable ODI to
progressively increase its volume of operations and strengthen its financial
position at the time it becomes self-reliant. Following the elimination of
Government transfers after 1986, ODI's net profits are projected to reach DH
3.1 million in 1987 and DHi 5.3 million in 1988. These encouraging prospects
are primarily due to ti) an increase in the income from portfolio as first
dividend payments from some large participations (in particular CIOR, SNEP,
and SIMEF) would materialize (Annex 6); and (ii) the continuing tight control
of ODI's administrative expenses.

1977.



- 33 -
5.16     ODI's projected balance sheets are detailed in Annex 8. ODI has
projected a moderate level of new investments for the period 1984-88 (about DH
36 million p.a. equivalent to $4.2 million), and its total assets are expected
to grow by about 3% p.a. to DH 710 million ($88 million) at the end of 1988.
Long-term debt would continue to grow but remain below 10% of total
liabilities throughout the period. ODI has already demonstrated that it could
be considered as a reliable partner for potential external lenders; it has
received a first loan from the European Investment Bank in 1980 1/. ODI would
reinforce its policy, initiated in 1983, of provisions for risks of losses on
equity investments. The level of provisions is projected to increase steadily
to reach 3.8% of total portfolio at the end of 1988. The auditors will assess
the adequacy of the level of provisions on the basis of their review of ODI's
portfolio.
5.17     ODI's increasing profitability and more systematic borrowing policy
should eliminate all cost-free Government allocations after 1986 (Annex 7).
In order to follow prudent financial practices (which are reflected in the
Policy Statement), ODI's borrowings should not exceed 35% of its new
investments, and its debt-service should not exceed one-third of its portfolio
revenues. Investment banks operating with sound portfolios usually borrow
about half of the resources necessary to finance their new investments;
however, ODI's portfolio is heavily concentrated in four large public sector
companies and although prospects for these firms are good, a somewhat more
stringent limit on borrowings should be applied. A limit of 35Z appears
reasonable, thus penmitting ODI to borrow up to about DH 63 million ($7.4
million) in 1984-88 for total projected investments of Dl 179 million.
Similarly, considering that about half of ODI's portfolio revenues should be
reinvested and one-sixth provisioned, up to one-third of the revenues could be
utilized for debt-service; ODI's projected annual portfolio revenue of DH 22
million p.a. would thus permit coverage of the debt-service on the average
outstanding debt of DH 46 million according to this guideline. Finally, in
view of the average time profile of returns on standard equity investments in
Morocco which generally do not generate dividends before the fifth year after
first investment outlays, it would seem appropriate that loans to ODI for
financing equity investments be repaid over 15 years with a grace period of
five years, and bear an interest rate of about 10%.
5.18     ODI's future policy will continue to favor the promotion of the
private sector and limit annual investments to about Dl 36 million p.a. ($4.2
million). The private sector portfolio is expected to increase by an average
31Z p.a. during the period 1984-88 and to reach DR 157 million at the end of
1988, or 23Z of total portfolio as compared to 7Z at end 1983. This prudent
strategy of limited investments and more systematic association with the
private sector is expected to gradually eliminate ODI's dependence upon
Government support and increase the average yield of ODI's total portfolio As
shown in Table 5.1 below, this yield would nevertheless remain modest (4% in
1988) mainly because some of ODI's large investments which accumulated
1/ Loan of 5 million ECU ($6 million) made through the Treasury at favorable
terms (25 years; 2% interest rate) to finance equity participations
ranging between $0.25 and 1.8 million.



- 34 -
important losses in the past will need some time to consolidate their
financial position before starting to pay dividends 1/. ODI is expected to
take additional measures to further improve the yield of its portfolio, in
particular (i) to finance whenever possible part of its new project fundings
through capital loans in order to ensure a minimum stream of regular revenues;
and (ii) to require that all projects it finances have a minimum IRR. ODI's
Policy Statement, agreed during negotiations, includes the above principles on
financial and operational policies (para 6.17).

will be strergthened with two additional engineers, the commendable
performance realized so far by ODI in promoting industrial projects in
association with private and foreign investors and providing technical
assistance, its improving financial situation increasingly free from
Government subsidies, and its pipeline of 10 EMI subprojects representing a
total equity investment of DH 64 million ($7.5 million) for 1985-87 argue in
favor of supporting ODI through a subloan to finance equity participati...s in
EMI projects.
1/ As detailed in Annex 6, three of ODI's four large participations in public
sector companies were profitable in 1983 (total profits before taxes of DH
22 million). However, due to projected recovery of differed depreciation
in 1984-85, no dividend payments to ODI are expected before 1986 (except
DH 3.2 million from SIMEF in 1985).

VI. THE NROJECT
Project Justification, Objectives and Components
6.01     The objectives of the proposed project are:
a.   to support the industrial and technological development of EMIs;
b.   to promote term industrial lending by commercial banks and increase
the efficiency of financial sector intermediation; and
c.   to strengthen ODI's effectiveness in industrial promotion and improve
its policies and quality of project financing.
These objectives are in line with the priorities set by the GDvernment for the
EMI sector in the 1981-1985 Plan and support the Bank strategy for industry in
Morocco (para 2.11). They are also in line with the recommendations of the
Bank report on the Financial Sector which calls for basic reforms, including
fostering more competition by financial intermediaries in term financing to
industry (para. 4.14). The proposed project would provide support to the
Government policy of deepening the industrial base of the Moroccan economy and
alleviating pressure on the balance of payments through efficient import
substitution and increased exports of EMI products. It would also provide
adequate medium and long-term financing to EMIs, a prerequisite for the
effective development of the sector. Such financing has so far been limited
both because of the higher complexity of EMI projects (para. 4.09), and
distorsions in the financial sector which discouraged commercial banks from
undertaking such financing (para. 4.14)
6.02     The project would be supported by a loan of $25.1 million (including
the capitalized front-end fee of about $60,000) to the Kingdom of Morocco with
the following components:
-i) a line of credit of $22 million to be onlent through six selected
commercial banks for about 40 eligible subprojects in EMIs; and
(ii)  a subsidiary loan of $3 million onlent to ODI and consisting of $2.8
million for financing equity participations in about six eligible EMI
subprojects (many of which would also receive subloans from
participating commercial banks), and $0.2 million for technical
assistance for EMI sub-sectoral studies.
The proposed loan amount is based on a conservative estimate of the pipeline
of identified EMI subprojects (para 3.14). It would be repaid over 17 years
including a grace period of 4 years.



- 36 -
A. Line of credit to Commercial Banks
6.03     Eligibility Criteria.  All EMI subsectors will be eligible for
financing under the loan. Most projects are expected to be for efficient
import substitution of capital goods and supplies and for exports in light
engineering industries. Projects involving assembly of consumer durable goods
usually have low local value added and are unlikely to meet the FRR and ERR
requirements under this loan (para 6.04). EMI subprojects meeting size and
employment criteria for SSI financing will not be eligible under the proposed
loan since SSI Bank loans specifically designed for such projects 1/ are in
place.
6.04     EMI subprojects would also meet the following criteria:
a.   in line with Government policy of fostering private investment, the
loan would emphasize financing projects promoted by private
enterprises; projects with majority public shareholding would be
limited to expansion or modernization of existing firms to ensure
that Bank's financing be confined to firms with an established record
of profitability and economic viability; the total amount of financing
under the proposed loan for such public sector enterprises would be
limited to $5 million;
b.   their total investment cost should not be more than DR 50 million
($5.9 million);
c.   they should have a minimum FRR and ERR of 12% in real terms; and
d.   equity should represent at least 40% of total investment cost for new
projects and 30% for expansion of existing firms.
These criteria were reviewed and agreed during negotiations, and recorded in
the Loan Agreement.
6.05     Use of Loan Proceeds.  The Bank loan would be onlent to six selected
commercial banks (BQM, BMCE, BICI, CDM, CMCB and SGQB) which have developed a
good pipeline of EMI projects (para 3.14), and have demonstrated an interest
for the development of the EMI sector as well as an appraisal capability in
medium and long-term lending to industry (para 5.03). The amount of the
credit line would be divided among participating banks, each bank receiving a
specific share based on its pipeline of projects. To permit flexibility and
foster competition, the banks would have the possibility to review their
shares annually, on the basis of their respective commitments; such a review
would, if the Treasury agrees, lead to a reallocation of funds between
participating banks or to the cancellation of all or part of the allocated
amounts if an agreement between the banks and the Treasury is not possible.
To ensure a rapid utilization of the Bank loan, the banks would pay a
comuitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum on the unwithdrawn portion of the
line of credit. These arrangements and the amounts originally allocated
1/ Projects with a maximum asset size of DH 6.5 million ($0.8 million) and
maximum cost per job of DE 110,000 (g12,900). $33 million remained
uncomuitted under the SSI 2 loan as of December 1, 1984.

to each of the participating banks were confirmed during negotiations and
would be reflected in the standard agreements to be signed between the
Treasury and the participating commercial banks (para 6.08) 1/.
6.06     Rules for Subproject Financing and Onlending.  The loan proceeds will
finrnce the direct and indirect foreign exchange costs of eligible EMI
sub-projects. The average foreign exchange components of EMI investments in
Morocco is estimated to be about 60%. In the interest of administrative
simplicity, the total amount of all Bank financed sub-loans for a project,
when added to Bank financed ODI equity participations in that project would be
limited to 60% of the sub-project total investment cost 2/. In order to
finance a sufficient number of subprojects and to ensure that the subprojects
would remain within the commercial banks' risk and appraisal capacity, the
total amount of all Bank financed subloans for any individual subproject,
added to Bank financing of ODI's equity participations in that project when
relevant, would be further limited to $2.5 million. The criteria for granting
protection to subprojects financed by subloans or OD's equity participations
(para 3.20), including its nature and duration, would conform to the policy
recently agreed with the Bank under the Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment
loan (Loan 2377-NOR) 3/. These arrangements were agreed during negotiations
and are recorded in the Loan Agreement.
6o.07    The terms of individual subloans would be in line with the economic
life and the financial viability of the subprojects with a maximum of 12 years
including a grace period of up to three years. The interest rates effectively
paid by the final borrowers would be no less than the minimum effective
interest rate prevailing at the time of sub-loan approval for long-term loans
to industry (para 4.17), and are expected to remain positive in real terms, on
the basis of projected inflation, during the coming years (para 4.18). The
line of credit would be repaid by commercial banks to the Treasury according
to a composite amortization schedule reflecting the amortization periods of
individual sub-loans and would bear the Bank interest rate prevailing at the
time the Bank loan is signed. Thus, an overall spread of about 3.5%
(including commissions and fees) would be available to the selected banks.
This spread has been confirmed as attractive by commercial banks and is
expected to promote long-term industrial lending by commercial banks. These
arrangements were discussed during negotiations and recorded in the loan
Agreement. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan.
However, in order to lessen the cost of the exchange risk coverage to the
Treasury the commercial banks will pay a flat foreign exchange fee of 1% of
the amount of each sub-loan. The banks would pass on this fee to the ultimate
borrowers. A comprehensive reform of the exchange risk coverage is
1/ The cost of commitment fees would under these agreements be borne by the
Treasury until signature of the agreements (about $15,000 per month).
2/ Including permanent working capital, but excluding the cost of land.
3/ Detailed in paragraph 16 of the Government's Statement of Development
Policy.



- 38 -
being discussed with the Government in the context of a package of measures in
the financial sector (para 4.12), which could be supported by a possible Bank
loan. The Government will bear the interest rate risk. The agreements
reached on the foreign exchange risk are reflected in the Loan agreements.
6.08     Financing Scheme.  The administration of the loan would be the
responsibility of the Treasury. Subproject appraisal reports would be
prepared by participating banks and include at least the information and
analysis detailed in a minimum format for subproject appraisal prepared with
Bank assistance. 11 Since this is the first projec. wit!, Bank financing of
non-SSI projects appraised by commercial banks, there will be no free limit.
Thus the Bank will be able to ensure that subproject appraisals meet
acceptable standards. Participating banks would sign with the Treasury
standard agreements specifying their commitments, the eligibility criteria of
subprojects and the onlending terms of subloans. The draft of this agreement,
which was reviewed during negotiations, is expected to be finalized rapidly.
Signature of such agreements satisfactory to the Bank by at least two banks
and for a total amount representing not less than $13 million equivalent (or
about two-thirds of the credit line) would be a condition of effectiveness.
Signature of such an agreement with each remaining bank would be a
disbursement condition for sub-loans made by that particular bank.
6.09     Appraisal Standards and Formats.  The subproject appraisal reports to
be prepared by the participating banks and ODI and reviewed by the Bank would
include, among others, the following information:
a.   the description of goods to be produced, and their relative weight in
total project output;
b.   the structure of the enterprise ownership;
c.   the composition of the foreign exchange and total investment costs,
and the financing plan for the project;
d.   a detailed analysis of the local demand for goods to be produced, and
of the sub-project's markets and marketing arrangements;
e.   a detailed description of the protection granted, or to be granted,
to the subprojects' output, specifying the duties and taxes levied on
competing imports and, if any, the quantitative restrictions
protection (import licensing); and
f.   a detailed study of the financial and economic viaoility of the
project including the computation of the FRR and ERR.

6.10     Procurement and Disbursements.  In view of the small size of the
expected contracts and individual investment items, procurement under the
project will follow the normal procedures used under previous Bank loans to
the DFC sector which have been satisfactory and where the inherent
self-interest of the entrepreneurs has led to general international bidding or
shopping. EMI equipment purchases would thus be made on the basis of a
comparison of at least three price quotations from suppliers/contractors.
Civil works contracts for subprojects are expected to be made on the basis of
three price quotations. However, where industrial promoters have construction
capability, and find more economical, to execute civil works themselves, such
works would be authorized by the Bank. In such cases, the participating banks
which have a sizeable experience in local construction costs will be able to
effectively evaluate construction costs and to verify that they conform with
the current norms.
6.11     Disbursements under the credit line for projects receiving Bank funds
through subloans, would be against 60% of all expenditures incurred for goods,
works and services under approved subprojects. Disbursements for equity
participations would be made against 100% of amounts paid by ODI on account of
sub-project expenditures. Disbursements for technical assistance to ODI (para
6.15) would be made against 100% of foreign expenditures and 85% of local
expenditures. Disbursements would be made on the basis of standard
documentation except for expenses with a contract value below $100,000
equivalent for which disbursements wozld be allowed against statements of
expenditures. In order to expedite disbursements for sub-loans and equity
participations a Special Account in Dirhams for an amount equivalent to $3
million (or 4 months of peak disbursements) will be established in the
Treasury. This fund will be replenished on the basis of standard
documentation or statements of expenditures for eligible expenditures. These
arrangements are reflected in the legal documents. The estimated disbursement
schedule of the loan, based on standard disbursement profiles for the
EMENA/DFC sector, is given in Annex 9.  The final date for submission of
sub-projects to the Bank would be December 31, 1987 and the closing date would
be December 31, 1990.
6.12     Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing of up to $2,000,000
would be provided to finance eligible expenditures on about 5 subprojects,
where payments would have been made after August 1, 1984.
6.13     Reporting, Accounts and Auditing.  Participating commercial banks and
ODI would prepare semi-annual progress reports on subprojects during
implementation and during the first three years of subprojects' operations.
These reports would indicate the performance of individual subprojects against
anticipated targets (production, sales, financial situation), and follow-up
measures to improve performance. The progress reports would be provided by
the banks and ODI to the Treasury and made available for review by the Bank's
supervision missions. The Treasury would cause the project accounts to be
maintained, would have these accounts and the Special Account audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and would furnish the audit
reports to the Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year.



- 40 -
Separate accounts would be maintained by the commercial banks for the
sub-loans extended by them under the project, and by ODI for equity
investments and prxnotion activities.  These accounts would be submitted
semi-annually to the Treasury and be available for review by Bank's
supervision missions. They would also be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and furnished to the Bank within four months of the end
of each fiscal year. Agreement on these audit requirements was reached during
negotiations, and is recorded in the Loan Agreement.
B. Subsidiary loan to ODI
6.14     Credit Line. The Office pour le Developpement Industriel (ODI),
would strengthen its support to the industrial sector, and particularly to the
EMIs under the proposed project. ODI's pipeline of projects currently
contains 10 EMI projects (Annex 1) representing a total investment cost of DH
450 million and requiring a total equity of DU 222 million. In accordance
with its investment policies (para 5.18), ODI intends to take minority equity
participations (generally below one-third) in those projects for a total of DR
64 million (US$7.5 million). To support ODI's role in promoting the
development of ENIs, a subsidiary loan of 03 million would be made available
to ODI by the Treasury and comprise (i) $2.8 million to finance ODI's equity
participations in EMIs; and (ii) $0.2 mill-in for EMI subsector studies (para
6.15). Subprojects sponsored by ODI should meet the following eligibility
criteria:
a.   the general subproject criteria of paras 6.03 and 6.04; and
b.  ODI's participation would not exceed half of the share capital to be
raised on the acount of the subproject; and
C.   Bank financing of equity on each subproject should not exceed 35% of
the share capital to be raised on account of the subproject, and
would be added to the Bank-financed subloan in meeting the 60Z ratio
of the sub-project's total investment cost, and the $2.5 million
ceiling for maximum Bank financing per subproject (para 6.06).
Procurement and disbursements would be made according to the guidelines
detailed in para. 6.10 and 6.11 above and suitable agreements on these were
reached during negotiations.
6.15     Technical Assistance for EMI Sub-Sector Studies.  The $0.2 million
allocated to the support of ODI promotional activities would be used to
finance the cost of EMI subsector studies to be carried out by ODI with the
assistance of specialized consulting firms selected in accordance with Bank
guidelines. In particular, ODI intends to hire in 1985 an engineering
consulting firm to identify specific lines of EMI products which could be
developed in Morocco. Following this phase, detailed market studies would be
carried out by local or foreign firms to assess the market viability of
identified projects. The terms of reference of such studies financed under
this component would be reviewed by the Bank. The cost of these market
studies, to be included in the total cost of the projects which would
materialize on their basis, would be recovered by ODI.



- 41 -
6.16     The subsidiary loan would be repaid by ODI to the Treasury over 15
years including a grace period of five years and would bear the interest rate
prevailing at signature of the Bank loan. To ensure a rapid utilization of
the Bank's loan, ODI would pay a commitment fee of 0.75 percent on the
subsidiary line of credit. The repayment period to the Treasury reflects the
time profile of returns on equity investments in Morocco, which generally do
not generate dividends before the fifth year after first investment outlays,
and takes into account ODI's projected cashflow during the 1985-88 period
(Annex 7). These arrangements were reviewed during negotiations and recorded
in the Loan Agreement. The terms and conditions of the subsidiary credit line
will be recorded in an agreement to be signed between the Treasury and ODI.
The signature of this agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition
of effectiveness.
Strengthening of ODI
6.17     Policy Statement.  The review of ODI's institutional activities and
capacity has identified the need for a Pblicy Statement which would clearly
define ODI's financial and operational policies and provide a framework to
guide the actions of ODI's management and staff (para 5.10). Following Bank
comments on the preliminary draft of the Policy Statement received in July
1984, ODI's management prepared a final draft, which was reviewed during
negotiations and found satisfactory. This final draft includes, inter-alia,
the following points:
(i)  ODI will focus on the promotion of the private sector for existing
and new enterprises and on investments in small and medium-scale
projects through minority participations (para 5.18);
(ii) investments will generally include equity participations and,
whenever possible, capital loans (para 5.18);
(iii)  projects financed by ODI will have a minimum IRR equivalent to BNDE's
interest rate net of subsidies for long-term loans to industry (para
5.18);
(iv) the annual accounts will be audited by independent auditors (para
5.11);
(v)  ODI will constitute satisfactory provisions against losses in
investments on the basis of the auditors' independent opinion (para
5.16);
(vi) the borrowings will not exceed 35% of new investments, and the
debt-service will not exceed one-third of the portfolio revenue (para
5.17);
(vii)  ODI's total exposure in any single company (equity participations and
capital loans) will normally not exceed 15% of ODI's own equity



- 42 -
ODI's auditors would be satisfactory to the Bank; ODI's audited financial
statements and the audited accounts of equity investments financed under the
Bank loan (para. 6.13), would be submitted to the Bank within four months of
the end of each fiscal year. ODI would adopt and thereafter maintain the
policy statement, whose approval by ODI's Board will be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
6.18     EMI Department.  To strengthen the engineering and appraisal capacity
of its EMI department, ODI has planned to hire two experienced engineers. It
was agreed during negotiations and recorded in the Loan Agreement that the
recruitment of those engineers will be a condition of disbursement for the ODI
credit line.
C. Project Benefits and Risks
Benefits
6.19     The project would provide direct support to the Government's policy
of deepening the industrial base of the Moroccan economy, and alleviating
pressure on the balance of payments through efficient import substitution and
increased EMI exports. The $25 million loan would finance some forty EMI
subprojects over the 1985-1987 period with a total investment cost of about
t43 million equivalent to 57% of total projected investments in EMIs
(excluding public and SSI projects). These investments will create about
1,500 jobs at an average investment cost of $30,000 (in 1983 prices). While
some of these projects are expected to be export-oriented, most would be for
efficient import-substitution of intermediate EMI goods.
6.20     The project would strengthen the capability of major financial
intermediaries through encouraging commercial banks to be more active in term
financing of industry, reinforcing their market and economic analysis,
supporting ODI's role of industrial promotion in the EMI area, and
strengthening the institutional framework within which ODI operates.
Risks
6.21     The major risk of the proposed project is the readiness of the
selected commercial banks to use the credit line, their performance in
appraising relatively complex EMI projects and their ability and readiness to
follow the operational procedures for procurement and disbursement required by
the Bank. This risk should, however, remain minimal since the selected banks
have indicated a strong interest for the project and agreed to pay commitment
fees, have already demonstrated an appraisal capability, and are familiar with
the Bank procedures, such as procurement under the SSI loans. Moreover, the
Bank will assist the Moroccan Government in minimizing these risks through
close supervision of the proposed project.

*Projected
a)       CIOR is an 82% ODI owned (DH 200 million) cement factoxy located in
Oujda near the Algerian border. It operates at more than 85% of capaciy and
is vell managed. CIOR was able to maintain its production despite the general
slowdown of the economy by selling part of its production in the Casablanca
market area and to sustain a positive cash flow of about DHi 90 million in
1982-83 despite substantial foreign exchange losses on dollars borrowings.
However, because of these foreign exchange losses and large depreciation
costs, first net profits and dividends to ODI should be posted in 1986 only.
b)       SNEP. This chemical plant became profitable in 1982 following a 25%
increase of sales. Sales continued to increase in 1983 and 5% of production
was exported. ODI's projected utilization of capacity (8OM) and sales
increase (12%) in 1984 appear realistic. First dividend payments to ODI are
scheduled for 1986 after recovery of differed depreciation in 1984 and 1985.
c)       ICOZ. Due to technical and marketing misconception in 1974, this
textile unit accumulated losses and more than DlH 20 million of arrears were
due to BNDE at end 1981 despite two injections of new equity funds by ODI in
1980 and 1981. A major commercial and financial restructuring, initiated by
ODI and backed by BNDE, took place in 1982 and brought about an impressive
upturn of ICOZ perfomnance in 1983: production was up 15% and sales 21%; the
cash-flow was multiplied by three and the company posted its first profits
(before taxes) of DR 8.6 million.  Profits are projected at DH 14 million in
1984, but due to large differed depreciation, ODI would only collect from IWDZ
the interest and principal an its current account advances during the period
1984-88.
d)       SIMEF is ODI's first important and innovative project in the ElI
sector (investment cost of DR 54 million with ODI participation of DH 17
million). It is a well designed and operated project (electrical and diesel
motors) with good prospects. SIMEF is profitable since 1983 and is projected
to start payin7 DH 3.2 million dividends to ODI ir. 1985 and DRi 5.4 million in
1986.
