improve governance in\n            general, and improve public sector management, service\n            delivery, and budget/expenditure planning. It will also\n            provide foreign exchange to maintain essential imports,\n            boost international reserves, and provide non-inflationary\n            financing for the budget. The Government's cross\n            cutting reform program to support private sector\n            development, includes policy actions in the financial\n            sector, privatization, and enterprise reforms, and reforms\n            in the infrastructure sector. The project will be beneficial\n            for the establishment of a government budget audit office,\n            public administration, and customs reforms, and for\n            improving fiscal management, and developing a medium term\n            expenditure framework. Nonetheless, risks include the\n            deterioration of regional security due to political reasons;\n            as well as weak implementation capacity, suggested by the\n            lack of government understanding of the need for\n            implementing sustained reforms, a fact which may not be\n            guaranteed. Additionally, restructuring of external debt\n            with major creditors, may imply risks for fiscal, and\n            external sector sustainability, aggravated by the low level\n            of reserves, which could adversely impact foreign exchange\n            management. However, it is expected that the assurance of a\n            sound macroeconomic framework, supported by the Poverty\n            Reduction and Growth Facility from the International\n            Monetary Fund, will mitigate those risks."}, "docdt": "2001-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
