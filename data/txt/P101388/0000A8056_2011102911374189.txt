                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project has two key objectives: to contribute on the one hand to the supply of basic services and facilities to the respective conflict-affected populations;
                         and to contribute to capacity building of the state government to enable it to more effectively execute its mandate, especially at the local (decentralized) level.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite a late start and several security related issues which the project had to face from time to time during its period of implementation, it has managed to record an overall
                         moderately satisfactory performance. It achieved all the physical targets contained in the original Results Framework and went beyond them by utilizing savings to carry out a
                         vocational training program. Unfortunately, out of 298 planned only 196 selected community members could complete the training; and the training program for the remaining 102 had

                         to be abandoned because of the serious deterioration in security situation resulting from outbreak of hostilities in June 2011.

                         One of the bright features of the project implementation relates to the task team and project team supported by CMU working together to find innovative alternatives making up the
                         shortfall in government counterpart funding. Against their commitment of providing US$6.85 million towards the overall cost of US$14.73 million the federal government could provide
                         only US$745,267 and declared its inability to contribute anymore to the project. It seemed to be in line with the government position that MDTF had fixed too high a quota for the
                         government and that their share should be reduced. This unilateral enforcement of their decision created serious funding problems in this project and particularly in components with
                         high government participation such as component#2 on rural roads which as a result were left in a limbo.

                         The task team and the project team explored several other alternative sources for making up this substantial shortfall. The gap was made up by approaching the Unity Fund of Sudan
                         (UFS) and the South Kordofan state government. The UFS made substantial contribution to the project. This included $742,331 paid directly to the project, for completion of physical
                         capacity building and health components of the project. Unity Fund also transferred $1,596,000 directly to the National Mine Action Commission (NMAC) for implementing the
                         project's Demining component. Finally, the State Governor of South Kordofan agreed to directly implement the rural roads component of the project, namely construction of 113 km
                         between Dilling, Salamat and Lagawa as well as 50 bridges and 20 box culverts, equating to an estimated $4.5 million. In this manner the co-financing by the government and its
                         subordinate agencies exceeded the allocations provided under the project co-financing agreements.
