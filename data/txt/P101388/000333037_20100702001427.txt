                                     Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Sudan, South Kordofan STATE EMERGENCY PROJECT, TF090168,
   P101388 will be extended from June 30, 2010 until June 30, 2011.

2. All eight of the project's components have either been fully implemented or are close to
   completion with the exception of the rural roads component which was delayed by lack of
   counterpart funds. Following the recent visit of the Country Manager and task team to South
   Kordofan in June 2010, the Government of South Kordofan expressed in writing its
   commitment to contribute US$4.5 million to the project. The task team believes that with the
   release of these committed counterpart funds, the Project's objectives continue to be
   achievable. This is supported by the considerable improvement in disbursement rates
   currently at 68% and the performance of the Project Implementing Entity which has been
   consistently satisfactory.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to allow the Ministry of Economy and Investment of
   South Kordofan (acting on behalf of the Project Implementing Entity, the Government of
   South Kordofan) to utilize counterpart funds in the amount of US$4.5 million committed by
   the Government of South Kordofan and additional funding to be presented soon in the
   amount of US$14 million and to complete planned activities to achieve the original Project
   objectives. Progress reported by the State Government suggests that Project activities will be
   completed in accordance with the revised action plan. The task team closely assisted the
   project coordination unit in formulating this action plan, and is satisfied that the indicated
   activities and time-frame are feasible and will result in the achievement of the intended
   Project objectives.

4.    This will be the second extension of the project. The Project was restructured and the
     Closing Date extended from August 31, 2008 to June 30, 2010. As of May 27, 2010 the
     project had disbursed US$9.99 million, which represents 68% of the total amount.

5. The implementing entities are compliant with the Bank's financial management
   requirements; and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports from these
   entities.
