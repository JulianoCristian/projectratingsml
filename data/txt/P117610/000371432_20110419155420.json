"The objective of Second Phase of the 135\n            Third Program Development Policy Support Operation Project\n            is to improve the results of one of Vietnam's National\n            targeted programs for poverty reduction. The policy reforms\n            that the preparation of this operation supported sought to\n            promote greater and more informed participation at community\n            level by ethnic minorities, the intended beneficiaries of\n            P135-2, as well as to improve targeting, fiduciary\n            management, transparency, and monitoring and evaluation, as\n            primary means to achieve the poverty reduction results of\n            these programs. This series of Program Development\n            Objectives (DPOs) was an innovative pilot effort to use\n            policy-based lending in support of a government National\n            targeted program (NTP). The hypothesis was that the DPOs\n            would be a more sustainable and far reaching means of\n            influencing how Vietnam undertakes targeted poverty\n            reduction work. In support of this approach was the fact\n            that government's ownership of the program was very\n            high, and that the operations would also leverage a\n            substantial amount of government's own funding. Vietnam\n            has weathered the 2008-09 global economic crises relatively\n            well. After registering real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\n            growth of 5.3 percent in 2009, its economy grew by an\n            estimated 6.8 percent in 2010. Vietnam stands out not only\n            for achieving a higher average growth rate in the\n            post-crisis period, but also a more stable growth path. The\n            rapid recovery has been bolstered by higher level of\n            investment and a strong revival in exports. Foreign direct\n            investments have continued to remain buoyant and remittances\n            have grown at a healthy rate. Exports are growing at 24\n            percent, with export of non-oil sector doing particularly\n            well, having registered 30 percent growth in first eleven\n            months of 2010. Overall, the recovery of the real sector of\n            the economy has been both robust and remarkable.\n            Vietnam's strong recovery has, however, been tempered\n            by its growing macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The annual\n            inflation rate is currently hovering at double-digit level\n            and its currency has been under intense pressure for the\n            last several months. Foreign exchange reserves have declined\n            and Vietnam's sovereign rating has recently been\n            downgraded on account of persistent macroeconomic\n            vulnerabilities, including default by one of the largest\n            state owned enterprises. These instabilities were triggered\n            by external shocks - the surge in capital flows in 2007 and\n            the global financial crisis in 2008-09 but have become\n            increasingly domestic, with the authorities being slower to\n            react and hesitant to disrupt the country's impressive\n            growth record."}, "docdt": "2011-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
