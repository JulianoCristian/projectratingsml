                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The Program Development Objective is to improve the results of one of Vietnam#s National Targeted Programs for poverty reduction, P135-2, through
                         strengthening four policy areas: poverty targeting; decentralization, participation and empowerment; fiduciary transparency and accountability; and monitoring
                         and evaluation. The third Development Policy Support Operation would continue to support policy and institutional reforms to improve the results of P135-2.
                         The operation aims to promote improvements in informed participation by the communities, as well as increased fiduciary control, accountability and quality
                         evaluation in the Government's poverty-targeted public investment programs.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government program has been implemented and closed on December 31, 2010 as planned. The program has delivered key basic rural infrastructure to poor communes and
                         decentralization has been improved with majority of communes empowered to act as investment owners. Progress on policy reforms was adequate and satisfactory to trigger the
                         third and last development policy credit (DPO 3) for this programmatic development policy support operation. The government is in the process of preparing the follow-up program for
                         poor communes in which best practices from Program 135-2 will be sustained and applied. DPO 3, the Bank operation for budgetary support to the Program 135-2 became effective
                         on August 29, 2011. It seeks to support policy actions that would complete and expedite the reform agenda already underway. It also sought to reinforce and help to embed the
                         reforms already achieved as a way of influencing Government#s successor programs to P135-2. Overall progress on the series of operations is positive and consistent with the
                         program outcome targets. The third operation is in too early a stage to report progress towards its development objectives.
