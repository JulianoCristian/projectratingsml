Main Policy Areas        The proposed operation will be recognizing strengthened policies and
                         their implementation regarding the Government's principal public
                         program targeting poor, remote ethnic minority communities. Specific
                         policy areas include those related to:
                          (i)      poverty targeting;
                          (ii)     decentralization, participation and empowerment;
                          (iii)    fiduciary transparency and accountability; and

                         criteria for allocating resources amongst communes: Baseline (DPC1):
                         0, (DPC2): 42, (DPC3): 47, Target: 47.
                         Policy Area 2: Decentralization, Participation & Empowerment:
                         Percentage of P135-2 communes which act as investment owners for at
                         least a significant share of program investments. Baseline (DPC1): 22
                         %, (DPC2): 60%, (DPC3): 65%; Target: 70%
                         Policy Area 3: Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability: Ensure
                         adequate oversight of public funds through independent audits,
                         covering both operational and financial aspects, as indicated by public
                         disclosure of audit results at national and local levels, and
                         documentation of follow up actions taken. Baseline (DPC1): No
                         operational audits conducted in VN by State Audit Authority for a
                         National Targeted Program. (DPC2): Financial and operational audit
                         carried out and publicly disclosed in ten provinces and follow up action
                         reports for eight provinces covered by 2007 audit. (DPC3) Financial
                         and operational audit carried out and publicly disclosed in 18 provinces
                         by 2009 audit and follow up action report for ten provinces prepared by
                         audit coordination group led by CEM. Target: Financial and operational
                         audit carried out covering at least 18 provinces and publically disclosed
                         and follow-up actions reports for 14 provinces covered by 2009 audit.
                         Policy Area 4: Monitoring and Evaluation: Randomized survey
                         approach with baseline and control group and citizen report cards used
                         to assess progress and beneficiary satisfaction to inform program
                         improvements: Baseline (DPC1): No use of citizen report card or other
                         participatory monitoring tools. (DPC2): Baseline survey and
                         introduction of citizen report cards used to identify areas for program
                         strengthening. (DPC3): Aligned Monitoring Tool (AMT) reports and

                                                 1
                            improved routine reports used as inputs to joint progress review
                            mission. Target: End of project survey and citizen report cards used as
                            key elements of final evaluation report
Program Development         The Program Development Objective is to improve the results of one of
Objective and               Vietnam's National targeted programs for poverty reduction, the
Contribution to CAS         "Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing
                            Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas (2006-
                            2010)," known as "Program 135 Phase 2" (or P135-2), through
                            strengthening the four main policy areas as mentioned above.
                            The proposed operation is fully aligned with the Bank's Country
                            Partnership Strategy 2007-2011 which is based on Government's
                            Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006-2010). The proposed
                            operation specifically supports the "Strengthen Social Inclusion" pillar
                            and particularly the outcomes of "better access to services and
                            infrastructure for the rural poor," and "ethnic minorities in rural areas
                            more fully integrated into development processes."
                            The proposed operation provides the platform for working directly with
                            Government in reviewing and improving the procedures and
                            implementation of Government's main poverty reduction program,
                            including the transfer of experience from much smaller, donor
                            supported programs working with ethnic minority communities in
                            Vietnam such as the recently closed Northern Mountains Poverty
                            Reduction Project (Cr. 3572-VN) co-financed with DFID, and
                            Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project (Cr. 3532-VN), the
                            newly approved Second Northern Mountains Poverty reduction Project
                            (NMPRP-2) and programs supported by AusAid, Finland, IrisAID,
                            SIDA and IFAD.
Risks and Risk Mitigation   The risks that have been identified under the previous operations have
                            been mitigated effectively: The risk that capacity constraints at
                            commune level would limit implementation was mitigated through
                            issuance of user-friendly manuals and guidelines as well as
                            establishment of a program taskforce supported through decentralized
                            TA by development partners; Reputational and operational risks from
                            local level corruption in use of resources were mitigated by introduction
                            of more rigorous auditing and strengthened transparency and social
                            accountability mechanisms. A more recently identified risk that
                            achieved reforms might not be sustained and fully mainstreamed in the
                            GoV's future programs on poverty reduction is mitigated through
                            continued dialogue with CEM and other government ministries and
                            relevant operations and continued analytical work.

                            In addition, increased macroeconomic instability has emerged as one of
                            the risks facing the proposed operation. They are mitigated by the
                            government actions, as expressed in Resolution 11, and through
                            continuous monitoring of the macro situation, close collaboration with
                            the IMF and frequent discussions with the authorities on implementing
                            policies to reestablish and maintain macroeconomic stability

(DPCs) providing assistance to the policy reforms implemented under the Government's
Program 135 Phase 2, designed to reduce poverty among disadvantaged groups. The
Government's program started in 2006 and was completed and closed in December 2010, as planned.
The re-designed `Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship
in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas (2006-2010),' known more familiarly in Vietnam as
`Program 135, Phase 2' (P135-2), was one of Vietnam's National Targeted Programs (NTP) for
poverty reduction. In 2006, when the series of operations was conceived, P135-2 represented the best
available entry point for the Bank and other development partners to a wider, emerging agenda for
addressing one of the main remaining challenges in poverty reduction in the country, and for systemic
change in the way NTPs in Vietnam are conceived and implemented. The policy reforms that the
preparation of this operation supported sought to promote greater and more informed participation at
community level by ethnic minorities, the intended beneficiaries of P135-2, as well as to improve
targeting, fiduciary management, transparency, and monitoring and evaluation, as primary means to
achieve the poverty reduction results of these programs.

2.       This series of DPOs was an innovative pilot effort to use policy-based lending in support
of a Government NTP. The hypothesis was that the DPOs would be a more sustainable and far-
reaching means of influencing how Vietnam undertakes targeted poverty reduction work. In support
of this approach was the fact that Government's ownership of the program was very high, and that the
operations would also leverage a substantial amount of Government's own funding. Given this, it
was expected that policy decisions would be rapidly translated into implementation and that the
DPOs would also be able to measure the results on the ground quickly. On the other hand, the high
degree of ownership and the significant Government funding toward P135-2 meant that there were
limits to how far and how fast policy reforms could be influenced by the World Bank and other
development partners. Available evidence so far indicates that the Program has made concrete
contributions to combating poverty on the ground, and is very popular among the beneficiaries.

3.      The Bank's engagement on P135-2 is deemed to have contributed substantively to
improvements made in the second phase of P135 over the first phase. When Program 135 phase
1 (P135-1) closed in 2005, it had (i) an almost exclusive bias toward infrastructure investments (99
percent); (ii) equal allocation of resources across communes, regardless of population size and
poverty rates; (iii) low recorded levels of local participation in decision-making; (iv) limited
decentralization and empowerment to communes and communities; (v) weak or absent mechanisms
and resources for operations and maintenance (O&M) of infrastructure; (vi) limited transparency and
public information on program budgets and spending; (vii) an absence of effective monitoring and
evaluation; and (viii) limited application of locally learned lessons and best practices in poverty

  As more than 24 months passed between the approvals of the first operation (DPC1) and the second operation
(DPC2) by the Board of Executive Directors, March 21, 2007 and May 21, 2009, the series was considered to have
lapsed and an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) was prepared for DPC1. The lessons learned from the ICR
assessment are reflected in this operation.

reduction as developed by several donor-funded operations. When P135-2 closed in 2010, it had
achieved progress on several fronts, including: (i) more decentralized decision making from
provinces to districts and communes as investment owners, (ii) greater empowerment and
participation by local communities, (iii) higher budget allocations for O&M, (iv) measures in place
for improved transparency and fiduciary safeguards, (v) a baseline survey conducted and M&E
system and tools installed, which are starting to show some results, (vi) an improved policy dialogue
forum on poverty reduction for ethnic minorities, and (vii) a shift in focus beyond infrastructure
investments to also include attention to livelihoods support. Government of Viet Nam has prepared a
follow up program, implementation of which will continue to benefit from the policy changes
supported by this series.

4.       The three operations in the series were structured as follows:

     ·   DPO1 (US$50 million equivalent) supported structuring the policy framework consistent with
         the desired outcomes. The prior actions aimed at strengthening community-level ownership
         over the planning, execution, management and construction supervision, and operation and
         maintenance of basic infrastructure investments under P 135-2;
     ·   DPO2 (US$100 million equivalent2) supported actions identified as needing additional
         emphasis to advance the reform agenda, based on the first two years of implementation. The
         prior actions included revised policy and supporting procedures in areas such as production
         support and competitiveness of local procurement to permit more effective implementation by
         provinces, districts and communes, as well as strengthening of the monitoring and oversight
         functions at the central level;
     ·   DPO3 (US$50 million equivalent) supports the remaining policy reforms deemed important
         to strengthen implementation of the reforms supported under DPC1 and DPC2, particularly at
         sub-national levels. These actions were considered useful in accelerating progress towards
         achieving results in the final year of the program, as well as in helping to make the reforms
         introduced during program implementation more permanent.

5.      The series of operations also provided a vehicle for development partner coordination
around a programmatic reform agenda. Consistent with the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid
Effectiveness (Vietnam's localized version of the Paris Declaration), the Government and the
development community agreed that a policy-based budget support, complemented by parallel
technical assistance (TA), provided the most promising financing modality to help bring about the
outcomes P135-2 was designed to achieve. The proposed operations were jointly prepared with three
bilateral donors -- Australia, Finland and Ireland -- who are providing parallel financing and TA
through bilateral agreements with the Government. In addition, the International Fund for
Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provide
parallel TA, and more recently, the European Union (EU) and Switzerland also joined in providing
financial support. All partners are active members of the Partnership Committee (PC) and all
financiers use the common operation policy matrix as a basis for disbursements.

6.      At the beginning of the P135-2 implementation period, a five year policy matrix or results
framework was established jointly with the Government and participating development partners. It
was modified based on the findings of annual joint reviews (see Annex 3). The single policy matrix
describes the main areas of the programmatic reform agenda. The prior actions for the proposed
Credit (DPC3), as well as those under DPC1 and DPC2, are indicated in the matrix. The matrix also

  The amount for the second operation was increased from the originally planned US$50 million to US$100 million
as a part of the response to the government's request to support the financing of its stimulus program in response to
the global financial crisis.

II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

7.      Vietnam has weathered the 2008-09 global economic crisis relatively well. After registering real
GDP growth of 5.3 percent in 2009, its economy grew by an estimated 6.8 percent in 2010. Vietnam
stands out not only for achieving a higher average growth rate in the post-crisis period, but also a more
stable growth path. The rapid recovery has been bolstered by higher level of investment and a strong
revival in exports. Foreign direct investments have continued to remain buoyant and remittances have
grown at a healthy rate. Exports are growing at 24 percent, with export of non-oil sector doing
particularly well, having registered 30 percent growth in first eleven months of 2010. Overall, the
recovery of the real sector of the economy has been both robust and remarkable.

8.      Vietnam's strong recovery has, however, been tempered by its growing macroeconomic
vulnerabilities. The annual inflation rate is currently hovering at double-digit level and its currency has
been under intense pressure for the last several months. Foreign exchange reserves have declined and
Vietnam's sovereign rating has recently been downgraded on account of persistent macroeconomic
vulnerabilities, including default by one of the largest state owned enterprises. These instabilities were
triggered by external shocks ­ the surge in capital flows in 2007 and the global financial crisis in 2008-09
­ but have become increasingly domestic, with the authorities being slower to react and hesitant to disrupt
the country's impressive growth record.

9.      The first signs of macroeconomic problems can be traced back to 2007 when Vietnam
experienced an unprecedented surge in external capital flow, fueling a credit boom and an asset price
bubble. Between 2006 and 2007, foreign direct investment increased by three fold and portfolio flows by
four-fold ­ with total external capital increasing from US$ 3.6 billion (or 5.9 percent of GDP) in 2006 to
US$ 12.8 billion in 2007 (18 percent of GDP). Consequently, money supply grew rapidly, fueling a credit
boom and creating an asset price bubble. Inflation rate accelerated and trade deficit widened rapidly
during this period.

10.      The economic boom came to a sudden halt as the global economy plunged into a financial and
economic crisis during 2008. Capital flows slowed, with portfolio flow reversing from its peak of US$
6.2 billion in 2007 to US$ -0.5 billion in 2008. The stock market lost nearly 66 percent of its value in
2008. Fueled by global commodity price shocks, Vietnam's inflation rate accelerated to nearly 20 percent
and its currency appreciated in real terms.

11.      This was followed in 2009 by a global economic crisis that led to a significant slowdown in
manufacturing growth, contraction in export demand and the possibility of closure of thousands of
factories and millions of lost jobs. Many of the export-oriented firms, which had invested heavily with the
belief that the boom would continue, suddenly found their orders cancelled and sales plunged. Some of
the more leveraged firms, including the state owned enterprises, found it difficult to keep up with their
debt service payments. A timely and large `stimulus package' however helped to cushion the adverse
impact of the global crisis.

12.     The most recent episode of macroeconomic instability started in the second-half of 2010 when the
economy overheated following delayed withdrawal of the fiscal and monetary stimulus that had been
introduced to deal with the impact of the global financial crisis. As of December 2010, inflation climbed
to a two year high of 12.2 percent, the dong came under intense pressure, and the level of foreign
exchange reserves declined to $12.5 billion (1.5 months of imports). The health of the banking sector also
became a focus of concern, in part because of the build-up of contingent liabilities in the state-owned
                                                     5
enterprise (SOE) sector. On account of this deterioration in the country's macroeconomic indicators and a
default by one of its largest state owned enterprises, Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded
Vietnam's sovereign rating to BB- and B1, respectively.

THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY RESPONSE

13.     After the successful completion of the XIth Party Congress in January 2011, a consensus begun to
emerge within Government (including the provincial governments) behind the need for strong measures to
restore macroeconomic stability. The authorities recognized that their attention and focus should be on
addressing instability even if this comes at the expense of slower growth in the short term. The
Government publicly indicated its intention to pursue "tight and prudent monetary and fiscal policy" and
approved Resolution 11, which commits the government to a wide range of monetary, fiscal and structural
policy reforms that are intended to cool an overheated economy. Several of the measures in the
Resolution have already been implemented. Specifically, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has issued
Directive 01/CT-NHNH on March 1, 2011 to implement parts of Resolution 11 that fall under its ambit
and similar Directives and Circulars are under preparation in all the relevant Ministries. A brief summary
of the measures are as follows:

14.     Exchange Rate Policy. The dong was devalued by 9.3 percent against the US dollar and the
trading band was narrowed from +/-3% to +/-1%. This is the single largest correction to the exchange rate
following the onset of macroeconomic instability in 2007. The authorities also indicated that the interbank
average exchange rate will be managed more flexibly, consistent with the intention to gradually move to a
more flexible exchange rate regime. Given a large and rapidly growing quasi-illegal trade in gold, which
                                                             6
led to a significant increase in errors and omissions in the balance of payments, Resolution 11 instructs
SBV to prepare a Decree on Management of Gold Trading for issuance by the second quarter of 2011.
The Decree will centralize gold exports, eliminate trading in gold bars, and prevent cross-border
trafficking of gold. The Resolution instructs competent authorities to ensure that foreign exchange and
gold traders comply with the law.

15.     Monetary Policy. In the last four months, SBV has increased the base (refinancing) rate from 8
percent to 11 percent and revised upward the overnight market operation (repo) rate six times­ from 7
percent to 12 percent. SBV also announced that the target for credit growth in 2011 will be cut to 20
percent from 39 and 30 percent in 2009 and 2010 respectively. This will be the lowest target for credit
growth in the last 10 years. Concomitantly, the target for broad money supply growth has been kept at 15-
16 percent during 2011      the lowest growth target since the beginning of economic reforms two decades
ago.

16.     Fiscal Policy. The government has announced that it will cut non-salary recurrent expenditure by
10 percent, not start any new construction projects in the public sector this year, including in SOEs, and
thereby reduce fiscal deficit to below 5 percent of GDP in 2011 (GoV's definition) a 1 percentage point
reduction relative to 2010 and 0.3 percentage point reduction relative to 2011 budget estimate.

17.       Banking Sector. Resolution 11 limits banks' exposure to non-productive activities (which include
real estate and security market) to 22 percent of total credit by June 30, 2011 and to 16 percent by
December 31, 2011. Non-complaint banks will be asked to double their required reserves ratio and
restrict their business activities. SBV will review compliance at the end of June 2011. The government is
revising Decision 493 to upgrade loan classification and provisioning practice in the banking system to
bring them closer to international norms. The revised Decision will be issued by May 2011. The
government has also confirmed its participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and
has sort technical assistance from the Bank and Fund.

18.     State-Owned Enterprises. The Government has asked key Economic Groups to carry out
independent audits using international norms and make the results available by end 2011. The Ministry of
Planning and Investment (MPI) has been asked to review planned loans and investment projects of SOEs
to identify those that can be dropped or scaled down. The report from MPI is due to the National
Assembly by the end of March 2011. Resolution 11 also indicates that the Government will accelerate the
equitization process and strengthen the governance of SOEs.

19.     Other Structural Measures. The government is preparing a Circular to increase disclosure of
information and policies affecting monetary management and banking, including submitting key statistics
to the IMF's International Financial Statistics on schedule. A draft Circular has been sent to the Bank for
review. Finally, the government is moving from an administrative mechanism for setting the prices of key
commodities such as electricity, gas and fuel, to a more market-based mechanism. It has already
announced an increase in electricity tariffs by 15.3 percent, and in the price of gasoline (by 18 percent),
diesel (24 percent), and kerosene (21 percent). In addition, Resolution 11 instructs MOIT to prepare a
regulation for establishing a market mechanism for pricing electricity.

20.      The above policy measures, in our view, constitute a credible plan for Vietnam to regain
macroeconomic stability. The measures have been widely discussed and debated within the government,
with representatives of large SOEs as well as with independent Vietnamese economists. It has the broad
support of line ministries as well as key finance and budget committees in the National Assembly. The
international financial markets have reacted favorably to the recent announcement, with Vietnam's
sovereign spreads steadily declining over the past few days. This augurs well for successful
implementation.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS


Fiscal Policy and Debt Situation
21.      Vietnam experienced a sharp increase in its fiscal deficit in 2009 on account of the stabilization
measures. The government's overall fiscal deficit was 9.0 percent of GDP in 2009, substantially above
those of previous years, as the stimulus package came on top of an already expansionary budget plan. In
addition to the measures adopted to stimulate economic activities, the fall in oil prices and the slowdown
in economic activities have resulted in a decline in the government revenue. This decline was partially
offset in the second half of 2009, as both international commodity prices and domestic economic activities
became more buoyant.

22.     With significantly higher than expected revenue outturn and expenditure in check, the government
has achieved a lower fiscal deficit than planned during 2010. According to the latest IMF estimate, total
budget revenue and grants increased from 26.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 28.1 percent in 2010.
Meanwhile, total budget expenditure (including off-budget expenditure) is estimated to have decreased by
1 percentage points, from 35.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 34.6 percent in 2010. The fiscal deficit is
therefore estimated to have declined from to 9.0 percent of GDP in 2009 to 6.4 percent in 2010 (Table 2).



                                                            8
Despite the downward trajectory of fiscal deficit, the slow pace of fiscal consolidation remains a matter of
                                                     3
concern for country's long-term fiscal sustainability .

23.     Through its 2011 Budget, and recent Government's Resolution, GoV has indicated its intention to
further consolidate the fiscal accounts and gradually reduce the fiscal deficit to pre-crisis levels. This
process is being facilitated by reining in current expenditure, improving efficiency of public investment
and scaling up the existing medium term budget framework being piloted in various line ministries to the
national level.

24.      Vietnam's public debt is likely to remain sustainable if the current economic recovery continues
and the authorities carry on the current fiscal tightening. The results of the debt sustainability analysis
conducted in 2010 indicate that the public sector debt was 49 percent of GDP at end-2009, two-thirds of
which (31 percent of GDP) was owed to external creditors. Under the baseline scenario, this ratio was
projected to increase to just above 50 percent of GDP during 2010-13 before starting to decline again
thereafter. The large fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010 do not affect the overall debt sustainability
significantly, as long as the government reverts to the pre-crisis levels of deficit in a few years as
expected. The stress tests indicate that the two main risks to debt sustainability are a loss of access to non
debt-creating capital inflows and a slowdown of exports. The standard assumptions applied for these
shocks are severe, and are unlikely to materialize.

25.      The largest source of uncertainty and hence, unquantifiable risk, to the DSA comes from implicit
obligations which are not captured under public and publicly-guaranteed debt statistics. Neither a clear
definition nor a reliable estimate of such liabilities is available, which limits the government's ability to
manage associated risks. Contingent liabilities might arise from off-budget statutory funds such as health
insurance fund, the banking sector, or large SOEs. The last one in particular is a serious concern. It is
now well known that Vinashin (a ship-building economic group) used resources obtained through their
preferential access to credit to invest heavily outside its core businesses and falsified financial reports.
Collecting reliable and up-to-date information on contingent liabilities (mostly in the SOE sector) and
assessing their fiscal risks has become be a priority. And by articulating these changes taking place in the
government to market participants and providing them with regular and up-to-date information on fiscal
and debt situation, the government is trying to help to build confidence among market participants.

26.     The second source of fiscal risk, albeit not of the same magnitude as contingent liabilities, arises
from the large size of off-budget expenditure, which has been funded by issuing off-budget bonds. The
off-budget spending is managed by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) to build infrastructure
such as canals, schools and housing for poor. While the off-budget spending is approved by the National
Assembly and is subject to the same level of oversight and scrutiny as on-budget spending, it has been
termed as off-budget (misleadingly in our view) because it is largely managed by MPI ­ a leftover of the
planning era. In the last four years, off-budget expenditure financed by MPI bonds has increased sharply
from 1.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 2.8 percent. However, it is scheduled to fall to 1.9 percent of GDP in
2011 and to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2012 (Table-2).

Changes in the Banking Sector
27.     The banking sector has been adversely affected by the succession of asset price bubbles, monetary
tightening and growth slowdown. The real estate bubble of end-2007 and its subsequent freeze in early
2008 have made it difficult for several commercial banks to recover their loans; the rapid disinflation in
late 2008, at a time when interest rates were still very high, substantially increased the debt service burden
faced by enterprises because of the rapid rise in real interest rates.

 According to MOF's Draft Strategy of Finance for Period 2011-2020, fiscal deficit (national definition) will be
gradually reduced to 4 percent of GDP.
                                                         9
28.      The asset quality of bank portfolios remains an ongoing concern given the unusually high credit
growth of the past years and developing, but relatively weak, risk management capacity in the banking
sector. According to the official data, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of the banking system was 1.9
percent, 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent in end-2009, March 2010 and August 2010, respectively. However, if
international standards are applied, the NPL ratio of the banking sector is expected to be significantly
higher. Currently, only 3 commercial banks are assessed to have the adequate capacity to use international
method of calculating NPLs.

29.      From the macroeconomic risk perspective, the financial health of the state-owned commercial
banks (SOCBs) has often been highlighted as a source of concern. SOCBs play a dominant role in the
banking sector, though they have been rapidly losing market share (in both credit and deposit markets) to
the joint stock banks (JSBs) in recent past. At the end of 2007, SOCBs share in total outstanding credit
was 59.3 percent and that for JSBs was 27.7 percent; by the end of 2010, these numbers were 51.4 percent
and 34.8 percent respectively. Two SOCBs have started the equitization process and a third one plans to
start the process this year. International Financial Corporation (IFC) has recently bought 10 percent stake
in the third largest SOCB. In terms of credit growth, loan portfolio of the SOCBs has grown at a slower
rate than the overall system in the past couple of years. For example, in 2010, SOCBs loan portfolio grew
at 22 percent compared with the average of 40 percent growth in the JSBs. The share of SOCBs credit
going to SOEs has also declined in recent years. For example, only 25 percent of Bank for Investment and
Development of Vietnam's (BIDV's) portfolio has been lent to SOEs in 2010 compared with 35 percent
in 2009. For Agribank, the largest SOCB, the ratio was 6.6 percent and 4.4 percent in 2009 and 2010,
respectively.

30.     The SBV has upgraded its supervision efforts and raised minimum capital requirements in
response to the concerns about the health of the banking sector. By the end of 2008, all commercial banks
had met the new requirements. The process of increasing the minimum charter capital continues, in part
as a gentle push towards some consolidation of smaller banks. However, the deadline to increase the
minimum charter capital further to 3 trillion dong (about $150 million at today's exchange rate) by end
2010 was extended, when 18 of the smaller banks were unable to meet it. The SBV opted for a more
measured implementation of this policy, especially in the current fragile macroeconomic environment.

31.     In 2010, a number of other important changes in the policies and regulations governing the
banking sector were announced. These include the removal of interest caps, the revised banking laws
(namely, the Law on the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV Law) and the Law on Credit Institutions (LCI)),
and regulation on prudential ratios. These together are expected to reshape the working environment of
the banking sector. The SBV Law is expected to improve the accountability, mandate and autonomy of
SBV in undertaking monetary policy. The LCI is seen as enhancing the autonomy, safety and soundness
of credit institutions. The removal of the interest rate caps and the issuance of Circular 13 (replacing
Decision 457) on prudential ratios are expected to affect the operation of the credit institutions. On one
hand, credit institutions now have greater flexibility in setting interest rates, but on the other hand, are
subject to the tighter prudential ratios, most notably the significantly higher capital adequacy ratio (9
percent as of October 01, 2010), while facing stricter requirements on the amount of funds eligible for
lending activities (although the subsequent Circular 19 lightened this requirement to some extent).

32.     Much needs to be done over the medium term, however, to address some of the structural
weaknesses, particularly in the banking and state enterprise sectors, that have contributed to periodic bouts
of macroeconomic instability. On this, Resolution 11 is less ambitious, partly because of a lack of
capacity to detail actions in this area and also because there is less consensus within Government on the
way forward. Various on-going activities such as review of the state economic group model, taking stock
of the SOE reform and the formulation of Decrees to improve the management of state assets and equities
in SOEs can, however, provide valuable ingredients for the formulation of a systemic reform program in
the medium term.

33.     Through various tasks in the work program, the Bank team is providing policy advice and
technical assistance to prepare detailed action plans for the reform of banking and SOEs, help build
consensus behind them, and eventually support their implementation. The upcoming preparation of the
FSAP will provide a platform for some of this work while ongoing TA on SOE Governance, the
upcoming Vietnam Development Report 2012 on "Transition to Market", and a policy note on ensuring
that SOEs face hard budget constraints will support progress on the SOE issues. Through the Public
Financial Management Reform project we are also assisting the Government in developing the legal
framework and monitoring indicators to better manage contingent liabilities, including those arising from
the SOE sector.

PROGRESS IN POVERTY REDUCTION

34.      Vietnam's comprehensive economic reforms since the launching of Doi Moi in 1986 have
led to rapid economic growth and remarkable progress on poverty reduction and other
development outcomes. The share of the population living below the official poverty line fell by
nearly half; from 28.9 percent in 2002 to only 14.5 percent by 2008. Many of the remaining poor are
from disadvantaged groups (e.g. ethnic minorities or live in more isolated regions). Although the
economic status (and vulnerability to shocks) among the growing numbers of rural-to-urban migrants
is not clear. These estimates are based on a consistent (in real purchasing power) albeit conservative
"basic needs" poverty line and a series of six broadly comparable household surveys (Figure 1)
Calculations using the World Bank's international poverty line ($1.25/day, 2005 PPP) indicate
similar progress, yet somewhat higher poverty rates. Poverty measured by the international poverty
line fell from over 65 percent of the population in 1993 to under 21 percent by 2008. Both sets of
statistics highlight Vietnam's impressive progress in reducing poverty over the past two decades.

35.      Sustained and broad-based economic growth has been central to Vietnam's success. Poverty
reduction achievements in the 1990s are generally attributed to market-oriented policies that created
economic opportunities for the majority of the poor (e.g. an egalitarian allocation of land, secure
property rights to land holdings, and the emergence of private channels for rice markets and
distribution). Economic reforms in the 1990s contributed to rapid development of the private sector
(e.g., the Enterprise Law in 1990) so that small businesses could flourish, new entrants to the labor
force could find jobs in rapidly expanding services and industrial sectors, and Vietnam's economy
could benefit from the rapid opening to global trade. Widespread access to basic education and
health services, far better than the norm for countries at similar levels of development, ensured that
Vietnam's workers were well equipped to take advantage of opportunities created by market-led
growth.

36.     Reform momentum continued in the 2000s and growth rates remained consistently high. Pro-
poor programs took on a broader range of interventions to address the needs of an increasingly
diversified rural population, and new initiatives were introduced to address concerns about rising
inequality between regions and socio-economic groups. Targeted area development programs, such as
P135-2 or the new 62 Poorest Districts program, related policies to improve the living conditions of
ethnic minorities (P-132, P-134) to expand access to land and adequate housing. Programs were also
developed to address rising vulnerability (e.g. the Hunger and Poverty Eradication Program), health
insurance for the poor, and benefits paid to the most vulnerable under Decree 67. A new budget law
went into effect in 2004 that facilitated rapid decentralization; 45 percent of public spending
decisions are now made at provincial and lower levels. Equalization grants were put in place
(provincial poverty rates enter the allocation formulas) to ensure adequate funding for capital and
recurrent costs in less well-off provinces. For some of the poorest provinces, equalization grants
from the central budget comprise more than 90 percent of the overall provincial budget.

37.    These and other pro-poor policies formed an integral part of Vietnam's first PRSP ­ the
Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy ­ finalized in 2003. The Vietnam Country
Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) created momentum within Government to
mainstream poverty reduction in Vietnam's planning processes. Poverty reduction and social
development was introduced as a pillar of Vietnam's 2006-2010 Socio-Economic Development Plan
(SEDP) and continue to be prioritized in the 2011-2015 SEDP and Vietnam's 2011-2021 Socio-
Economic Strategy (SEDS). Recent debates in the National Assembly suggest that more weight will
be given to poverty statistics and measures of under-development in planned budget allocations under
the 2011-2015 SEDP.

38.      Although there was rapid progress in reducing poverty throughout the 1990s and well into the
2000s, recent evidence (e.g. based on the 2008 VHLSS) suggests that progress has slowed and there
is a large and growing gap between some of the poorest households and the better off, as well as a
persistent gap between different regions of the country and well as households living in urban and
rural areas. Figure 2 contrasts poverty rates between the majority Kinh/Hoa population and that if
Viet Nam's ethnic minority groups.

39.    Over 40 percent of the remaining poor in 2008 were ethnic minority households; despite
progress over the past two decades, nearly half of ethnic minority households still live below the
poverty line, compared to only 9 percent of Kinh/Hoa majority households.

40.     The overall distribution of wealth (measured in per-capita expenditure terms) is also changing
(Figure 3); it is flattening and becoming more skewed to the left due to rapid improvements in well-
being for many households. However the distribution of wealth for ethnic minorities has changed
more slowly and still remains highly concentrated around the poverty line (Figure 4, VASS PA
Synthesis Report, 2010).

41.    Aggregate measures of progress over time mask important differences across regions.
According to successive rounds of the VHLSS, poverty has fallen rapidly in the Red River Delta and
the South East Region, where Hanoi and HCMC are located, but more slowly in other parts of the

                                                                                                                         13
country. Poverty is becoming more concentrated in the Northwest Region and Central Highlands,
both areas with a high proportion of ethnic minorities. According to the 2009 Population Census,
ethnic minorities now comprise 55 percent of households in the Northern Midlands and Mountains
(NE and NW Regions) and 44 percent of households in the Central Highlands, in contrast to less than
2 percent in the Red River Delta (Hanoi and environs) and 5 percent in the South East (HCMC and
environs).

42.     Programs targeting ethnic minorities must take into account the differences between
specific ethnic minority groups. The cultural communities of Vietnam are diverse, officially
comprising 54 ethnic groups and encompassing seven major language families. The largest minority
group, the Tay, has nearly 1.5 million members, while the smallest, the O Du, has barely 300.
Poverty varies considerably amongst these groups, as do efforts to address it. Ethnic minorities based
in the lowlands (Khmer and Cham) have seen dramatic rates of poverty reduction, and groups who
tend to be valley-dwelling rice farmers in the Northern Mountains (Tay, Thai, Muong and Nung)
have also seen significant reduction in poverty. But other groups in the Northern Mountains, the
Central Highlands and the South and North Central Coasts, remain extremely poor. Agricultural
production systems and land use practices vary significantly amongst ethnic minority groups,
requiring a differentiated approach to applied agricultural research and farming systems development.
In addition, some groups have less well-developed social linkages to labor and product markets
outside their communities. Accordingly, programs targeted to ethnic minority communities must not
assume a "one-size-fits-all" approach in terms of communications, community engagement and
technology transfer.

43.      Schooling and language skills appear to be an important factor. Ethnic minority people
have, on average, 2.5 fewer years of schooling than the majority population. Compounding this is the
fact that their returns on schooling may be lower for several reasons: they tend to start school later,
repeat or drop out of grades more often, receive lower quality education, and have more difficulty
absorbing that education because of language barriers. Whether language is the main problem or
whether it is the result of other social factors ­ culture or discrimination ­ is unclear. But it is true
that the non-Kinh population that does not speak Vietnamese is among the poorest.

44.     Many communities face difficulties in linking social capital to formal administrative
processes. Access to microcredit programs and having a voice in community participation is
significantly improved with membership in various community based associations ­ like those for
                                                    14
farmers, women and youth. Because ethnic minorities have started off with higher rates of poverty
and also with a history of social exclusion, they may face barriers to inclusion in such groups. P135-
2 explicitly supports strengthened participation through investments in communications, capacity
building and devolution of investment management to the local level to change attitudes of both the
communities themselves and of local administrations who, in some cases, perceive resistance to
change as symptomatic of lack of education or laziness.

45.     Land allocation - both for cropland and forest areas also appears to be another critical
limiting factor to ethnic minority welfare. Often land allocation at the local level was based on the
recipient's perceived ability to be productive, as measured by having access to capital and labor. This
may have resulted in many ethnic minorities receiving little land or land of lower quality. Forestry
land is disproportionately used by ethnic minorities, but a number of policies emphasizing
environmental protection have made it more difficult for ethnic minorities to access and use these
lands productively. Agricultural extension programs have not focused on these types of lands or the
traditional crops grown or harvested there, and generally have not been able to effectively promote
land use and farming systems which integrate environmental sustainability and livelihood
improvements while recognizing the multiple, sustainable uses of forest that could benefit the ethnic
minority poor.

III.     GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

46.      The Government's five-year Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010 (SEDP)
incorporated the main elements of a poverty reduction strategy, including participatory process
(see Box 1). Following Directive 33 of the Prime Minister, the SEDP for 2006-2010 was drafted
according to the same principles that had governed the preparation of the previous Comprehensive
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy, including the preparation of a clear results-based monitoring
framework for the SEDP. Accordingly, the Bank and other donors have used the SEDP 2006-2010 as
a basis for their development assistance to Vietnam over this same period.

             BOX 1. PARTICIPATORY PROCESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC
                                 DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2006-2010

       The SEDP 2006-2010, a milestone in the modernization of planning in Vietnam, presented an
       outline of policy measures needed for Vietnam to advance to middle-income status by the end of
       the decade and marked a clear break with past five-year plans. Previously, national plans were
       prepared in accordance with traditional command economy principles; directed from the center and
       based on the premise that government was in full control over the delivery of goods and services. The
       general result was limited consultation outside of government agencies, a long list of wishful production
       targets, and the self-reporting of outcomes rather a genuine assessment of actual results. In contrast, the
       SEDP 2006-2010 set the framework for government action and resource allocation which was much
       more focused on attaining development outcomes. Stakeholders outside government, from grassroots
       communities to the overseas Vietnamese, were widely consulted on the SEDP framework and for the
       first time, the SEDP­ as the government's primary planning document-- was used as a basis for guiding
       and allocating ODA.

       The preparation SEDP 2006-2010 was built on the experience with the Comprehensive Poverty
       Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). Several initiatives were undertaken since the late 1990s to
       support modern planning processes. In June 2001, given the shortcomings of both traditional five-year
       plans and targeted poverty reduction programs, the Minister of Planning and Investment (MPI) was
       given the responsibility to produce a broader document, addressing poverty issues in a comprehensive
       way. The content of this document represented an important step toward genuine analysis and
       assessment. Instead of relying on administrative records, the document introduced high-quality
       quantitative and qualitative data into the discussion. This led to a better coverage of sensitive issues,

                                                          15
     such as the challenge of addressing ethnic minority poverty and the problems faced by urban migrants in
     accessing basic services. The document shifted from the description of inputs and the setting of output
     targets towards the statement of development objectives. As part of this process, the Millennium
     Development Goals (MDGs) were localized. There were also efforts to connect policy actions and
     resource allocation, with a rudimentary "costing" exercise for the VDGs.

     The process of preparing the SEDP 2006-2010 was a significant departure in terms of
     participation and transparency of information. In addition to internal discussions with government,
     consultation workshops were held with local officials, groups of academics, the domestic business
     community, international and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), people living with
     disabilities (PWD), overseas Vietnamese, women and women's groups, and donors. A series of
     participatory research exercises involving local experts and international NGOs also helped to gather
     feedback from poor communities in 17 sites across the country. The draft SEDP was declassified for the
     first time ever. It was discussed by the National Assembly (NA) in November 2005, a departure from
     previous practice of deferring its discussion after the Party Congress, which gave representatives more
     input into the content of the document than in previous planning cycles. There was also a second round
     of consultations within government and with donors and NGOs following the first discussion at the NA.

     With the support of the NGO Resource Center, civil society organizations participated actively in the
     organization of consultations for the preparation of SEDP. NGOs were also actively involved in the
     analytical work underlying this series of development policy credits, with their contribution focusing on
     infrastructure (especially in the relation to the needs of PWD), the social sectors and legal development.
     Substantive inputs were provided on the interpretation of the key development issues in each area, the
     identification of the main strengths and weaknesses of the government's strategy to address those issues,
     the prioritization of policy actions within the SEDP framework, and the selection of the most appropriate
     outcome indicators to measure progress in each area.

     A well-functioning mechanism has also been in place in Vietnam to conduct consultations with business
     associations and the private sector. Prior to both the year-end Consultative Group (CG) meeting
     between government and donors and the informal mid-year CG meeting, the Vietnam Business Forum
     (VBF) gathers to discuss the issues of concern to a range of chambers and associations representing the
     interests of enterprises. The discussion is organized around topics such as investment promotion,
     transparency, tax, labor, and land. In each of these areas, a list of main concerns is assembled, and the
     focus is on assessing progress towards solving them.




47.      Government uses its national targeted programs (NTPs) as the primary instrument for
channeling resources in support of its poverty reduction strategy. The national poverty reduction
programs consist of various combinations of policies and mechanisms that are brought together to
target particular population groups and/or geographical areas. They provide the primary means
through which supplementary resources from the State Budget are distributed to the target population
or areas. These NTPs should not, therefore, be considered as `programs' in the conventional sense
(i.e. of having a unified management structure and system). All NTPs are designed around a number
of `projects,' and different line ministries or agencies are assigned to manage and implement these
separate activities. While poverty reduction NTPs are generally assigned to several ministries,
provincial departments and sector agencies, sectoral NTPs (in education, rural water supply,
sanitation, etc.) are based within particular line agencies.

48.     As part of the SEDP 2006-2010, Government revamped the poverty reduction NTPs in
order to help address the distinct challenges facing communities living in the poorest and most
remote areas of the country. Accordingly, P135-2 was completely redesigned based on a series
of assessments and reviews. This process included a review of lessons learned from the Phase 1
of the program, and from parallel, donor-supported initiatives. In addition, there was an

                                                        16
exceptional process of review and consultation during 2006 involving key ministries and central
agencies in extensive provincial-level field studies and regional workshops.

49.     P135-2 is an important policy instrument for the national government to address
regional disparities in access to basic services and productive opportunities. P135-2 encourages
the adaptation of approaches at the provincial level that reflect an understanding of local needs,
specific cultural attributes and opportunities to enhance labor mobility. At the same time, the
program recognizes that such mobility-enhancing efforts need to be complemented by support to
the many ethnic minority groups which have important ties to their current geographic locations
and therefore prefer to seek improved livelihoods in situ. The objectives of P135-2, as expressed
in the Government's program document4 have been: (a) to facilitate significant improvement in
production knowledge and to accelerate a shift toward higher value-added commodities; (b) to
sustainably improve the socio-cultural life of people living in communes facing extreme hardship in
ethnic minority and mountainous areas, in order to narrow the gap in living standards among
Vietnam's regions and ethnic groups; and (c) by 2010, to eradicate hunger in the targeted areas and to
reduce the poverty rate to below 30 percent, according to the Government's new (2005) poverty line.5
The program recognized the need to reduce the challenges faced by these communities by ensuring
provision of essential services such as water, sanitation, education and health care, supporting
infrastructure to improve access to markets, and by promoting labor-intensive activities, such as
agriculture, agro-processing and handicrafts, which can be efficiently carried out in dispersed
locations.

50.     P135-2 complements other policies and programs focused on poverty reduction and the
needs of ethnic minority communities. Decision No.7 states that a core principle for P135-2 is to
effectively integrate the program with other policies and programs in the same areas. As such, the
component elements of P135-2 were determined by the existence of other NTPs which have
complementary sets of policies and interventions. In particular, the component to support living
conditions of poor households (i.e., improved access to essential social services) was designed to
augment other programs focused on improving labour mobility, such as the Education National
Targeted Program. P135-2 is distinct in its geographical targeting and concentration of additional
resources on ethnic minorities and remote communes and villages. In December 2008, the
Government announced Resolution 30A to initiate the `61 Poorest Districts (now 62 Poorest
Districts) Program,' which supplements resources in many of the same districts covered by P135-2.
This program drew upon the mechanisms and experience under P135-2, and CEM has a key role in
ensuring compatibility of investment planning and procurement procedures.

51.     In October 2010, the Government announced establishment of an overall Poverty Reduction
Framework as an umbrella NTP for the period of 2011-2015, incorporating all major poverty
reduction programs such as the 30A program, Program 135 phase 3 (P135-3), the program to support
poor coastal communes, and the national vocational training program. The division of institutional
responsibilities under this Framework is still being discussed. The current proposal would have CEM
(under P135-3) focus its future support on infrastructure development while other entities (i.e.,
MARD and MOLISA) would support livelihoods improvements. Certain elements of P135-2, in
particular the promotion of community participation procurement methods, and use of an open menu
for small-scale infrastructure investments (which has been shown to enhance allocation efficiencies),
are expected to be used in other NTPs which have appreciated the positive outcomes of these and
other P135-2 policies. The Bank will continue to closely engage with the Government as it refines

this umbrella poverty reduction NTP, while also continuing to provide closely related support via
targeted investment loans such as the Second Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project.

52.     Another key feature of P135-2 is its support to decentralization and implementation of
Government's "Grassroots Democracy" Decree. Over the last decade, a range of policy measures
have been introduced to enhance the autonomy and accountability of local governments in Vietnam.
These decentralization reforms constitute an integral part of the overall Program of Administrative
Reform (PAR) for the period 2001 to 2010.6 The legislation on Grassroots Democracy (introduced
in 1998 and updated in 2003 and 2007)7 aims to enhance the accountability of local government
authorities and agencies, and provides the mechanism through which citizens can participate in
planning and supervision of activities of the executive through both direct and representative
means. P135-2 is the only NTP which has a concerted policy for decentralization to commune
level; shifting investment ownership responsibilities to the communes is a means to strengthening
their capacity as well as to improving the targeting of the resources focused on poverty reduction.

53.     While, land policy and allocation for ethnic minorities is not directly addressed under
P135-2, recent legislation has provided a stronger basis for ensuring equitable and stable allocation of
residential and production land to disadvantaged ethnic minority households. In particular, decision
No. 132 of 2002, No. 134 of 2004, and No. 304 of 2005 respectively address residential and
production lands, ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands, and the allocation of forests and
contractual assignment of forests for protection to ethnic minority households and communities in
hamlets and villages in the Central Highlands. And while not a specific component under P135-2,
land allocation is an integral part of strengthening production support.

                           BOX 2. INITIAL RESULTS FROM LIVELIHOODS SUPPORT

    A weaving project in Nghe An is one example of creative use of P135 funds slated for livelihood production.
    Local Thai women gather regularly underneath a house built on high stilts to learn how to operate looms and
    weave new patterns, comfortable in the knowledge that their brightly covered fabrics have a ready market, as
    they are trained by local retailers who provide an immediate outlet for their products. Moreover, this new
    activity is easily integrated into the women's busy lives. Training and production take place during times when
    work was not required in the fields -- or even during rainy weather which would normally have been
    unproductive time. The activity is a social one, as well. Much farm and household production is a solitary
    affair, but these women were able to learn new skills, increase their incomes, and strengthen community ties,
    all at the same time, hopefully weaving a new life together along their tapestries, bags, and clothes to be
    snatched up by tourists to the nearby national forest.



54.      The P135-2 is achieving results on the ground. By the end of 2010, P135-2 had budgeted a
total of approximately US$720 million and disbursed 71 percent in support of 1850 "extremely
difficult communes," and an additional 3,300 "extremely difficult villages" in 47 provinces. In five
years, 314 communes have been added to the program, while 110 communes have graduated from the
program (based on improved poverty rates). Local authorities continue to review the communes to
determine which ones should continue to qualify for, and which ones should graduate from,

participation in the program. It is expected that by the end of 2010, 20 additional communes will
graduate. The program is popular, strongly owned by the Government, and steadily producing results
on the ground, serving the country's poorest communes. The program has delivered 3,375 road sub-
projects, 2393 irrigation schemes; 2478 schools; 1573 water supply schemes; 995 power supply
schemes; 367 markets; 489 healthcare stations; and 976 community houses.8 The results from an
impact evaluation of P 135-2 currently being conducted by CEM are expected in December 2011.

IV.       BANK SUPPORT TO GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND LINK TO CAS/CPS

55.     The proposed operation is fully aligned with the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2007-2011, which is based on the current Government's SEDP (2006-2010), considered
by the Bank and other donors as embodying the main principles of results-based poverty
reduction strategy. The proposed operation is most strongly aligned with the social inclusion pillar of
the CPS, addressing two outcomes of `better access to services and infrastructure for the rural poor
'and` ethnic minorities in rural areas more fully integrated into development processes.' It also
contributes to the governance pillar of the CPS, particularly with respect to the outcome `modernized
planning towards development objectives, with more participatory approaches.' In addition, the
proposed operation is a part of a programmatic series of development policy credits, which is fully
consistent with the emphasis of the CPS on new modalities for delivery of development assistance,
and partnerships between Government and donors around program-based approaches, underpinned by
the Hanoi Core Statement commitments adopted by the Consultative Group Meeting in 2005. The
proposed operation is included in both the previous CAS (2003-06) and ongoing CPS (2007-11).

COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DONORS

56.      This series of operations has served as an effective vehicle for coordinating development
partner support for the Vietnam's NTP for poverty reduction. Government and its development
partners for P135-2 have engaged through a Partnership Committee which ensures that reporting,
supervision and policy dialogue are streamlined and standardized to minimize the incremental
demands on implementing agencies. All partners participate in an annual joint review exercise as
part of a consensus-based approach to assess the progress and identify changes needed. This
engagement is led by the Government, with rotating donor coordination. Australia, Finland, and
Ireland provide parallel budget support to P135-2, of approximately $45m, $26m, and $41m
equivalent, respectively. In late 2009, the EU and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) joined
in the Partnership with financial contributions of approximately $17m and $1m equivalent,
respectively. In addition, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Finland, AusAID,
Ireland and the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) are providing TA at national
and provincial levels. The latest program's Joint Progress Review was in October 2010 and served as
a basis for preparing the proposed operation.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

57.     The series of operations was designed to complement and build on the Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and investment operations. It bridges the gap between the
macro-reform agenda of the PRSCs and the micro-operational foundations of ongoing investment
operations by supporting a set of policy and institutional actions to deepen the reforms targeted at
responding to the needs of marginalized ethnic minority communities concentrated in the poorest,
most remote areas of the country. It drew on the demonstrated results from relevant, community

driven development (CDD)-type investment operations supported by the World Bank and other
donors.

58.     The proposed operation scales up policy and institutional innovations demonstrated to
be effective under ongoing IDA-supported projects. These included the First Northern Mountains
Poverty Reduction Project (NMPRP-1) and Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project
(CBRIP), both implemented by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). NMPRP-1 and
CBRIP promoted informed participation and civic engagement at community level in basic
infrastructure provision and, in the case of NMPRP, in complementary support for agricultural
extension, health and education services. Between them, NMPRP and CBRIP were implemented
in 19 of the 47 P135-2 provinces. A recently approved Second NMPRP complements the basic
service focus of P135-2 by prioritizing support on the linkages between communities and
economic opportunities.

59.     The proposed operation also complements other programs supported by the Bank
which strengthen provision of core education and health services in ethnic minority
communities. The Bank is providing considerable support to education services in ethnic minority
communities through a geographically targeted Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children
Project and its support to the Education for All initiative in the context of Government's Education
National Targeted Program. The Bank-supported Second Higher Education Project also includes a
small grants program targeted to universities in ethnic minority areas. In the area of health sector, the
Bank's support includes three on-going regional health projects, the Mekong Health Support Project,
Northern Uplands Health Support Project, and the Central North Region Health Support Project.

LESSONS LEARNED

60.     The design of the program initiated in the first P135-2 Support Operation reflected
general World Bank experience in the design of policy operations, as described in Box 3 and
discussed more extensively in the Program Document for the first and second operations.


       BOX 3. GOOD PRACTICES FOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY LENDING AND EVIDENCE UNDER
                                        P135-2

    Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

    The operation supports the reformed aspects of one of the Government's principal national targeted
    programs for poverty reduction, identified through an exceptionally thorough consultation process
    involving central and sub-national agencies and field studies in the context of the P135-2 Midterm
    Review (MTR). It benefits from broad support across at least five participating ministries and 45
    provincial governments. Vietnam's impressive economic performance and overall achievements in
    poverty reduction attest to its track record in policy reform, and previous Bank support through five
    PRSCs has seen steady policy implementation. The operation addresses a high-priority, strategic agenda
    for the country in contributing to narrowing the poverty gap between lagging regions and population
    groups (notably ethnic minorities) and the rest of the country.

    Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
    accountability framework

    The Bank's support was built around and summarized in a focused policy matrix or results framework
    which provides a vehicle for coordinated donor support to a strategic reform agenda over this period.
    Three bilateral donor partners joindc the Bank to provide budget support, all relying on the same policy

                                                      20
    matrix/ results framework. Other development partners including bilateral donors and international NGOs
    are also considering aligning their support with the accountability framework underpinning the series of
    operations.

    Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
    circumstances

    The operation adheres fully to the core principles of the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness
    (Vietnam's localized version of the Paris Declaration). It complements and builds on ongoing Bank-
    supported investment operations and macro-level policy lending through PRSCs, and seeks to
    institutionalize key lessons learned through reforms in the policy environment shaping the country's own
    poverty-targeted programs and support their sustained implementation in practice. The policy areas
    supported concern poverty targeting of public investment, community-driven approaches to basic
    infrastructure provision, fiduciary transparency and accountability, and country systems for results
    measurement. The agreed actions are based on the experience with Government and donor financed
    programs on the ground in around a half of all targeted communities, and extensive analytical work to
    synthesize these lessons from experience, reflecting evolving country circumstances and priorities. .

    Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

    The jointly agreed Bank/donor policy matrix uses a limited set of conditions as prior actions (9) across the
    13 selected policy areas, plus 8 additional monitoring actions to gauge overall program progress. The
    policy matrix also includes actions that some bilateral donor partners use as conditions for disbursement
    in the alternate years between the joint operations also supported by the Bank. Conditionality is focused
    on steps considered critical to achieving results on the ground and to strengthen transparent
    implementation and use of resources and are sequenced in support of consistent progress towards program
    objectives.

    Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
    financial support

    Joint progress reviews take place twice each year, timed so as to allow for a predictable review of
    progress and announcement of support levels at the beginning of the budget year. The results framework
    includes outcome indicators which are assessed as part of operation implementation and mid-term review,
    and are closely linked to the supported policy actions. Support for the Government's own results
    measurement system is one of the four priority policy areas in the policy matrix.



61.     The Joint Government-Development Partners mid-term review, the ICR for DPC1, and the
findings from periodic Joint Progress Reviews have documented several additional and specific
lessons learned regarding these DPCs in Vietnam that have informed the current operation as well as
the Government's overall program. These lessons are discussed below.

62.     Programs providing support to the poorest areas face an inherent challenge of
insufficient implementation capacity on the ground. The mid-term review found that the program
had set ambitious targets without sufficient understanding of the constraints and priorities of the poor.
The challenge is particularly acute in the case of P135 because ethnic minorities are not a
homogeneous group; their needs are varied and given social-cultural factors not easily addressed
through standardized national programs.

63.     Different reforms require different timeframes to move from a decision to
implementation. Sensitive areas of institutional or policy reform, such as local procurement and
shifts toward market-linked production support, require longer time for dialogue and agreement
before they gain traction and demonstrate results, usually beyond any specific DPC operation or
series of operations. Therefore, several incremental steps should be anticipated over a program
                                                21
period, and it should be recognized that intended outcomes may not be evident even after the 5 year
period. On the other hand, areas such as decentralization and communication have attracted attention
and achieved positive results: almost all communes now could act as investment owners for small-
scale investments; communications are more diversely and effectively carried out.

64.     Policy reforms at the central level should ideally be accompanied by TA at local levels in
the context of a decentralized administrative and budgetary system in Vietnam to assist the local
governments to implement the agreed reforms, and to ensure timely feedback to the central level. In
the case of P135, CEM lacked an adequate decentralized structure to play this role and the technical
assistance provided for the program initially did not include decentralized support. If this had been in
place, it is likely that the impact of policy action on the ground would have been accelerated
considerably. Since TA is so critical to reinforce reforms at the local levels tasked with
implementation, particular attention should be paid to ensuring provision of a strong, sub-nationally
focused TA program to reinforce capacity and understanding to implement reforms, as well as to
support better information and experience-sharing between provinces and between levels of
Government.

65.     Downward accountability and the use of information are critical. It is critical that the
lowest level of government is empowered to address the needs of the constituents it is serving, with
each higher level of government reflecting adequately the priorities and realities communicated from
the lower levels of government in the policy-making process. Effective monitoring and supervision,
and transmission of relevant information can only be effective if such information is understood to be
used for sound decision-making, which reflects the needs and reality on the ground. Intermediate
levels of the government needs to have incentives to perform their roles and must be impressed upon
that accountability goes both upwards and downwards. Modern monitoring tools and good indicators
are means to establishing this chain of communications. It is useful to define specific objective
indicators for monitoring progress in each policy area, with baseline data against which to compare
the progress. The use of a programmatic series of operations provides scope for adjusting indicators
with experience.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

66.     Recent analytical work confirmed the policy direction of P135-2 and sharpened the
focus on fiduciary elements and informed participation. The analytical underpinnings of the
P135-2 are described in detail in the Program Document for DPC1. They include the evaluations of
P135-1, as well as other CDD-type operations in Vietnam, including NMPRP. They were
complemented by the 2004 Public Expenditure Review and other studies of decentralization. The
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2007) identified areas for improvement in sub-
national public financial management, highlighting the need to increase public financial management
capacity, and to strengthen auditing, particularly the absence of mechanisms for review of
implementation of inspection/auditing missions. These issues are addressed in P135-2 through the
fiduciary transparency and accountability policy area in both DPC2 and the proposed operation.

67.      The recent Country Social Assessment: Ethnicity and Development in Vietnam (CSA)
(2009) provides an in-depth analysis of the situation of ethnic minorities, particularly in such
sectors as access to services, livelihood opportunities and impacts of targeted policies. The CSA
identifies six primary factors for continued ethnic minority poverty: lower levels of education; less
mobility; less access to financial services; less productive lands; lower market access; and
stereotyping and other cultural barriers. The CSA also indicates six policy priorities to address these
factors: (i) improving the quality and public access to information on minorities to serve as the basis
for designing cultural appropriate service interventions; (ii) using affirmative action programs,
                                                  22
particularly in education, to increase representation of particularly less numerous groups in
administration of services to these same communities; (iii) increasing understanding of cultural
differences, particularly with respect to agricultural practices and land rights; (iv) strengthening
cultural inclusion through recognition and support of cultural differences, particularly of the most
marginalized groups; support; (v) supporting ethnic voices through strengthening of grassroots
participatory processes in the context of local governance and support to minority-run NGOs; and (vi)
opening dialogue on new approaches such as for more effective targeting of vulnerable groups and
consideration of moving from blanket approaches and programs for ethnic minorities to more
differentiated approaches. These results, which are consistent with the P135-2 outcomes and the
policy actions taken under DPC1, are reinforced in the implementing guidelines and manuals for
procurement and production support under DPC2, and are the emphasis of the accelerated,
decentralized technical assistance agreed by Government and Development Partners at the mid-term
review and the subsequent JPR for the DPC3.


V.     THE PROPOSED OPERATION

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

68.     Development Objective. The Program Development Objective is to improve the results of
one of Vietnam's National Targeted Programs for poverty reduction, P135-2, through strengthening
four policy areas: poverty targeting; decentralization, participation and empowerment; fiduciary
transparency and accountability; and monitoring and evaluation. The proposed operation would
continue to support policy and institutional reforms to improve the results of P135-2. The operation
aims to promote improvements in informed participation by the communities, as well as increased
fiduciary control, accountability and quality evaluation in the Government's poverty-targeted public
investment programs.

69.      This operation is the last in the programmatic series of three DPCs, and accompanies the last
year of the P135-2 implementation. As such, it seeks to support policy actions that would complete
and expedite the reform agenda already underway. It also sought to reinforce and help to embed the
reforms already achieved as a way of influencing Government's successor programs to P135-2.
Overall progress on the series of operations is positive and consistent with the program outcome
targets.

70.     Expected benefits and results include: (a) better targeting and delivery of public investment
resources contributing to increased level, security and sustainability of livelihoods of ethnic minority
households that remain deep pockets of poverty; (b) higher quality and more cost-effective support
services and basic infrastructure used by poor, ethnic minority households in remote locations to
access markets, wage-earning opportunities, education and health services, and sources of public
information; (c) greater responsiveness of local authorities to citizens' and communities' demands for
more effective service provision; and (d) an improved governance and performance of NTPs and
other government programs through enhanced public participation, oversight of public financial
management and procurement, and results-based planning.

PROGRESS ON ACHIEVING PRIOR ACTIONS

71.     Overall progress on achieving program goals for the proposed operation is satisfactory. In
particular, four prior actions agreed to during negotiation9 of the predecessor operation in the
series are considered achieved. It should be noted that while policy decisions have clearly been
taken, implementation on the ground is still ongoing, with some actions more advanced than others.
The satisfactory attainment of the four prior actions demonstrates the commitment of the Government
to achieve the program goals.

   When the predecessor operation, P135-2 DPC2, was negotiated, six prior actions were agreed upon. However, two
of these: (i) "CEM to disseminate P135-2 related documents and materials in the five principal ethnic minority
languages", and (ii) "at least 30 provinces have started producing MIS reports to search for and report on the inputs,
outputs and short term results," are considered to be implementation of previously adopted policy reforms. As such,
they were deemed not suitable as prior actions. It should be noted that good progress has been made on these two
items.

72.      The Joint Review missions of P135-2 in 2009 and 2010 provided a basis for assessing
progress towards program outcomes. The joint review conducted in October 2010 was based on the
reports from provinces and the various stakeholder discussions in selected participating communes,
districts and provinces. This review is used by the Government and development partners to evaluate
progress in the achievement of policy actions. The agreed summary matrix of the progress made
under this and the previous two operations and the agreed aide memoire of the joint review are shown
in Annex 3, and 4, respectively. In order to give a fuller picture of the Government's overall
program, the policy matrix reports on other policy reforms undertaken in addition to the prior actions.
These reforms are described briefly below.

Policy Area I: Poverty Targeting

73.      Targeting and resource allocation. This series of operations sought to support improved
efficiency of targeting and enhanced transparency. Under DPC1, the Government adopted the system
of criteria-based allocation, moving away from equal distribution of resources to all program
communes irrespective of population and poverty rates, which was the system used under P135-1.
Program communes were required to make public the list of beneficiaries. The recent JPR mission
confirmed effective implementation of these policy reforms: both beneficiary and non-beneficiary
households expressed satisfaction in the selection process in the program communes visited, and
officials at all levels of the government were aware of the criteria-based allocation system.

74.     Operations and Maintenance (O&M). Allocating funds to operations and maintenance is a
cost-effective way of managing infrastructure investments. However, prior to P135-2, no O&M
budget allocation was made under any NTP or other investment operations. This was generally
considered the responsibility of investment owners or the end users, which caused difficulties for
poor communes, resulting in premature deterioration of infrastructure investments. A prior action in
P135-2 DPC2 supported the policy decision to allocate O&M budgets to provinces. However,
review missions found that implementation on the ground was not uniform as the concept was
relatively new to the country. To further support this critical policy reform, DPC3 supports issuance
of a participatory O&M manual as a prior action. This prior action has been met. Field assessments
show that more experience is required so that the appropriate use of O&M funds is more uniformly
implemented on the ground.


                                                        25
75.      Livelihoods support. P135-1 had almost no support for private goods/livelihoods activities
(less than 4 percent of the budget), which was recognized as an omission in efforts aiming to address
poverty among ethnic minorities. As a result, P135-2 included up to 20 percent of the total resources
for this purpose. However, implementation guidance has been insufficient to promote optimal use of
these resources for the intended purposes. As a result, and as a prior action under DPC2, the Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has prepared a circular clarifying relevant
implementation aspects particularly regarding the use of funds for investment costs and cost-sharing
requirements. Furthermore, with IFAD assistance, MARD has also prepared technical manuals to
further detail how livelihoods support may be provided in different ecological and market
environments. Roll-out of these manuals and related training was being monitored as a benchmark in
2010.

Policy Area II: Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment

76.      Informed public participation in planning and management. Planning processes for NTP
investments, including under P135-1, varied considerably in terms of transparency and opportunities
for community participation. In addition, there has been limited coordination of the planning
processes between these and other local investment activities except through the district and
provincial level screening processes. These factors resulted in both lower participation rates, less
awareness of public investment efforts, and therefore lower satisfaction rates of communities with
investments. In order to increase awareness of P135-2, CEM formulated a communications strategy
for the program (a prior action for DPC1) and the Prime Minister approved requisite funding for its
implementation (including dissemination through multiple media outlets and ethnic minority
languages). The MTR found that while there was general understanding of P135-2 objectives and
activities, more focused attention was required to fully promote the participatory planning and
transparency elements supported under the program. To address this challenge, CEM issued a
manual on participatory planning for the use of P135-2 beneficiary communes, as a prior condition
for DPC3, underscoring the importance of participatory operations and maintenance and
participation of women. In addition, increased availability of relevant materials in ethnic minority
languages was monitored during the preparation for DPC3. Satisfactory progress has been made in
this area.

77.     Investment ownership. Having taken a more active role in prioritizing local level
investments, promoting direct management and ownership of relevant infrastructure by communities
and lower levels of Government is desired under the GoV's Democratic Governance Decree to ensure
alignment with local priorities and increase local responsibility for maintaining investments. To help
encourage this process, CEM's development of specific guidance to provinces on transparent criteria
to be used to determine commune readiness to assume investment ownership responsibility was a
prior action for DPC1, while issuing of specific criteria for identifying communes for investment
ownership as well as criteria for targeting technical support from the districts, was a prior action for
DPC2. By the end of 2008, Provinces and Districts had transferred investment ownership to 1,000
communes, or over 60 percent of the total under P135-2. However, while the MTR indicated that
communes with investment ownership generally had higher satisfaction rates with P135-2
investments, it also highlighted a number of challenges in the process of devolving ownership. In
particular, both communes and districts emphasized the need for districts to strengthen their role in
support of commune monitoring boards for the development of technical designs, procurement
processing and technical oversight of civil works. Accordingly, as a prior action for DPC3, it was
agreed that technical taskforces that draw from provincial and district technical staff should be
formed in selected provinces, to help accelerating the transfer of investment ownership to 100 percent
of communes supported by P135-2. At the end of 2010, task forces had been set up in 17 provinces,

                                                  26
including the 11 provinces with TA projects, with clear TORs defined to help communes in the role
of investment owners.

78.      Capacity Building in Support of Decentralization. While the Grassroots Democracy
Decree encourages participation and transparency in all local development activities, NTPs provide
very little or no dedicated funding for capacity development to support this objective. Under P135,
support for local-level institutional capacity-building was increased from less than 1 percent under
P135-1, to a minimum of 7 percent of total program cost of P135-2. This was confirmed in the Prime
Minister's Approval No. 206/TTgt-QHQT (dated February 8, 2007) which was a prior action for
DPC1, and a capacity building plan was adopted in 2008. Evidence from assessments conducted for
the MTR indicate higher participation rates in investment planning and supervision in P135-2
communes and for P135-2 investments within commune than for other local investment programs.
As indicated above, there remains significant scope to further utilize technical assistance support to
strengthen communications and capacity building activities at the district and commune levels to
broaden popular participation in the investment planning, decision making and supervision processes.

Policy Area III: Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability

79.     Procurement of Small-Scale Infrastructure. Evaluations of P135 investments indicate that
they are completed at lower unit-costs than similar public investments, and also that there is further
scope to improve the cost-effectiveness of investments made, particularly through the use of more
transparent and competitive public procurement methods. Moreover, it was noted that opportunities
to generate greater levels of local employment through the use of community contracting methods
were being missed. Provisions under P135-2 to introduce and promote these methods, which are not
explicitly covered by Vietnam's procurement law, were found to be insufficiently clear to encourage
their wide-spread use. Therefore, in 2008, the preparation of a procurement manual to guide the
application of these unfamiliar methods was a prior action for DPC2. Furthermore, detailed
instructions on community participation procurement methods were issued in 2009, a prior action
for DPC3.

80.     Public Financial Management. The joint IDA/Government Public Expenditure Review-
Integrated Fiduciary Assessments of 2004 and 2005 found that fiduciary controls in public
expenditure management under P135 and some other NTPs were stronger than thought though there
remained scope for increased public disclosure of financial management information. Therefore, as a
prior action for DPC1, MOF issued Guidance No. 2849 (dated December 29, 2006), giving
instructions for MOF to prepare processes and procedures for fund-flows reflecting the provision of
funds from the state budget to each spending agency at central, provincial, district and commune
levels; and quarterly financial reports and reconciliation of P135-2 expenditures between spending
agencies and the State Treasury. Implementation of these procedures, including placing reports on
transfer and use of funds to provinces on the MOF website, occurred in 2007 and 2008, and continued
being monitored as benchmarks in 2009 and 2010.

81.     Independent Fiduciary Oversight. NTPs, including P135, had traditionally only been
subjected to compliance audits by the State Audit of Viet Nam (SAV). However, the issuance of
Guidance No. 2849 ­ a prior action for DPC1 ­ provided the basis for more systematic and
transparent auditing of P135 with provincial coverage being progressively increased year by year. To
further increase transparency of the auditing process, Government/SAV is sharing the annual audit
plans with P135-2 donors for comment; audit reports are submitted within six months of the end of
the audited year; implementation of each prior year's audit recommendations reviewed; and audit
reports are publicly disclosed on SAV's website and through the media, in accordance with the
provisions of the State Audit Law. SAV attempted its first audit of P135-2 in 2007, in which it
                                                 27
reviewed issues of compliance, coordination, management, and progress towards objectives as well as
surveys of beneficiaries as an integral part of the audit process. Consistent with State Audit Law,
specific sections of the audit were disseminated through a press release and on the SAV website. The
2008 audit was expanded to 10 provinces, a prior action for DPC2, and its findings correlated
closely with other independent assessments such as the National Assembly Commission for Ethnic
Minorities and development partners' field reports. The SAV audits are considered a success in
terms of their quality, transparency, accessibility and as a mechanism for independent supervision of
public programs. It was hence agreed that to further strengthen the accountability framework, SAV
and CEM would review and share with development partners reports from the audited provinces
indicating the actions taken by provinces to implement the previous year's audit recommendations,
including reimbursement of funds to the State Budget. Government is working with development
partners to strengthen the follow-up to these reports as part of the regular joint monitoring review
process. Government extended SAV's audit coverage to 14 provinces for the 2009 audit, and 18
provinces for 2010. The quality of audit reports which contain some aspects of performance audit has
been improved over time.

82.     Community Contribution. The practice of community contribution under NTPs and other
local investments is generally confined to contribution of land and/or unpaid labor. Inter-ministerial
Circular No. 676, a prior action for DPC1, required that compulsory local contributions be
affordable; that the poorest households be exempted from such contributions; and that mechanisms
shall be developed to promote paid local labor in civil works, with priority for wage earning
opportunities given to poor households. While interest in such wage-labor activities varies from
region to region, and may still be affected by residual impacts of the global economic crisis, rules and
guidelines to encourage communes to utilize local paid labor in P135-2 investments were supposed to
be developed in 2009. Moreover, such information has been reflected in commune accounts and is
monitored through the program's MIS. The policy decision to capture and monitor such local
contributions so that the information collected from the grass-roots level can be used in the future
policy-making was agreed to as a prior action for DPC3. MOF and the State Treasury of Vietnam
issued an official instruction (No. 319/KBNN-KHTH, dated March 4, 2009), underscoring the
relevance of the existing general guidelines (issued in 2003) to P135-2.

Policy Area IV: Monitoring and Evaluation

83.     Impact Evaluation. While evaluations have generally been part of assessing NTP
performance, there has been limited use of statistically based impact surveys or efforts to correlate a
range of quantitative and qualitative sources of information. With TA support from UNDP, the
World Bank, and other agencies, the Government has designed a comprehensive M&E system for
P135-2. Outcome indicators and the overall M&E framework were agreed and adopted, and a
baseline survey was designed including a matched control group as a prior action for DPC1. The
baseline was conducted in 2007 and analysis completed in November 2008 ­ a first for an NTP. The
survey results were matched with results from other independent assessments, including the field
reports from the National Assembly Commission on Ethnic Minorities, development partner field
observations and SAV audit results and shared and discussed in an open forum with Government,
donor and civil society representatives ­ a prior action for DPC2 ­ as the basis for agreeing on
additional policy actions and institutional measures to strengthen progress towards agreed program
objectives and outcomes. In order to ensure timely implementation of the end of program evaluation
survey work, the preparation of terms of reference and budget estimate for the survey and assessment
was a benchmark for 2009, which has been achieved, and implementation of the survey a benchmark
for 2010.


                                                  28
84.     Process Monitoring. NTPs, while regularly collecting information on progress, generally do
not institute a standardized, computer-based MIS which covers process as well as input and output
elements, nor are these usually complemented by client satisfaction tools such as citizen report cards,
etc. Recognizing the challenges in monitoring the effectiveness of implementing the agreed policy
changes under P135-2 in 47 provinces throughout the country, CEM, with MPI support, adapted the
Government's Portfolio Monitoring Tool (PMT) ­ developed under the auspices of the Partnership
Group on Aid Effectiveness ­ as the basis for its own computerized MIS for P135-2. The action plan
to adapt the PMT for purposes of tracking and reporting on inputs, outputs, and intermediate
outcomes of P135-2 was adopted as a prior action for DPC1. Implementation of the action plan
was delayed, but as of October 2008, training of trainers had been carried out in the provinces for use
of the MIS and a number of communes, districts and provinces have begun to generate reports for the
MTR. In parallel, a beneficiary satisfaction survey for P135-2 was carried out with 480 households
in 16 communes in four provinces in September/October 2008. Both the establishment of the PMT
MIS and the use of a citizen report-card type survey are firsts for NTPs in Vietnam. As a prior
action for DPC2, results of this survey and of an independent "best practices" assessment were used
as part of a cross-learning event with participating P135-2 provinces as part of the MTR. Ensuring
that the PMT is established in and being used for reporting by at least 30 provinces was an agreed
prior action for DPC3. However, given that this represents the implementation of previously agreed
policy actions, it was subsequently deemed unsuitable as a prior action. At the time of the October
2010 JPR 22 provinces were running the PMT. CEM is preparing for the end-of-program survey and
evaluation. Citizen report cards will continue to be used as part of the exercise. Terms of Reference
for the end-of-program survey have also been developed. Results of the evaluation are expected to be
available by the end of December 2011.

VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

85.     P135-2 uses a community-based approach to fight poverty, complementing other
poverty-reduction programs which are based exclusively on household targeting. To this end,
most funding under the program supports infrastructure to improve water and sanitation and
connections to markets, and builds social capital and the capacities of communities to participate in
the decision-making processes of choices and actions that affect their collective lives. These activities
are complemented by more finely targeted support for access to basic education, electricity,
healthcare and production assistance for food security.

86.     P135-2 is effectively targeting the communes with the highest proportion of poor
households. The baseline study (2007) estimated that 43 percent of households covered by P135-2
are below the poverty line compared to about 16 percent nationally, confirming that emphasis on
ethnic minorities used in the program is appropriate. The study found that poverty in these
communities is twice as high amongst ethnic minorities as amongst the Kinh and Hoa groups. Self-
reported poverty rates were similar to income-based poverty measures at 51 percent for ethnic
minorities and 28 percent for Kinh and Hoa headed households. Almost half of households in the
program area declared that they lacked food over the past 12 months, of which over a third indicated
frequent periods of food shortage. Less than 15 percent of households had access to piped or filtered
water or hygienic toilets. Insufficient physical facilities were identified as the most serious obstacles
to primary schools attendance in 85 percent of the P135-2 communes. Although the presence of
primary health care facilities was nearly universal, the rate of free medical treatment was relatively
low at 55 percent, similar to the rate in less poor communes. Income generation is limited by poor
road access; over a third of P135-2 villages do not have vehicle-accessible roads, limiting movement

                                                   29
of key productive goods and labor, resulting in lower yields and less focus on market crops amongst
households in P135-2 areas.

87.     P135-2 has had significant positive social and poverty impacts during its implementation
since 2006. The mid-term review (2008/09) confirmed that P135-2 had been effective in increasing
access of remote communities to roads, school buildings and other public infrastructure, and is
beginning to channel effectively improved social services for education and sanitation. In addition,
the P135-2 investments have contributed significantly to narrowing or closing the gap between
program and non-program communities. As P135-2 interventions were focused on longer term
solutions, building physical and human capital to facilitate greater labor migration and market
integration, measured poverty rates are not expected to decline rapidly, especially in the more isolated
target communities where the challenges are the greatest. The Government intends to use the lessons
learned through P135-2 implementation to tackle remaining challenges, while paying due attention to
cultural heritages of different ethnic minorities.

88.     While it is difficult to disentangle the effects of the specific policy actions from the overall
program results, the four prior actions are considered to be important building blocks to attaining the
overall goals of the program. The issuance of manuals and guidelines for community procurement is
expected to empower the communes to participate in planning process, O&M decisions and
procurement. Newly approved national targeted program of New Rural Areas (managed by MARD)
has taken up community contracting similar to the manual developed under P135-2. The manuals on
participatory planning and operations and maintenance (O&M) have been applied program wise.
Preliminary results show that the manuals were appreciated by local people and authorities in local
planning. Establishment of program taskforce has accelerated and supported decentralization of
investment ownership.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

89.     As required under Operations Policy 8.60, the task team determined if there are significant
effects on the country's environment, forests, and other natural resources. "Significant effects" are
defined as "environmental changes of sufficient magnitude, duration, and intensity as to have non-
negligible effects on the natural resource base and on human welfare."10 An examination of the
environmental implications of P135-2 was undertaken during preparation by the Government,
building on an earlier, generally positive, assessment of the environmental impacts of P135-1
conducted in 2005 with the support from UK's Department for International Development. The
environmental examination of P135-2 also incorporated the findings of environmental safeguards
compliance monitoring conducted under the IDA-supported Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction
and Community Based Rural Infrastructure Projects. Experience under those operations, which
finance similar investments to those under the infrastructure component of P135-2, indicated that
adverse environmental effects were very small, whether considered individually or in the
aggregate. The four prior conditions of the proposed operation, relating to issuance of manuals,
establishment of a program taskforce, and issuance of guidelines for information-collecting are in
themselves expected to have negligible environmental effects.

90.     In the longer run, the program is expected to result in positive effects on the environment
through efforts at environmental awareness and specific technical adaptations and safeguards applied
in agriculture and infrastructure activities. "Capacity building and awareness raising to better
integrate environmental considerations in investment planning and implementation" was one of the

10
  World Bank Toolkit "Assessing the Environmental, Forest, and other Natural Resource Aspects of Development
Policy Lending" (World Bank, 2008).
                                                     30
policy areas pursued under P135-2. CEM has intensified its environmental communications activities
program-wide, as well as developed and delivered targeted training activities in communities in
environmentally sensitive areas such as those near protected areas and areas subject to erosion. These
activities have been supported, in part by the increased, decentralized TA. In addition, the new
production component guidelines promote the use of environmentally friendly production practices as
an alternative to heavy use of chemical inputs.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

91.      Institutional and Management Arrangements. The Committee for Ethnic Minorities
(CEM) is the lead agency for managing and supervising the implementation of P135-2. It does so in
coordination with four other ministries, Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), Ministry of
Finance (MOF), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), and Ministry of
Construction (MOC), per inter-ministerial circular No. 676 (see Annex 2), that are also co-signatories
to the IMC. These ministries have representatives on the Program Steering Committee, which is
chaired by a Deputy Prime Minister. The State Audit of Vietnam (SAV), the National Assembly
Committee for Ethnic Minorities, and the Vietnam Fatherland Front, among others, play the role of
independent supervision bodies. At provincial level, a Steering Committee for the implementation of
the P135-2 is set up with participation from all related agencies and the standing agency is the
Provincial Committee for Ethnic Minorities, headed by the Chairperson of the Provincial People's
Committee (PPC). The PPC ensures an enabling environment for the effective implementation of the
P135-2 by developing and issuance of provincial guidance regulations and implementation of
capacity building. The same institutional setting applies at the district level. The District People's
Committee provides guidance and supervision for planning and implementation at commune level.
The Commune People's Committee is the investment owner of P135-2 investments and makes
decisions on implementation and supervision. At commune level there is a `program management
unit' established by the District People's Committee.

92.      Implementation Roles and Responsibilities. CEM is responsible for overall policy
development, inter-agency coordination, capacity support to provinces, monitoring, assessment and
reporting to the Prime Minister's Office and the National Assembly. Program funds are transferred
directly to participating provinces, which are then allocated amongst communes based on poverty
criteria established by provinces. While most guidelines for implementation of the program are
provided through CEM to the provinces, provinces frequently adjust these guidelines to reflect their
own institutional procedures. Provinces can also initiate their own capacity building and
communications activities. Communes identify priorities for P135-2 funding, which are transmitted
and reviewed at the district and provincial levels for approval. Contracting of investments can be
carried out by either the commune or the district, depending on commune capacity--in many
instances, district will provide technical support to the communes, particularly for designs and
supervision of construction. Reporting is provided by communes through the districts and provinces
which review and consolidate reports which are provided to CEM. Accountability mechanisms
include the elected Commune, District and Provincial Peoples' Councils, as well as the Committee
for Ethnic Minorities of the National Assembly, all of which have the right to review documentation
and seek clarifications on Program activities.

93.     Monitoring and evaluation. According to the inter-ministerial circular No. 676, the PPC
takes overall responsibility for quality, progress, and effectiveness of P135-2. Every quarter the PPC
takes the lead in supervising and monitoring program implementation. The P135 Provincial Standing
Office serves as the lead agency to conduct monitoring and supervision, and assists the PPC in
synthesizing and reporting results to the Central Standing Agency. Monitoring and evaluation are
also achieved through annual audits, independent field missions of the CEM of the National
                                                 31
Assembly, semi-annual joint monitoring missions to the field carried out by Government and
development partners, a mid-term review, and a final evaluation upon program completion. A
baseline study to permit impact evaluation was conducted in 2007 in both a representative `treatment'
sample of P135-2 target communes and in a control sample. Monitoring and evaluation is one of the
four main policy areas supported by this and preceding two operations.

94.      Partnership Committee. A P135-2 Partnership Committee (PC) has been formally
established by the Government to oversee and review progress towards the agreed policy and
institutional actions under the proposed series of operations. The PC is chaired by CEM, and
comprises senior managers and specialists from all those Government agencies that have a role in
P135-2 implementation (including CEM, MOF, MPI, MARD, Office of Government, GSO, and
MOLISA). All co-financing donor agencies are also represented in the PC. The group of donor
representatives in the PC designate one among their group to lead the policy dialogue with the
Government representatives in the PC on a rotational basis. Annual joint progress reviews with IDA/
Development Partners are held annually.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

95.     Public Financial Management. Vietnam's public financial management (PFM)
environment is considered adequate to support this operation. The most recent Country Financial
Accountability Assessment conducted in 2007 concluded that `the financial management risk to
proper use, control and reporting of funds that are managed through the Vietnam public financial
management systems is assessed as moderate.' The Government has maintained strong
ownership of the PFM reform agenda and continues to lead a coordinated reform program in
consultation with the donor community. Financial management and accountability systems of the
government have improved but there is not yet full compliance with a number of new laws and
regulations. Financial management risks arise from weaknesses in implementation and
compliance gaps. The quality and extent of independent audit oversight remains low given the
financial audit programs of the State Audit of Vietnam do not yet accord with international
standards and the development of an effective internal audit functions is only at an embryonic
stage. A more detailed discussion of public financial management in Vietnam is at Annex 4.

96.    Foreign Exchange Environment. An IMF safeguards assessment has not been conducted
in Vietnam. This assessment would provide information about the foreign exchange control
environment of the SBV and integrity of financial information. The SBV is subject to auditing by
SAV on an annual basis, however under the current laws, the audited financial statements and
audit reports of SBV are not made public. Notwithstanding these factors, IDA understands,
following recent discussions with the IMF, that there are no serious concerns with the SBV's
foreign exchange control environment.

97.     A number of the reforms to improve the transparency of financial management and auditing
are incorporated and monitored as part of the proposed operation, including financial reporting by
spending agency (investment owners) and State Treasury, reconciled annually, and periodic public
release of the results of annual audits through press conferences. In addition, CEM is working with
SAV and MOF to update progress made by provinces on recommendations on audit from the
previous year, and making available these reports in relevant ministries' websites. Finland is
providing TA to SAV specifically to further strengthen the quality of auditing of P135-2 towards full
performance audits, as well as to strengthen the follow-up actions taken by provinces and central
agencies based on the audit results. Government has further agreed to work closely with IDA in
strengthening the fiduciary review aspect of the Joint Review Missions.
                                                 32
DISBURSEMENT, REPORTING AND AUDITING ARRANGEMENTS

98.     The proposed Credit will follow IDA's disbursement procedures for development policy
operations. The Credit proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the
Program and not tied to any specific purchases, and no procurement requirements will be needed.
Various measures have been taken to ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and institutions are
adequate to proceed with support from IDA and other development partners. The Recipient will open
and maintain a dedicated foreign currency Deposit Account (DA) in US dollars at the State Bank of
Vietnam for the Recipient's use once the Credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective.
The dedicated DA will form part of the country's official foreign reserves. The Recipient shall
ensure that upon the deposit of the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount in Vietnamese
Dong is credited in the Recipient's budget management system to be used for budget expenditures in
a manner acceptable to IDA. If the proceeds of the Credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined
in the Financing Agreement (FA), IDA will require the Recipient to refund the amount directly to
IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA shall be cancelled. The administration of this Credit will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.

99.      Through SBV, the Borrower will report to IDA on the amounts deposited in the foreign
currency account and credited to the budget management system and on the timing of such deposits
and credits. The Borrower will forward the report within one month of receiving the letter from IDA
advising of the deposit, and the report will include: (i) statement of the exact sum received into the
dedicated DA and the timing of such receipts; (ii) confirmation to IDA that all withdrawals are for
eligible expenditures; (iii) confirm to IDA details of the Treasury account to which the Vietnamese
Dong equivalent of the Credit proceeds will be credited, the credited amount, and their timing, and
(iv) a report on receipts and disbursements for the dedicated DA.

100. Flow of funds and auditing. To address the potential residual fiduciary risks related to the
foreign exchange environment, the Borrower will maintain a dedicated foreign currency deposit
account (DA) for the proceeds of the Credit, and will report on the funds flow of the dedicated
deposit account. The Government will, if deemed necessary by IDA, allow an independent external
audit of the dedicated foreign currency deposit account (DA).

101. The 2005 State Audit Law has established the SAV as an independent institution reporting to
the National Assembly on the uses of State Budget funds. The SAV has acted as the auditor of the
Credit who prepared (i) annual audit plan acceptable to donors prepared by the start of the year; (ii)
annual audit conducted with increasing sample coverage over the years. For 2009 it was eighteen (18)
provinces; (iii) FY2009 Audit Report issued by August 30, 2010; (iv) Implementation of prior year's
audit recommendations reviewed as part of each JMR mission based on summary of actions taken by
provinces and central agencies to implement 2010 audit recommendations including reimbursement
and (v) audit reports publicly disclosed through the media and website in accordance with the State
Audit Law. The Government will, if deemed necessary by IDA, allow an independent external audit
of the dedicated deposit currency account.

RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT

102. At the beginning of this series of operation, three categories of risks were identified:
institutional capacity, fiduciary, and policy choices which are not adapted to the needs of ethnic
minorities. Specific measures were put in place to mitigate and manage these risks as a part of the
overall design of P135-2 series. The institutional capacity turned out to be a main factor in
constraining effective implementation of the program. The capacity constraints are addressed

                                                 33
through the proposed operation by issuance of user-friendly manuals and guidelines, as well as setting
up taskforces at sub-national levels with TA from development partners to assist the activities.

103. Fiduciary risks were mitigated through introduction of more rigorous auditing and
strengthened transparency and social accountability mechanisms. In particular, issuance of
procurement manual and detailed instructions on community procurement is supported as prior
conditions in this and previous operations in this series.

104. Policy-related risks, particularly those associated with not paying enough attention to
different needs of different ethnic minorities, were mitigated through diligent encouragement of
community participation in all phases of program. As the proposed operation is the last in the series,
there is an additional risk of sustainability of the reforms that have been adopted or are underway.
While there is no easy way to mitigate this risk, the task team continues to engage with CEM and
other relevant agencies, such as MOLISA, MARD, MPI and MOF to ensure that major elements of
the reform agenda remain in place under P135-3 and other poverty reduction programs.

105. In addition, increased macroeconomic instability has emerged as one of the risks facing the
proposed operation. Rising inflation, volatility in the foreign exchange market, slower than expected
fiscal consolidation, problems in the state-owned enterprises and health of the banking sector are
some of the factors which have contributed to this risk. In recent months, and especially since mid-
February, however, there has been a new emphasis by the government to stabilize the macroeconomic
situation. The recently adopted policy measures, as expressed in Resolution 11, should help mitigate
the macroeconomic risks facing the country. The risks are mitigated further through continuous
monitoring of the macro situation, close collaboration with the IMF and frequent discussions with the
authorities on implementing policies to reestablish and maintain macroeconomic stability.

                LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY (English Translation)


                                                                             Ha Noi, March 9, 2011


To: Mr Robert Zoellick
President of the World Bank - Washington, D.C.


       Dear Mr. President,
        The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) in Viet Nam has been
committed and implemented by the Government of Viet Nam, in which, poverty elimination and
socio-economic development for especially disadvantaged areas, areas of ethnic minorities and
mountainous areas are of top priorities.
         During the past 20 years of "Doi moi", Viet Nam has gained numerous achievements in
socio-economic development and poverty elimination, especially in areas of ethnic minorities and
people in difficult circumstances. The outcomes of economic growth have been redistributed with
priorities for National Targeted Programmes (NTPs), in which many are aimed at poverty reduction
and improving living standards for poor people and ethnic minority people.
        In 1998, though Viet Nam experienced financial crisis with GDP growth rate of 4%, the
Government decided to invest in one special programme on socio-economic development for
disadvantaged areas, areas of ethnic minorities and mountainous areas (so called Programme 135).
This programme was implemented almost nationwide (52 out of 63 provinces) and more than 2,400
poorest communes in Viet Nam have been benefited from the Programme. After 7 years of the Phase
I (from 1999-2005), P135 achieved important goals in many social and economic areas, the face of
rural mountainous areas changed significantly.
       In order to continue the support for communes and wards in especially difficult
circumstances, gradually narrow the gaps among regions and ethnic groups, on January 10, 2006, the
Prime Minister issued Decision No.07/2006/QD-TTg on approval to the Socio-Economic
Programme for Especially Less-Developed communes in mountainous and remote areas from 2006 to
2010 (so called P135 Phase II).
         The objectives of the Programme are to: Radically accelerate the production, promote the
agro-economic structural shift in the direction of market-driven production; sustain the improvement
of spiritual and material living conditions of the ethnic people in extremely difficult communes and
villages, and narrow the development gap between ethnic groups and other regions. By 2010,
basically there are no hunger-stricken households in the targeted areas, the number of poor
households drops below 30% based on the poverty line, over 70% of households will obtain an
average income per capital of over 3.5 million VND per year.
        The Programme has 4 main tasks, which are: Production development support and improve
skills and train the people of ethnic minorities on new production practices, accelerate the agro-
economic structural shift, essential infrastructure development. Provide village cadres and commune
heads with skills and knowledge on professional and administrative management, Strengthen capacity
of the community. Provide services to improve the people's living standards, legal assistance to
increase their awareness.
       In order to increase the effectiveness of P135 Phase II and strengthen the foundation for
development efforts at larger scale in the communities which receive support, P135 Phase II has
                                                40
focused more on (i) improve allocation of resources to reach the poor, ii) strengthen decentralization,
participation and empowerment of communities under the programme, iii) strengthen financial
transparency and accountability and iv) strengthen monitoring and evaluation of the programme.
Specific measures in order to achieve the outcomes in 4 "policy areas" have been developed from the
Programme 135 phase I Review and Lessons Learnt, as well as lessons learnt from other Programmes
in the region funded by the Government and development partners.
        According to the review reports from local levels for the period of 2006-2010, the central
budget allocated 14,025.25 billion, by now the implementation rate has reached 100%, disbursement
rate has reached 97,1%. After 5 years of implementation, P135 phase II has covered 1,958
communes, 3,274 wards and villages in especially difficult circumstances in 369 out of 690 districts
under 50 out of 63 provinces. The Programme has gained significant achievements, contributed to
socio-economic development of the mountainous communes, wards and village of especially difficult
circumstances where there are ethnic minorities.
        P135 Phase II has also been benefited from the development of partner-based approach in
accordance with Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and Ha Noi Core Statement on Aid
Effectiveness; these statements emphasize the importance of ownership, harmonization, linkages and
outcomes. The phase II of the Programme started in 2006 with the financial support from Australia,
Finland, Ireland, the UK and the World Bank, technical support from Australia, Finland, International
Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and UNDP. This support has been provided with the
participation of Partnership Group to support the programme, which includes leaders and officials
from relevant ministries and agencies, representatives from international donors, this board plays a
role of an agency to consult the Programme Steering Committee and has established the foundation
for the ongoing policy dialogue, including joint assessment on the achievements gained.
        The achievements of P135 ­phase II are obvious in improving the implementation
management of the programme activities, though there are differences in implementation progress in
different components as well as delays in some areas. The Joint Mid-Term Review of P 135-Phase II
was conducted in November, 2010 led by the Government with participation from all the relevant
ministries and agencies, representation from participating provinces and district, donors and
NGOs/INGOs, with presented the results from annual State Audit from 2007-2010, report on results
from following the recommendations of the State Audit in 2008 has just been finalized, field survey
reports of the Ethnic Minority Council of the National Assembly... have recognized a number of
important changes in policies:
         First, the Committee for Ethnic Minorities, line ministries and local governments have made
efforts to gain significant achievements in creating basic change in mobilization of people's
participation, strengthening the transparency, publicity of the programme implementation process. In
particular, the issuance of planning guidelines for investment activities run by commune level and
Operations and Maintenance Plan was implemented with the participation of the local people, among
those, 30% are female. For the first time in a national programme on poverty reduction, in addition to
manuals and handbooks issued in 2006 and 2007, the guidelines handbook on participatory planning
and Operations and Maintenance Guidelines Handbook have created a basic shift to the approach in
programme implementation from central to local level. With the technical support from technical
assistance projects, trainings on these handbooks have been conducted for staff at communal level in
11 provinces. At the same time, many provinces have promulgated guidelines on using the handbooks
for their communes such as Binh Dinh, Ninh Thuan, Quang Ngai, Kien Giang, An Giang, etc..
       These handbooks and guiding manuals are not only helpful for local staff in implementation
of Programme 135 in local areas, but also seen as important experience in implementation of
programmes and policies on poverty reduction in general and P135 Phase II (2011-2015 with a vision
to 2020) in particular. CEM has assigned the School of Training for Ethnic Minority Staff in
                                                  41
coordination with the Coordination Office for P135 to compile and develop these materials to be used
for trainings, providing guidelines to local levels on implementation of programmes, projects and
policies on ethnic minorities in the next period.
        Secondly, in order to strengthening the decentralization in programme implementation and
technical assistance for communal level in performing their role as project owner, CEM has
instructed and provided technical guidelines to local levels in establishing and sending technical
assistance groups from provincial/district level in some selected provinces who have assisted their
communes in this area with technical support from UNDP, Finnish Embassy, Irish Aid and AusAid.
There have been 17 provinces forming their technical groups to support the programme
implementation. According to local levels, these technical groups have provided timely assistance to
commune staff in addressing challenges in performing their roles as project owner. Although it has
been just implemented in some provinces with technical assistance sources, the form of technical
support groups shows necessity of the support going along with empowerment for project owner at
communal level. This is also a good experience for programme implementation for the next period in
order to strengthen ownership, participation and effectiveness at local level. Thus, the model of
technical support groups and team will be considered to replicate nationwide by CEM in coordination
with line ministries in the period of 2011-2015.
        Thirdly, during the implementation of P135-Phase II, CEM has also coordinated with MPI,
MOF to develop and issue, for the first time within a framework of a National Programme, the
detailed process and procedures on contract with community (community bidding). CEM has
coordinated with provinces to conduct trainings for the communes and wards under P-135 Phase II in
areas where there are technical assistance activities of donors using community bidding. It can be said
that this is a new bidding method, promising to benefit directly the poor in ethnic minority and
mountainous areas. However, the Joint Mid-Term Review has reviewed and re-assessed expectations
related to increasing paid employment opportunities for local people with infrastructure investment
works within P135-2 through community bidding. The interviews with local community and
independent assessment have showed that different local areas have big differences in available labor
forces and accessible employment opportunities, thus, there needs an approach relevant to each
specific area. local employment opportunities need to be significantly improved in poor northern
mountainous provinces, while in other provinces, this issue needs to be monitored as part of the
strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of how daily-paid salary contribution and in-kind
contribution is used for investment works under the Programme in 2009 and 2010 and it's necessary
to apply relevant solutions in order to increase employment opportunities for Northern Mountainous
Provinces. In general, community bidding method is a new approach, which shows great
determination and efforts of the Government in creating more employment and income opportunities
for ethnic minorities and poor people. These efforts have been clearly made in continuing to
mainstream community bidding in the Programme on developing new rural areas and poverty
reduction programmes in the future.
        Fourthly, the Mid-term review team in 2010 has also recognized the development of
regulations and guidelines for implementation on local paid employment contribution and other
contributions of the local people saved in the Information Management System and cost accounting
in liquidation documents of the communes. Financial management has been improved significantly,
transparency has been strengthened with strengthened monitoring of the usage of public financial
resources, however, solutions to improve cost-effectiveness and create paid employment
opportunities within infrastructure construction component under the Programme is still limited.
Quarterly financial support, reports of expenditures and periodical reports in every 6 month on
allocation and grant of funds from P135-phase II has been published in the website of MOF.
However, the implementation of computerization of data and information on contributions of the
local people into MIS system of the Programme still needs to be strengthened.
                                                  42
         P135-phase II is considered the first progamme using high standards of outcome assessment
methodology as well as effective use of scientific and reliable Management information System
(MIS), which is a key tool for identification and addressing programme management issues. The
baseline survey for P135-II, based on statistical sampling, control groups in coordination with GSO,
the survey results have been used as key input for the Joint Mid-Term Review. MIS based on AMT
has been applied in order to monitor the overall investment in Viet Nam established for P135-II. This
is the first time that a NTP in Viet Nam has been able to do this. Although the implementation of MIS
was delayed from 2007 until 2008, trainings in provinces have been completed and the systematic
capacity in generating reports has been confirmed. In addition, the results from Citizen Report Card
survey which has been developed for an NTP in Viet Nam for the first time and initial lesson learnt as
well as comparative assessment among provinces have served as important inputs for assessment of
the Joint Mid-term Review team. In 2010, the Government has made a significant progress in using
MIS at commune, district, provincial and national level consistently and continuing to use
participatory assessment methods such as Citizen Report Card and experience sharing activities in
order to provide information for programme management and extend the usage of these tools for
Programme completion assessment as well as in the design and implementation of P135 in the period
of 2011-2015.
        We believe that the improvements in the programme implementation have shown significant
progress not only in policies but also in the quality of P135 implementation during the past. CEM,
line ministries and local governments have recognized and highly appreciated the values of the policy
improvements that have been made from the cooperation with the World Bank and development
partners. On behalf of the Government of Viet Nam, I would like to express our sincere thanks to
international donors in supporting us to design and implement P135-II until now and the continuous
support in evaluation, quality and progress improvements of the programme in order to achieve the
outcome expected. We would like to reassure the commitment of the Government of Viet Nam in
paying continuous attention and investment in poorest areas of Viet Nam in various ways through
different policies, programmes and projects. The Government has made a strong commitment to
ensure the success of the Programme and continue to maintain a close partnership with the World
Bank and donor community. We do hope that through this close and continuous cooperation, the
Programme will be implemented more effectively and contributed to poverty reduction in the context
that there are increasing risks to the global macro economy and to achieve MDGs.

ANNEX 2: OVERALL GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

1.       The Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in
Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas, 2006-2010 (more familiarly known as `Program 135 Phase
2') is the redesigned successor to a program with the same name implemented over 1998-2005. It
aims to help reduce poverty and promote economic growth among ethnic minority groups and local
people living in remote, mountainous and upland regions of Vietnam, building on lessons from recent
evaluations of Phase 1.

2.        Program objectives. Program 135 Phase 2 (P135-2) has the overall objectives of eradicating
hunger by 2010 in the targeted areas (primarily those listed above as being the poorest in the
country), and reducing the share of poor households to below 30 percent, based on a newly approved
poverty line. Significant design improvements of P135-2 over the previous phase of the program are that: (a)
it is not limited to basic infrastructure provision alone but also includes significantly increased support
for agricultural production and rural livelihoods; (b) it includes criteria for targeting the poorest
villages within poor communes; (c) it aims at wider implementation of the commune-level investment
ownership concept; (d) it provides more resources for operation and maintenance (O&M) of basic infrastructure;
and (e) it provides significantly increased support for local-level capacity building.

3.      Program components. P135-2 has five components: (i) production/ livelihoods support
(accelerating agro-economic productivity, and enhancing income); (ii) infrastructure development
(ensuring provision of essential commune infrastructure on a sustainable basis and which contributes
to improved living conditions, production development and income generation); (iii) capacity
building (provision of training and fostering of commune and grassroots cadres and strengthening
community capacity for effective participation in infrastructure creation, operation and maintenance,
and supervision of village and commune management); (iv) living conditions support (ensuring
improved access to essential social services); and (v) management support (to ensure successful
program implementation).

4.     Component 1 (production/ livelihoods support) comprises various production programs
aiming at introduction of high-yielding crops and new production practices based on participatory and
demand-led extension services.

5.      Component 2 (infrastructure development), focuses on small-scale and essential works to
meet identified needs at commune and village levels. Typical types of works in the program are inter-
village roads/paths, small-scale irrigation, low-voltage power supply, houses for semi-boarding
school students, public market-places and meeting halls for villages, commune clinics with
equipment, clean water and commune-cluster extension centers. Communes are encouraged and
planned to become investment owners with regular support and capacity building from district and
provincial levels. O&M budget is available (at 6.3 percent of total infrastructure budget).

6.       Component 3 (capacity building) is an area of special focus and this marks a major
improvement of P135-2 over its predecessor. Under Program 135 Phase 1, less than 1 percent of the
total program budget was allocated to capacity-building activities. In P135-2, at least 7 percent of the
total program budget is allocated to capacity-building activities. A wide range of capacity-building
activities, topics and target groups has been identified under the program to equip. local leaders,
technical officers, supervision boards and local people at commune and village levels with project

 7.      Component 4 (living standards support) comprises complementary policies aimed at
 improving the living standards and local environment of poor people, their access to public services,
 and helping to narrow the welfare gap between people living in lagging regions and those living in
 better-off regions. The priority policies are for housing, clean water, sanitation and public hygiene,
 healthcare, education and legal aid. These sets of policies are carried out in coordination and
 integration with other NTPs on, notably, healthcare, education, and rural water and sanitation.

 8.      Geographic scope and targeting. P135-2 is implemented in over 1800 poor communes in
 47 provinces (out of a total of 64 in Vietnam), located throughout the country but with the highest
 density of communes in the North-West, South-Central Coast, and Central Highlands regions. These
 communes are characterized by high poverty incidence; upland/ mountainous locations, often along
 the national borders; a predominance of ethnic minorities within the local population; and facing
 constraints to accessibility. One of the new features of the redesigned P135-2 is that the program also
 includes some 3,250 of the poorest villages in Zone II (less poor) communes as part of its finer-
 grained targeting approach. These villages remain as pockets of poverty and need further support and
 public investment. The Government has revised the criteria for zoning and classifying communes
 according to levels of poverty and other dimensions of hardship or difficulty. The list of eligible
 communes shall be updated annually as communes progressively `graduate' from P135-2.

 9.       Funding. The main funding source for the implementation of P135-2 is the state budget,
 including central budget sources (which account for 70-75 percent of all state budget resources for
 P135-2), resources from provinces, and those from local people's contributions. The Prime Minister's
 Decision No. 1922 (November 23, 2006), allocated about US$810 million equivalent to VND12,950
 billion (exchange of US$1= VND 15.950 in 2007) for the P135-2 over five years. After nearly five
 year of implementation of the Program, P135-2 has budgeted over US$700 million (at current
 exchange rates of August 2010), and disbursed almost US$500 million (71 percent). Donor funded
 budget support has been equivalent to nearly 50 percent (or US$ 355 million [at exchange rates used
 at November 2010]) of total Program funding to-date.

 10.     P135-2 is financed by various sources, and Provincial People's Committees (PPCs) are
 responsible for: integrating the program into other projects and programs within their areas of
 jurisdiction; mobilizing local resources contributed by the State, economic enterprises, social
 organizations and residents in target communes; and empowering the latter with participatory
 responsibilities and involving them in program implementation. Inter-ministerial Circular No. 01
 guiding P135-2 implementation further requires that use of P135 resources be planned and accounted
 for within the Government's national planning and financial management system; that information
 about the program be disseminated to each commune and resident in an open manner; and that
 program funds be allocated only to eligible localities and target groups, for the correct purposes and
 without waste or abuse whatsoever.
                                                  45
11.      Resource allocation. P135-2 resources are allocated through a two-tier system. In the first
tier, from central level, state budget shall be allocated to equally according to the number of
communes in a given province. In the second tier, at provincial level, provincial authorities should
develop a clear and transparent mechanism to allocate funds to communes, so that poorer communes
and those facing greater difficulties are allocated more resources. Detailed criteria are worked out by
each province, based on their own circumstances and conditions (e.g. population, poverty rates,
geographical conditions, etc). Information on budget allocation to communes is announced and made
public to all program communes and local people.

12.     Monitoring and evaluation. P135-2 features a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation
system, which was largely absent under Phase 1 of the program. Baseline data was collected, albeit in
2007 with a delay of one year, and documented. Monitoring criteria have been developed and are
being introduced at all levels to track the progress. CEM, as the lead agency, has introduced an
overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework at central level, and provincial authorities are
required to maintain their own M&E frameworks to provide inputs to the central M&E system. Semi-
annual and annual reviews are conducted ­ jointly with donors on an annual basis which utilize the
M&E system and field visits to identify to required changes.

13.    Legal framework: P135-2 is governed and regulated by a number of key legal regulations.
The overall program document was approved by the Prime Minister in Decision No. 7/2006/QD-TTg,
dated January 10, 2006. A set of guidance documents have been further developed to set the
framework for implementation. This section highlights key newly issued guidelines for the last
twelve months. Full list of other regulations applicable to the Program are listed in the Attachment
below.

14.     On September 15, 2008, Inter-Circular 01 was issued to replace the Inter-Circular 676 (issued
on May 17, 2006) and presented some policy changes that have been learnt from two-year
implementation of the Inter-Circular 676. Key changes are (1) removal of two budget lines for
Production Support activities; (ii) regulating for and application of non-direct procurement methods;
(iii) opening more opportunities for local capacity building and vocation training. Decision No.
69/2008/QD-TTg dated May 28, 2008, approving the list of 152 communes to be newly included in
the program, and 110 communes to be graduated from the program (making the total number of
P135-2 communes of 1946). Decision 01/2008/QD-UBDT on 3149 poorest villages to be included in
the program coverage and investment was issued by CEM on January 11, 2008. Decision
04/2008/QD-UBDT on Policy and Forms for Monitoring and Reporting for P135-2 was issued by
CEM on August 8, 2008. PM Official Document No. 744/TTg-KHTH dated May 19, 2008 on
additional budget allocated for P135-2, especially on the fund for Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
which was subsequently stipulated further by MoF on 6.3 percent of the total Program budget for
O&M activities.

15.     Program implementation is based on the principles of `grassroots democracy', enabling the
maximum degree of people's participation throughout the whole process. It is the responsibility of
PPCs to disseminate program content, such as menus of eligible investments, lists of beneficiary
communities, financial allocations, designation of local implementing agencies, and the accounting
for and posting of program fund allocations in public places and via the mass media. Regarding the
Government's policy to promote decentralization of management and of implementation of P135
investments to communes, Provincial and District People's Committees (PPCs and DPCs) are
instructed to provide guidance and to assign staff to support participating communes to directly
manage the program.


                                                  46
  16.     In line with the decentralization reforms and guidelines for budget management under NTPs,
  the provincial authorities are afforded an increased degree of autonomy in decision-making on
  program implementation within the planning framework set out at national level. Province-specific
  decisions, instructions and guidelines are therefore a critically important part of the overall policy
  context for P135-2 implementation. This relates to resource allocation to different components and
  sub-components of the program, as well as to implementation processes and procedures that will have
  a determining influence on results and impacts on the ground.

  17.     Planning procedures. According to Inter-Ministerial Circular No. 01, procedures for
  development, synthesis and assignment of annual plans for P135-2 are implemented simultaneously
  with the general planning process but should stand as a separate item in the annual plan. That is,
  People's Committees at various levels make investment plans and budget estimation for P135-2 in
  line with the Budget Law; and PPCs aggregate at their level and report to CEM as a basis for fund
  allocation from the state budget. Financial allocation under the annual Plan is made as follows: when
  authorized by the Prime Minister, MPI notifies PPC of their allocation for P135 projects and
  programs as a separate item in the provincial general plan; PPC submits to the Provincial People's
  Council for allocating P135-2 resources, integrated with other funds mobilized locally, to projects and
  programs at district level; DPC allocates the provincial budget, integrated with other funds mobilized
  locally, to participating communes or villages/hamlets, within the general framework of plans
  decided by the province. Within the overall budget estimates and structure determined at the
  provincial level, DPC can take the initiative to revise budgets to implement projects and programs
  under their responsibility.

ANNEX 4: PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IN VIETNAM

Overview

1.     Over the past decade, Vietnam has made strides in establishing a sound public financial
management system. With the adoption of the first organic budget law in 1996 and its revision
in 2002, a legal framework for public resource management has been put in place. A centralized
treasury system is being set up with branches extending from the center to all provinces and
districts to provide basic essential financial services to all government agencies. Steady progress
has been achieved in making the budget more predictable and pro-poor, and the budgeting
process more transparent and participatory. Substantial efforts have also been made in recent
years to improve transparency in the use of public resources through disclosure of information on
detailed government spending as well as expenditure policies, regulations and procedures.

2.     There is strong ownership in the Vietnamese Government of the PFM reform agenda.
MOF is currently engaged, as are other Ministries, in developing a reform strategy for 2011-2020.
The strategy aims at (i) maintenance of stability of public finances within the broader economy;
(ii) improved effectiveness of public sector expenditure in achieving policy and service delivery;
(iii) development of effective influence by government over key finance markets; (iv) effective
and efficient resource mobilization to finance public expenditures. Support to the implementation
of reforms is coordinated through the PFM partnership group which overarches the activities of
government, donors, and working groups, meeting half yearly to discuss progress. There is
ongoing effort among donors to directly align their support with the mainstreaming government's
strategies and plans.

3.   PFM remains in the center of Public Sector reforms. Other focus areas are
organizational restructuring, pay and employment reform, and institutional development. The
PFM reforms hinge on seven priorities: budget management, revenue management, debt
management, SOE fiscal risk management, financial market supervision and government bond
market development, public asset management, and price management.

4.   The overall conclusion of the latest Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA
2007) stated that PFM arrangements and their implementation and performance pose a
moderate risk that funds will not be properly controlled or used for intended purposes. The
CFAA proposed a set of recommendations to help the government design and continue
implementing reforms and capacity building programs to modernize and strengthen PFM and
enhance transparency and accountability arrangements in support of sound economic
management and improved governance.

5.    Even though a series of analytical work, such as Public Expenditure Review (PER) or
CFAA, have been undertaken every three to four years, progress and impact of the PFM reforms
and development initiatives can only be measured by establishing an official monitoring
framework, and baseline performance measures. The Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) measurement framework provides a recognized measurement of the
performance of the public financial management of government. Similarly, the Debt
Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA), adapted from the PEFA framework, but is
focused on debt management issues, would provide a baseline assessment of debt management
capacity. Although the Government has agreed in principle to introducing these measurement
frameworks through pilot self-assessment process in 2011 (PEFA) and 2012 (DeMPA), no firm
decision on detailed timeframe and commitment of resources have been made.




                                                                                                53
6.    Within the MOF, the number of technically-qualified and experienced managerial staff
needs to be increased to meet the reform challenges of the Ministry. Support is needed for
Capacity building across sectors and sub-national government to implement decentralized PFM
reforms.

Recent Developments and the Way Ahead

7.     PFM Legal and Institutional Framework. The CFAA reported that since 2004,
implementation of the 2002 State Budget Law and the 2005 Accounting Law has progressed and
a State Audit Law has been enacted. However, it also noted that some confusion and overlap in
budget responsibilities remain in the budgeting system which is limiting the participation of
sectors in resource planning, budgeting and budget management and confuses accountabilities
between the national and sub-national levels. Furthermore with the redevelopment of the
government accounting systems and regimes, the Accounting Law is no longer adequate and
needs revision, and the basis for accounting needs to be better defined, however there is no clear
plan at that this time to revise the Accounting Law. The State Budget Law will be revised and re-
submitted to the National Assembly in 2012, expectedly including a number of critical changes to
state administration in Vietnam such as enhanced decentralization to subnational government and
adjusted fiscal authority of central vis-a-vis subnational tiers of government in budget approval.

8.    PFM information systems. The Treasury and Budgetary Management Information System
(TABMIS) will progressively address difficulties in monitoring a fully-consolidated budget as
well as the fiscal position. TABMIS has been developed since 2007, piloted in 2009, and
recently rolled-out to MOF and treasuries and financial agencies in 35 out of 63 provinces.
Fifteen largest spending line-ministries are getting ready to use TABMIS to conduct budget
allocations for 2011. It is expected that the system will become fully operational in 2012 upon its
nationwide roll-out. TABMIS will provide the capability to record and control commitments,
improve cash management and arrears management, and strengthen expenditure management and
controls. There are initial staged plans for TABMIS consolidation and expansion, in both terms of
both functionality and coverage, towards the Integrated/Government Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS).

9.    Public accounting regulations. In parallel with TABMIS project, a unified Treasury and
Budgetary Chart of Accounts has been developed to provide consistency of classification of
revenues and expenditures in budgeting, accounting and reporting with expenditures classified on
an administrative, economic and functional basis. This will facilitate accurate and timely financial
reporting, and the flow of budgetary information between government ministries provinces and
the public. For future TABMIS expansion, development of a unified and uniform chart of
accounts for the public sector (including the Spending Units) is now envisaged. A staged
roadmap for adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) is also
being developed to align government accounting regimes and practices with international
standards.

10. Budget Development & Execution. Vietnam's budget coverage is reasonably
comprehensive but still incomplete compared to international practices. Budget gaps arise from
the lack of clarity in the state budget coverage of user fees and charges of many service delivery
units, lack of integration or disclosure of the financial positions of public financial funds,
untimely and sometimes inadequate incorporation of donor financing, and off-budget government
bonds. Budget execution variations arise from such practices as revenue underestimation
particularly for crude oil revenues, keeping the state accounts open after year end with post year
expenditures recorded against previous year unused budgets, and over implementing construction
and development plans. Separate preparation of the recurrent and capital investment budgets


                                                                                                 54
hampers effective management of resources and the composition of public expenditure remains
unbalanced.

11. Public expenditure is planned annually and also for medium-term over five year periods
but the linkage between the two remains weak. The ongoing revision of the State Budget Law
introduces Medium-Term Fiscal and Expenditure Framework, to be mainstreamed in the annual
budget cycle. There are also initial discussions on reforming budget planning toward output- and
program-based budget elaboration.

12. Off-budget-balance expenditures, i.e., expenditures not counted in the calculation of the
budget deficit, include government bonds issued to finance infrastructure projects and education
facilities, recapitalization of entities such as the Vietnam Development Bank or the Vietnam
Social Policy Bank, and borrowings by sub-national governments and their affiliated entities such
as local development funds. However, these so-called off-budget expenditures in Vietnam can be
considered on-budget in several respects. They are included in the budget that is reviewed and
approved by the National Assembly, and their execution was done through the Treasury and
subject to the same disclosures and scrutiny as standard budget expenditures. There are attempts
under the ongoing revision of the State Budget Law to adjust budget structure and coverage to be
more in line with the international norms.

13. Contingent liabilities might be arising from these "off-budget-balance expenditures" and
other implicit sources. A systemic definition and a reliable estimate of such contingent liabilities
are not available, which limits the government's ability to manage such risks properly. More
broadly, as Vietnam is reaching middle-income status, it will need to engage more long-term
finance from both domestic and external sources. Under the recently improved debt
management, initial attention from the government on risk management and monitoring of
contingent liabilities has been observed. Given the recent default of one of the largest state owned
Economic Groups (Vinashin), MOF is planning to strengthen monitoring of fiscal risks from the
SOEs. However, although considered as the country's lead agency for national and public debt
management, MOF has not yet prepared an inventory of government contingent liabilities from
various sources, due to lack of necessary legal framework, poor data availability and limited
assessment capacity.

14. Revenue administration. Customs controls are still considered low in productivity,
inconsistent and vulnerable to corruption. The Customs administration will need to change
significantly, shifting its mindset from a culture of domestic protection and control of all
transactions to one that facilitates foreign trade and promotes private sector development. The
tax administration is also characterized by low compliance and vulnerability towards corruption.
Five areas of tax administration have been identified as in need of special attention: (1) the
fragmentation of the legal framework related to tax administration; (2) the absence of effective
coordination and information-sharing between the tax administration and other government
agencies; (3) taxpayers' lack of knowledge about the tax laws and compliance procedures; (4)
inadequate professional skills and training of tax administration; and (5) information technology
system which is lagging behind the requirements of a modern tax administration. In addition, tax
laws and policies will need further reforms to broaden the tax base, and to reduce the number of
rates and exemptions. Reforms in the management of revenue are progressing with clearer
allocation rules and decentralized responsibilities; however classification of revenue in line with
international standards needs to be introduced, and enhanced consultation on revenue targets is
needed to improve the quality of revenue budgets.

15. Public debt management has improved both in terms of legal framework and institutional
arrangements. The Debt Management Department was established in May 2009 with the role of a
modern debt management office under the MOF. Although not all of the tasks relating to public

                                                                                                 55
debt management have been consolidated to this Department, the organizational structure of the
department is similar to the debt management office according to international practices, with 6
divisions functioning as front office, one division performing the middle office functions, and one
division performing the back office functions. Meanwhile, the first-ever Law on public debt
management was approved by the National Assembly in June 2009 and came into effect in 2010.
The Law introduced substantial reforms in managing and monitoring comprehensively public
debt and government commitments (including domestic sub-national debts and on-lending), and
addressing many weaknesses in the public debt management in Vietnam. A series of guiding
decrees were adopted in 2010 to facilitate the implementation of the law. Special attention is now
paid to strengthening risk management and developing forward-looking debt management
strategy and program.

16. Financial market supervision and the government bond market. At present, many
agencies participate in financial market supervision, leading to overlapping responsibilities and
ineffective management and supervision. There is a need to consolidate market supervision
functions into a single agency and to separate state management and supervision functions.
Vietnam's government bond market is still small scale, low liquidity, and the maturity structure is
skewed toward short-term. The number of market participants is relatively small and supporting
infrastructure, such as depository, clearing and information systems, is yet to be developed.
Therefore, considerable efforts are required to develop a full-fledged government bond market
and coordinate it with development of related markets such as capital, security and real estate. A
bond market development roadmap is being prepared towards these visions.

17. The Government's PFM reform program highlights that state assets budget resources and
human resources need to be managed in an integrated way for efficient and effective service
delivery, and reforms are being gradually introduced. The legal framework and market principles
in asset management were recently adopted under the Law on State Asset Management. The
requirements for management reporting systems are being defined, but reform in this area has
been slow. Initially, attention is needed for developing consistent and comprehensive asset
accounting and asset management policies in line with international standards and practices.
Further study will be carried out in 2011 to determine the most appropriate solutions to address
the government's accounting and asset management requirements.

18. Independent scrutiny of PFM has significantly increased, with external oversight of
budgetary affairs by the National Assembly and the recently independent State Audit of Vietnam
(SAV). The functional committees and deputies of the National Assembly, and the local People's
Committees have been given greater prominence in examining, decision-making and oversight of
the state budget. There is steady expansion of external audit coverage and quality, and legislative
oversight. Encouragingly, the SAV audit report was made public for the first time in 2006, and
regularly since, triggering serious debates where are broadcasted live on the usage of state
budgets. However, the capacity of these institutions, especially the SAV, is limiting the coverage
and scope of audits. It is difficult for the SAV to manage the increasing workload including
compulsory audit for 100% of SOEs, and to consider the move towards performance audit.
Significantly, the SAV has recently approved an ambitious and comprehensive strategy to 2020
(with accompanying implementation plan to 2015) aimed at upgrading its capacity across the key
areas of organizational and legal framework, human resources, audit planning and methodologies
(including performance audit), information technology, and external relations.

19. The country's public financial management system has a range of internal oversight
mechanisms. In the past, the focus was on inspection rather than systematic review to provide
regular and timely feedback to the management on the use of public resources. Internal auditing
is an important element of a sound public financial management system, which helps increase
effectiveness, efficiency and financial control. This issue becomes even more important if the

                                                                                                56
government intends to decentralize further to the local levels. The legal and institutional
frameworks for the organization and operation of internal audit are being developed. Although
implementation will be challenging, this has been a very encouraging step towards establishing a
sound internal audit system in Vietnam in the coming years.

20. Vietnam has increased its level of fiscal transparency. Budget plans and budget execution
accounts are being made available publicly, and there is increasing compliance with reporting
regulations. However there is still room for improvement, particularly in relation to consistency
in quality of reports and their timeliness. The draft budget plan should be disclosed before
National Assembly's approval. To enhance the quality of financial reporting, consistency
between budget and accounting classifications needs to be maintained. The number of budget
execution reports needs to be rationalized. Content and presentation of financial information
needs to be improved in line with existing government regulations in the publicly available
budget execution reports to make them more informative. Enabled by TABMIS, MOF has
committed to, by 2013, publish monthly and more disaggregated budget execution reports on
MOF website 15 days after month end, as opposed to the current practice of publicize quarterly
and aggregated report 45 days after quarter end. In addition, the Government is establishing a
State Accounting General function, and working toward producing and issuing annual financial
statements, including cash and asset information, in line with international practices. The annual
final accounts need to be issued faster than the current 18 months, e.g. 9 months, after year end to
enhance their relevance to the discussions on the budget of the subsequent year.

21. Good progress has been made in establishing legislation and the environment for greater
financial accountability and transparency of financial information. Regulations on financial
disclosures of the State Budget Law, Accounting Law and State Audit Law have been issued
increasing the scope and range of required disclosures by entities at all levels of government.
Information is being made available on public accessible websites. However, implementation
remains the challenge. To further increase transparency, the content of budget documentation and
the final accounts could be enhanced by including analysis, explanations and information in line
with international practices. Disclosure of financial information, particularly spending at unit
level should be actively monitored to ensure compliance with the enhanced disclosure
requirements. Published financial reports should be timely, and a calendar for disclosures issued
publicly.

ANNEX 5: AIDE MEMOIRE OF THE JOINT PROGRESS REVIEW OF P135-2

                               JOINT PROGRESS REVIEW (JPR)

                                       AIDE MEMOIRE (AM)
                                          November 2010

INTRODUCTION

This Aide Memoire (AM) has been jointly formulated by the Committee for Ethnic Minority
Affairs (CEMA) and the group of donors jointly supporting the Government of Viet Nam
(GoVN) Programme 135 Phase II (P135-II) in the period 2006-10. The Aide Memoire reflects
key observations, discussions and findings from the Joint Progress Review (JPR) undertaken by
CEMA, line ministry agencies and Development Partners (DPs) in October and November 2010.

The JPR involved three field trip missions to the north, centre and south of Viet Nam to view
P135-II implementation and discuss progress and challenges with beneficiaries and Government
stakeholders at the commune, district and provincial levels. Provinces visited were Ha Giang and
Tuyen Quang (North); Nghe An (Centre); Soc Trang and Lam Dong (South); field reports from
each of the teams are included as Annex 1.11 A series of central level meetings were also held
with line ministry agencies involved in the implementation or monitoring of P135-II. A summary
of the meetings held are included as Annex 2.

This AM reflects observations and information gathered through the field visits and central
meetings, and is not intended to be a comprehensive evaluation of P135-II as implemented
nationwide. Rather, the JPR process provided an opportunity for all stakeholders to discuss
impressions of the programme and the AM is intended to reflect agreed views on the current
status of programme implementation, indicative results, remaining challenges in management and
implementation in the current phase, and key issues to consider in the design of a new
Programme 135 for the period 2011-15.

The AM is structured in the following way. Section 1 provides an overall assessment of the
Programme against the policy matrix and summarises key issues for the future. It also reflects
upon evidence of impact upon poverty reduction and the sustainability of the programme. Section
2 presents programme implementation progress in terms of budget allocation and disbursement
and completion against targets. Section 3 presents key findings and recommendations against the
policy matrix, Section 4 discusses cross cutting issues and the policy matrix itself is presented in
Section 5, followed by annexes.

I.   OVERALL ASSESSMENT

Poverty reduction has taken place in all of the communes visited over the course of the JPR,
reflecting the national trend overall of the poverty rate falling. P135-II is a central pillar in the
Government's poverty reduction efforts and the Program is clearly highly appreciated both by
national agencies and provincial, district and commune officials. The Program represents a
significant part of the overall commune budget in poor communes and the infrastructure
component, in particular, has ensured that critical investments have been made in the enabling
environment in poor communes. Disbursement of funds has been satisfactory (see Table on page
8) and the Government has demonstrated a clear commitment to the Program, and to the cause of


11
  Because of heavy flooding the review team to the central region were only able to visit Nghe An Province,
and not Ha Tinh Province too as planned.

                                                                                                        58
addressing ethnic minority poverty, through making substantial funds available and exceeding the
initial allocation of funds originally earmarked for 2006-10 in the Program document.

Considerable progress has been made overall in implementation of Program 135 this year, in
comparison to past years, though experience across provinces and between the different
components of the Program varies; the infrastructure component has a high rate of disbursement
and is relatively straightforward in execution, the production support component and, to a degree,
the capacity building components are more problematic. This perhaps reflects the challenge of
delivering support through a national program to areas that differ significantly in the poverty
challenges they are seeking to overcome. The livelihoods support component has been slow to
establish and is a relatively minor component in comparison to the other components, and is
therefore hard to assess.

Key factors observed through the field visits that underlie the accelerated progress of
implementation and the apparent effectiveness of Program support include strong leadership at
provincial level in interpreting and applying central instructions and steering Program
implementation; good systems of extension support in the north, that are well tailored to
addressing the particular problems faced; and a strong commitment on the part of the
Government to making substantial financial resources available in a timely manner and in
promoting financial transparency through the audit process.

On the whole, in spite of a number of areas where progress has been more difficult, it can be said
that progress against the Results Framework agreed jointly between the GoVN and the donor
partnership group is satisfactory. (See Section 5).

The Table at the end of this section summarises the key findings from the JPR, followed by a
summary table of key recommendations for the next phase of the Program. A number of
longstanding issues remain unresolved with P135-II, which should be addressed in the next phase
of the Program from 2011-15. In particular the quality of participation and the participatory
process underlying Program planning, implementation and monitoring could be much improved
in the future. Evidence from the JPR visits suggests participation on the part of beneficiaries is
often consultation at best. Significant progress has been made in promoting Commune Investment
Ownership (CIO) of Program components and reported figures are encouraging, but on closer
inspection CIO appears to remain something of a paper exercise. The CIO process would be
significantly strengthened if participatory planning processes were improved, but this requires
greater Program flexibility in the kinds of activities that communes can undertake to support
poverty reduction according to local conditions. The current pre-designed components and fixed
modes of delivery do not offer this flexibility and addressing this constraint will become an ever
more pressing issue over time, as the absolute number of ethnic minority poor people decreases
and the nature of poverty becomes less about straightforwardly identifiable issues such as lack of
roads or school buildings.

The establishment of separate funds for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of infrastructure
investments has been a key innovation of P135, but evidence suggests there is some way to go
before these funds are used effectively, and for the purpose intended. O&M funds are often used
for upgrading work, rather than for regular maintenance, and the concept of preventive care now
to avoid major rehabilitation later does not appear to be well understood or institutionalized
amongst responsible agencies. In procurement for goods, works and services there is little
evidence of competitive bidding and community bidding does not appear to have been established
at all yet. There were also no records kept in the provinces visited of payments to labourers as
required in the agreed policy triggers. Great efforts have been made in attempting to implement
the MIS system for the Program but success in the operation of the MIS differs significantly even

                                                                                               59
between districts in the same province. The system is seen largely as a reporting requirement to
upper levels and not as a useful management tool for local Program managers. The MIS therefore
clearly needs to be simplified in the future.

The existence of a large number of poverty reduction programs and policies, with components
that are often very similar in design and focused upon very similar, if not the same, target groups
places a heavy administrative and management burden upon local officials. Steps need to be
taken by Government leaders to rationalise this congested landscape of PR programs and policies
in the next planning phase, 2011-15.

Over the past 10 years P135 has demonstrated how a geographical targeting approach can be an
effective means of tackling mass poverty in large clearly defined `poor' areas. After more than 10
years of rapid poverty reduction however, the rationale for a purely geographical targeting
approach is no longer so strong, at least in the central and southern regions of the country. As the
number of poor people decreases and the pools of ethnic minority poverty shrink, the risk of mis-
targeting increases significantly. The next phase of P135 therefore needs to demonstrate a sharper
focus on effective targeting methods to ensure scarce poverty reduction resources are used
efficiently, and in ways that best address the particular needs of poor ethnic minority women and
men across the country.

Summary Table of Key Findings and Lessons Learnt from the JPR

                             Key Findings and Lessons Learnt from P135-II

1.    Implementation appears to have improved significantly compared to previous review periods,
      but the level of improvement differs between components and between the provinces visited.
2.    Infrastructure appears to be relevant and the component is well implemented. However the
      quality of infrastructure remains an issue given that the O&M fund is still not being used
      effectively (see point 8 below) and the program areas are prone to various types of natural
      disasters and harsh conditions.
3.    It seems that the programme has made a good contribution to poverty reduction.
4.    Key factors behind this improvement include:
      -- Strong and effective leadership at provincial level,
      -- Relatively well established existing extension systems in the northern provinces visited
         which contributed to the effective implementation of production support components there,
      -- Strong Govt commitment to budget implementation and effective financial management
         methods, particularly the annual audit process.
5.    Participation is mostly confined to local consultation to select from prescriptive program
      menus rather than quality, meaningful participation by people in deciding what support best
      meets their needs. There is limited participation in program management, oversight and
      implementation.
6.    Relevance of the Program ­ P135-II support is very prescriptive and leaves little flexibility for
      grass roots levels in meeting differing needs. This also contributes directly to the limited scope
      for participation.
7.    A high number of overlapping poverty reduction programs poses a management burden on
      local government agencies. This should be addressed in the future.
8.    Operation & Maintenance (O&M) funds are used largely for repairs and upgradation work
      rather than regular O&M, which relies much more on voluntary labour contributions from


                                                                                                      60
      people.
9.    There is little evidence of competitive bidding for infrastructure contracts and virtually no
      evidence of community bidding.
10.   No records appear to be kept by local officials of wages paid to labourers by contractors and
      limited records are kept of local labour contribution in the MIS system. These are made at the
      commune level but not shared with higher levels. It isn't clear how this information is used in
      program management and implementation.
11.   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): attempts to put the AMT/ PMT system into operation
      have been made but local (particularly commune) levels still face difficulties in completing the
      reporting formats. Different levels of adminsitration also do not yet use the information
      generated for management purposes. The AMT/PMT system may need to be refined and
      simplified and the M&E system may need to include more measurable indicators at the
      outcome level in the future.
12.   Geographical targeting seems to have worked well in the past, but in the future different kinds
      of targeting methods (especially of the poorest households and individuals) may need to be
      considered in the different Program components.



Summary Table of Recommendations for the Next Phase of the Program

                           Recommendations for the Next Phase of Program 135

1.    Key innovations and successes in the design and implementation of P135-II should be carefully
      documented and refined in the implementation instructions for the next phase of the Program.
      Reform agendas that have been initiated under P135-2 are to be reviewed and strengthened
      further to accelerate the pace of Program implementation.
2.    Greater flexibility in Program modalities is a key requirement if participatory planning and
      local priority setting are to be strengthened. Community empowerment should be a critical
      feature of the future Program's implementation.
3.    Improved strategic planning processes at the commune level would increase the opportunity to
      maximize the synergies across program components, and ensure P135 is better linked up to
      other poverty reduction initiatives. Supporting the strengthening of the local SEDP process will
      be critical for this, and should be a focus for the new program.
4.    Poverty reduction needs to be more reliably measured in the future. The poverty line therefore
      needs to be adjusted for inflation more regularly, and the pool of indicators against which
      poverty reduction is assessed needs to be broadened.
5.    Income enhancement and livelihood diversification support to poor households needs to be as
      high a priority in the new program as infrastructure provision. Employment creation should also
      be considered as a focus activity of the Program.
6.    Better village and household targeting methods within designated `poor areas' are needed in the
      next phase, to ensure targeting is efficient and effective. In particular, multi-dimensional criteria
      should be used in both geographical and individual household targeting.
7.    A focus activity for the next stage of the Program should be experience sharing and support
      from those areas that have applied P135-II modalities effectively, to those that have not. The
      `task force' model could usefully be expanded, to include inter-provincial task force support.
      Migrating experience and innovation from P135 to the Government policy `mainstream' should
      also be a key priority in the next phase.
8.    The overlapping of poverty reduction programs is currently being addressed through the new

                                                                                                        61
           poverty reduction framework, but how this will work in practice is still unclear. What is clear is
           that CEMA will need to develop new ways of working with MoLISA and other ministries in the
           future, to reflect the new realities under a single poverty reduction program. At the sub-national
           level the role and involvement of DEMA and DoLISA in the provincial steering committee for
           poverty reduction, which will manage this single program, will need to be strengthened.
9.         The management and operation of O&M funds, competitive bidding and community
           contracting are all key areas of the Program that need to be strengthened in the next phase.
           These should be seen as important measures to ensure the effective use of public resources.
10.        A monitoring and evaluation system that is simple to use, yet which delivers information useful
           for both reporting and decision-making at local levels, is a key requirement for the next phase.
           The existing MIS should be reviewed and adapted or overhauled as necessary.
11         Decentralization processes need to be further improved and the current momentum for
           improved decentralization should be maintained. Greater TA provision down to village and
           commune levels is required to ensure the quality and effectiveness of communes acting as
           investment owners. The proposed approach of `block grants' to communes calls for greater
           efforts in TA provision to the communes involved.
12         Attempts at more transparent and stronger fiduciary measures as introduced under the P135-2
           Policy Matrix should continue, especially the public disclosure of Program's financial
           information and annual auditing exercises by State Audit of Viet Nam.
13         Implementation capacity at local levels should be prioritized much more to ensure the effective
           translation of policies into actions and into development impacts upon poverty reduction.
           Capacity development activities should be targeted at the commune, village/ community level.



II.         PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

The number of participating communes has increased by 314 in the five year period from 2006 to
2010, whilst 110 communes were found to have met the objectives of the programme and
`graduated', leaving a total of 1,848 communes in the programme in 2010. The process of
reviewing communes is ongoing and it is anticipated that more communes will have met the P135
criteria and graduated from the programme by the end of 2010.



                                                                                                          62
In terms of the allocation of funding under P135-II, investment to the communes has
progressively increased over the course of the five year programme cycle, as follows:
     -- 2006 and 2007: VND 860 million/commune/year
     -- 2008 and 2009: VND 1,060 million/village/year
     -- 2010: VND 1,360 million/commune/year; VND 265 million/village/year

The total budget allocation from central budget funds to the provinces in the period 2006-10 was VND

Local budget contribution to the Program was a reported VND 635 billion (about 4.5% of the
total funding for the Program) according to data provided by CEMA. According to provincial
reports, on average community contributions to the Program varied at between 10-15% of the
total investment budget for project works.

As of 31st August 2010, annual disbursement stood at 1,627.71 billion VND, accounting for
49.5% of the budget allocated for the year. Overall for the period 2006-10, disbursement
currently stands at VND 9,610.23 billion, accounting for 71% of the total allocated budget for the
program period. Budget disbursement for the period 2006-10 is presented in the table below:

Budget disbursement for the period 2006-10 will not achieve the overall total budget allocation
set for the period. Some of the reasons for delay and slow disbursement in past years are as
follows:
·       In 2006 the disbursement rate was only 57%, largely due to delays in the allocation of
        funding from the Central Budget. At the beginning of 2006, funding was only made to
        infrastructure and training projects and provinces did not receive funding allocation for
        production development support projects until December 2006. As a consequence, funds were
        carried over to 2007 (with program disbursement for that year exceeding the target set by
        nearly 20%). An additional restraint was that program implementation guidelines were issued
        late, with Circular 676 not issued until August 2006. This created difficulties for provinces in
        implementing program activities, as they had no legal basis to do so.
·       In 2008 after implementation of the Program had begun, it became apparent that guideline
        documents and regulations from the central authorities were not always appropriate and this
        caused difficulties for provinces in implementing the Program smoothly. In particular, the
        funding mechanism stipulated in Decision 1445 regulating the development budget and
        administrative budget was not suitable. Documents from MARD providing guidelines for the
        implementation of production development support projects (Circular 01 and Circular 79)
        were also not clear and were consequently difficult to implement.

Progress in Meeting Programme Targets

Figures on current progress against a number of indicators, and the baseline situation in 2006, are
presented below. Based on this data internal to the Program, the conclusion could be drawn that
there has been considerable success in reducing the overall poverty rate in poor, mountainous and
ethnic minority communes and villages through the Program, and in raising the average per capita
income in these communes and villages. However, there are still a number of indicators that will
not be met by the end of the current program period, particularly in the provision of safe drinking
water suppy and small irrigation schemes to support production. Additional data, normally
available after the final evaluation, will be necessary to fully demonstrate impact.

All data from CEMA administrative reports
     *Projected figures for end 2010

Viet nam has experienced very high rates of inflation in recent years but the poverty line has not
been adjusted since it was last set in 2005, and is not linked to the Comsumer Price Index (CPI)
to enable periodic adjustment. It is therefore highly likely that the average cost of the basket of
goods used in setting the poverty line will have increased significantly, affecting the usefulness of
the current (fixed) poverty line as a true measure of wellbeing/ deprivation. The Government
plans to introduce a significantly higher poverty line from 2011 (VND 450,000 per capita per
month in rural areas, VND 600,000 in urban areas) which will sharply increase the number of
people classified as poor under the existing method. (The national poverty rate using the new
poverty line will be an estimated 15% by the end of 2010, against 11% using the existing poverty
line). These issues highlight the need to monitor poverty generally, and the impact of poverty
reduction programmes specifically, against a broad basket of indicators, and particularly not to
over rely on monitoring income and expenditure data. Other important indictators include those
related to health, education, access to services, environmental quality and public participation.
Multi-dimensional indicators give a more rounded and holistic picture of ethnic minority well-
being and are well suited to evaluating the impact of programs like P135.

Implementation of Programme Components, 2006-10

Implementation of the four program components between 2006-10 was as follows.

Production development support
From 2006 to 2010 VND 2,301.3 million has been allocated to this component, of which funding
from the central budget was VND 1,946,86 billion and from local budget VND 355 billion.
Support was provided to 2,199,640 households through the provision of 11.8 thousand food crop
seedlings, 33 million industrial and fruit crop seedlings, nearly 300,000 head of livestock, over
1.3 million poultry units, 470,000 tons of chemical fertilizer and plant protection chemicals; the
development of 6,834 agro-forestry-fishery development models and 81,085 machines to support
production and processing. 911,721 people attended agro-forestry training courses and study
tours.

At present, 100% communes and villages under P135 have had access to new crop varieties and
livestock breeds. Over 70% of poor households have received training in agro-forestry extension
and production skills, to enhance the production skills of ethnic minority people and facilitate the
planned shift from production for self-sufficincy, to more commercially oriented production
methods. Many people now have access to production support services such as credit and market
information services.

Fund disbursement under the Production support component from 2006 to August 2010 was
VND 1,249.2, so 64% of the planned total of 1,946.86 billion. Some reasons for slow
disbursement were as follow:



                                                                                                  65
·   Issuance of guideline documents was delayed, the funding structure was not sufficient and did
    not reflect actual conditions. Additionally, many provincial authorities were not proactive in
    addressing constraints and difficulties.
·   Budget allocated for production activities did not match well the seasonal production
    schedule.
·   Limited numbers of agritultural extention staff were available, and their capacity to deliver
    support was low.
·   Some provincial authorities did not have effective measures to support communes to become
    investment owners according to the guidelines from central authorities or were late in
    assigning local agricultural agencies to direct implementation of the Production Support
    component in a timely manner.

Infrastructure development projects
In the period 2006-2010, the total funding allocated for this component was VND 8,646.07 billion, to
be invested in 12,646 infrastructure works. The total funding disbursed by the end of August 2010
was VND 7,231.85 billion, accounting for 84% of the allocated budget. Investments were made in the
following projects: road construction projects 3,375; irrigation schemes 2,393; school construction
projects 2,478; water supply utilities 1,573 works; electricity supply schemes 995; market
construction projects 367; medical stations 489; communal houses 976.

Infrastructure investment projects were in line with local socio-economic plans and the aspirations of
local people. In some provinces the handover of works to local people was delayed, such as in Kon
Tum, Tra Vinh, Bac Kan, Quang Binh, and Quang Nam.

Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of infrastruture works is a key priority of P135-II. Since
2008, 6.3% of the planned budget for infrastructure works have been allocated from central
budget funds for local authorities to perform O&M of project works. CEMA estimates that
approximately 5-7% of project works received regular operation and maintenance, which
contributed to increasing the longevity and sustainability of these works.

Communes and villages facing hardship have high demands for infrastructure development under
the Program. In order to meet these demands the number of projects invested in was high but the
schemes were consquently often small scale and not of a high technical standard. Construction
techniques were rudimentary and consequently the infrastructure often degraded and broke quickly.
Additionally, provincial authorities often did not actively develop documents stipulating in detail
how O&M of works should be carried out and there was consequently no foundation for
implementation. Ultimately, this resulted in delayed disbursement (19%) for O&M and the use of
O&M funds to repair works from the previous investment phase.

 Training and capacity strengthening for local staff and communities
As of end of August 2010, VND 576.16 billion had been allocated from the central budget for
training of staff at different levels on the skills necessary to manage and organize implementation
of the Program, and for training for local people. CEMA provided training for 3,500 officers from
provincial and district levels involved in the management of P135. Local authorities provided
training on administration, financial and project management skills to 178,000 commune and
village staff. Training was also provided to 279,793 local people on the content of P135, on credit
and knowledge on household economic development, along with vocational training for ethnic
minority youth. Through this training the knowledge and skills of P135 management staff has
been improved. Most notably, 90% of all communes became investment owners of projects under
the Program.


                                                                                                   66
Policies to develop support services, improve livelihoods and provide legal aid to improve legal
awareness
In terms of support to poor students to attend school, VND 1,896.92 billion was allocated from
central budget funds for tuition fees, enabling 926,326 children to attend kindergarten and
secondary school, and semi-boarding schools. The total funds disbursed was VND 452.97 billion,
accounting for 24% of the planned budget. In the school years 2009 - 2010 and 2010-2011, the
Prime Minister issued Decision No. 101/2009/Q -TTg to expand the list of beneficiaries to all
schoolchildren from poor households, and funding support was recalculated appropriately. Slow
disbursement was a consquence of difficulties encountered early on in implementation, in
identifying beneficiaries. In some provinces, budget was allocated as proposed but disbursement
was incomplete as insufficient beneficiaries had been identified. By the end of 2009 only 18 out of
50 provinces had disbursed 100% of the funds allocated, with the remaining budget therefore
carried forward to 2010. In some provinces, the budget had to be recovered and paid back to central
coffers because of inappropriate administration, such as in Thua Thien Hue or Binh Thuan.

For the policy on legal assistance and legal awareness raising, incomplete reports from provincial
authorities show that 1,570 legal aid clubs have been estabilished in communes under P135-II
using funding from the Program and from the Vietnam Legal Aid Fund. The clubs organized
meetings focusing upon essential legal themes such as Law on Legal Aid, Law on Land, Law on
Marriage and Family, Law on Complaint. These clubs have become a reliable source of support
for local people, helping them increase their legal awareness and be more confident in settling
minor conflicts and disputes, ensuring social stability.

Free provision of legal documents and legal information to communes under P135 also helped
local people understand their rights and the policies of the state. At present, about 12,000
signboards and information boxes have been placed in the commune people's committee offices
and with organizations that handle complaints. More than 2,000,000 leaflets containing legal
information in ethnic languages have been printed and delivered to local people, in 13 languages.
More than 16,000 cassettes in ethnic languages have been produced and delivered to poor and
ethnic minority people.


III.   KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS AGAINST THE POLICY MATRIX

I.A. Commune, Village and Household Selection
Evidence from the JPR visits shows beneficiaries of Program support were those officially
recognized as poor in the village poor list, but the methodology for distributing program benefits
to eligible beneficiaries was unclear; commune officials appeared to prefer distributing Program
support to beneficiaries on an equal basis (i.e. as and when the support became available, it would
be distributed equally amongst eligible households) rather than planning support to households
based upon what they needed to supplement existing assets and livelihood strategies. Support
provided was not therefore always best suited to the needs of households. Infrastructure
investments were made in accordance with the commune SEDP. Commune authorities were
aware of the obligation to publicise the list of beneficiaries of Program support at the commune
and village offices, and posted information about infrastructure investments at the commune
office and at construction sites during construction. Despite the rapid increase in poverty
reduction reported by district and provincial officials, the rate of communes graduating from the
Program remains slow (only 110 communes in total between 2006-10), and the number of
communes and villages participating in the Program has actually increased through the Program
period, from 1,644 communes in 2006, to 1,848 communes in 2010.




                                                                                                67
I.B. Program Resource Allocation
Findings from the field visits showed that provinces have developed criteria through which the
allocation of P135-II funds to district and commune levels is done on a `pro-poor', non-
egalitarian basis, and are applying these criteria.

I.C. Enhancing Sustainability of Program Investment
The establishment of a separate fund for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of P135-II
investments is a key achievement of the Program. However, findings from the field visits suggest
the fund is not being operated as intended. In some cases the O&M funds are being used for
upgrading and major rehabilitation of works, and even for construction of school buildings and
roads. The O&M fund is intended to be used to periodically undertake routine maintenance to
prolong the life of infrastructure investments, and to offset the need to undertake major
rehabilitation work soon after construction. This `preventative' approach does not appear to be
well understood or institutionalized in the areas visited, with no evidence of an O&M plan for
P135-II infrastructure and no O&M groups established as required in the O&M manual for P135-
II. Consequently the rate of disbursement of O&M funds is very low, at approximately 19%.
Districts also largely remain the investment owner for O&M. In establishing the O&M fund
CEMA requested a flat rate of 6.3% of total infrastructure investment funds allocated, but during
a meeting with Ministry of Finance they suggested that a more appropriate modality for the O&M
budget would be allocating funding according to the level of P135 infrastructure investment
already realized in each province, so that O&M funding would relate more closely to the volume
of existing P135 investment needing maintenance in each province.

I.D. Pro-Poor Orientation of Production/ Livelihoods Support
Production support is a key activity of the Program, and a central objective in promoting a shift in
production in ethnic minority areas, from production for subsistence to production for higher
value cash crops for the market, and greater integration of EM producers in commercial value
chains. According to findings from the field visits, success in this regard varied from region to
region. In Meo Vac and Dong Van districts in Ha Giang a high value chain of cows was evident,
with cattle distributed as far as Laos and Thailand through traders coming from Phu Tho and
Vinh Phuc. This seemed to be a highly appropriate activity well suited to the rocky and difficult
terrain of Ha Giang. Farmers borrowed money from the Vietnam Social Policy Bank (VSPB) to
top up support provided through P135-II, to buy cattle. Ha Giang Province used budget under the
production support component to pay the interest on these loans, however this support was
identified by SAV as inappropriate expenditure.

In the south the production support component did not appear to fit well with the needs of those
identified as poor. In Soc Trang, many of the poor were EM migrants who were primarily
involved in daily wage labour, and were essentially landless. They were therefore not reached by
the provision of agricultural inputs, and had little land upon which to graze cattle, which was
another input provided through P135-II. In Lam Dong Province, free agricultural inputs were
being provided to households and recipients received them year on year, but remained on the
poor list. The support was therefore insufficient to move them out of poverty. Elsewhere in the
province, the poor were primarily local indigenous groups who lacked the training and skills to be
able to move into the production of higher income commodities. The provision of agricultural
inputs without this training was therefore insufficient to move them out of poverty.

There was a low take-up of agricultural demonstration models in the areas visited, suggesting
they were not always suitable to local needs, and the production element overall remains
prescriptive, with no scope for flexibility for communes in setting the criteria for activities locally
or in promoting off-farm activities. Under MARD's Circular 12 the responsibility for supervision
of the production support component lies with DARD, but the effectiveness of DARD in

                                                                                                    68
fulfilling this responsibility still appears to be limited. Support still focuses upon the provision of
free or heavily subsidized inputs and agricultural training that is not always appropriate to local
conditions and production practices. There is less focus upon providing high quality extension
support that would support ethnic minorities in the production of higher value commodities and
wider market chains and commercial opportunities.

II.A. Informed Public Participation in Program Planning and Management
Planning was reported to be participatory and `bottom-up' in orientation but in practice,
participation still seemed to be restricted to choosing from a list of pre-prescribed activities for
Program support already set at a higher level, and could therefore be described as consultation at
best. The participatory planning manual has been issued and widely disseminated, and some local
officials have been trained in its use. Progress in promoting women's participation in the
programme is unclear; officials appear aware of the importance of women's participation but data
is not being recorded effectively. In both Soc Trang and Lam Dong provinces, information about
the program was being provided in at least one ethnic minority language, through the village loud
speaker system.

Much of the prescriptive guidance could be discontinued to allow more integration with other
local resources, towards objectives set in local level Socio-Economic Development Plans
(SEDPs). In order for this to occur, however, a qualitative shift in the nature of participation
occurring at local levels would need to take place. In particular, there appears to be a need to
strengthen not just the mechanisms for promoting participation, but also the `culture' of
participation; on the part of duty bearers in actively engaging beneficiaries in all aspects of the
planning cycle, and amongst beneficiaries in asserting their rights for inclusion and participation.

In terms of the integration of P135-II resources with other programs, this was reported by district
and provincial authorities as being very difficult to do, as each program has separate
implementation mechanisms, targets, reporting procedures and guidelines. The burden falls upon
commune authorities to implement and report against separate programs. With the proliferation of
further poverty focused Programs at the national level (NTP-RD, Resolution 30a) the application
of a coherent vision for poverty reduction support is an imperative.

II.B. Devolution of Investment Ownership
The Commune Investment Ownership (CIO) model for infrastructure investment has been widely
applied in the final year of P135-II implementation. CIO of the production support component is
also reportedly high (projected at 70% by the end of 2010). For the capacity building and
livelihoods support components, CIO remains largely with the district levels. The remaining
inability of communes to become investment owners is attributed to a lack of capacity on their
part. In some cases, CIO seems to have been adopted reluctantly on the part of communes visited
and there is little evidence of CIO having been applied beyond the Program so far. But CIO
remains a key innovation of P135-II and is firmly institutionalized within the Program.

II.C. Local Institutional Capacity-Building Support
Training in support of P135-II objectives is being delivered but whilst the number of training
courses held is widely reported, the outcome of training is not reported or analysed. Women's
participation in training activities was good in the locations visited, particularly for extension
support. Low cost norms available for participation in training were reported to be a significant
obstacle to take-up. Training delivered in vocational training was reportedly not linked effectively
to employment opportunities and the success rate of trainees in gaining employment was
therefore low. The Program's rigid age qualification for participation in vocational training (19-
25) also excluded many people over 25 years of age who would benefit from this activity. Local


                                                                                                    69
authorities appear so far not to have a comprehensive vision and plan for capacity building
activities.

III.A. Procurement for Small-Scale Infrastructure
Procurement for Program activities still largely takes place through direct appointment. For small
scale activities (i.e. under 1 billion VND) this is in line with Government procurement guidelines,
but Program 135-II guidelines stipulate that open and competitive bidding should take place for
all activities with a budget over 300 million VND. Local authorities argued that few contractors
are interested in small projects and that the pool of qualified contractors in remote rural areas is
small. Community contracting (i.e. local communities doing the work) is an alternative but is so
far under-developed in P135-II communes. P135-II contractors are requested to use local labour
as much as possible and local authorities reported that this is the case, though record keeping on
this matter was limited and no records were kept by local authorities of contractor payments to
labourers. Many officials were unaware of the requirement to record this data for P135-II.
Procurement plans for infrastructure investments were not available to the JPR teams for
inspection.

III.B. Public Financial Management
Program 135-II remains one of the only national programs that has an audit plan and has regular
comprehensive audits conducted. In 2010, six provinces were scheduled to be audited by SAV; so
far three audits have been conducted. From the last round of 18 provinces audited, reports have
been completed and sent to CEMA and are awaiting comments before being published. SAV
reported that the issuing of the audit manual and training of local auditors in 2010 has increased
the quality of the auditing process for P135-II.

Project financial reports should come from two sources; (a) the spending agency (investment
owner or implementing agencies) and (b) from State Treasury. Reporting capacity of the
implementing agency is weak, thus at the provincial level, quarterly financial reports are not
reliably generated. At the program wide level, both annual and quarterly reports therefore cannot
be generated by CEMA.

The reconciliation between State Treasury and Spending Agency therefore cannot be done on a
quarterly basis. Instead, it is done annually and only at provincial level. The policy benchmark
requires the quarterly reconciliation of expenditure to take place on a program wide basis but this
is not feasible, for the reasons given above. An alternative may be that quarterly financial reports
are prepared by a number of provinces (say 25 provinces) and reconciled with State Treasury. Six
monthly reports can be generated by State Treasury on a regular basis. However they are not
regularly published on the website of MoF.

Audit reports were issued during August/September. However the audit reports were not
published on the website of SAV. The summary of audit reports was (and will be) published to
the public through a press release/ press conference only. An alternative option may be the
disclosure of audit reports on the P135 website (of CEMA).

The mission was informed that SAV and CEMA have conducted a mission to check the
implementation of audit reports' recommendations in the previous year. The report from that
follow-up mission has not yet been made available.

III.C. Community Contributions
The monitoring and recording of community contributions is not taking place in a uniform way,
reflecting a lack of specific guidance on this issue. Consequently, the reported level of
community contributions varies widely between the provinces visited. Community contributions

                                                                                                 70
largely take the form of contributions in kind, particularly land for rural road schemes. It was
unclear in the areas visited whether the land for the right of way for road projects was through
acquisition or voluntary contribution. Also, the requirement to have community contributions in
kind equal to 3% of the sub-projects value as suggested in guidelines may be unaffordable in less
populated, poorer and more difficult areas.

IV.A. Impact Evaluation
The report for the 2007 baseline survey has been published and is widely available. A follow-up
survey is planned for the beginning of 2011, to provide an end of program benchmark survey and
also generate baseline survey data for the next phase of P135. The end of project survey will
provide an important input to an end of programme evaluation of P135-II. Other impact
monitoring activities conducted include the use of Citizen Report Card (CRC) surveys which will
be further utilised in the next phase of the Program.

IV.B. Process Monitoring
The Management Information System (MIS) for the Program, the AMT/ PMT system, varies
widely in the effectiveness of its use and application in the provinces visited. In Tuyen Quang in
the north, comprehensive MIS reports were being generated whilst in Ha Giang, no MIS reports
were available. In the south, the MIS system was operational in both provinces visited but
authorities reported difficulties in implementing the system, with too many indicators to collect
and insufficient staff time and resources to do so. Some provinces have mobilized `intra-
provincial task forces' to provide support to districts and communes that are not so successful in
applying the MIS, but none of the provinces visited had applied this mechanism so far.
Completing MIS reporting was viewed as a reporting task to higher levels, and not as an aid to
local Program management or decision making.

Data collected was seldom disaggregated by gender and by poverty levels. The reliability of some
data presented to the JPR teams was questionable too, as when data was investigated further it
was found to be planning data only, rather than results of actual implementation. Monitoring
systems in the future will need to be carefully reviewed to ensure an excessive burden does not
fall upon the lower levels; essential data needs to be collected and reported accurately but the
management load should be sustainable and management responsibility clearly assigned. The role
of community based monitoring or the active participation of the community in monitoring the
Program has not been promoted so far.

IV.    CROSS CUTTING ISSUES

Gender
Steps have been taken to increase the participation of women in Program activities, however the
delay in producing and disseminating a gender mainstreaming manual for the Program has held
back progress in this regard. Where recording of women's participation has taken place (in
meetings or trainings) analysis has not gone beyond the counting of the number of participants.
There has been no assessment of how women have benefited from participating in the Program,
or how women's income or wellbeing has been impacted in specific and concrete ways. Further
analysis of how existing capacity building activities have specifically addressed the needs of
women would be useful too.

Environment
Environmental protection is not a core concern of the Program and there was little evidence of
environmental considerations taken into account in P135-II planning. Forest land allocation to
individual households through other programs in Lam Dong Province had contributed to
community involvement in forest protection, but the sustainability of Program investments in the

                                                                                               71
face of natural disasters is a serious concern; flooding last year in Kon Tum and other provinces
destroyed a lot of P135-II investments made and the next phase of the Program should seriously
investigate lessons learnt from elsewhere in `climate proofing' investments and mainstream this
in future guidance.

Decentralisation
P135-II has played a key role in supporting Government efforts for greater decentralisation and
has developed modalities for greater commune ownership in development processes. Notable
examples in this regard include Commune Investment Ownership (CIO), the establishment of
O&M funds, the piloting and application of Citizen Report Card surveys and the development
and application of a participatory planning manual. Much more needs to be done in the future to
consolidate these experiences and migrate them across to other Government programs and
processes. Consolidation, documentation and advocacy around these innovations could form a
central strategy for TA support in the next phase.

ANNEX 6: IMF ASSESSMENT LETTER

                              Vietnam--Assessment Letter for the World Bank1
                                              April 5, 2011
    ___________________________________________________________________________

1. Growth has remained strong through the global crisis thanks to the sizable
stimulus package, but macroeconomic stability has deteriorated and financial sector
risks have increased as monetary policy has remained accommodative.

     ·    GDP growth accelerated in 2010, and is estimated at 6¾ percent for the year as a whole. At the
          same time, inflation rose to 11.8 percent y/y in December and further to 13.9 percent y/y in March
          2011.
     ·    Credit-to-GDP ratio reached 125 percent of GDP as credit growth remained high at 32 percent y/y
          in December 2010. Concomitantly, financial sector risks have risen, exacerbated by cross-
          holdings within the financial sector and ownership links to the corporate sector, in particular state-
          owned enterprises (SOEs).
     ·    The current account deficit in 2010 narrowed significantly to 3.8 percent of GDP from 6.6 percent
          in 2009, on the back of recovery in exports. Direct investment inflows remained robust and
          portfolio investment rose strongly, but high unrecorded outflows of $13.3 billion (13 percent of
          GDP), reflecting to a large extent foreign currency and gold hoarding by residents outside the
          financial system, have led to continued exchange rate weakness and further pressures on
          international reserves which stand at 1.4 months of prospective imports at end-2010.
     ·    The overall fiscal deficit in 2010 is estimated to have reached 6½ percent of GDP, lower than the
          budgeted 7½ percent, owing to higher-than-projected revenues even as expenditures are also
          estimated significantly higher than budgeted levels.

2.      Against this background, the authorities have shifted their policy focus toward
restoring macroeconomic stability. After raising policy interest rates in several steps in late
2010 and early 2011, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) in February devalued the dong by
8.5 percent, while indicating greater flexibility in adjusting the daily exchange rate.
Subsequently, the government announced a comprehensive stabilization package aimed at
reining in inflation. Key measures for 2011 in the package include a reduction of credit
growth to below 20 percent, proactive use of policy interest rates, and a reduction of the
budget deficit by around ¼ percentage point of GDP from the budget plan. In addition,
10 percent of non-wage recurrent spending is to be frozen until the second half of the year,
and investments by the state and SOEs are to be reviewed, reprioritized, and in some cases cut.
The authorities have also announced plans to ban trading of gold bars to curb hoarding. To
address financial sector risks, the SBV earlier raised minimum capital requirements-- though its
application has been postponed for some banks--and the capital adequacy ratio, and is
introducing a limit on the credit-to-deposit ratio.

3.      The stabilization package is a very important step in the right direction, but
steadfast implementation through concrete action, which may need to be stepped up, is
crucial. The revised credit growth target is appropriate to reduce inflation expectations and
stabilize the exchange rate in 2011. At the same time, more ambitious fiscal consolidation

 The 2010 Article IV consultation was concluded on July 28, 2010. Staff visited Vietnam periodically since then, most recently during
February 24 ­ March 9, 2011 to conduct the 2011 Article IV consultation. Discussion of the staff report for the 2011 Article IV
consultation is scheduled for April 28, 2011
                                                                                                                                    73
than currently planned would help support inflation reduction and build cushions against
potential contingent liabilities. If such a policy package is implemented, IMF staff expect
output growth in 2011 to slow down somewhat to around 6¼ percent, and inflation at end-
2011 to about 9½ percent y/y. The current account deficit is projected to widen slightly, but
remain more than covered by continued strong direct investment inflows. Provided
confidence in the dong is restored, international reserves are expected to recover somewhat
but remain low. Downside risks to this outlook include a further rise in international
commodity prices, and a slower growth in major export markets.

4.       Safeguarding financial sector stability is critical. In this context, the recent request
for an assessment under the Financial Sector Assessment Program is welcome. The SBV's
new prudential regulations are important steps, but enforcement is key. The SBV's
credibility--and with it successful management of sectoral risks--hinges on close onsite and
offsite supervision of the financial sector and strong enforcement of prudential norms.
