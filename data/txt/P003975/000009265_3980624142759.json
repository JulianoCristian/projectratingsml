The overall objective of the project was to\n            expand, strengthen and upgrade the transmission facilities\n            for the Java-Bali system to supply electricity to new\n            consumers and to meet increases in electricity demand\n            arising from existing and new consumers. Both the\n            Bank's and the Borrower's performance under the\n            project has generally been satisfactory.The key lessons\n            learned were as follows : (i) establishment of a central\n            Project Management Unit (PMU) could benefit overall project\n            coordination and accountability; (ii) cumbersome procurement\n            processes are a leading cause of project implementation\n            delays; (iii) action on land acquisition should be taken\n            early on during project preparation stage; (iv) the project\n            did not have any outcome or impact indicators to measure the\n            performance of State Electrcitv Corporation\u2019s (PLN) power\n            transmission system in Java; (v) the project's focus on\n            institutional development solely through a system planning\n            study can in hindsight be viewed as overly narrow; and (vi)\n            more attention should be given on accurate cost estimate."}, "docdt": "1998-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
