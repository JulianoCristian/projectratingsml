MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
A POWER TRANSMISSION  'ROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for $275.0 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance
the Power Transmission Project. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent
to the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) for 20 years including a grace
period of five years; the onlending rate would be equal to the Bank's
standard variable rate on the loan, plus fees of 3.5 percent towards
covering administrative charges and the foreign exchange risk that the
Government will bear.
Background
2.       Indonesia is richly endowed with energy resources including oil,
gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal energy. To maintain the level of its
export earnings, a major objective of the Government's energy policy has
been to diversify domestic energy consumption away from heavy reliance on
petroleum products towards alternative and more economical fuels for which
there is a nonexportable surplus (gas and coal) or which are nontradeable
(hydropower and geothermal). The power subsector is playing an important
role in this respect. It offers a sizeable market for alternative fuels,
and allows their development to take advantage of economies of scale in
production ar.t transportation infrastructure.
3.       Indonesia's electric power subsector comprises:  (i) PLN, the
State Electricity Corporation, with 8,940 MW of installed capacity,
(ii) captive plants installed by private parties for their own use, with
about 6,800 MW of capacity, (iii) a small number of Government sponsored
rural electric cooperatives, and (iv) a large number of informal
microenterprises providing electricity to clusters of customers in rural
villages not served by PLN. PLN's supply facilities have grown rapidly
during the past decade. Its installed capacity increased by 355 percent,
to 8.9 GW; its sales grew by 420 percent, to 27.4 TWh; the number of
consumers grew 460 percent, to 10.2 million. Despite this rapid growth,
the per capita electricity consumption in Indonesia in 1989/90 was only
about 260 kWh, compared to 450-550 kWh per capita in Philippines and
Thailand, and about 300-350 kWh in India and Pakistan which have lower per
capita income than Indonesia. Only about 28 percent of all households in
Indonesia are electrified. PLN's current targets for 1994/95 are to
increase installed capacity to about 13.2 GW, and the share of electrified
households to 40 percent. The share of industrial consumption in PLN's
total sales is expected to groiw to about 52 percent.
Sector Strategy
4.       The objectives that the Government has set for the power subsector
are to improve the welfare of the population and to support the growth of
economic activity by meeting electricity requirements in an efficient and
reliable manner. The strategy in the power subsector is being focussed on



- 2 -
strengthening the technical, commercial and financial capability of PLN to
construct, operate and maintain efficiently the growing electricity
network. The priority issues being addressed in the power subsector
include (i) development of a stable long-term financial framework for
meeting PLN's investment requirements, and improvement in PLN's internal
cash generation capacity; (ii) promotion of efficiency by increasing the
financial and managerial autonomy and accountability of PLN, and
decentralization of authority within the organization; and (iii) promotion
of private sector participation in the development of the power subsector
to achieve additionality. These issues are being addressed through policy
dialogue and lending operations.
Experience With Past Operations in the Sector
5.       Since 1969, the Bank has financed a series of power projects to
help PLN expand its generation, transmission and distribution facilities in
a least-cost manner by, inter alia, diversifying its sources of fuel and
taking advantage of geothermal and hydroelectric resources. These
projects, and the technical assistance that was provided concomitantly,
have also enhanced PLN's institutional capabilities in many areas of
utilities operation and management, including project implementation. The
Bank's support has also focussed on developing PLN into a modern and
efficient utility by: (a) strengthening its financial performance;
(b) strengthening technical and corporate planning; (c) improving operating
efficiency; and (d) developing human resources. Project Performance Audit
Reports (PPARs) and Project Completion Reports have been issued for the
first eleven power projects in Indonesia. The lessons drawn from the
experience in Indonesia are consistent with international experience
reviewed in OED's report of 1990, entitled "Evaluation Results for 1988:
Issues in World Bank Lending Over Two Decades', that evaluated the outcomes
of 180 Bank-financed projects from 1974 to 1988. The OED report recognized
the importance of adequate electricity tariffs for good financial
performance and highlighted the following as other major factors
contributing to satisfactory performance: (a) continuing efforts for
strengthening institutional capacity; (b) taking steps for timely project
implementation, including procurement and land acquisition; and
(c) providing greater financial and operational autonomy for the utility.
These lessons learned from past experience have been taken into account in
the design of the proposed project, as indicated in para. 9 below.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.       The rationale for Bank involvement with the proposed project
arises not only from the financing requirements of Indonesia's large power
program to meet its development objectives but also from the need to
sustain efforts aimed at developing PLN into a modern, commercially
oriented utility. The Bank has been financing a large proportion of PLN's
facilities and assisting in building up PLN's institutional capabilities.
The proposed project would continue implementation of this strategy by
ensuring that transmission investments proceed at least-cost and in balance
with planned investments in generation and distribution facilities, to meet
increases in electricity demand. The project also would provide a vehicle
for strengthening PLN's capability in long-term planning of transmission
systems, and for promoting measures to strengthen PLN's financial position.
Discussions have been initiated on the introduction of a mechanism for
formula-based periodic adjustment of electricity tariffs.



- 3-
Proiect Objectives and DescriDtion
7.       The overall objective of the proposed project is to provide
reliable and efficient supply of electric power. The project would
(a) expand, strengthen and upgrade the transmission facilities for the
Java-Bali system to supply electricity to new consumers and to meet
increases in electricity demand arising from existing and new consumers;
(b) provide technical assistance for (i) the engineering, design and
construction supervision of transmission facilities included in the
project, (ii) the engine6ring, design and construction supervision of
additional generating units at the Suralaya coal-fired thermal power
station in West Java, (iii) a site selection and feasibility study for a
new thermal power plant in West Java, and (iv) a study for the long-term
development of the transmission network for the Java-Bali system; and
(c) promote measures for strengthening PLN's financial position. In
support of these objectives, the proposed Bank loan would finance equipment
and materials, and consulting services. The total financing requirement
for the project is estimated at $415.7 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of $316.6 million (76.2%), including interest during
construction. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9057-IND dated May 23, 1991 is
being distributed separately.
Environmental AsRects
8.       Extension of substations has practically no environmental impact.
No major environmental impact is expected from the establishment of new
substations and construction of new transmission lines. Any adverse
effects on the environment from the substation and transmission line works
will be minimized through the use of appropriate planning and engineering
design criteria, and construction and operation and maintenance practices.
Acquisition of the required land and rights-of-way will be coordinated with
local authorities and landowners. The project cost estimate includes
provision for appropriate compensation for the rights-of-way and purchase
of land. There would be no displacement of people. For the Suralaya coal-
fired thermal power station, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA),
based on three additional units of 600 MW each, has been carried out and
reviewed by the Bank. The EIA suggests that the Suralaya project will meet
the Bank's environmental guidelines for such projects.
Agreed Actions
9.       It was agreed that PLN will achieve an annual rate of return of
not less than 8 percent on PLN's revalued average net fixed assets in
operation in Java in FY1991/92 and thereafter, and reach financial break-
even for PLN's outside-Java operations in FY1993/94 (a shift of one year
from the target year of FY1992/93 that was agreed under Loan 3180-IND).
Towards this end the Government has informed the Bank that it will increase
electricity tariffs by an average of about 20 percent, effective July 1,
1991. It has been agreed with GOI that taking of all necessary steps to



- 4 -
ensure PLN's compliance with the covenanted revenue target in FYl991/92
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan; these steps
include implementation of required increases in electricity tariffs.   The
following a-reements, consistent with those reached under the Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND), have also been included in the
proposed project: (a) annual review with the Bank of PLN's investment plan;
(b) implementation of an action plan for efficiency improvements;
(c) review of financing plans for PLN's investment program; (d) annual
review of the tariff level and structure; and (e) limitation of debt, audit
of accounts, and asset revaluation. In addition, PLN has agreed to
(a) establishment by no later than December 31, 1993 and maintenance
thereafter, of an adequate revolving stock of standard equipment required
for supplying electricity to selected industrial consumers at 150 KV;
(b) timely acquisition of land and rights-of-way; and (c) submission of
quarterly progress reports on the environmental aspects of the transmission
component of the project, and status of acquisition of land and rights-of-
way and related compensaticn.
Benefits
10.      The project would help supply electricity in a reliable and
efficient manner, and meet increases in electricity demand, and thereby
support the rapidly expanding economy of Indonesia. The project would also
help strengthen PLN's financial position by supporting the development of a
mechanism for the periodic adjustment of electricity tariffs. The internal
economic rate of return (IERR) for PLN's investment program in Java for
1990/91-1994/95, which includes the transmission component of the proposed
project, is 17 percent; it would be 12 percent, if the consumer surplus
were excluded from the benefits.
Rsisks
11.      The main risk relates to possible delays In commissioning the
transmission facilities due to slow procurement actions, ineffective
coordination of different implementation activities and delays in
acquisition of land and rights-of-way. PLN has agreed to ensure effective
coordination of implementation activities through its central Directorate
of Construction. It has initiated advance procurement actions and will
undertake measures to acquire in time the required land and rights-of-way.
Recommendation
12.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
