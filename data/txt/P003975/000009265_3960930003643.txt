POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiary:         State Electricity Corporation (PLN)
Amount:              $275.0 million equivalent
Terms:               Repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:    The proceeds of the loan would be onlent from the
Government of Indonesia (GOI) to PLN for 20 years
including a grace period of five years; the onlending rate
would be equal to the Bank's standard variable rate plus
fees of 3.5 percent. The Government would bear the
foreign exchange risk.
Project              The proposed project would support the development of the
Description:         power sector and help provide reliable and efficient
supply of electric power. It would: (a) expand,
strengthen and upgrade the transmission facilities for the
Java-Bali system to supply electricity to new consumers,
and to meet increases in electricity demand arising from
existing and new consumers; and (b) provide project
support technical assistance, including consulting
services for (i) the engineering, design and construction
supervision of transmission facilities included in the
project, (ii) the engineering, design and construction
supervision of additional generating units at the Suralaya
coal-fired thermal power station in West Java, (iii) a
site selection and feasibility study for a new thermal
power plant in West Java, and (iv) a study for the long-
term development of the transmission network for the Java-
Bali system.
Benefits:            The project would help ensure that transmission
investments proceed at an appropriate level, and in a
least-cost manner, to meet increases in electricity demand
and to extend the network to currently unelectrified
areas. It would maintain a balance between planned
investments in generation, transmission and distribution
facilities.
Risks:               The main risk relates to possible delays in commissioning
the transmission facilities due to slow procurement
actions, ineffective coordination of different implementa-
tion activities and delays in acquisition of land and

INDONESIA
POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
I. THE EtERGY SECTOR AND ELECTRICITY SUBSECTOR
Sectoral Context
1.1       Indonesia is richly endowed with energy resources including cil,
gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal energy. Exports of oil and LNG, valued
at $9.3 billion in 1989190, accounted for 40 percent of total merchandise
exports. To maintain that level of export earnings, a major objective of the
Government's energy policy has been to diversify domestic energy consumption
away from heavy reliance on petroleum products (which account for about
62 percent of commercial energy use) towards alternative and more economical
fuels for which there is a nonexportable surplus (gas and coal) or which are
nontradeable (hydropower and geothermal). The power subsector is playing an
important role in this respect. It offers a sizeable market for alternative
fuels, and allows their development to take advantage of economies of scale in
production and transportation infrastructure.
Energy Resources
1.2       Oil.  Indonesia's recoverable oil reserves remaining in 1990 are
about 8-10 billion barrels. To maintain the current production level of about
500 million barrels p.a., continued exploration is required to compensate for
the depletion of the reserves. The growth in domestic consumption of
petroleum products, after a period of stagnation from 1980-86, accelerated to
6.3 percent per annum from 1986-89.
1.3       Natural Gas.  Endowed with about 84 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas reserves in a favorzole location near burgeoning East Asian markets,
Indonesia has become the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas,
with about 19.0 million tons exported in 1989, valued at $3.0 billion. In
addition to exports, Indonesia also possesses sufficient reserves to serve the
needs of the domestic market at specific locations in Java and Sumatra.
Natural gas is now considered the most economical fuel for power generation
and industry in these areas.
1.4       Coal.  Indonesia's coal reserves are believed to be as high as 28
billion tons, mostly located in Sumatra and Kalimantan. These reserves have
the potential for sustaining a large coal-fired power generation program in
the country, and also provide for a major increase in exports above the
current level of about 1.0 million tons per year. With one public and about
20 private enterprises, the coal industry would be able to take advantage of
opportunities as they arise, in both domestic and external markets.
1.5       Geothermal.  The geothermal reserves of Indonesia are estimated at
10,000 MW. Since the 1982 commissioning of the first geothermal power plant
at Kamojang, in Java, three more geothermal fields have been proven and are
being developed. To date, most geothermal exploration has focussed on Java,
where there exists a well-developed power grid which offers a large market,
but for which large coal-fired steam plants or gas-fired combined cycle plants



offer more economical options. In the outer islands, where the cost of
alternatives is higher, geothermal development would have greater competitive
advantage.
1.6       Hydropower.  Indonesia has considerable hydroelectric resources,
estimated at about 32,000 MW, but their development to date has been limited
by the fact that over 90 percent of it is located outside Java, where the
demand for electricity is limited. In Java, with about 2,000 MW of hydro
already developed, the only available options revolve around a few moderate
size sites and capacity increments (with negligible energy additions) at
plants that are already operating. Several hydroelectric plants outside Java
are currently under study.
1.7       Nuclear.  For Indonesia, nuclear power is expensive when compared to
coal and gas based power generation. There are, therefore, no current plans
to develop this option, although the Government has commissioned a study to
evaluate its feasibility for the future.
Institutions in the Energy Sector
1.8       The principal agency responsible for implementing Government
policies in the energy sector is the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). IMOF
coordinates all activities in the energy sector and supervises the state
enterprises in the sector: Pertamina (oil, gas and geothermal), P.1. Batubara
(coal), PGN (gas distribution) and PLN (electricity). Other ministries and
agencies are also involved in the sector, for example, the Ministry of Public
Works is responsible for hydropower resource surveys and the operation of
multipurpose hydro plants and the National Atomic Energy Commission is
responsible for nuclear development. An inter-ministerial National Energy
Board (BAKOREN) coordinates energy policies and development with that of other
sectors. BAKOREN is supported by a Technical Committee (PTE) consisting of
senior officials in different departments, chaired by the Director General of
Electric Power and New Energy (DGEP). The organization chart of the MME is
shown in Annex 1.1.
The Electricity Subsector
1.9       The Electricity Act (Law No.15 of 1985) defines the legal framework
for electricity subsector, and includes provisions for the participation of
private and cooperative enterprises. The subsector comprisest (i) PLN, the
State Electricity Corporation, with 8,940 MW of installed capacity;
(ii) captive plants installed by private parties for their own use, with about
6,800 MW of capacity; (iii) a small number of Government sponsored rural
electric cooperatives; and (iv) a large number of informal microenterprises
providing electricity to clusters of customers in rural villages not served by
PLN. The regulation of the subsector is the responsibility of the Minister of
Mines and Energy, which is assisted by the DGEP. The DGEP is the chairman of
the Supervisory Board which oversees PLN's operations and reviews PLN's
investment plans, budgets and tariffs.

Sector Obiectives and Priorities
1.10      In view of Indonesia's rich endovment in energy resources, the
energy sector is expected to continue to make an important contribution to the
development of the economy. The GOI's main objectives for the sector ares
(a) the economic (efficiency) objective: to meet the country's energy
requirements at least cost, and conserve exportable petroleum
reserves, principally by encouraging the domestic market to
substitute oil consumption by alternative fuels for which there is a
non-exportable surplus (e.g., gas and coal) or which are
nontradeable (e.g. ,hydropower and geothermal);
(b) the resource mobilization (financial and fiscal) objectives to
maximize the country's foreign exchange earnings and budgetary
revenues from the sector, mainly through the export of tradeable
energy resources, including oil, gas and coal, and to enable
producers of energy to recover their costs and obtain sufficient
resources to finance their growth and development;
(c) the soci.tl (equality and fairness) objective: to promote the
regionally balanced development of the country and enable the
majority of the people to afford the basic services provided by
en)rgy (lighting, cooking, transportation); and
(d) the environmental objectives to promote the production and
utilization of energy resourceg in a manner that will conserve the
environment.
Key sector Issues
1.11      To pursue the ebove objectives in an effective and efficient manner,
the following priority issues need to be addressed (i) determination of energy
prices in a manner coiisiEtent with the strategic objectives; (ii) reform of
the egulatory framework to promote efficiency by increasing the financial and
managerial autonomy and accountability of the state enterprises in the sector;
(iii) enhancement of the private sector's contribution; (iv) strengthening of
the regulatory framework for establishing, monitoring and enforcing
appropriate environmental standards in the sector; and (v) balancing of the
demand for and supply of electricity, particularly over the next two-three
years, to avoid outages (paras. 3.5 and 3.6).
Rationalization of Energy Prices
1.12      The current structure of domuestic energy prices is substantially
distorted and undermines the GOI's strategy of diversifying domestic energy
consumption away from petroleum products to more economical alternatives such
as natural gas, coal and geothermal. There is need to adopt an integrated
energy pricing strategy based on efficiency prices. To implement such a
pricing strategy and el..minate existing distortions in the structure of energy
prices, the GOI needs to:
(a) introduce a system for the periodic adjustment of PLN's electricity
tariff based on changes in the prices of its fuel and other costs;



- 4 -
(b) introduce a system for the regular adjustment of domestic petroleum
product prices that tracks the international market prices. Also,
there is need to eliminate the subsidies for diesel oil and
kerosene; and
(c) remove restrictions to allow market forces to play their role in
incremental supplies of energy so that there is adequate competition
between suppliers, such as of coal, natural gas, geothermal steam
and private power generation.
1.13      To assist the GOI in pursuing the above pricing strategy, the Bank
financed an 'Energy Pricing Policy Study' under the Gas Distribution Project
(Loan 2690-IND), and carried out a complementary Energy Pricing Review (Report
No. 8684-IND, Draft). These reports were recently discussed with GOI.
Following up on these discussions, the GOI has indicated that it is aware of
the need to reduce and eventually eliminate the subsidies on petroleum
products, and to make other adjustments in energy prices, as appropriate.
Also, under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND), the GOI has
agreed to specific proposals for institutionalizing the review of energy
prices, including the establishment of an Interdepartmental Energy Pricing
Task Force to review and advise Government on energy prices, and of an Energy
Pricing Unit in MME to provide analytical support and technical data to the
Task Force. To date a provisional Energy Pricing Task Force has been
established, and the functions and size of an energy pricing unit are under
review within the MME.
1.14      The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is also supporting the GOI in the
above effort by p.oviding technical assistance for the design and
implementation of a mechanism for periodic adjustment of the electricity
tariff. This study has been completed recently and its results are being
reviewed by the GOI. During the loan negotiations, an understanding was
reached with the GOI that there was a need to adopt a periodic electricity
tariff adjustment mechanism. The mechanism would be so designed as to protect
PLN's financial performance from changes in the cost factors beyond PLN's
control, such as domestic and international inflation, fuel prices and the
exchange rate. The further course of action in the matter is being pursued
with GOI through the Bank's ongoing dialogue on energy sector policies.
Enhancing the Private Sector's Contribution
1.15      An enhanced role for private enterprise in the development of the
power sector is of interest because of the potential it offers for
contributing additional financial and managerial resources, as well as for
increasing efficiency through competitive pressures. Although private
electricity generation already plays an important role in the industrial
sector as well as in some rural areas, there are several approaches that can
be pursued to enhance the contribution of private enterprise. These include
(a) coordination with captive generation, (b) transfer of utility functions to
village enterprises and (c) promotion of private power generation.
1.16      Coordination with Captive Generation.  Given the large installed
captive generation capacity (para. 1.9), many opportunities exist for PLN to
improve the reliability of its service, reduce its reserve requirements and



-5-
augment its service through coordination of capacity use. As a first step,
the GOI and PLN are planning to implement selected pilot projects where the
coordination with captive generation would be economical, such as utilization
of captive capacity to (i) support PLN's grid reliability on an emergency
basis; (ii) meet owner's own requirements to relieve the grid on an emergency
basis (interruptible supply); and (iii) supply energy to the grid on a long
term basis by using industrial waste (e.g., wood waste, rise husks, bagasse)
or through combined heat and power generation (cogeneration). The practical
operating experience collected from such pilot projects would be used to
subsequently implement standardized arrangements on a broader scale, as agreed
under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND).
1.17      Transfer of Utility Functions.  Another area for enhanced private
sector involvement is suggested by the existence of a large number of
microenterprises that provide highly expensive and precarious power supply in
rural areas. These enterprises do not appear to be sustainable in the long
term. A strategy for supporting the development of the rural areas by
developing their managerial, technical and labor resources into useful Jnputs
for the electrification program needs to focus on the transfer of utility
functions from PLN to village enterprises, and eventually developing them into
local distribution companies. The objective of this effort would be to reduce
PLN's costs and to supplement PLN's scarce technical, managerial and
operational resources. PLN is already moving in this direction, through a
concerted effort, including special procurement procedures, training and
technical assistance, to develop locally-based enterprises to handle
construction, customer administration, line services and, in the future,
equipment operation and maintenance. This effort is supported through the
Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND).
1.18      Private Power Generation.  In an important initiative to take
advantage of the private sector, the GOI is taking steps to arrange private
power gen6ration through Build, Own, Operate and Transfer type of contracts.
In addition, the GOI proposes to encourage private investments in those
situations where private generation is economically competitive with PLN's
grid, such as (a) the combined generation of steam and power (cogeneration) by
industries that have a continuous demand for steam, (b) the use of selected
waste materials as fcel for power generation, and (c) the development of large
scale power plants to meet specific industrial requirements and augment PLN
supply.
The Environmental Objective
1.19      The GOI is pursuing the objective of developing the energy sector in
an environmentally sound manner through the establishment of an appropriate
regulatory and institutional framework. This framework includes the creation
of an Environmental Task Force in the MME, the requirement of a satisfactory
Environmental Impact Statement for every investment project, and the
strengthening of monitoring and enforcement capabilities at the line Ministry
and local government levels. This process is supported through technical
assistance, provided under the Paiton Thermal Power Project (Loan 309e-IND),
which is designed to assist the GOI to (a) formulate environmental regulations
and quality standards for energy projects, (b) develop standard approaches for
controlling various environmental impacts, (c) develop environmental
monitoring plans, (d) strengthen enforcement procedures, and (e) training of
personnel.

2.2        Project Performar-e Audit Reports (PPARs) and Project Completion
Reports (PCRs) on the first eleven projects have been issued. Also, the
implementation of the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Power Projects is
substantially complete. The PPARs have concluded that the projects reviewed
so far achieved the objectives set out at the time of appraisal.
Specifically, these projects and the technical assistance that was provided,
enhanced PLN's institutional capabilities in many areas of utilities operation
and management, and particularly in the area of projects implementation, and
helped PLN meet critical demand for electricity (para. 2.2). The last PPAR
(No. 7902 of June 26, 1989) concludes that the Bank has made a positive
contribution towards the development of the Indonesian power sector over the
past 20 years. It attributes this to the facts that: (a) there was a long-
term vision for the development of the subsector and this vision was shared
between the Bank, Government and PLN; (b) the vision was translated in to a
long-term strategy which was persistently pursued, while remaining flexible in
conception and implementation of individual measures. Individual projects
fitted into this strategy and complemented each other; and (c) a reasonable



- 7 -
balance Was struck between the physical and the institutional development
components of the projects. These conclusions drawn from the experience in
Indonesia are consistent with the Bankwide experience reviewed in OED's report
of 1990, entitled "Evaluation Results for 1988: Issues in World Bank Lending
Over Two Decades". This report evaluated the outcomes of 180 Bank-financed
poi-er projects from 1974 to 1988 and suggested that sustainability of power
projects was highly influenced by institutional and country economic
conditions but less so by technical and policy factors. The report also
concluded that the main causes of "unsatisfactory" performance were:
(a) technical inadequacies in design; (b) poor institutional and managerial
performance; (c) poor financial performance and related financial problems;
and (d) implementation delays, cost escalation and inadequacies in the
electricity tariff structures. The following paragraphs provide some details
to assess the experience in Indonesia in the light of this international
experience.
2.3       In broad terms, the Bank's involvement with the power subsector in
Indonesia can be distinguished in three phases. In the initial phase (1968
until the mid-1970s), the Bank concentrated on creating a national entity,
PLN, to deal with sectoral problems and helped put in place procedures and
systems to manage and improve its initially small-scale operations. In the
second phase, (from 1975 to 1985), the primary thrust of the Bank's work was
to assist PLN to develop capability to undertake rapid expansion of its
electricity supply facilities. The latter was facilitated by the increased
revenues that GOI received due to oil price increases. In the current third
phase (from 1986 onwards), with PLN improving its operational, planning and
implementation capability, the focus has shifted towards providing the entity
greater financial and corporate autonomy, and to the external environment
including the reform of the regulatory framework in the power subsector.
Specific aspects of the Bank's involvement and experience in the Indonesian
power subsector are described below.
2.4       Initial Phase.  In the late 1960s, when the Bank became involved in
the power subsector in Indo3nesia, PLN was in an exceedingly poor
organizational and financial state. The first power project (FY70) helped in
identifying PLN's weakr.esses and finding approaches to overcoming them. Under
a second operation in 1972, a long-term power development study for Java was
carried out that defined the objectives and components of the power system
development on which most of the work under the second phase of the Bank's
involvement was based. Another result of the first phase of the Bank's
involvement was the promulgation of Government Regulation No. 18 of 1972, that
provided PLN with a higher, albeit still limited, degree of autonomy,
including responsibility for procurement and construction of most of its
facilities. This first phase also resulted in a new accounting system and a
comprehensive training program.
2.5       Capacity Expansion.  During the second phase (from 1975 until 1985),
the Bank approved about one project each year. The infrastructure component
of this series of projects helped PLN expand primarily in Java, its generation
capacity of thermal, coal-fired, hydroelectric and geothermal power plants,
and transmission and distribution facilities. These projects also supported
the Government's objective of diversifying domestic energy consumption away
from oil by the use of coal, hydropower and geothermal. At the beginning of
this decade, PLN's installed capacity had grown to more than 10 times what it



- 8 -
was at the beginning of the 1970s, and to more than 2.5 times what it was at
the beginning of the 19809; Bank-financed projects had made substantial
contributions to 3,800 MW of the approximately 6,000 MW of generating capacity
operating in Java in 1990.
2.6       Institutional Development.  A first major effort at institutional
development at PLN took place with Bank assistance in the mid-1970s, through
the implementation of a comprehensive Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) which took
into account all aspects of PLN's administration and operations. As part of
the FRP and subsequently through a long series of loans, technical assistance
was provided to improve PLN's skills in diverse areas including system
planning, demand forecasting, system operation, design of generation and
transmission facilities, operation and maintenance of power plants, project
managemenrt, personnel management, management informstion system and
accounting. As a consequence, PLN made progress in improving the efficiency
of its operations (Annex 4.2). In particular, its transmission and
distribution losses decreased from 20.8 percent in 1983/84 to 15.7 percent in
1989/90. The operation of the 1,600 MW coal-fired thermal power plant at
Suralaya in West Java (funded by four Bank loans), supplied about 40 percent
of the electricity needs of Java and achieved an availability factor of 83
percent in 1989/90, which is comparable to a standard expected in developed
countries. Overall, PLN's capacity for implementation, as well as for
operation and maintenance, has grown substantially during its association with
the Bank. It now carries out on average an investment program of about $1
billion per year and connects over one million new consumers annually.  In
order to implement a rapidly growing expansion program and to manage
increasingly diverse and complex operations in an efficient r..anner, PLN would
need to strengthen its institutional and operational capacity. International
experience has suggested that a main cause of unsatisfactory operational
performance in the power subsector is poor institutional and managerial
performance (para. 2.2). Accordingly, the Bank's dialogue on institutional
development is now focussed on providing PLN greater corporate autonomy and
increasing its accountability.
2.7       Financial Performance.  The objective of the Financial Recovery Plan
for PLN to achieve the full operating cost recovery was met in 1975/76.
Thereafter, a self-financing ratio (SFR) covenant was adopted in 1978 under
the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1513-IND). The agreed SFR target was 30
percent for 1985/86 with indicative targets for intervening years. While the
indicative targets for the self-financing ratio were met, the rate of return
on asspts remained negative. Therefore, a rate of return (ROR) covenant was
adopted under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND) in 1984. The ROR
covenant was modified in 1987 under the Power Transmission and Distribution
Project (Loan 2778-IND), to provide for separate financial performance targets
for PLN's operations in Java (ROR of not less than 8 percent) and outside-Java
(financial breakeven situation), in view of their different operational
characteristics. Projections showed that PLN would be able to achieve a self-
financing level of 25-30 percent with these covenants. However, the
government did not permit the corresoponding tariff adjustment in 1987/89.
Consequently, although project preparation continued, the Bank did not approve
further loans in 1987 and 1988, pending the Government's action on tariff.
The Government increased tariff by about 25 percent effective April 1, 1989.
As a result, PLN's financial performance became satisfactory in 1989/90, with
net internal cash generation allowing PLN to finance about 32 percent of its



- 9 -
investment needs. Currently, PLN's tariff is close to the long run marginal
cost of supply in Java. The main lesson during the prior period in the 19809
was that electricity tariff adjustments generally lagged increases in PLN's
fuel and other operating costs, which affected negatively PLN's financial
performance. The emphasis of the Bank's dialogue on electricity pricing has,
therefore, shifted towards designing a mechanism that would permit periodic
and quasi-automatic adjustment of electricity price with the changes in the
cost of inputs such as fuel, salaries and wages and the exchange rate.
2.8       Fuel Price Subsidies.  The Bank has had a continuous dialogue with
GOI on the petroleum products prices. Until 1979, the level of domestic fuel
oil prices was about one third of the international level. In 1980, in the
context of the Ninth Power Project (Loan 1872-IND), the GOI agreed in
principle to the elimination of subsidies and during 1980-84, eliminated them.
The average price for a basket of petroleum products was raised to an
international price equivalent, and has been maintained roughly at that level
since then.
2.9       Implementation.  Problems with implementation of power projects have
been caused in three major areas: (i) delays in the selection and appointment
of consultants, (ii) delays in the procurement of equipment and goods, and
(iii) delays in the acquisition of land and the right of way for the
construction of transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, rigid
budgetary authorization procedures, scarcity of local funds, unsatisfactory
performance of local contractors, and for a long time shortage of trained
personnel within PLN, have delayed the implementation of previous projects.
These problems are not specific to the power subsector but are germane to the
implementation of projects in most sectors in Indonesia. In response to this
experience, the Government has become conscious of the need for improvement
and has been taking corrective steps, such as dismantling the organization for
centralized control on procurement in 1988. In a similar vein, under the
proposed project PLN is taking advance action to speed appointment of
consultants, issue of bid documents and acquisition of land for new
substations and rights-of-way for transmission lines.
Bank Role and Strategy
2.10      Despite the accomplishments discussed above, there are several
important constraints in the power subsector that need to be addressed. These
are as follows:
(a)  Reducing the large unmet electricity demand against the background
of a continued rapid economic expansion has three major
implications: (i) PLN's financing requirements will be large
(estimated at $30 billion for the current decade); hence a medium to
long-term financing plan will need to be worked out by GOI/PLN;
(ii) the institutional and implementation capacity of PLN will need
to be strengthened further if it is to construct, operate and
maintain the growing electricity network; and (iii) private
participation in the subsector will need to be promoted to help
reduce the financial and managerial burden of the GOI, which
requires a suitable regulatory framework and adequate safeguards to
ensure efficiency and fairness;



- 10 -
(b) Given the magnitude of the financing requirements, there is need for
(i) a long term commitment on the GOI's financial contribution,
based on the resources required for the expansion of socially
directed activities; (ii) improvement in PLN's internal cash
generation capacity, through the establishment of a mechanism for
periodic adjustments of the electricity tariff reflecting changes in
factors beyond the control of PLN (such as fuel prices, domestic
inflation and exchange rate), and further efficiency improvements in
its operations; and (iii) a strategy for promoting PLN's access to
domestic and international markets for borrowing and, eventually,
equity;
(c) In order to make further progress in improving the efficiency of
PLN's operations, there is need for (i) streamlining the regulatory
framework to increase the autonomy and accountability of PLN through
a transparent system of financial support for socially directed
programs, and simplification of budgetary and procurement controls;
and (ii) strengthening the institutional framework through the
enhancement of the corporate planning process, decentralization of
authority and accountability throughout the organization. This
should lead to a reduction of operating costs, especially through
improvements in fuel efficiency, fuel substitution and reduction in
transmission and distribution losses, particularly in the operations
outside Java; and
(d) As domestic oil consumption is projected to increase, the objective
of energy resource diversification will need to be pursued more
vigorously, to avoid Indonesia becoming a net tmporter of petroleum
products. The current level and structure of prices favors the
consumption of petroleum products in lieu of other, more economical
fuels, such as natural gas and coal, of which Indonesia has an
abundant endowment. Adoption of efficiency prices as the basis for
the determination of domestic prices of petroleum products, and
periodic adjustment of such prices in line with international
trends, will help achieve the goal of energy resource
diversification and promote the utilization of natural gas for power
generation.
The Bank will continue to provide, as in the past, financial assistance and
policy advice to the GOI and PLN to address the above-outlined constraints in
the power sector, through specific lending operations and policy dialogue.

III. THE POWER MARKET AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The Market
3.1       During the 1970s and 1980s, the power sector of Indonesia has grown
rapidly. The installed capacity of PLN, grew from 0.5 GW in 1970 to 2.5 GW in
1980 and 8.9 GW in 1990, as its sales grew from 1.6 TWh in 1970 to 6.5 TWh in
1980 and 27.4 TWh in 1990. This achievement is impressive, particularly
considering the extension and archipelagic nature of the country. Even so,
the proportion of electrified households in Indonesia, of 28 percent, is low
by regional standards. PLN is only able to serve about 62 percent of urban
households and 16 percent of rural households, whereas it is estimated that at
least 90 percent of urban households and two thirds of those in rural areas
can afford to purchase electricity. Annex 3.1 shows the growth in PLN's
consumers and sales.
3.2       In spite of its rapid development, still PLN accounts for only just
over half of the installed generating capacity, with the rest being accounted
for by captive generation facilities operated by industrial plants. The rapid
emergence of captive generation in the 1970s and its continued growth in the
1980s, bridged the shortfall in electricity supply, albeit at a cost, as grid-
supplied electricity is generally more economical than captive generation.
This was facilitated by the Government's policy of allowing industrial plants
to generate their own electricity whenever PLN was unable to meet the
requirements. Total installed capacity of captive generation is about 6,800
MW, of which about 1,900 MW are also connected to PLN and operate on a standby
basis, and 4,900 MW operate in isolation. In addition to industrial captive
generation, the shortage of electricity also gave rise to thousands of village
generating sets providing a precarious service to small numbers of customers.
Annex 3.2 shows the growth in captive plants in Indonesia.
The Demand for Electricity
3.3       Several studies have shown that the potential demand for electricity
is large and that there is a potential for rapid growth in PLN's sales as
supply capacity expands. This is supported by the fact that even though PLN's
sales grew by 15.1 percent per annum during the 1980s, electricity demand
growth could only be supported by expanding use of captive generation by
industry, and the proliferation of informal microenterprises in rural areas.
The rapid growth in PLN's sales originates from three sources, viz.(a) growth
in consumption by existing customers as a result of rising output and income;
(b) extension of supply to new areas for residential and other users; and
(c) gradual replacement of diesel-based captive generation.
3.4       It is estimated that the sales of electricity from PLN's grid will
continue to grow as shown in Table 3.1. This forecast, which is agreed with
PLN, takes into account the higher projected rates of economic growth that
result from the unexpectedly positive response of the economy to the
Government's recent economic reforms; it is based on the following main
assumptionst (a) a gradual levelling off of the GDP growth rate from
7.5 percent per annum in 1990 to 6.4 percent in 1995, combined with a
transition towards a more efficient pattern of electricity consumption; (b) an
increase in the share of electrified households from 28 percent (62 percent
urban. 16 percent rural) in 1990 to 40 percent (75 percent urban, 25 percent
rural) in 1995; and (c) a gradual increase in the share of total industrial
electricity requirements provided by PLN. Overall, the share of industrial



- 12 -
customers in PLN's total sales is projected to increase from 49 percent in
1990 to 52 percent in 1995, while that of households is projected to decline
from 33 percent to 31 percent over the same period, with the rest accounted
for by commercial and public customers.

PLN's Development Program
3.5       The updated sales forecast  has necessitated a substantial revision
in PLN's long term development program. Even with the revisions, the recent
acceleration in economic growth, which had not been foreseen, combined with
the long lead time required for power generation investments, is likely to
lead to a situation in which demand for electricity from PLN will outstrip its
ability to supply, at least until 1993/94, when PLN's capacity is expected to
catch up with requirements.
3.6       To minimize the adverse economic consequences of a possible shortage
of electricity, the GOI and PLN are pursuing a series of measures to balance
supply and demand in the medium term in a least-cost manner and avoid the
disruptions associated with widespread outages. These measures include: for
the short term, (i) a relaxation of licensing requirements for industrial
consumers to install their own g-nerating capacity; (ii) a freeze in
connections to new consumers who already have captive generation capacity; and
(iii) installation by PLN of short-lead time gas turbine generation capacity
as a first step towards the construction of more efficient combined-cycle
power plants; and for the medium term, development of a regulatory framework
that would make it feasible for private investors to build power plants to
supply the grid in a manner that is consistent with the long term efficiency
of the power system. The Bank is assisting in the formulation, evaluation and
implementation of these measures through the dialogue that it maintains in the
course of its operational work.  In addition, to the above measures, greater
emphasis on demand side measures such as load management, energy conservation,
interruptible supply agreements, cogeneration and pricing is being pursued.
3.7       To avoid the continued supply constraints beyond 1993/94, PLN has
revised its least-cost generation expansion program to reflect an accelerated
rate of preparation and implementation. The revised expansion programs for
Java and Outside Java are summarized in Annexes 3.3 and 3.4. The
corresponding investment requirements for Indonesia and Java are shown in
Annexes 3.5 and 3.6.

PLN's Investment Program
3.8       PLN's installed generating capacity in 1989/90 was 8,941.3 MW of
which about 6,150 MW was in Java. Table 3.2 shows a breakdown of the
generating capacity by primary fuel sources in Java and outside Java as of
March 31, 1990.

3.9       The instilled capacity in the Java system is expected to grow to
over 10,000 MW in the next five years. The least cost generation expansion
plan prepared by PLN and reviewed by the Bank, establishes the following
targets for the generating capacity, by fuel sources, for the end of
FY1995/96. The share of gas as a primary fuel will grow from almost nil n
1989/90 to about 30 percent of the total.

3.10      PLN has also formulated an investment plan for the expansion of the
transmission and distribution facilities in Java, to meet the expected growth
in demand. The basis for the plan is derived from (a) segregated area-wise
demand projections consistent with the aggregate demand projections;
(b) supply agreements and applications for supply from industrial consumers;
(c) targets for the expansion of supply to urban and rural residential
consumers; and (d) detailed load flow studies to ensure the integrity and
reliability of transmission system. The Bank reviewed the composition of the
investment program and the methodology for determining it and was satisfied
that the program was justified for ensuring a balanced development of
generation, transmission and distribution facilities. A detailed technical
and economic review of the components to be funded under the proposed project
was also carried out (paras. 5.2 and 7.4). The investment requirements for
the transmission lines, substation and the distribution facilities required in
Java for the period 1990/91 to 1994/95 are provided in Table 3.4.

3.11      To ensure continued soundness of the development program, the Bank
agreed with the GOI and PLN under the Rural Electrification Project (Loan
3180-IND), that: (a) each year, PLN and GOI will review with the Bank PLN's
investment program so that the Bank can express its views on the priorities
and the balance among generation, transmission and distribution investments;
and (b) the GOI will ensure that PLN has access to sufficient funds to finance
its capital expendltures as reviewed and agreed with the Bank. This agreement
is also included under the proposed project.

IV. THE BENEFICIARY
4.1       The proposed loan would be made to the Government of Indonesia.  The
proceeds of the proposed loan would be made available to PLN (through an
onlending agreement) which is responsible for the implementation of the
proposed project. PLN, the sole government-owned national power utility, has
been the beneficiary of Bank Group lending to the power sector in Indonesia
since 1969 (para. 2.1).
PLN's Organization
4.2       PLN was established as a public corporation (Perum) under Government
Regulation No. 18 of 1972, with responsibility for the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity and the planning, construction
and operation of electricity supply facilities. That governing Regulation
No. 18 was amended by Government Regulation No. 54 of 1981, and superseded by
Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990. PLN is managed by a Board of Directors
headed by a President Director, who is appointed by the President and is
accountable to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The President Director has
authority for all operations of PLN. The Board currently includes five other
directors with functional responsibility, respectively, for planning,
construction, operations, finance and administration. Operational
responsibility devolves to 17 regions, and responsibility for major
construction to 12 project managers. Also reporting to the Board are several
staff units responsible for power research, education and training, management
services, an internal audit unit called the Corporation Inspectorate, the
Java-Bali system operation and control unit, and a recently established
Engineering Services Center. PLN's organization chart is shown in Annex 4.1.
Institutional Development
4.3       PLN has grown rapidly in the past decade.  Since 1977/78, it has
connected new consumers at a fast increasing rate, from about 370,000 in
1978/79 to about 1,040,000 in 1989/90. The rapid expansion of supply
facilities, which is expected to continue over the next several years,
involves increasingly complex technical and managerial tasks, for which PLN
will need to continue to strengthen its institutional capacity. Areas that
need strengthening have been recognized, and actions and programs are either
already underway or planned, in many cases with assistance from the Bank. The
areas that are being strengthened include planning, organization and
management, operating efficiency, and staff development and training.
4.4       Through the years, PLN has strengthened its technical planning
activities in the areas of generation, transmission and distribution. The
generation and transmission planning functions are now well established in PLN
and are functioning smoothly. The proposed project finances consultant
assistance for preparation of a long-term transmission development plan and
enhancing PLN's capacity for planning long-term development of the
transmission network (para. 5.8).
4.5       In the area of operations, the main emphasis rests on improving the
planning, operation, maintenance and management of distribution facilities.
PLN's distribution management functions are being strengthened through
technical assistance being provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project
(Loan 3097-IND). Technical assistance provided under the Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) will help improve the planning of



- 16 -
rural electrification subsector development. Also, PLN's corporate planning
and financial planning functions are being developed further with technical
assistance provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND).
Annex 4.2 shows some of the performance indicators for PLN for the years
1980/81 to 1989/90; they indicate significant achievements in several areas.
Specifically, the transmission and distribution losses were reduced from
20.8 percent in 1983/84 to 15.7 percent in 1989/90. Efforts are continuing to
achieve further improvements. Under the Power Transmission and Distribution
Project (Loan 2778-IND) and the Power Sector Efficiency, Paiton Thermal Power
and the Rural Electrification Projects (Loans 3097-IND, 3098-IND, and 3180-
IND), PLN agreed to carry out an action plan for efficiency improvements,
which is under implementation. The major components of this action plan are:
(i) efficiency improvement in distribution including reduction in losses;
(ii) conversion of selected oil-fired thermal plants to gas-firing;
(iii) improvements in the operation of major therma' 3wer plants;
(iv) improvements in the operation and maintenance of diesel power plants,
including their relocation and rehabilitation; and 'v) renovation of small
hydro plants. The agreement to carry out the action plan is also included
under the proposed project.
4.6       To provide a broader framework and longer-term perspective for the
institutional development of the power sector, the Bank has recently carried
out a Power Sector Institutional Development Review (Report No. 7929-IND,
dated December 20, 1989). The objective of the review was to identify the
regulatory and institutional conditions under which the continued rapid
expansion of the sector could be carried out with the greatest efficiency and
effectiveness. The results of the review suggest that the principal condition
is the creation of an environment within which PLN and the other participants
in the sector will be motivated to apply their initiative and creativity to
reduce costs and improve service in the course of achieving the targeted
expansion. As a general direction, the creation of such an environment will
require a shift towards greater reliance on guidance through incentives rather
than administrative intervention and on decerntralized decision-making rdther
than centralized control, while also taking advantage of the pressures created
through competitive comparison. This study was presented to the Government in
December 1989. Based on the recommendations of the study, several issues
relating to PLN's financial autonomy are being pursued through the proposed
project and the Bank's ongoing dialogue with the GOI. These issues include
(a) electricity tariff, including its periodic adjustment (paras. 1.14 and
6.8); (b) financing of investment program (para. 6.21); and (c) a move to
bearing of full cost of capital by PLN (para. 6.23).
Staff Development and Training
4.7       As of March 31, 1990, PLN had about 51,800 employees, of whom about
38,450 are permanent staff. PLN has no difficulty in recruiting staff
educated at levels up to technical high school, but faces constraints in
recruiting those with higher academic qualifications. Less than 5 percent of
its staff have university degrees, which is low by utility standards. To
address its training needs, PLN has a separate training department that plays
an important role in PLN's efforts to upgrade the skills of its technfCal and
administrative staff. These efforts have been largely successful. In
1989/90, about 9,000 staff received training -- about 5,400 received training
within PLN, about 3,500 domestically outside PLN, and about 100 abroad.
4.8       The Bank has been supporting PLN's training activities and human
resources development efforts, including the establishment of several training



- 17 -
centers. Current efforts being supported by the Bank include training in the
areas of diesel/thermal plant operations, distribution management, corporate
and financial planning, general accounting and cash management, as well as
specific training activities in the rural electrification area. The proposed
project provides for treining in transmission planning as part of the
technical assistance for the study for the long-term development of the
transmission network (paras. 4.3 and 5.8).
Accounting and Budgeting
4.9       PLN's accounting system, installed in the early 1970s, follows
generally accepted accounting principles, and normal utility practices, but it
needs upgrading to keep pace with the growing complexity and volume of
accounting transactions. There is need for improvement with respect to the
completeness and accuracy of fixed asset accounting, depreciation, inventory
accounting and accounts receivables. The accounting system needs to produce
more accurate information in a timely manner for decision-making purposes.
Also, PLN's internal procedures for preparing budgets and monitoring actual
expenditures need to be strengthened through better coordination among and
participation by the various functional directorates and regional offices in
the process, to enhance the budget's value as a management tool.
4.10      A major constraint to PLN's accounting has been a lack of trained
senior accountants and uniform accounting procedures. Since 1987, PLN has
been implementing an action plan to improve its accounting practices and
functions by (i) establishing a uniform accounting system, (ii) improving
related support systems, (iii) sensitizing concerned nonfinancial managers and
staff to the importance of timely and accurate accounting, (iv) upgrading the
skills of the accounting staff through in-house and external training courses,
and (v) computerizing the accounting process. PLN is also attempting to
improve coordination between its departments and its regional offices in the
areas of budget preparation, and monitoring and evaluation of performance.
Technical assistance is being provided under the Power Sector Efficiency
Project (Loan 3097-IND) to improve the accounting system. The Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) provides technical assistance to
continue to enhance the system for the segregation of PLN's accounting of its
RE operations (para. 6.14).
Billing and Collections
4.11      PLN's bills are computerized and prepared monthly at the Jakarta
headquarters. Overall collection performance is generally satisfactory. The
receivables position of general consumer accounts has been good, as it has
been kept at about one and one-half months of the yearly billing. The
overdues from government users (including the Armed Forces and local
governments), which account for about 10 percent of PLN's total sales, have
also been reduced to under two months' billing.
Audit and Internal Control
4.12      PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by
Government auditors. The audits are carried out following generally accepted
accounting practices and standards. The audit reports in recent years had
received qualified opinions from the auditors, most recently with respect to
the inventory accounts. PLN has made substantial improvements in the areas
commented upon by the auditors. As a result, in the latest report for 1989/90
there were no qualifications.  PLN makes special efforts to expedite the



- 18 -
closing of accounts and has succeeded in completing them usually within six
months after the close of the fiscal year, as stipulated by Government for all
public corporations. While the unaudited accounts are generally finalized and
received in time, there have been delays in the auditing Z accounts.
Remedial action is being taken; thus the audit covenant under Loan 3180-IND,
which requires PLN to submit to the Bank its audited financial statements and
the report of such audits no later than nine months after the end of each
fiscal year, was also agreed under the proposed project. In addition, PLN
would furnish to the Bank (i) a copy of its unaudited annual accounts whenever
they are sent to the auditors; and (ii) its segregated financial and operating
information on rural activities (para. 6.14), all within six months after the
end of each fiscal year.
4.13      PLN has an effective internal audit group which reports to the
President Director for various special investigations, in addition to keeping
general and project accounting matters under review.
Insurance
4.14      PLN currently carries transit and marine insurance on equipment and
materials in transit. Projects under construction are covered by the
contractor's all risk and erection insurance. Fire and other hazards on most
of the assets in operation are self-insured. In view of the geographical
spread of PLN's assets, any single loss would be relatively small by
comparison with total assets and operations, and this policy has been
considered satisfactory by the Bank. However, with some very large projects
having been completed in recent years and others now under implementation,
there would be a greater concentration of assets in certain locations than in
the past. An understanding was reached under Loans 3097-IND and 3098-IND that
major works, plant and equipment at large power projects would be insured with
outside agencies. PLN is currently carrying commercial insurance for major
operating plants and equipment at five large power projects totalling 3,680
KW, namely, Muara Karang (700 MW), and Suralaya (1,600 MW) thermal power
plants, and Saguling (700 MW), Cirata (500 MW) and Panglima Besar Soedirman
(180 MW) hydroelectric power plants. In addition to these plants, PLN plans
to commercially insure in 1991/92, other large power plants, such as those at
Gresik, Semarang, Belawan and Bukit Asam.

V. THE PROJECT
Backaround
5.1       The electric power system in Java-Bali islands is the largest in
Indonesia (para. 4.5). PLN's system in these islands had electric energy
production and peak load of about 23,860 GWh and 3,943 MW, respectively, in
1989/90.   This power system comprises about 6,150 MW of installed capacity,
which is interconnected by a 500 kV extra-high voltage (EHV) -itwork. The EHV
network extends about 730 km from Krian in East Java to the Suralaya thermal
power plant in West Java. The subtransmission networks at 150 kV and 70 kV
stretch for about 6,000 km and 4,000 km. respectively. Transforming capacity
of substations is about 3,500 HVA for the 500/150 kV level and 2,560 MVA for
the 150/70 kV level. The annual average growth rate of net electric energy
production and peak load demand has been about 14 percent during the last five
years; and current forecasts would lead to a doubling of energy production and
sales by 1995/96. PLN generating plant in the Java-Bali system is projected
to gr%w by about 63 percent to about 10,055 MW in 1995/96.
5.2       As discussed in para. 4.5, the operating efficiency of PLN system
has shown important improvements during the past few years in several areas,
including a decrease in transmission and distribution losses in the Java-Bali
system from about 20.8 percent of gross energy production in 1983/84 to 15.7
percent in 1989/90. However, the transmission system operates with some
substations and lines that are overloaded, thereby affecting the security of
operation and reliability of supply. Such substations need to be expanded to
decrease overloading, and to take care of the projected load growth in the
areas which they serve. The overloaded lines need to be reinforced or
reconstructed in all or part of their le-_alth to improve operational
characteristics. PLN has formulated a transmission investment program that
proposes to meet these aims (para. 3.10). The proposed Power Transmission
Project is an important part of that investmw"nt plan.
Rationale for Bank Inirolvement
5.3       The proposed project is an integrot,! part of the Bank's strategy of
promoting the developmelLt of PLN into a mode.-, commercially oriented utility
capable of meeting the electricity needs of 7n>onesia in a reliable and
efficient manner.  The Bank has financed a la&ge proportion of PLN's
facilities, and has helped build up PLN's instAttttional capabilities (paras.
2.1 to 2.6). The Bank's financial assistance in the power subsector has been
focussed mainly on Java, as the Government has sought assistance from other
donor agencies to meet the requirements outside Java. The Bank's presence in
the sector would promote cofinancing, and help GOI/PLN deal with complex
regulatory and institutional issues in the sector (paras. 1.11-1.17). The
proposed project would continue the implementation of the above strategy by
ensuring that transmission invtestments proceed at an appropriate level and at
least-cost, and in balance with planned investments in generation and
distribution facilities, to meet Increases in electricity demand. The project
also provides a vehicle for strengthening PLN's capability in long-term
planning of transmission systems, and for promoting measures to strengthen
PLN's financial position, including the introduction of a mechanism for the
periodic adjustment of electricity tariffs.

Project Obiectives
5.4       The major objectives of the project are:  (a) to ensure that
investments in power transmission facilities proceed at an appropriate level
to supply electricity to new consumers and to meet increase in electricity
demand in Java, by strengthening and upgrading the Java-Bali transmission
system; (b) to assist in the preparation of power generation projects and of a
study for the long-term development of transmission network in Java-Bali;
(c) to improve PLN's capability in long-term planning of transmission systems;
and (d) to promote measures for strengthening PLN's financial position.
Project Description
5.5       The project would (a) expand, strengthen and upgrade the
transmission facilities for the Java-Bali system to supply electricity to new
consumers and to meet increases in electricity demand arising from existing
and new consumers; and (b) provide project support technical assistance,

5.7       The proposed project would also support a special fund--the
Industrial Consumers Connection Fund (ICCF)--of about $20.0 million (base cost
plus contingencies) to finance the construction of new transmission facilities
for supplying industrial consumers at 150 kV. Currently, PLN requires a lead
time of about three years to respond to requests from large industrial
consumers for power supply, and the steps involved are: (a) location of
sources of finance; (b) procurement of equipment and materials; and
(c) construction and erection of transmission facilities. The concept behind
the ICCF is to reduce or eliminate the time taken in steps (a) and (b), and to
enable PLN to respond to consumer needs in a short time. Towards this end, a
portion of the fund would be utilized for maintaining a revolving stock of
standard equipment for the connection of industrial consumers at 150 kV, which
will be procured along with other transmission and substation equipment to be
financed under the proposed loan. Another portion of this fund would be used
for non-standard and urgent requirements for connecting the consumers. PLN
has agreed to establish by not later than December 31, 1993, and maintain
thereafter, an adequate revolving stock of standard items required for
supplying in a timely manner, electricity to industrial consumers at 150 kV.
At negotiations, an understanding was reached that PLN will maintain the
revolving stock on a continuing basis from its own or other resources even
after the equipment procured from funds provided for under the proposed loan
have been installed. At negotiations, understandings were also reached that:
(a) the ICCF will be utilized to construct substations and lines to connect
those industrial consumers who had not contracted with PLN by June 30, 1990
for supply of electricity and who, preferably, do not have their own
generating capacity to meet their needs, and (b) the selection of such
connections would be done on the basis of the following criteria: (i) the
supply will be at 150 kV; (ii) a supply contract between PLN and the consumer
has been signed; (iii) total capital cost will be $1.0 million or more;
(iv) the financial rate of return will be at least 8 percent; (v) the economic
rate of return would be at least 10 percent. PLN has agreed that prior to
constructing new transmission facilities for supplying electricity to the
industrial consumers, proposals justifying such connections will be submitted
by it to the Bank for review and approval.
5.8       Technical Assistance Component:  The project includes the following
project support technical assistance proposals that relate to project
implementation, feasibility studies and long-term system planning:



- 22 -
(a) engineering, design and construction supervision of substations and
transmission lines included in the project (about 600 staff-months);
(b) engineering, design and construction supervision of Units 5, 6, and
7 of the Suralaya coal-fired power plant in West Java (about 600
staff-months);
(c) site selection and feasibility study for a new thermal power plant
in West Java (about 200 staff-months); and
(d) study for the long-term development of the transmission system in
Java-Bali (about 90 staff-months).
5.9       Project Engineering and Proiect Management.  PLN has competent
engineers to undertake the engineering design and tender documents for the
works. However, PLN's needs for reinforcement and expansion of the
transmission system are large and growing quickly. PLN's engineering,
supervision, and coordination capabilities need to be supplemented by the
provision of technical assistance to help carry out these tasks. Therefore,
the proposed project provides funds for such assistance. Annex 5.4 provides
the agreed term of reference for the consulting services. The total work is
divided regionally into three parts, i.e., for West Java, Central Java and
East Java. Short lists of consultants for these tasks were agreed with the
Bank and the proposals received from them are under evaluation. The
appointment of the consultants is expected by December 1991.
5.10      The engineering, design, and construction supervision of Units 5, 6,
and 7 of the Suralaya coal-fired power plant, the site selection and
feasibility study for a new thermal power plant in West Java, and the study
for long-term development of the transmission system in Java will be carried
out by consulting firms. Terms of reference for these three assignments
(Annexes 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7) and short lists of consultants were agreed with the
Bank, and proposals received from them are under evaluation. The appointment
of consultants for these assignments is expected by September 1991. A project
for the expansion by 3 x 600 MW (Units 5, 6 and 7) of the Suralaya Thermal
Power Project is currently under preparation. The proposed project provides
for consulting services for the advance preparation during the precontract
phase. The consulting services contract for the Suralaya power plant
engineering and design work would be divided into two phases. The first
phase, to be financed under the proposed loan, would cover all work in the
first 12-18 months of the assignment and include (a) engineering, design and
bid specifications for some initial contracts, (b) bid issuance, evaluation
and finalization of some contracts, particularly turbine-generation and steam
generators, and (c) post contract award engineering and follow up of some
contracts. The second phase, included as optional services under the current
proposal would be financed under a future project, would cover post contract
award engineering, and construction management and supervision.
5.11      Land Acquisition and/or Right of Way.  PLN has experienced in the
past difficulties in the acquisition of land for transmission substations and
of right-of-way for transmission lines. The proposed project includes
predominantly extension of existing substations, and land is already available
for these expansions at most of the existing substations. The acquisition of
additional land and/or of right-of-way would be related mostly to new
substations and new transmission lines. The procedures involved are time
consuming and lengthy. PLN has already initiated advance action to acquire
land for new substations, as necessary. It has agreed to acquire by not later



- 23 -
than December 31, 1992 all the land for substations and rights-of-way for
critical sections of the transmission lines, and thereafter submit evidence
satisfactory to the Bank that it has available the required land and rights.
The critical sections of transmission lines include in particular those that
are likely to traverse through high density population areas where
difficulties are expected to be encountered in acquiring the rights-of-way.
In such cases, PLN, with the assistance of consultants, would make route
selections and obtain construction permits in advance, and provide them to the
contractor. All other required rights-of-way would be acquired by PLN with
the assistance of the contractor as part of the construction activity in
accordance with the project implementation schedule. Requirements for
reporting by PLN on the environmental aspects relating to acquisition of land
and rights-of-way are discussed in para. 5.26.

5.13      The total cost of the project including physical and price
contingencies is about $355.9 million equivalent of which about $275.0 million
is foreign cost. The costs are inclusive of taxes, estimated to be about
$6.2 million equivalent. PLN is exempt from duties and taxes on imported
equipment but pays a 10 percent value-added tax (VAT) on all local contracts.
The project cost estimates for the transmission component are based on 1990
prices which are derived from (a) quotations received from manufacturers of
materials and equipment; and (b) analysis of recent international tenders for
materials and equipment received by PLN. The costs of the consulting services
are b-ased on an estimate of about 600 staff-months for the engineering, design
and construction supervision of the transmission component, and about 890
staff-months for the other technical assistance components included in the
project. Physical contingencies amounting to about 10 percent for
transmission lines, 5 percent for substations; and 10 percent for engineering
services have been provided. Price contingencies, which amount to about 7
percent of the base cost plus physical contingencies, are estimated on the
basis of annual escalation factors of 3.6 percent for foreign cost, and 6.5
percent in 1991 and 6 percent in 1992 and thereafter for local cost.
Financing Plan
5.14      The proposed Bank loan of $275.0 million equivalent would meet
100 percent of the foreign cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, or about 66 percent of the total financing required. The
proceeds of the Bank loan, which would be made to the Government of Indonesia
(GOI), would be onlent to PLN for 20 years including a grace period of 5
years, under a subsidiary loan agreement satis£actory to the Bank, the signing
of which would be a condition of loan effectiveness. The onlending rate will
be the Bank's standard variable rate on the loan, plus fees of 3.5 percent
towards covering administrative charges and the foreign exchange risk that
would be borne by the Government (para. 6.23). The estimated financing for
the project is as shown in Table 5.3 below.

5.15      The Bank loan will finance the acquisition of equipment, materials,
and services, including supervision of erection, testing and commissioning of
special equipment, of the substations and transmission lines, and the
consulting services for the engineering, design and construction supervision
of the transmission component, as well as consulting services for the
engineering, design and construction supervision of Units 5, 6, and 7 of the
Suralaya coal-fired power plant, the site selection and feasibility study for
a new thermal power plant in West Java, and the study of the long-term
development of the transmission system in Java-Bali.



- 26 -
5.16      Several bilateral and international lending agencies are expected to
be involved in financing the transmission investments in Indonesia. GOI is
arranging financing for PLN's investment program for transmission facilities
required during 1990/91 to 1994/95. The proposed project is a part of that
program and accounts for about one-fourth of the related financing
requirements. Thus, for the convenience of implementation, the project does
not include direct cofinancing.
Procurement
5.17      All equipment, materials and related services to be financed under
the proposed Bank loan will be procured by international competitive bidding
(ICE), in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. In the ICB
procedures for the procurement of equipment and materials, domestic
manufacturers would be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of
15 percent r the import duty whichever is lower. All bidding packages for
goods finaz.ced by the Bank loan estimated to cost over $1,000,000 equivalent
will be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documents, which
covers nearly all contracts. Table 5.4 summarizes the procurement
arrangements.

5.18      The construction and erection of transmission facilities (including
related civil works) which would not be financed under the proposed loan,
would be procured under local competitive bidding procedures in accordance
with GOI regulations acceptable to the Bank.
5.19      For all consulting services to be financed under the proposed Bank
loan, consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines.
Implementation and Supervision
5.20      PLN will implement the project.  For the transmission component,
PLN's Engineering Service Center will handle the engineering, design and
preparation of tender documents; procurement will be handled by a central
procurement unit; and construction will be managed by the three transmission
project construction units in West, Central and East Java. PLN has a central
division (Network Project Control Division) in its Directorate of
Construction, which coordinates and monitors the implementation of various
projects involving the expanbion of transmission and distribution networks.
The manager of this division will be responsible for coordinating and
monitoring the implementation of the proposed project and providing reports to
the Bank on the progress of the project. The project supervision arrangements
are described in Annex 5.9.
5.21      PLN has been constructing and erecting through contractors,
substations and transmission lines under previous projects financed by the
Bank. The same arrangement for construction and erection of substations and
lines is proposed for the project. While PLN will procure, through
international competitive bidding, the equipment and materials and services,
including supervision of erection, testing and commissioning of special
equipment (para. 5.17), separate contracts for the construction and erection
of substations and transmission lines will be entrusted to contractors based
on local competitive bidding, following GOI guidelines acceptable to the Bank.
5.22      The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 5.10.  The
construction of substations and transmission lines is expected to be completed
by March 31, 1996. The closing date of the loan will be December 31, 1996.
Disbursements
5.23      The Bank loan will be disbursed against approved contracts and will
cover: (a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly imported
equipment and materials; (b) 100 percent of ex-factory expenditures for
locally manufactured items; (c) 65 percent of local expenditures for other
items procured locally (ex-shelf); and (d) 85 percent of expenditures for the
services of consultants. No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior
to loan signing. To the extent practicable, withdrawal applications will be
aggregated in amounts of $100,000 equivalent or more prior to submission to
the Bank. In view of the large size of contracts involving mostly direct
payments, there is no need for special accounts or the use of the statement of
expenditure (SOE) procedure.
5.24      Annex 5.11 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank
loan. The disbursements against this loan are expected to be faster than the
disbursement profile for power projects in Indonesia because: (a) of the high
proportion of the transmission component, where about 90 percent of the Bank
loan would be disbursed against procurement of goods only; (b) work on



- 29 -
acquisition of land, and transmission line route surveys is advancing well;
(c) bid documents for the transmission lines and substation equipment and
materials are being completed for issue by June 30, 1991; and (d) consultant
proposals have already been received for all of the technical assistance
components.
Environmental Aspects
5.25      PLN staff prepared an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Report
in July 1990. The Report is based on the Bank's Environmental Guidelines for
Power Transmission Lines. The IEE report reveals no major adverse impact by
the transmission works. No resettlement is expected since people would not be
displaced by them. The extension of about 41 substations has practically no
environmental impact. To minimize any adverse effects on the environment from
the establishment of about 18 new substations and the routing of the 16 new
transmission lines, including 14 overhead lines and two underground ones, PLN
will coordinate land acquisition and the routing of the new lines with local
authorities and land owners, and will use appropriate planning and engineering
design criteria and construction and erection specifications as well as
adequate operation and maintenance practices for the transmission works (para.
5.11). PLN will take appropriate measures to reduce the environmental impact
during the construction and erection of the underground lines. The cost
estimate of the transmission component includes funds for the compensation for
the rights-of-way and for the purchase of land; the proceeds of the proposed
Bank loan will not be utilized for these purposes. For the Suralaya coal-
fired thermal power plant, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), based on
three additional units of 600 KW each, has been carried out and reviewed by
the Bank. The EIA suggests that the Suralaya project will meet the Bank's
environmental guidelines for such projects.
5.26      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached that PLN will submit
to the Bank, for its review and comments, quarterly progrese reports in regard
to the environmental aspects of the transmission component, and the status of
acquisition of land and rights of-way and related compensation.   .
understanding was reached with PLN that the quarterly reports will cover,
inter alia, the following aspects:
(a) resettlement and rehabilitation of affected population, if any;
(b) disturbance or destruction of forest;
(c) category of land and type of property being acquired, classified by
type of use (industrial, agricultural, residential, etc.); and
(d) amount of compensation paid for different types of property.
Since work on the preparation of the project, including on the environmental
aspects was already underway, an understanding was reached that the first
quarterly report will be furnished to the Bank not later than June 30, 1991.

Excluding revaluation surplus.
6.2        During 1982/83-1985/86, the Government's policy on electricity
tariff permitted PLN's operations to function at or near financial breakeven.
As a result, PLN's annual rates of return (ROR) on net revalued assets were
nearly zero or negative. The Government provided substantial equity
contribution towards PLN's sizeable capital investment during this period. In
1986/87, PLN achieved a positive rate of return (3.4 percent) on net revalued
assets and its annual self-financing ratio (SFR) was 23.0 percent. However,
in 1987/88, PLN's financial performance deteriorated substantially (ROR of
-0.2 percent and SFR of 7 percent). This result was due mainly to the
devaluation of the Indonesian currency in September 1986, price escalation,
and substantial increases in the proportion of oil-based generation in 1987188
because of the drought of 1987. PLN's financial performance showed only
marginal improvement in 1988/89. An average increase of about 25 percent in
the electricity rates approved by the Government, effective April 1, 1989,
restored and improved PLN's profitability in 1989/90 (para. 6.4).
6.3        PLN's operating performance varies considerably at regional level.
PLN's Java operations, which supply electricity through an interconnected
system, are largely commercially-oriented and profitable. PLN's outside-Java
operations, which are mainly small-scale and dispersed over a large number of
islands, are mostly highly unprofitable, and have a negative impact on PLN's

overall finances. The selected 1988/89-1989190 financial indicators for PLN's
Java and outside-Java operations are presented in Table 6.2.

6.4       In 1988/89, PLN's Java operations generated an operating profit of
Rp 190 billion, with a ROR of about 3.8 percent. The outside-Java operations,
however, incurred an operating loss of Rp 187 billion with a ROR of about
-9.9 percent, and thereby reduced PLN's overall operating profit to Rp 3
billion, with an ROR of 0 percent. In 1989/90, the operating loss incurred by
the outside-Java operations reduced to about Rp 128 billion, with a ROR of
-5.3 percent, whereas the Java operations produced an operating profit of Rp
691 billion with a ROR of 10.6 percent. PLN's overall financial position
improved substantially in 1989/90 (ROR of 6.3 percent, with a self-financing
ratio of about 32 percent). This satisfactory performance resulted from
various improvements in efficiency (e.g., lower transmission and distribution
losses) and the about 25 percent increase in electricity rates effective April
1, 1989.
Financial Obiectives
6.5       Under the Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND signed April
30, 1990), PLN is required tot (i) realize for its Java operations, in
1989/90 and each fiscal year thereafter, an annual ROR of not less than
8 percent, and (ii) for its outside-Java operations, achieve a break-even
situation in each of its fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1992/93,
i.e., total revenues equivalent to not less than the sum of their (a) total
operating expenses, and (b) the amount by which debt service requirements
exceed the provision for depreciation. A covenant under Loan 3180-IND also
requires PLN to carry out an action plan for efficiency improvements for all



- 32 -
its operations, in a manner to ensure that the break-even requirements of the
revenue covenant for the outside-Java operations are achieved (para. 4.5).
6.6       The principal financial objectives underlying the revenue covenant
discussed above were that PLN should achieve: in the short term, sufficient
overall profitability for it to cover its operating expenses, realize positive
annual rates of return, meet its debt service requirements, maintain adequate
liquidity, and self-finance about 20 percent of its average annual capital
expenditures; and in the medium term, to improve its profitability further to
self-finance about 30-35 percent of its annual capital expenditures, and rely
mostly on borrowings to finance the balance, confining the Government's
contributions to programs that involve the building of infrastructure for
supplying electricity to targeted groups, mainly outside Java.
Present and Future Performance
6.7       PLN's actual financial petformance for 1989/90, the estimate for
1990/91 and projections for 1991/92 through 1995/96 and related income
statements for its Java and outside-Java operations are summarized in Table
6.3. (Details are given in Annex 6.1; notes and assumptions underlying the
projections are given in Annex 6.2). In the projections, the sales growth and
investment requirements for the Java and non-Java operations are based on the
PLN's latest sales forecasts and the related power development plan agreed
with the Bank (paras. 3.4 and 3.7).

6.8              While PLN's financial performance improved substantially in 1989/90
(para. 6.4), the performance in 1990/91 was adversely affected by the domestic
fuel price increases in May 1990 averaging about 15 percent, increases in
personnel costs and exchange rate depreciation. Nevertheless, through
improved capacity utilization, and better control of personnel and other
operating expenses, PLN expects to be able to achieve for its Java operations
in 1990/91 a ROR of about 7 percent (compared to the 8 percent covenantedi,
and annual SFR of about 20 percent. However, for the outside-Java operations,
the profitability gains achieved in 1989/90 would be nearly eroded in 1990/91,
largely due to the May 1990 increase in the price of diesel oil by 22.5
percent. For PLN to achieve the covenanted revenue target in 1991/92 (paras.
6.5 and 6.10), adjustment of the electricity tariff would be necessary.
Towards this end, GOI has informed the Bank that it will increase electricity
tariffs by an average of about 20 percent effective July 1, 1991, which would
exceed requirements to allow PLN achieve the financial objectives in 1991/92.
It has been agreed with GOI that taking of all necessary steps to ensure PLN's
compliance with the covenanted revenue target in 1991/92 would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan; these steps include implementation of
required increases in electricity tariffs. To ensure the continued
achievement by PLN of its financial objectives in subsequent years, the
Government is considering the introduction of a mechanism for formula-based
periodic adjustment of the tariff. Discussions have been initiated with GOI



- 34 -
on the specifics of such a mechanism (para. 1.14). In the financial
projections the tariff is assumed to be adjusted by about 20 percent effective
July 1, 1991, and thereafter annually by 4 percent at the beginning of each
fiscal year, to absorb the impact of increases in operating costs (excluding
increases in fuel costs) and increases in the rate base.
6.9       The financial projections show that PLN's overall profitability
would improve substantially with its overall annual rate of return rising from
about 2.6 percent in 1990/91 to about 8.7 percent in 1995/96. The capital
structure would remain satisfactory; the debt as a percentage of debt plus
equity (excluding revaluation surplus) would rise from about 36 percent in
1989/90 to about 50 percent in 1995/96, and its debt service coverage ratio
would be in excess of 2.0 throughout the projection period. An existing
covenant under Loan 3180-IND requires that PLN may not incur any additional
debt unless a reasonable forecast of its net revenues after expenditures for
each year during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5
times its projected debt service requirements. This covenant was also agreed
under the proposed project. PLN's current ratio is expected to be in the
range of 1.3 to 1.6 through most of the projection period; this would provide
adequate liquidity.
6.10      The financial projections show that during the forecast period, the
profitability of PLN's Java operations would improve substantially, with the
operating ratio declining and the annual ROR rising, respectively, from the
estimated 79 percent and 7.1 percent in 1990/91 to 63 percent and 12.6 percent
in 1995/96. Consequently, during the forecast period the Java operations
would exceed substantially the ROR target of the revenue covenant (para. 6.5).
PLN's operations outside Java would also show substantial improvement from
1991/92 onwards, with the operating ratio declining from the estimated
139 percent in 1990/91 to 107 percent in 1992/93 but not enabling a financial
break-even in that year, as required under the revenue covenant for the
outside-Java operations (para. 6.5). Crucial to reaching the financial break-
even outside Java is the continued implementation by PLN of an action plan
(para. 6.5) for sales promotion, efficiency improvement, and cost reduction in
the operation of a large number of isolated, scattered small systems. As the
implementation of the cost reduction measures is being carried out along with
rapid system expansion, it is not feasible to achieve the break-even objective
prior to 1993/94, when the operating ratio is projected to be 99 percent. In
view of the above, it was agreed under the proposed project to retain the
current ROR covenant for the Java operations, and to postpone compliance with
the break-even target for the outside-Java operations by one year to FY1993/94
(para. 6.5).
6.11      In the financial projections, PLN's capital expenditures (including
interest during construction) projected for 1991/92-1995/96 are derived from
the investment requirements and least-cost expansion plans shown in Annexes
3.3 to 3.6, and total about Rp 30,910 billion ($16,260 million) in current
prices. The financing plan assumed in the financial projections for the
REPELITA V (1989/90-1993/94), is presented and compared to that for the
REPELITA IV (1984/85-1988/89) in the Table 6.4. Details are given in
Annex 6.1.

/a   Including consumers' contributions and deposits, and adjusted for changes
in working capital.
6.12      In the projected financing plan for the REPELITA V (1989/90-
1993/94), the Government's contribution is estimated to be about 24 percent,
compared to about 40 percent for the REPELITA IV period, with the annual
contribution declining to 37 percent in 1991/92, and to 13 percent in 1993/94.
PLN's own contribution from its internal sources is projected to increase from
about 13 percent during REPELITA IV to about 31 percent during REPELITA V,
with annual SFR rising from 20 percent in 1990/91 to 34 percent in 1993/94.
Borrowings would cover about 45 percent of the financial requirements during
the REPELITA V. compared to about 46 percent in the REPELITA IV. While this
is basically in line with the financial objectives underlying the revenue
covenant (para. 6.6), there is need to develop a strategy for the long-term
financial requirements of PLN (paras. 6.19-6.21).
Performance Monitorin8
6.13      For monitoring the financial performance under the revenue covenants
discussed in para. 6.5 for PLN's Java and outside-Java operations, PLN has
been providing the Bank with separated historical financial results (beginning
with its fiscal year 1986/87) and forecasts on a proforma basis, but not
separate audited fir.ancial statements. Accounting for PLN's Java and outside-
Java operations is separate except for overhead expenses, and debt service
payments, which have been difficult to separate except on a notional basis.
While initially the overhead expenses and debt service payments are being
allocated on the basis of unit sales of energy, PLN is pursuing the separation
of debt service payments on the basis of actual debt and related service
payments.
6.14      As an important step towards improved efficiency and management
accountability, PLN needs to obtain a better understanding of the costs
associated with its substantial socially-directed activities (e.g., rural
electrification). To assess the impact on its finances of such activities,
PLN has agreed to implement a system for segregating financial and operating
information on rural electrification activities both for Java and outside-Java
operations, which, as a first step, will serve as a proxy for socially-
directed activities. The data generated by this system would provide a basis



- 36 -
for the Government to assess the extent to which it should compensate PLN to
sustain and expand the agreed socially-directed electrification programs.
Under Loan 3180-IND, it was agreed with PLN that such information will be
compiled and submitted to the Bank, along with the annual accounts. A first
report containing such information for 1989/90 was submitted by PLN in
February 1991. PLN is refining the system to improve data quality, and would
continue to furnish annually such reports to the Bank.
Tariffs
6.15      PLN's tariff schedules, which became effective April 1, 1989,
comprise 21 consumer categories. For medium and large industrial, and large
commercial consumers, and for large office buildiugs, time-of-day pricing is
in effect. The tariff schedule is shown in Annex 5.3.
6.16      Under the Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) it was
covenanted that (a) PLN will periodically review its long-run marginal cost
(LRNC) and tariff structure, and discuss the results of the review with the
Government and the Bank, and (b) before December 31 in each year, PLN will
review the adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirements of the revenue
covenants (para. 6.5). Such a review will take into account the results of
the review of the LRMC-based structure and an action plan for efficiency
improvements to achieve, inter alia, the requirements of the break-even
revenue covenant for the non-Java operations (para. 6.5). These covenants
were also agreed under the proposed project.
6.17      In April 1990, PLN completed a study of its LRMC of supply in Java.
which was reviewed by the Bank. The study indicated that PLN's average revenue
in 1989/90 would have been Rp 132.2/kWh, if the tariff of each consumer
category was set at the estimated LRMC of supply in Java. PLN's actual
average revenue in 1989/90 was Rp 114.1/kWh. This level of the electricity
tariff is close to or above the LRMC of supply for all categories of consumers
except small social institutions, small residential, small hotels and small
industrial consumers. With a tariff increase of about 20 percent to be
implemented effective July 1, 1991 (para. 6.8), PLN's average revenue in
1991/92 would be about Rp 134.5/kWh on an annualized basis.
Taxes
6.18      In accordance with the prevailing tax legislation effective since
1984, PLN is subject to a 10 percent value-added tax (VAT) and to corporate
income tax. The Government currently bears the VAT on the foreign contracts,
and PLN bears it on the local contracts; this policy is assumed to continue
throughout the projection period. With respect to corporate income tax, the
current Indonesian tax code permits the use of accelerated depreciation of
assets in operation, instead of the straight-line method used by PLN in its
financial accounting. As a result, PLN does not expect to pay any corporate
income tax for its fiscal year 1990/91, and during the projection period. In
calculating the rate of return, however, any income tax payments will be taken
into account.



- 37 -
Overall Development Fund
6.19      Under Government Regulation No. 18 of 1972, that established PLN
(para. 1.10), the provisions relating to the disposal of PLN's annual net
profit after corporate income tax require that 55 percent of such profit be
set aside for "Dana Pembangunan Semesta" (DPS), or the Overall Development
Fund for which the required payment should be made to the state treasury.
Regulation No. 18/1972 also provided that the Minister of Finance may directly
reinvest in PLN for the expansion of its facilities the DPS funds payable by
PLN. So far, PLN has retained such DPS funds for financing its investment
requirements and has made no payments to the treasury in this regard. A
Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990 has superseded PLN's governing Regulation
No. 18 of 1972, and the earlier provision that allowed the Minister of Finance
to reinvest in PLN the proceeds of the DPS funds payable by PLN is no longer
applicable. PLN has a sizeable investment program that is expected to grow
substantially over the next several years. Any large payments by PLN to DPS
would significantly reduce its self-financing capability, and there would be
need to ensure that PLN would have sufficient funds available to carry out its
investment program. In the past, the GOI has provided equity contributions to
finance a large share of PLN's investments. The GOI is aware of PLN's future
investment requirements, and it will continue to make its best efforts to
provide financing in amounts and time to enable PLN to implement its
investment program.
Financing Policy
6.20      PLN formulates its long-term investment program spanning a ten-year-
horizon, which is updated periodically. The plan is reviewed by the GOI and a
five-year time-slice of it is incorporated in the country's development plan,
the latest (REPELITA V) of which commenced on April 1, 1989. Based on the
approved framework of the five-year plan, PLN prepares an annual plan and a
budget, which is approved by the Government. In past years, the Government
has shown a strong commitment towards these plans and has taken steps to
enable PLN to implement them. During REPELITA IV, the Government's
contribution amounted to about 40 percent of PLN's investment expenditures,
whereas PLN's own contribution was only 13.6 percent with the balance of about
46 percent being financed by borrowings (paras. 6.11-6.12). The level of
PLN's own contribution was low because it was not permitted any upward
adjustment in its tariff during the REPELITA IV period.
6.21      The Government proposes to continue to finance PLN's investment from
three sources, namely, PLN's internal funds, borrowings and Government
contributions. In view of the rapidly growing investment requirements of the
sector, there is a need to develop a strategy for the long-term financing
requirements of PLN. Because of the uncertainty associated with the magnitude
of its self-generated funds, the level and cost of borrowing, and the
magnitude of the equity contribution from the Government, PLN has been unable
to prepare meaningful financial plans. Thus, there is need to develop a
suitable framework that will allow PLN to formulate and implement investment
plans in a reasonably predictable financial environment. As a step towards
developing such a framework, PLN is drafting a five-year corporate plan for
1991/92-1995/96 that would include a financing plan for the five-year period
and specify targets for PLN's self-financing, GOI contributions and
borrowings. PLN's self-financing targets would need to be based on
maintaining a level of tariffs that would enable PLN to meet the revenue
covenants agreed with the Bank and other financial objectives. There would
also be a need to define the strategy for PLN's borrowings, including access



- 38 -
to local capital markets. These matters will be pursued through the Bank's
policy dialogue and lending operations.
6.22      An existing covenant (Loan 3180-IND) relating to the long-term
aspect of PLN's financial planning has also been agreed under the proposed
project.  This covenant requires that, as part of its ongoing annual planning
activities, PLN should prepare a ten-year financial forecast based on its
proposed development plan, and also prepare for the first five years of the
forecast period a financing plan that should indicate the amount of external
financing and the appropriate mix of equity and debt, and if possible the
potential sources of financing. The covenant also requires that PLN's
development plan, and related financl   forecast and financing plan will be
reviewed and adopted by its Board, and that these plans and the forecast will
be submitted to and discussed with the Government and the Bank. Technical
assistance is being provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan
3097-IND) to help develop further the financial planning function in PLN
(para. 4.5).
6.23      PLN is authorized by its charter to borrow from local and foreign
lenders and to issue its own obligations. However, in line with its policy
for all State Corporations, the Government secures all foreign borrowings on
behalf of PLN and bears the foreign exchange risk. Until the Power
Transmission Project (Loan 2778-IND) approved in January 1987, the onlending
rate included a fee of only 0.25 percent over the Bank's standard variable
interest rate to cover the administrative charges. In line with the Bank's
objective of gradually adjusting the onlending rate to a level (including the
foreign exchange risk) comparable to one that would apply if the loan was made
directly to PLN, fees were increased in steps to 2.5 percent under the Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) approved in March 1990, towards
covering the administrative charges and the foreign exchange risk that would
be borne by the Government. For the proposed project, the GOI has agreed to
charge PLN fees of 3.5 percent over the Bank's standard variable interest rate
on the loan (para. 5.14).
Asset Revaluation
6.24      PLN's assets have been revilued periodically.  The last detailed
revaluation was done in 1979/80 as required of all public corporations under
instructions of the Ministry of Finance. The revaluation was recorded in the
books and was accepted by the Bank. Fixed assets acquired after March 31,
1979 are appraised at cost. Following the currency devaluation in September
1986, the Government issued Regulation No. 45/1986 dated October 2, 1986,
providing for the revaluation of assets of businesses and public corporations,
acquired through September 12, 1986. The Regulation specifies the annual
revaluation factors for the years 1970 to 1986 for adjusting the asset values
as of January 1, 1987, and corporations had until December 31, 1987 to report
the revalued data. PLN has also prepared a revaluation of its assets for
1979/80-1986/87 based on the Regulation; however, it has not yet been recorded
in the books. The methodology used by PLN for asset revaluation is
satisfactory to the Bank. A covenant, under Loan 3180-IND, that requires PLN
to revalue annually its fixed assets (including work in progress and
consumers' contributions) and accumulated depreciation for the purposes of the
rate of return and break-even calculations under the revenue covenant
(paras. 6.5 and 6.10), has also been agreed under the proposed project.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Proiect Justification
7.1       As discussed in paras. 3.5 - 3.7, the demand for electricity from
PLN will outstrip its ability to supply until mid-1990s, and to avoid
continuation of supply constraints beyond 1995, PLN has accelerated the
preparation and implementation of its least-cost generation expansion program.
With the available infrastructure, and given its proximity to the load
centers, the Suralaya thermal power plant's proposed Units 5, 6 and 7 appear
early in the sequence of projects in the least-cost generation expansion
program in Java. Four coal-fired generating units of 400 MW each have already
been installed at this power plant, all of which are now in commercial
operation. The project provides for the engineering, design and construction
supervision of the additional units at the Suralaya power plant. Following
the completion of the Paiton Thermal Plant Units 1 and 2, under construction
(Loan 3098-IND), and of Suralaya Units 5, 6 and 7, additional generating
capacity will be required in Java. It is in this context that the project
includes a feasibility study to select a suitable site in West Java and
determine the optimum size and characteristics of the generating units to be
installed at the selected site. The long-term study for the transmission
network in Java is required to identify and define the conceptual framework
and specific actions that will result in a reliable and efficient transmission
network in Java to support the rapid growth in electricity demand. It will be
so designed as to build suitable capacity in PLN through the provision of
suitable software and training, to conduct similar studies.
7.2       Transmission Facilities.  PLN needs to continue to expand its
transmission facilities rapidly as part of its overall expansion program
described above. PLN has a list of large industrial customers who have
contracted over 800 MVA with PLN and have also requested an increase in
supply, and of new consumers who have contracted already nearly 450 MVA. PLN
also expects new consumers to contract for an additional 1,100 MVA in the near
future. In addition, PLN needs to build new substations and to expand
existing substations to connect new consumers or to solve overload situations.
New transmission lines will also need to be built. To attain these goals,
PLN's investment program for transmission and distribution in Java for
1990/91-1994195 is planned as follows:
1990/91  1991/92  1992/93  1993/94 1994/95    Total
--- (Constant 1989 $ million) --------
Transmission        654.2    530.9    483.4    521.9   662.8        2,853.2
and Distribution
7.3       The proposed project comprises those transmission facilities that
would be commissioned during 1993-95 and are not financed by other sources.
It will be integrated with various other transmission works that are currently
ongoing, or are being considered by PLN. Other lending agencies that are



- 40 -
involved in the financing of the program in Java include ADB, OECF, KfW, and
several other bilateral agencies.
7.4       The transmission facilities included in the proposed project are
justified on the basis of: (a) avoiding overloading in existing substations;
and (b) supplying new loads. About 41 of 61 substations, are to be expanded
for either consumer connection or avoiding overload and improving reliability.
Of the remaining 20, 2 are mobile substations and 18 are substations at new
locations to supply new loads. The project also includes 16 new transmission
lines to supply new areas, and the improvement of three existing lines through
reconductoring to increase transmission capacity and operational performance.
Transforming capacity and loading balance for the existing 150 kV and 70 kV
substations were carried out to determine operating situations. Expansion of
substations was deemed necessary when transforming loading exceeded 70 percent
of nominal transformer capacity or the substation maximum allowable loading
surpassed 120 percent of available transformer capacity during two hours with
one largest transformer unit taken out of service. Expansion of existing
substations is also to be done to keep up with load demand growth. Load flow
studies indicated the necessity of improving voltage profile, and therefore
reactive power compensation will be used to solve the problem of voltage drops
to within allowable limits and to improve power factor to satisfactory levels.
Upgrading of transmission lines is required to bring these lines within PLN's
operating criteria of thermal limit and maximum loading. New transmission
lines are needed to connect new substations to the existing grid, while new
substations are required to supply the rapid load growth arising from
industrial consumers. New underground transmission is being provided in the
heavily populated urban areas in the cities of Semarang and Yogyakarta in
Central Java to connect new urban gas insulated substations included in the
project. Mobile substations will be used in West Java as a pilot project in
either: (a) filling the gap in substation capacity needs originating from new
consumers while a stationary substation is expanded; (b) or relieving
temporary overloading in substations; (c) or replacing temporarily substation
transformer(s) taken out of service during maintenance periods to keep
continuity of supply. PLN will assess the pilot project during 1995 and
report the findings to the Bank by June 30, 1996.
Economic Rate of Return
7.5       The economic rate of return has been calculated for PLN's entire
investment program in Java for 1990/91 to 1994/95 of which the proposed
transmission component is a part. The cost flows include: (a) the
investments made prior to 1990/91 for the generation plant to be commissioned
during 1990/91-1994/95, and investments in generation, transmission, and
distribution works to be commissioned during the program period; and (b) the
incremental fuel costs, and operation and maintenance expenses associated with
the incremental sales of the program. The investment stream was converted to
economic cost by expressing the import content at cif prices and by shadow
pricing the local components.
7.6       The benefits comprise the revenues estimated from incremental energy
sales at the average rate per kWh on the basis of existing electricity rates.
The consumer surplus for residential and industrial consumers was quantified
and included as a benefit.
7.7       Annexes 7.1 and 7.2 present details of the economic analysis and
sensitivity tests. Based on the above, the internal economic rate of return
(IERR) for the investment program in Java is about 17 percent. It would fall



- 41 -
to 15 percent if investment costs increased by 10 percent. The IERR would be
about 12 percent with only revenues at average tariff in 1989/90 as benefit.
Project Risks
7.8       The main risk is the possibility of slippage in implementation due
to slow procurement actions, ineffective coordination of implementation
activities and difficulties in the acquisition of land for substations and
rights-of-way for transmission lines, that could delay the commissioning of
the power transmission facilities. Such slippage could have impact on the
electricity supply, and could delay the realization of the economic benefits
of the power transmission component. To ensure effective coordination of the
different activities during project implementation, PLN will coordinate and
monitor project implementation through its central Directorate of Construction
and will engage consultants for assistance in the engineering, design and
construction supervision of the transmission component. The risk of slippage
will be kept to a minimum through careful planning and attention to
procurement to avoid protracted procurement actions and decision-making, to
supervision of contracts, capability of manufactures to meet delivery
schedule, and of construction and erection contractors to complete the works
as scheduled. For all the land for substations and rights-of-way for critical
sections of transmission lines, PLN will submit evidence satisfactory to the
Bank that it has available the required land and rights-of-way by December 31,
1992 (para. 5.11).

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements Reached

POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Ensineering and Design for Units 5, 6 and 7
of the Suralaya Coal-Fired Power Plant
Terms of Reference for Consulting Services
Background
The demand forecast for the Java system points to the need for PLN
to construct additional generating capacity at the Suralaya Steam Power
Station. This power station, located in the west coast of Java, was
originally designed to accommodate an ultimate capacity of 3,100 MW. The
plant already has four units of 400 MW each (1,600 MW) in commercial
operation. Coal for the power plant is mined at Bukit Asam in Sumatra and
shipped over the strait to the plant site. A feasibility study and
preliminary engineering for the additional units is being carried out by PLN
with the assistance of Consultants, and a project Design Report will be
prepared that will serve as the criteria for detailed design of the plant. A
preliminary environmental assessment report on the project is also being
prepared.
Obiective of the Services
The objective of the services is to carry out project planning,
detailed engineering and design for Suralaya Units 5, 6 and 7 having a nominal
rating of 600 MW each, complete with all ancillaries and auxiliaries, and

POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Site Selection and Feasibility Study for
New Thermal Power Plant in West Java
Terms of Reference for Consulting Services
Background
The demand forecast for the Java system requires PLN to accelerate
its power development program and commission additional generating capacity
starting from 1995/96. One of the regional development planning policies of
the Government of Indonesia has been to balance the various developments
within each region, including the electric power sector. To this end, a coal-
fired power station of about 3,000 MW ultimate capacity, of which 1,600 MW is
already in operation, has been constructed on the west coast at Suralaya, a
site that was selected out of several alternate sites in West Java. Three
additional units are proposed to be added at this plant in the near future.
It is the intention of PLN to build another steam power station in West Java,
using a fuel that offers the least-cost solution, the choice being between
coal and natural gas.
Objective of the Study
The purpose of the study is to select a suitable site for a large
steam power station in West Java of about 4,000 MW ultimate capacity at the
selected site, to determine the availability of natural gas and coal as fuel
for the plant, and to compare its economic and technical merits against other
alternate sites in West Java (identified in course of the feasibility studies
conducted for Suralaya Steam Power Station), taking into account the costs of
fuel transportation and EHV transmission lines.
The study is expected to be completed in 18 months from the time of
its commencement.

POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
STUDY OF THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM IN JAVA-BALI
Terms of Reference for Consulting Services
Background
Java system is an integrated network spread out from West to Eastern
region of the island. Interconnection is performed using bulk transmission
system 500 kV whereas 150 kV and 70 kV as well are operated as regional
transmission system. The development network of Java was studied firstly in
1980. These studies introduced the Extra High Voltage (EHV) 500 kV system
which interconnect each region in Java coinciding with the operation of big
coal power plant in Suralaya (West Java). Additional studies were conducted
in 1983 with regard to the planning of new coalfired plant in East Java.
These studies concentrated on the developmernt of 500 kV network as well as 150
kVs in East Java. The latest expansion studies of Java network were performed
in 1988. These studies represented the development of 500 kV Java system when
the new coal fired plant in Central Java would be in operation.
During the last four years, PLN energy sales in Java - Bali reached
16.1 percent per annum. This growth rate is forecasted to decrease to 12
percent annually by the year 2003/04. This demand forecast requires PLN to
accelerate its transmission system development program focussing on a 500 kV
level to provide a reliable and secure service.
objective
The purpose of the study is to:
1.   Prepare a transmission system master plan for Java - Bali integrated
system to meet forecasted electric load growth up to year 2003/04;
2.   Prepare a detailed investment program for the initial five years of the
study period;
3.   Train PLN personnel in transmission planning and engineering technique.
Summary of Scope of Work
The consulting firm should do everything that is necessary to
achieve the objectives of the study. In all aspects of the work, the
consulting firm should analyze an adequate number of alternatives and support
its final recommendation with relevant technical and economic data. The

POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Project Supervision Arrangements
1.        PLN's Supervision Arrangements.  For the transmission component of
the project, PLN's central Directorate of Construction will be responsible for
coordinating and monitoring implementation, and providing quarterly reports to
the Bank on the progress of the project. The reports would cover, inter alia,
the status of project engineering, procurement, acquisition of land and
rights-or-way, environmental aspects, construction and disbursements.
Construction will be supervised by three consulting engineering firms that
will assist PLN's three transmission project construction units in West,
Central and East Java. The other technical assistance components will be
managed by PLN's Engineering Services Center and the System Planning Division
who will supervise the work of the consultants. PLN's Directorate of Finance
will be responsible for providing reports on PLN's financial performance on
rural electrification activities in Java and outside Java.
2.        Bank Supervision Inputs.  During the first two years of project
implementation, Bank supervision will involve close monitoring of the
procurement and technical assistance activities. Engineering and design work
for the Suralaya coal-fired power plant units 5, 6 and 7 will be monitored as
part of the preparation of a future Bank lending operation for that project.
Work on the site selection and feasibility for a new thermal power plant in
West Java, and the study of the long-term transmission system development will
involve close guidance and follow-up.during its implementation, as part of the
Bank's review of PLN's expansion program for generation, transmission and
distribution, to ensure least-cost development.
3.        The Bank staff resources to supervise the project would be about ten
staff weeks per year for the first two years of project implementation, and
would require about three supervision missions each year; thereafter Bank
staff resource requirements would decline gradually to about six staff weeks
and two supervision missions per year. Most of the field supervision
activities would be carried out in conjunction with the supervision of other
ongoing power projects and the processing of future lending operations.

Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts
1.        Inflation has been taken into account as followst
(a)  for foreign costs (ineluding indirect foreign costs, excluding
fuels), 3.6 percent per annum in 199U and each year thereafter; and
(b) for local costs (excluding indirect foreign costs and fuels) at 6.5
percent per annum in 1990-1991 and 6 percent per annum in 1992 and
each year thereafter.
2.        Separation of accounts of PLN's operations in Java and outside Java
is based on individual accounts maintained by PLN for each of its regional
units. These accounts are separate except for overhead expenses, which, for
the purposes of financial projections, have been allocated proportionately on
the basis of unit sales of energy. In the financial projections, consumers'
contributions have also been allocated in a similar manner.
3.        Energy sales are based on the sales forecasts that have been agreed
for the planning of PLN's system expansion program.
4.        Revenues for FY90/91 are based on the estimated actual average
revenue per unit sold in that year. The tariff is adjusted by 20 percent in
FY91/92, effective July 1, 1991, and thereafter annually by 4 percent to
absorb the impact of increases in operating costs (other than fuel, and
salaries and wages), and on the rate base assumed in the financial forecasts.
Efficiency gains are assumed to be internalized to improve the financial
performance of PLN so that it can undertake an increasing percentage of self-
financing of its rapidly growing investment program.
5.        Fuel/bulk power for FY90/91 is based on the budgeted quantities, and
for FY92/93 and beyond is derived from PLN's computer simulation of system
operation. The fuel costs are calculated on the basis of current domestic
fuel prices (established in May 1990) charged to PLN (245 Rp/l for diesel and
220/Rp/l for fuel oil) plus transportation costs. The fuel prices to PLN are
not escalated, on the assumption that any increases during the forecast period
will be passed on to PLN's electricity customers through its tariff.
6.        Operating expenses, other than fuel and personnel expenses, have
been forecast taking into account the facilities expected to be in use each
year, and subject to foreign and local cost inflation, as appropriate.
Personnel expenses are assumed to increase at an overall rate of 6 percent per
annum. Repair and maintenance expenses for PLN's Java and outside-Java
operations are estimated at 1.8 percent and 2.8 percent of their respective
gross fixed assets in operation during the preceding fiscal year.

7.        Depreciation is based on the application of PLN's normal rates
(straight-line method) to assets revalued annually. For purposes of corporate
income tax, the current Indonesian tax code permits the use of the accelerated
method of depreciation of assets in operation instead of the straight-line
method.
8.        Financing.  Terms of foreign borrowings are assumed to be 20 years
including 5 years' grace, at average interest rates of 11 percent per annum.
Terms of local borrowings are assumed to be 12 years including two years'
grace, at interest rates of 18 percent per annum.
9.        Capital expenditures are based on PLN's investment program
(Annexes 3.5 and 3.6) to meet the projected sales growth (para. 3 above), and
exclude costs of geothermal steam field development, which are assumed to be
incurred by another agency. The 10 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on the
foreign contracts is assumed to be borne by Government, and on the local
contracts it is assumed to by borne by PLN.
10.       Gross fixed assets, work in progress and consumers' contributions
are revalued annually, up to FY86/87 according to Government Regulation No.
45/1986, dated October 2, 1986, and from FY87/88 onwards, according to
weighted annual escalation rates (foreign and local). The rate base is the
average of the revalued net fixed assets in operation, less revalued
consumers' contributions. The rate base does not include work in progress.
11.       Customer accounts receivables are assumed at about 40 days of energy
revenues.
12.       Transmission and Distribution (T&D) system losses are estimated to
be about 15.4 percent for Java and 18.4 percent for outside Java in FY90/91,
and are assumed to decline gradually thereafter to about 14.3 percent and 16.5
percent, respectively in FY95/96.
13.       Substitution of fuel oil in the existing oil-fired plant at Gresik
in Java by natural gas is assumed to be completed in two phases during
FY90/91-FY92/93 when gas-based generation is projected to account for about 20
percent of total energy generation in Java.
14.       For PLN's operations outside Java, implementation of an action plan
to improve the efficiency of those operations (e.g., reduction of T&D system
losses) and to reduce costs, is assumed for the forecast period.
15.       All projections are net of Corporate tax.  Based on the current
Indonesian tax code, PLN does not expect to pay any corporate income tax
during the projection period.
