                         The development objective of the Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project (LKEMP) is to put in place a series of medium-term measures to ensure the
                         long-term conservation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and upstream catchments area. At the national level, the project has the objective of supporting the
                         development of a coordinated and consistent legal and institutional framework for environmental and water resources management and strengthening of
                         ecosystem monitoring and assessment functions of the environmental institutions in Tanzania.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation of project activities continues to be satisfactory. Preliminary results of the KST to native species transmission experiments have indicated that KST are free of
                         diseases. Kihansi gorge restoration activities are progressing well. The spray and moisture levels in and the condition of the -wetland vegetation in the spray wetlands are in good
                         condition. The final water right conditions for operating the Kihansi hydroelectric power facility have mostly been met, and environmental flows from bypass releases and sprinkler
                         systems have been maintained. Vegetation and food colony have been establishment in the 28 outfitted cages in Kihansi facility and the first population of 60 KST were transferred to
                         Kihansi on June 28, 2011. The current population of the KST at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) captive breeding facility is more than 500 adults. As of August 31, 2011 the
                         captive population of KST at the Toledo and Bronx zoos is approximately 6000.
