                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project (LKEMP) is to put in place a series of medium-term measures to ensure the
                         long-term conservation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and upstream catchments area. At the national level, the project has the objective of supporting the
                         development of a coordinated and consistent legal and institutional framework for environmental and water resources management and strengthening of
                         ecosystem monitoring and assessment functions of the environmental institutions in Tanzania.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         well, the current population is about 220, which is more than the twice the number of KST brought back from the US in August 2010. Support to the captive breeding in the US zoos

                         actions necessary for transferring the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) to the captive breeding facility at Kihansi and then back to the Kihansi Gorge are in good progress. A critical KST-to-
                         native species disease transmission experiment has been designed along with protocols and a budget.
