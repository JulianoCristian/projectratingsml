    long-term conservation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and\n            upstream catchments area. The closing date for the project\n            will extended from December 31, 2010 until June 31, 2011.\n            Overall implementation of project activities has been\n            satisfactory and the project development objective continues\n            to be achievable. Major achievements of the project to date\n            include: (i) development of research and monitoring\n            protocols for Kihansi Gorge ecosystem; (ii) conserved\n            biodiversity and ecological integrity of Kihansi Gorge\n            through a series of impact mitigation measures and\n            continuous monitoring of the impact area status of fauna and\n            flora; (iii) interventions have been established for\n            community conservation and livelihood support for upstream\n            catchment management with the aim of protecting of both\n            water quantity and quality of the Kihansi river waters; (iv)\n            local expertise and capacity built in areas of water\n            resources and conservation biology (especially of\n            amphibians); and (v) establishment of a captive Kihansi\n            Spray Toad (KST) population in Tanzania, an important\n            milestone in the process of reintroducing KST back to the\n            wild in the Kihansi Gorge."}, "docdt": "2010-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
