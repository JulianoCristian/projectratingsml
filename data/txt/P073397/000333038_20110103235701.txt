                      LOAN/CREDIT IDA 3546-1 TA

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.     In a letter from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs dated June 8, 2010
the Borrower has requested that the closing date for the Tanzania Lower Kihansi
Environmental Management Project , [Credit No. IDA 3456-1 TA], P073397 be extended
from December 31, 2010 until June 31, 2011.

2.      Since this extension would go beyond the three-year implementation limit
stipulated by OP/BP 13.20 Additional Financing, an approval for a policy waiver was
sought from Vice President, OPCS to enable this extension which is critical to complete
successful reintroduction of the nearly extinct Kihansi Spray Toad in the wild. The
waiver was granted on December 21, 2010.

3.      Background: Through the Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project
(LKEMP), the Government of Tanzania is actively supporting the re-introduction of the
nearly extinct Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) into its natural habitat in the Kihansi Gorge in
Tanzania. The Kihansi Spray Toad (KST), Nectophrynoides asperginis, is endemic to 2.0
hectares of spray zone in the Kihansi Gorge of south-central Tanzania The toad was first
discovered in 1996 living in micro-habitat created by the spray of waterfalls in the
Kihansi Gorge. The population of KST declined following the operation of a hydropower
plant in 1999 (built with financing from the World Bank, NORAD, Sida, and KfW) that
led to a diversion of water from the Kihansi River, which drastically reduced the mist
zone in which the toads thrived.

4.      LKEMP was designed as a response to concerns raised by the Government,
academics, and environmental NGOs, which were seeking a more aggressive action in
reducing the downstream threat to habitat loss as a result of the Kihansi Hydropower
Project. The project was prepared in 2001 as one the Immediate Rescue and Emergency
Measures (IREMS) to mitigate the ecological impacts from the hydropower plant to the
Kihansi Gorge ecosystem. As part of the rescue measures, a decision was made by the
government with support from its development partners to establish a captive breeding
facility program for KST as an insurance policy in case the KST became extinct in the
gorge. In this regard the government translocated 499 individuals into captivity in the
U.S.A. In addition, an artificial spray irrigation system was constructed to mimic the pre-
diversion spray generated by waterfalls in the gorge, essential to maintain the spray
wetlands. Subsequently, the KST population totally disappeared in 2004 and in 2009 the
toad was declared to be extinct in the wild by the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

5.     The Project Development Objectives of LKEMP is to put in place a series of
medium-term measures to ensure the long-term conservation of the Kihansi Gorge
ecosystem and upstream catchments through the development of a coordinated and

                                            3
consistent legal and institutional framework for environmental and water resources
management. This development objective was expected to be achieved through the
implementation of four project components: (i) habitat and species conservation and
management; (ii) establishment of the final water right; (iii) development and
implementation of an updated environmental management plan; and (iv) capacity
building and institutional strengthening.

6.     The Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project (LKEMP) was approved
on July 3, 2001 in the amount of SDR 5.0 million and became effective on September 18,
2001. The Closing date of the original Credit has been extended thrice, the first extension
was up to June 30, 2007, the second was to December 31, 2007 and the third was to
December 31, 2010 with an Additional Financing in the amount of SDR 2.3 million.
Additional financing was provided to enable the government to fill a financing gap that
was caused by the mortality of toads both in the wild and in captive population world-
wide due to the prevalence of Chyrtid fungus. Additional financing focused on
outstanding issues with regard to the re-introduction plan for KST under component 1.

7.       Overall implementation of project activities has been satisfactory and the Project
Development Objective continues to be achievable. Major achievements of the project to
date include: (i) development of research and monitoring protocols for Kihansi Gorge
ecosystem; (ii) conserved biodiversity and ecological integrity of Kihansi Gorge through
a series of impact mitigation measures and continuous monitoring of the impact area
status of fauna and flora; (iii) interventions have been established for community
conservation and livelihood support for upstream catchment management with the aim of
protecting of both water quantity and quality of the Kihansi river waters; (iv) local
expertise and capacity built in areas of water resources and conservation biology
(especially of amphibians); (v) support for the enactment of national environmental
legislation, Environmental Management Act (EMA, 2004 and several regulations) and
enforcement of environmental issues and water rights; (vi) coordination and management
of cross cutting projects and programs, using technical and policy organs such as the
Multisectoral Technical Advisory Committee (MTAC) and a steering committee set up
by the LKEMP; (vii) a successful breeding program in Bronx and Toledo Zoos in the
United States that managed to increase captive KST population to more than 6,000; and
(viii) establishment of a captive KST population in Tanzania, an important milestone in
the process of reintroducing KST back to the wild in the Kihansi Gorge.

8.      The proposed extension is necessary in order to allow time for the completion of
the KST reintroduction process. Although the first batch of one hundred KSTs was
reintroduced back to Tanzania on August 11, 2010 this population is currently housed in
a captive breeding facility at the University of Dar es Salaam, and the plan is to transfer
the toads to the Kihansi in December 2010. Due to the complexity of the reintroduction
process that has involved coordination of activities among multiple agencies internally
and externally (including Wildlife Conservation Society - WCS, Toledo and Bronx Zoo,
IUCN, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna -
CITES, US Fish and Wildlife Service, North-west University, Syracuse University), the
original timeline of having KST back in the Gorge by September 2010 has been delayed.
The situation has been exacerbated by the unforeseen requirement for CITES import and
export permit that necessitated additional test/isolation of Rana virus, that took about four

                                             4
months. As a result of the above factors, preparations for the captive breeding facility at
Kihansi and testing of the same were also delayed. The Borrower has submitted a specific
action plan, which is acceptable to IDA, to complete the project within the new extension
period. A copy of the Borrower's request for the extension and the action plan are
enclosed as Attachment 1 and 2 respectively.

9.      The Government has already taken an initiative to sustain the project activities
beyond IDA Credit by the inclusion of LKEMP activities in the workplans and budgets
for the financial year 2011/12 of key implementing sectors (NEMC, Rufiji Basin Water
Office under the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, TANESCO under the Ministry of
Energy and Minerals, the Wildlife Division under the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Tourism, and the Districts of Kilolo, Mufindi and Kilombero under PMO-RALG).
Therefore, an extension of six months will allow a smooth blending with the GoT
budgetary process and financial year.

        In addition to plans to raise funds internally, the Government is also preparing a
proposal for a follow on project under GEF 5 Allocation. Therefore the extension period
is necessary to advance the preparations of the GEF project.

10.     Given the project's potential to succeed and its critical stage for reintroduction, as
well as LKEMP's high reputational risk for the Bank, it is imperative for the task team to
continue working with the government to ensure sustainability of the project's
investments and more importantly the toad's survival.

11.     The Borrower has also requested a reallocation of a total of US $145,000 from
Category 5 (Unallocated) and Category 6b (Grants to Communities) to strengthen the
new amphibian diseases section under Category 2 (Good and Non-Consulting Services).
The propose reallocations and the revised Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Financing
are elaborated in the Attachment below.
