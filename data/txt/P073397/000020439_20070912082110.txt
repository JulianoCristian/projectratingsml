I.Introduction

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide an
additional credit in an amount o f U S 3.5 million to the United Republic o f Tanzania for
the Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project (LKEMP), Project ID number
P073397, credit number 3546-TA. The current closing date o f December 31, 2007 i s
proposedto be extended by three years to December 31,2010.

2.       The LKEMP project was designed as a response to concerns raised by the
Government, academics and environmental NGOs, which have been seeking more
aggressive action in reducing the downstream threat o f habitat loss as a result o f the
KihansiHydropower Project. The pivotal issue was the discovery of the Kihansi Spray
Toad (Nectophrynoides asperiginis) a rare species that depends upon the microclimate
produced from the Kihansi River's waterfalls. As part o f the immediate rescue and
emergency measures, a decision was made in November 2000 by the Government with
support from its development partners to establish a captive breeding program for the
Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) as an "insurance policy" in case the KST became extinct in
the gorge. Inthis regard, the Government translocated 499 KST individuals into captivity
inthe U.S.A.

3.       Additional Financing is requested to enable the Government o f Tanzania (GOT)to
fill a financing gap caused by additional issues that arose with unexpected mortality of
toads both in the wild and incaptive population due to the prevalence o f Chytrid fungus.
The need now is to determine the future of the KST captive population and whether they
can be brought back to the gorge, either for re-introduction or to move the site of the
captive breeding program. So far, conditions necessary for the reintroduction o f KST are
not right. The main constraints to achieving this objective are: (i) low population of the
captive bred KST; (ii)  unsuitable habitat due to the prevalence o f Chytrid fungus, and
invasive plant species; and (iii)declining water quality resulting from increased sediment
loads, and persistent toxic substances. These environmental problems must be addressed
prior to the reintroduction o f the captive-bred KST population into their natural habitat.
The originally envisaged activities for LKEMP undertaken properly are sufficient to
address these additional issues and achieve the Project Development Objectives.
Additional Financing will thus, enable GOTto continue implementing selected activities
in the original four components of the project, particularly on outstanding issues with
regard to the re-introduction plan for the KST under Component 1- Habitat and Species
Conservation andManagement.

11. BackmoundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancing

4.       Background: The existing LKEMP credit was approved on July 3, 2001 in the
amount o f US$6.0 million equivalent. The existing credit was declared effective on
September 18, 2001, and is expected to be fully disbursed by the current Closing Date o f
December 31, 2007. The project development objective (PDO) o f LKEMP i s to support
the Government o f Tanzania's efforts to implement a series of measures for the long-term
conservation o f the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and upstream catchment through the
development o f a coordinated and consistent legal and institutional fkamework for

environmental and water resources management.            This development objective was
expected to be achieved through the implementationo f four project components:

        Component 1 - Habitat and Species Conservation and Management - for
        financing and follow-up on the KST captive breeding efforts, developing
        monitoring protocols for the KihansiGorge ecosystem, andreintroduction o f KST
        in Tanzania, and strengthening the capacity of institutions to teach and carry out
        research inconservation biology;

        Component 2 - Establishment o f the Final Water Right for Tanzania National
        Electricity Supply Company (TANESC0)- for monitoring and enforcement o f
        final water right, establish bypass releases, and support data collection for
        hydrological model to support operations o fthe power facility;

    0   Component 3    - Development and Implementation o f an Updated Environmental
        Management Plan (EMP) - to specify conditions which bind TANESCO to
        operate the hydropower facility and to ensure compliance; and


    0   Component 4 - Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening - for
        rationalization and strengthening o f the local capacity for environment and water
        resource management. The existing development objective has not changed. The
        selected activities to be continued under the Additional Financing credit are
        intendedto enhance achievement o f the original development objective.

5.       Performance: The overall project implementation progress has been consistently
satisfactory, notably in the last 12 months.. The project is on course to meet its desired
intermediate outputs, except for the reintroduction o f the captive KST population into its
original habitat. The project met its two legal covenants: (i) updating the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) for the operation o f the Lower Kihansi Hydropower Plant
(LKHP), and the management o f the Kihansi gorge ecosystem; and (ii)       establishing the
Final Water Right for TANESCO to operate the LKHP facility. The updated EMP is
currently under implementation by various Government agencies, including TANESCO.
A final water right to divert and abstract water for TANESCO to operate the LKHP has
been established. The Rufiji Basin Water Office (RBWO) continues to monitor
compliance o f the final water right by TANESCO, and the hydrology o f the Kihansi
River. However, enforcing compliance with the provisions o f the environmental and
water laws and regulations remains weak, thereby affecting the performance o f the
project. Recent experience has shown that TANESCO has failed to maintain a minimum
bypass flow and flushing o fthe reservoir due to the recent energy crisis. This underlines
the importance o f ensuring compliance with the water right and environmental
regulations for the achievement o f the long-term development objective o f LKEMP. The
table below shows the compliance status o f LKEMP's legal covenants.

environment

6.        Support to captive breeding program for KST in the Bronx and Toledo zoos in
the USA is proceeding satisfactorily. The ecological monitoring o f the Kihansi gorge has
been sustained. The capacity building program at the University o f Dar es Salaam
(UDSM), National Environment Management Council (NEMC), RBWO, Ministry o f
Water (MW), Ministry o f Energy and Minerals (MEM), TANESCO, and Ministry o f
Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT) has beenimplemented.

7.       Rationalefor the Borrower's request: GOThas requested Additional Financing to
complete activities (as outlined in paragraph 9), which would enhance chances of
attaining the development objectives. Conserving the Kihansi Spray Toad inthe wild and
in captivity has been challenging and technically demanding.            In 2000, following the
commissioning o f the Lower Kihansi Hydropower Plant, the habitat o f the KST
decreasedby 92% resultingina rapid decline innumber o f toads inthe gorge from a high
o f about 50,000 to 12,000. In addition to the trans-located 499 KST individuals into
captivity in the USA, a series o f emergency mitigation measures were initiated in 2000
under the Immediate Rescue and Emergency Measures Project (IREMP) to conserve the
spray wetland habitat and the KST in situ. These included constructing an artificial spray
irrigation system to mimic the pre-diversion spray generated by waterfalls in the gorge,
essential to maintaining the spray wetlands; conducting studies o f the KST; and
constructingwalkways.

8.       Initially, the artificial spray irrigation system proved highly successful in
enhancing the KST population inthe gorge. Between2000 and 2003, the KST population
grew to more than 21,000 individuals. However, this success was short-lived. InAugust
2003, over a three-week period, the population o f the KST precipitously declined to
fewer than 50 individuals. The last documented sighting of the KST inthe Kihansi gorge
was in May, 2005. It is believed that the sudden decline o f the KST population was a
result o f any o f the following factors: (i)chytrid fungus, an exotic fungus that is
decimating amphibianpopulations worldwide; (ii)        accidental release o f toxic substances
that had accumulated in reservoir sediments, and discharged on the spray wetlands in
August 2003, during a high flow releases study; and (iii)         combined effects o f Chytrid
fungus, and toxic substances released during the high flow releases study. In order to
address the above problems, the project has been carrying out a series o f scientific
studies, including regular monitoring at the gorge focusing on riverine system, water
quality, floral and fauna at the Gorge and its upstream catchment areas. While the
ecological monitoring at Kihansi Gorge has highlighted changes in the structure and

abundance o f habitats and species, little i s known about the drivers o f these changes.
These studies will be continued duringthe Additional Financing period. The project will
also provide support for studying and monitoring o f Chytrid fungus in the gorge.
Nevertheless, the recent positive population growth trend in the captivity i s very
encouraging.     Assuming that the captive population in USA zoos continues to
approximately double annually, there should be a sufficient number o f toads available to
establish a captive population in Tanzania by March 2008. However, given the technical
and institutional complexity o f increasing the population of KST in captivity and
conserving the Kihansi gorge ecosystem, additional time and resources are required in
order to meet the critical development objective o f putting in place a series o f medium-
term measures to ensure the long-term conservation o f the Kihansi gorge ecosystem and
upstreamcatchment.

9.      In view of the foregoing discussion, the restoration of the Kihansi gorge
ecological integrity is a necessary condition for the reintroduction o f the captive KSTs
into their natural habitat. This can only be achieved if Additional Financing i s approved
to support the: (i)captive breeding program in the U S A zoos to increase the KST
population to a level that could be translocated into the wild, re-introduction plan o f the
KST to the natural habitat, and establishment o f the local facility at Kihansi site; (ii)
monitoring o f the Kihansi gorge ecosystem, both flora and fauna, and water resources;
(iii)community-based sustainable land management investments in the upstream
catchment, which were introduced at mid term as part o f Component 1, with the aim of
improving both the water quality and quantity, and maintain a healthy Kihansi gorge
ecosystem; and, (iv) capacity building o f the RBWO, NEMC, and other concerned
institutions to enforce final water right compliance by TANESCO, and other water users.
Capacity buildingto NEMC will include project management training.

10.      Country Context: In order to ensure sustainability, the Government of Tanzania
has developed an exit strategy, which entails mainstreaming o f LKEMP activities into the
normal operations o f the concerned implementing agencies. The exit strategy identifies
six project thematic areas and the lead and supporting agencies responsible for these
areas. As a commitment to the proposed extension, the GOThas budgeted TZS 250
million (US$ 215,000) in the FY2006/07 budget as counterpart funds to support project
activities. The Government has also adopted an Environmental Management Strategy that
emphasizes the conservation o f river catchments, including Kihansi gorge, which i s quite
critical in water resource management. Inthis regard, continued support to the on-going
community-driven investments inthe Kihansi river catchments to enhance water quality
and quantity will also set precedence for other river basins management, including the
Bank-supportedWater Sector Development Project.

111. ProposedChanges

11.     There are no changes proposed to the project development objectives. The major
points o f departure from the original project and the focus o f the Additional Financing
will be on the following aspects:

        Component I - Habitat and Species Conservation and Management, which
        entails:

        (i)      Species and Habitat Conservation        -   building local captive breeding
                 capacity, developing a recovery plan for the re-introduction o f the Kihansi
                 Spray Toad (KST) species into its natural habitat, restoration and
                 maintenance o f the KST species natural habitat, while at the same time
                 support the USA captive breeding facilities, and continue monitoring of
                 key ecological parameters;

        (ii) ImplementationoftheLandscape-WideConservationPlan(LWCP)
                 for the Kihansi River Catchment - supporting community-based
                 interventions for the upstream catchment management, with the aim of
                 protecting bothquantity and quality o f the Kihansi river waters, and,

        (iii) Capacity Building for
                 EnvironmentalQuality and Water Resource Management -
                                                 Enforcement        and     Compliance of
                                                                                      support
                 for monitoring the final water right compliance and hydrology o f the
                 Kihansi river; and capacity buildingactivities at the key institutions.

        The closing date o f the Additional Credit would be extended by three years, from
        December 31,2007 to December 31,2010. Annexes A and B show the summary
        o f project costs and detail project costs o f the Additional Credit respectively.
        Annex C shows the proposed Schedule 1and the percentage of expenditures to be
        financed. The procurement planfor the extended period i s attached as Annex D.

12.     Institutional Arrangements:      The institutional arrangements during the project
extension will remain the same. The National Environment Management Council
(NEMC) under the Vice President's Office will remain the host and lead coordinating
institution o f the project. A senior officer from its existing core staff has been appointed
to coordinate the project implementation, andwill report to the Director General, through
the Director o f Research.

13.      Procurement and Financial Management Arrangements:              Measures to further
improve the capacity o f NEMC on project management have been incorporated under
this Additional Financingproposal. Project financial arrangements will be mainstreamed
within the existing NEMC financial systems. Training on the financial and procurement
management, using Bank Guidelines and Procedures, will be offered to staff handling
project financial transactions and procurement contracts. So far, the NEMC accountant
and procurement officer have received basic training on the Bank's financial and
procurement management aspects, respectively.

14.      Procurement: All procurement o f goods/equipment, works, and consultancy
services under the additional credit will be undertaken in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRDLoans andIDA Credits" dated May 2004;
revised October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004; revised October 2006, and the provisions
stipulated in the Legal Agreement. Under the current project, project management,
including procurement arrangements, was handled by a Project Implementation Unit
(PIU). However, project management responsibility, including procurement under the
Additional Financing, will be mainstreamed within the existing National Environmental
Management Council (NEMC). An assessment o f the capacity o f NEMC to carry out
procurement actions was conducted in July 2007 and revealed weak capacity. Thus, the
overall project procurement risk continues to be rated as High. Mitigation measures
proposed to address the high procurement risk include training o f existing NEMC
procurement staff on procurement o f goods, works and consultancy services; establishing
a Procurement Management Unit; hiring o f a short term procurement specialist; training
staff on procurement filing and record keeping; provision o f adequate space for storage o f
procurement records; and establishing o f a proper contracts register. Actions to
strengthen procurement capacity, including staff training, were completed in August,
2007. Between September and December 2007, the Borrower intends to train additional
procurement staffwho will handle procurement under the Additional Financing.

15.      FinancialManagement:With effect from January 1, 2007, NEMC has taken full
control o f the financial management o f the project, formerly the responsibility o f a
Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The financial management assessment is, therefore,
based on the performance o f the current mainstreamed project financial management
arrangement, commitment by the GovernmenthEMC to implement recommendations
arising from the last project audit report and financial management mission, and the steps
taken by NEMC in supervising project financial activities under the mainstreaming
arrangement. Inaddition, a more recent review o f NEMC financial management systems
indicated that NEMC has adequate capacity to manage project funds.

16.      InMarch2006, anSOEreview ofthe former PIUidentifiedweak internalcontrol,
lack o f internal audits and failure to meet counterpart funding requirements, which
amounted to US$ 70,000. The Government was requested to refund to the Special
Account the ineligible expenditure for cost incurred due to delayed contribution o f the
counterpart funding. The refund o f US$ 70,000 was done by NEMC in October, 2006.
Subsequently, a December 2006 Bank Financial Management mission review found the
PIU had used an additional US$25,698.80 from the special account to meet counterpart
fund requirements.     The Government has confirmed that the above amount will be
refunded inthree installments' by the end o fDecember 2007.

17.     With effect from January 1, 2007, following NEMC's taking over o f full control
o f the financial management responsibility o f the project, project internal controls have
been strengthened, and internal audit unit i s now carrying out review o f the project funds.
This included visits to the districts o f Kilolo, Mufindi and Ifakara to audit community
grant schemes. N E M C has also addressed all issues raised in the last FY audit report.

However, as indicated above, the refund o f US$ 25,698.80 arising from lack o f
counterpart fundsLisstill outstanding, but the Government has confirmed to refund the
above amount by the end o f December 2007. As indicated inpara. 21 below, NEMC has
set aside adequate project funds intheir current budget allocation to cover for counterpart
funding. The Bank fiduciary team will continueto regularly monitor the financial aspects
o f the project andprovide capacity buildingas needed.

18.      The latest supervision report o f the project has rated the Financial Management
performance as satisfactory.

19.      Disbursements from the additional IDA Credit will follow the current pattern
under LKEMP, i.e. they will follow the Transaction-based disbursement procedures. The
external audit will be carried out annually by the National Audit Office. The auditor will
be required to express an opinion on the audited LKEMP financial statements and the
Designated Account (Special Account) in compliance with International Standards on
Auditingandsubmit the audit report within six monthso fthe end o fthe financial year.

20.
...      Standard financial covenants include the submissionto IDA of:
     Annual LKEMP audited financial statements within six months after the end o f the
     financial year.
     Agreed Interim un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs) within 45 days after each mid
     year, and shall cover such midyear project progress.
     Other related information as required by IDA Financing Agreement.
LKEMP is incompliance with all financial management covenants as per the DCA.

21.      Fundingof Activities Under Mainstreaming:Inthe current financial year, the
Government will provide a total o f US$ 117, 646 as contribution to project activities.
NEMC has set aside Tsh. 20 million (equivalent to US$ 15, 686), and the Ministry o f
Energyand Minerals will provide the balance o fTsh.130 million (equivalent to US$101,
960). The Government budget will cater for counterpart funding, mainstreaming of
project activities within the implementing sectors and co-finance activities under three
priority thematic areas, including: management o f natural resources and infrastructure in
the Kihansi Gorge, ecosystem monitoring and assessment, and management o f captive
KST population.

IV. Consistencvwith the CAS

22.      The current Tanzania Joint Assistance Strategy (TJAS) recognizes environmental
management as a cross-cutting issue, and mainstreams it in the planning of all sectors.
Special emphasis is given to the management o f water resources, including priority
catchments; and the sustainable natural resources utilization. TJAS underscores the links
between environmental degradation and rural poverty, and acknowledges that the most
effective way o f reducing rural poverty i s to invest in sustainable natural resources
utilization. LKEMP has already started implementing the LWCP, which uses matching
grants to support community-based natural resources management in the Kihansi River
catchment.

V. ExpectedOutcomes

23.     The Results Framework and the monitoring arrangements are consistent with
those adopted for the original project. The indicators used to assess the outcomes o f the
Additional Financing are consistent with the indicators included in original LKEMP
project. There will be no change in the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the PDO
(outcomes). The targets have however been revised upwards and intermediate outcome
indicators expanded to make them more relevant to the activities under the Additional
Financing and the extension o f the project closing date by three years to December 31,
2010. The updated Results Framework is presented inAnnex F.

VI. ProiectBenefits

24.     The Additional Financing would be necessary to enable the project realize the
outcomes o f investments made, and to fully achieve its development objectives. By this
time, the original project was expected to have built adequate institutional capacity for
long term conservation o f the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and the upstream catchments.
However, due to limited financial resources available under the project, this capacity was
not filly developed.

25.     The Additional Financing will continue to provide for the long-term conservation
and management o f the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem. The project's financial and technical
support will serve to strengthenthe capacity o f agencies with environmental management
responsibilities to identi@ critical issues related to habitat protection, and the strategies
which would be undertaken to mitigate the potential negative environmental impacts o f
development     activities.    The Additional Financing will continue to support
implementation o f the national institutional and legal framework for environmental
management.

26.    At the ecosystem level, the Additional Financing will assist in improving the
environmental conditions in the Gorge, and will improve the understanding about the
management o f critical habitats inareas o f highbiodiversity inTanzania. The Additional
Financing will be used to reduce the stress on the regulating services and facilitate the
long-term conservation o f the flora and fauna in the Gorge. Additional benefits will
include implementation o f sustainable land management practices (afforestation,
integratedpest management, water-saving irrigation, etc.) by the communities, which will
generate additional income, improve their livelihoods, andreduce poverty.

VII. FinancialTerms andConditionsfor the AdditionalFinancing

27.     Financial terms and conditions, including financial management, reporting, and
disbursement arrangements remain unchanged from those applicable to the existing
LKEMP credit. As noted in paragraph 21 above, a requirement for an incremental
counterpart fhding will be added to ensure that Government MTEF budget includes
LKEMP activities from respective implementing sectors. The other additional conditions
o f effectiveness o f the Additional Financing will be the Legal Opinion o f the Attorney
General, and that the Government has adopted the revised Project Implementation

Manual, in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank. . The expected changes include:
(i)Closing Date (to be extended to December 31, 2010); (ii)      replacing the table in
Schedule 1 to reflect the amounts and financing percentages to be disbursed under
Additional Financing; (iii)
                         Procurement to be under new IDA procurement guidelines o f
2004 (as revised in 2006); and, (iv) applicability o f the Bank's Anti-Comption
Guidelines.

                                    ProcurementArrangements


A) General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; revised October
2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated
May 2004; revised October 2006, and the provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. The general
description o f various items under different expenditure categories are described below. For each
contract to be financed by the Loadcredit, the different procurement methods or consultant
selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, andtime
frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementationneeds andimprovements ininstitutional capacity.

Procurement of Works: Civil Works procured under this project, would include construction o f
biosecure captive breeding facilities for toads. The procurement will be done using the Bank's
Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB and National SBD agreed with (or satisfactory to)
the Bank.

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include specialized shipping
containers for the captive breeding centres; motor vehicles; teaching materials and scientific
equipment for the University o f Dar es Salaam (UDSM); office furniture and office equipment for
Dar office andKihansi research station. The procurementwill be done usingthe Bank's SBD for all
ICB andNational SBD agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank.

Procurementof non-consultingservices: Non-consulting services to be procured under the project
include: Venues for conferences and workshops will be procured using the Borrower's
administrative procedures and inaccordance with Public Procurement Act (PPA) no. 21 o f 2004.

Selection of Consultants,Training and Audit Costs: Consulting firms and Individual Consultants
will be selected to provide consultancy services. Main consulting services to be financed by the
project include: Management o f captive Kihansi Spray Toad (KST); Studies to create a disease free
captive KST population/ chytrid immunity; Pathological examination o f KST tissues; Management
o f W C N subcomponent;        Drafting o f additional regulations,      guidelines and notices for
implementation o f Environmental Management Act; Design and supervision services o f civil works;
and Carrying out o f Financial Annual Audits. Individual consultants would be selected on the basis
o f their qualifications inaccordance with Section V o f the Consultant Guidelines. Single source may
be used where it can be justified and after consultation with the Bank. Short lists o f consultants for

services estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f
national consultants inaccordance with the provisions o fparagraph2.7 o fthe Consultant Guidelines.

OperationalCosts: The Project will finance the operating costs of NEMC that relate directly to the
Project Implementation. The Project's operating costs will include: maintenance o f goods/equipment
such as vehicles, and computers; fbel; office supplies; communication costs; authorized travel
expenses including per diems related to monitoring and data collection efforts, but excluding salaries
o f officials o f the Recipient's civil service. These will be procured using the Borrower's
administrative procedures and inaccordance with Public Procurement Act (PPA) no. 21 of2004.

Grants: Grants for subprojects to be financed by the project will be in accordance with the
procedures inthe Project Implementation Manual(PIM).

B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

Procurement o f works and goods and selection o f consultants i s carried out under the office o f
Administration and the Supplies Officer is responsible for day to day procurement o f NEMC. The
Supplies officer reports to the Chief Administrative Officer. NEMC has not yet established an
independent Procurement Management Unit (PMU) as required by the Public Procurement Act
(PPA) no. 21 o f 2004. However, NEMC has a Tender Board (TB) established in accordance with
the PPA. The TB i s responsible for processing bids @e., approval o f the bidding documents,
advertising, receipt and opening o fbids) as well as adjudicating contract award.

An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for
the project was carried out by Donald Mneney in July 2007.             The assessment reviewed the
organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the project's staff
responsible for procurement and the NEMC's relevant central unit for administration and finance.

The procurement section has two (2) procurement staff.         The assessment has revealed that two
officers are involved in procurements at NEMC and have acquired adequate experience in
procurement o f goods. However, it was noted that the staff lack adequate experience on procurement
o f works, and consultancy services. The staff will need further training in procurement o f works,
