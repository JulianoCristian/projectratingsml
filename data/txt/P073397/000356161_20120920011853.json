        Environmental Management Project for Tanzania were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: a fundamental lesson is not to ignore\n            downstream impacts when large infrastructure or hydropower\n            projects are undertaken in sensitive ecosystems. It is good\n            practice for the Bank to support development of improved\n            Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) legislation and\n            capacity as part of implementation of infrastructure or\n            hydropower projects. Preventing the potential extinction of\n            an endangered species is an exceedingly complex task; it is\n            costly because of the scientific uncertainty regarding the\n            processes involved. Considerable time is needed to respond\n            to unexpected events such as diseases, mortality, and\n            predators, which can wipe out whole populations even in\n            captivity. When environmental impacts involving scientific\n            uncertainty need to be addressed, it is prudent to involve\n            partners from the scientific community early in the project\n            cycle. Internalization of environmental management plans\n            within the developer's operating principles and\n            framework is good practice."}, "docdt": "2011-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
