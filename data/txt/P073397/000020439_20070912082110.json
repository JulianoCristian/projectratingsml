response to concerns raised by the Government, academics and\n            environmental NGOs, which have been seeking more aggressive\n            action in reducing the downstream threat of habitat loss as\n            a result of the Kihansi Hydropower Project. Additional\n            Financing is needed to ebable the Government of Tanzania\n            (GOT) to fill a financing gap caused by additional issues\n            that arose with unexpected mortality of toads both in the\n            wild and in captive population due to the prevalence of\n            Chytrid fungus. There are no changes proposed to the\n            original project development objectives. The major points of\n            departure from the original project and the focus of the\n            Additional Financing will be on the following aspects:\n            building local captive breeding capacity, developing a\n            recovery plan for the re-introduction of the Kihansi Spray\n            Toad (KST) species into its natural habitat, restoration and\n            maintenance of the KST species natural habitat, while at the\n            same time support the USA captive breeding facilities, and\n            continue monitoring of key ecological parameters; supporting\n            community-based interventions for the upstream catchments\n            management, with the aim of protecting both quantity and\n            quality of the Kihansi river waters; and, support for\n            monitoring the final water right compliance and hydrology of\n            the Kihansi river; and capacity building activities at the\n            key institutions."}, "docdt": "2007-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
