Participatory Stakeholder Framework (PSF)
for Nepal Health Sector Project (NHSP)
This is a participatory stakeholder framework (PSF) for the stakeholders of the Nepal Health Sector
Project (NHSP). The primary focus of the PSF is on the participation of the four target groups (i.e.
women, children, indigenous people and Dalit) in the Essential Health Service Package (EHSP)
envisaged in the NHSP which is to be delivered at the village level. The PSF briefly dwells upon: i.
legal and socio-cultural milieu; ii. stakeholder identification; iii. participation and implementation
measures; iv. formal and informal consultations; v. participatory monitoring and evaluation; and vi.
recommendations.
1. Legal and socio-cultural milieu
The identity of Nepal is the co-existence of plural cultures, races, and religions. Nepal has two major
racial groups-Caucasoid and Mongoloid. Though these racial groups have cross-influenced each
other, they practice distinct cultural and religious systems. The indigenous people (IP) targeted in the
NHSP belong to the Mongoloid race, while the Dalit come from the Caucasoid race. The women and
children groups come from both the races. This means the EHSP users, NHSP policy makers, and
EHSP providers-come from both the races. The IP groups under the Mongoloid race (such as
Gurung, Magar, Tamang, Kirant) tend to follow Buddhism, animism and Christianity, while the caste
groups under the Caucasoid race tend to follow Hinduism, Jainism, Islam and Christianity. The
Hindus live in a hierarchic social structure-Bahun/Chhetri at the top and Dalits at the bottom-while
the IP groups live in a horizontal social structure. However, a couple of recent studies have indicated
intra-group hierarchic social structures (Gautam 1995 ; Gurung 1996) pertaining to Dalits and IPs.
The Constitution of Nepal 1990 provisions for making no distinction on grounds of caste/ethnicity
(race), creed, religion, language and gender. The Constitution commits to protect, preserve and
promote all these plural characteristics of the people. Similarly, the Local Self-Governance Act
(LSGA) 1999 too provisions for the protection, preservation and promotion of different languages,
religions and cultures. The three local governments-Village Development Committees (VDCs),
Municipalities, and District Development Committees (DDCs)-have been given full duties and
responsibilities, but very limited power to make decisions to meet their duties and responsibilities
(LSGA 1999). After the restoration of multiparty democracy, and declaration of the democratic
Constitution of Nepal 1990, the Nepali society has sought to be open, flexible and inclusive in terms
of race, religion, language and gender. The government has set up a National Committee for
Development of Nationalities (1996), which has recognized 61 indigenous nationalities in Nepal
(NCDN 2003). The Foundation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities (FDIN) has recognized
59 indigenous people's groups (IP groups) in Nepal (FDIN 2003). Both the Ninth Plan (1997-2002)
and the Tenth Plan (2003- 2008) have distinctly focused on the development of IP groups, Dalits and
women. The major focus of the Tenth Plan is on poverty reduction of the marginalized/underserved
populations of all groups and gender. Despite the recent developments, the IPs, Dalits and women
depict deep rooted negative impact of the discriminatory legal provisions codified in the Muluki Ain of
1853 (Civil Code of Nepal 1853). The power structure is based on the hierarchic structure of the state

and the different caste-ethnic groups. All along the history, the power share with the women, Dalit and
IP groups has been very imbalanced in Nepal, and this has negatively affected these groups'
participation in education, health, and income-generation programs, more in the rural areas than in the
urban areas. The power to make decisions over the distribution of resources is with the central
government and the development facilities and the basic infrastructure are concentrated in the urban
areas. Therefore, among the local governments (VDCs 3912, Municipalities 58 and DDCs 75), the
VDC governments suffer the most, where over 80% Nepalese pull on their life. These rural areas are
the homes of majority Dalits, IP groups, the children and the women. According to the Census 2001
(Central Bureau of Statistics/HMG), the female population outnumbers that of the male. The caste
groups together with the Newari language group number about 47.94% as against the IP groups
(31.28%) together with the Dalit population (15.90%) number 47.18%. The others population
category carries 4.87%. According to Gurung 2002 (based on 1991 CBS Census data), the Dalit have
3.1%, the lowest, and the IP groups have 6.2% share of the graduate population (with Bachelor and
above education), but, in terms of HDI (Human Development Indicators), among the seven different
social groups, the IP groups rank the fifth, and the Dalit groups rank the last. In this ranking, the
Newari language group ranks the first, the Bahun rank the second, Chhetri rank the third and Tarai
castes rank the fourth (Gurung 2002). Similarly, in terms of incidence of poverty, among the fourteen
different groups, in average, the Dalit groups suffer the most followed by the IP groups as against the
most comfortable position enjoyed by the Newari language group followed by the Bahun and Chhetri
groups (Gurung 2002). Among the IP groups, the Gurung report says the Gurung ethnic group has the
most comfortable position (fifth position) and among the Dalit groups, the Sarki have the most
comfortable position (eleventh position).
Recently, out of the 59 Janajatis identified by the NCDN, the government of Nepal has recognized 28
Janajatis as the disadvantaged ones. These and the Dalits together with the women and children
groups stand as the project's target groups.
2. Stakeholder Identification
Broadly, stakeholders fall into three categories-the central, district and local, and accordingly have
differential status. At the central level, there are government Ministry of Health (MOH) and
Department of Health Services (DOHS), which make and implement health policies through top-down
approach. They both are the government bureaucratic agencies that have a long experience of holding
power in their hands. This is a great multi-faceted challenge for the project right now in its effort to
deliver the essential health services package (EHSP) to its target groups of women, children, IP goups
and Dalits. The NHSP envisages the participation of NGOs, private sector (e.g. drug suppliers),
DDCs, VDCs, Local Health Management Committee (LHMC), Health Posts (HPs), Sub-Health Posts
(SHPs) and others. The local level stakeholders need fresh mandate in terms of new roles and
responsibilities to judiciously deliver the EHSP to the target groups of women, children, IP groups and
Dalits at the village level. The other stakeholders are the project policy makers (central and local
governments, donors, NGOs, private sectors and political parties) at central, district and village level.
Similarly, there are the project service providers, who are the central, district and village governments
and their NGO and private sector partner organizations, at the central, district and village levels.

3.   Participation and implementation measures
There are different categories of stakeholders in the essential health service package. However, in this
participatory stakeholder framework, the focus is on the participation of a) the four grassroots user
groups (women, children, indigenous people and Dalits), and b) the service providers at the VDC level
(the LHMC, NGO, drug supplier, Health Post, and Sub-Health Post). The crux of the EHSP users'
participation is that, by all means, these grassroots stakeholders need to be represented in the
concerned central level policy committees, district level committees, and VDC level committees
Further, at the grassroots, the target users (women, children, Dalits and the IPs) need to be represented
in the Local Health Management Committee (LHMC). Besides, one needs to go further down the
ladder of the user groups' participation. The deserving households/families from Dalits, indigenous
people and others need to be socially mobilized into community-based organizations and self-help
groups for their active participation at decision-making level of the project. The Terms of Reference
(TOR) for the NGOs, the private sector and the government agencies need to include the participation
of women, Dalits, IPs and those that are in a disadvantageous position at the village level. These user
groups need to have access to the service management committees.
The most marginalized or the underserved groups live under social, cultural, economic and political
barriers. They need free service with an aim to crush the complex barriers (the cycle of poverty trap).
One needs to be very careful and sensitive while dealing with the service user groups. The framework
should assign the women, children, Dalit and IP groups' CBOs/SHGs/NGOs the role to socially
mobilize their concerned groups at the village level. This gives the underserved groups a sense of
confidence, fellow-feeling, ownership and makes them feel being cared for by the State.

Participatory stakeholder framework for Nepal Health Sector Project 2004
The envisaged EHSP implementation faces some challenges: operational, organizational and security.
The operational challenge relates to power shift from the centre down to the district and from there
further down to the village.
First, the project document clearly states that all the procurement power rests, as before, with the
DOHS. Similarly, the power to make the necessary policy guidelines also rests with the DOHS and the
MOH. This power-hold at the centre is likely to cause hierarchic delay and cost ineffectiveness in the
delivery of services to the village. However, the empowerment of the local governments, the partner
private sector, the NGO, the CBO/SHG is very crucial. Not only that, but also the empowerment of
the target groups of women, children, Dalit and indigenous people is all the more important. The
target groups must be represented in the LHMC and they must be involved in the planning,
implementation, and monitoring-evaluation of the EHSP delivery. The marginalized people need to be
put in a position from where they can identify their health related issues, design implementation
measures and get to implement them. Much of the operational power needs to go to the local
governments and their partners.
Secondly, the project document lacks any program geared to enhancing the capacity of the local
governments (VDC, DDC and Municipality) and partner organizations. There is an organizational
capacity enhancement program only for the MOH and DOHS organizations at the centre, but, by all
means, the local organizations need to be strengthened, because they are the implementers and the ones
who directly deal with the primary stakeholders. For effectiveness and efficiency of the program, these
local organizations require to exhibit commitment, sense of service to those in need or those for whom the
service is intended at the grassroots. They need to be sensitive to the needs of the local level women, children,
IP groups, and Dalits.
Thirdly, there is no mention in the project document of the necessary technical as well physical
security arrangements for the unhindered delivery of the essential health services at the village level.
But this needs to be attended properly.
The implementation of the following Participatory Stakeholder Framework as envisaged is expected to
greatly contribute to mainstreaming the marginalized and underserved groups of women, children, IPs
and Dalits.
The framework on the for left column, presents the four project components with their sub-
components, as were mentioned in the project document. The middle column presents the relevant
activities that can help meet the project components. The other details such as the actual content,
priority, timing (when and how many days), costs etc are left for the implementing agencies (and the
experts they hire) to decide later as per the situation and needs. The column on the right end presents
the responsible stakeholders at central, district and village levels. This involves both primary and
secondary stakeholders.

4. Formal and informal consultations
The implementation of the Participatory Stakeholder Framework (PSF) requires both formal and informal
consultations/interactions at central, district and village level with formal and informal organizations and even
individuals.
At the central level, the stakeholders need to interact with National Women's Commission; Nepal Federation of
Nationalities; Movement for Liberation of Oppressed, Dalits and Ethnic Groups; Dalit Commission; and the
children's representative organizations like the CWIN. The consultation should be made with the central
organizations of all the political parties including the CPN/Maoist to seek their cooperation and commitment.
At the district level, interaction should be made with all the district branches of the central organizations-both
governmental and non-governmental.
At the village level, cooperation should be sought to identify the target users and to socially mobilize them into
their own self-help groups/community-based organizations.  All parties need to be oriented to the
marginalized/underserved populations irrespective of their political affiliation. In no way, multi-party politics
should be measured to divide people and drive them to cultural disintegration of the nation as is happening now.
5. Participatory monitoring and evaluation
The participatory monitoring of the project/program is a day-to-day steering activity towards the planned impact
on the life of the target groups involving the primary target groups themselves, while evaluation is a periodic
activity-mid-term or end of the project/program (Development Management Institute 2003). Monitoring is
project-internal activity, while evaluation is a project-external activity.
In case of the essential health service package's impact monitoring, there can be several layers:
The first layer of monitoring can operate at the level of target group-specific CBO/SHG which has
accountability to the service user households at the community level, and Sub-Health Posts. The second layer
can operate at the LHMC level with accountability to CBOs/SHGs, the households, the VDC, and Health Post;
the third layer can begin from VDC,HP/SHP; the fourth layer can begin from the DDC, DHO, DH; and the fifth
layer begin at the centre. This is just an indication of the importance and the necessity of the participatory
impact monitoring of the delivery of EHSP at the village level to the marginalized target groups. In order to
initiate the participatory monitoring, the project needs to develop an impact chain. The impact chain consists of
inputs, activities, outputs/services, utilization of outputs/services, and the outcomes of outputs which are the
direct benefits of project outputs/services. Above this level, the project has the attribution gap, and beyond it are
the possible indirect benefits and the highly aggregated development impact at the national level.
Participatory stakeholder framework is an important and necessary tool to ensure that the services reach the real
service users who are the underserved populations. The target groups must receive tangible benefits and occur
attitudinal change in their families, communities and the entire governance of the VDC.

priorities           indigenous medicines etc are addressed and they are benefited.
6. Recommendation
The Participatory Stakeholder Framework recommends the project to:
*   generate, analyse and utilize the baseline and development information about the geographical location,
the EHSP user population, the policy makers and the service providers;
*   introduce information and communication technologies (ICTs) at the rural level to generate and manage
baseline information about the target service users disaggregated in terns of gender, IP groups, Dalits and
children;
*   work together with the LHMC, VDC and the Health/Sub-Health Posts to generate and manage a stock of
baseline information about the EHSP users and the service providers, so that the service package would be
effectively and efficiently delivered to the deserving users;
*   address the operational, organizational and security challenges involved in the NHSP;
*   introduce the tool of participatory impact monitoring to the project;
*   introduce organizational strengthening and institutional development (OSID) to district and village level
stakeholder organizations as well; and
*   conduct social mapping and poverty mapping of the target of group locations in the villages.
*   get the village level stakeholders participate in the district and even in the central level planning and
decision-making;
*   work on tuning the mandates of all the participating agencies towards the principle of social inclusion
both at central, district and village level;
*   make the local level stakeholders accountable to the grassroots people;
*   sensitize the service provider organizations on caste and gender 'behavior'.
