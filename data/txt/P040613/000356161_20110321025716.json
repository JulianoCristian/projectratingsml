Nepal were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: ambitions and expectations for policy and\n            institutional reform under an uncertain political and\n            security environment need to be more realistic. Improving\n            access to essential health care requires comprehensive and\n            consistent tackling of key health system constraints. Any\n            project with equity related development objective needs to\n            include clear monitoring and evaluation arrangements for\n            disaggregated data. Institutional arrangements and\n            appropriate support modalities need to be identified to\n            support the health sector's advocacy role and convening\n            power in these areas that have significant health impact.\n            Management of technical assistance in parallel to pooled\n            funding support to government health program was pragmatic\n            and an effective design choice.
