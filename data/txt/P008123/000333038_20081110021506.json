The technical assistance\n            provided under this project helped define a long term plan\n            for the highways, and helped provide a framework for the\n            restructuring of the railway system. The project as\n            originally conceived was sustainable in as much as it\n            resulted in the development of a long-term program for the\n            improvement of the generally rundown highway infrastructure\n            of Uruguay, which has incidentally been followed up in the\n            subsequent highway/ transport sector projects."}, "docdt": "1993-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
