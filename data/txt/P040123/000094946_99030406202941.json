The long process leading up to\n            Peru's Debt and Debt Service Reduction operation\n            reconfirms 1) the costliness to an economy of breaking its\n            links to the international economy and adopting a\n            go-it-alone strategy; and 2) that success in reestablishing\n            international creditworthiness ultimately depends on the\n            quality of the country's macroeconomic management and\n            reforms. While the Bank and the other International\n            Financial Institutions (IFIs) can play an important\n            catalytic roles, as they did in Peruvian case, the quality\n            of the country's own program and will to implement it\n            are the decisive elements in making the operation successful."}, "docdt": "1998-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
