DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION LOAN
PERU
(Loan No. 4133-PE)
Evaluation Summary
The Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) Loan to Peru was approved on
February 11, 1997 and fully disbursed on March 6, 1997. The US$183 million DDSR Loan, in
conjunction with US$50 million set aside from the Pension Reform Adjustment Loan (PRAL)
approved at the same time, helped Peru to purchase the collateral required for implementation of
the DDSR operation agreed with its commercial bank creditors, which closed on March 7, 1997.
Together with parallel support from the IMF and IDB, the DDSR Loan financed about 47 percent
of the upfront costs of the DDSR operation. Cofinancing from the Export-Import Bank of Japan
provided coverage for an additional 7 percent of the upfront costs of the operation.
Program Objectives
The interrelated objectives of the DDSR loan were to reduce the burden of future debt
service to a level consistent with Peru's debt servicing capacity, thereby reducing market
uncertainties and encouraging the investment, both foreign and domestic, needed to sustain and
realize the benefits of Peru's economic reform efforts. The reduction of market uncertainty was
expected to be reflected in improved access to international capital and financial markets.
The DDSR operation covered more than US$10 billion of public and publicly guaranteed
debt to commercial banks and private suppliers, including contractual interest of more than US$6
billion. Creditors elected to convert 41 percent of principal into front-loaded interest-reduction
bonds (FLIRBs), 25 percent into discount bonds, and 4 percent into par bonds. The remaining 30
percent of principal was retired via buyback. Contractual interest was reduced by a recalculation
at interest rates below originally contracted levels. Remaining eligible interest was retired by
conversion into a PDI bond (61 percent), 30 percent via buyback, and 9 percent with cash
payments made before and at closing. The DDSR Loan thus enabled Peru to restructure about 40
percent of its public and publicly guaranteed debt and to reduce its face value by more than US$3
billion, not counting interest forgiveness.
Achievement of Objectives
Implementation of the DDSR operation resulted in a debt reduction equivalent (DRE) of
56 percent of the eligible debt and 11 percent of total public and publicly guaranteed debt, not
counting the estimated interest forgiveness. The projected net present value of the cash-flow
savings amounted to more than US$2 billion (3.3 percent of GDP), with an internal rate of return
of 27 percent. In addition, interest rate risk was substantially reduced by the conversion of 85
percent of the eligible debt, after buyback, into fixed-rate instruments for the next 10 years.



ii
Completion of the DDSR operation naturally reduced somewhat Peru's ability to adjust
future debt service obligations through rescheduling, as the post-operation share of bonds in the
public and publicly guaranteed debt was increased to 14 percent. Nevertheless, Peru's high
international reserves and enhanced access to external financing provides greater room for
maneuver in its overall debt management.
A principal benefit from the completion of the DDSR operation was the enhancement of
Peru's creditworthiness in the eyes of external lenders and investors. A number of indicators
over the course of 1997 suggest that the operation was achieving this objective. For example,
between the announcement of an agreement in principle with private external creditors in
October 1995 and the end of 1997, Peru's international reserves grew by more than US$4 billion,
or more than 70 percent. Capital inflows from foreign private direct investments, exclusive of
privatizations, rose steadily from a quarterly average of about US$361 million in the first three
quarters of 1995 to US$433 million from the last quarter of 1995 through the first half of 1996,
and to US$464 million from mid-1996 through September 1997. The quarterly flow of foreign
portfolio investment doubled over the same period.
Following completion of the operation, ceilings on Peru risk were raised, and term credits
as long as ten years became available after several years in which only short-term money had
been available. The share of external credit lines in the total liabilities of the Peruvian banking
system rose from 16 percent at the end of 1996 to 24 percent in November 1997, and the share of
foreign capital in the total capital of the banking system increased from 27 percent to 41 percent
during the year. Spreads on foreign loans to prime borrowers fell some 40-60 percent to as low
as 30 basis points over LIBOR. Spreads on short-tern working capital loans were reported
(before the Asian crisis) to have fallen around 1 00 basis points during 1997. By the end of the
year, Standard & Poors had upgraded its evaluation of Peruvian sovereign debt, rating it at the
same level as that of Argentina and Mexico.
GDP growth accelerated strongly in 1997, exceeding 7 percent as compared to 2.8
percent in 1996. This resurgence of growth was accompanied by falling inflation and a reduced
current account deficit. The impact of the El Nifio phenomenon will dampen this performance in
1998, but these generally positive trends should be sustainable through the end of the decade.
Bank Performance
Peru's successful DDSR operation could not have been completed without the financial
support of the Bank, IMF and IDB. The Bank's performance in bringing this operation to
fruition, including the close working relationship maintained with its IFI partners, was highly
satisfactory. A Briefing Note was sent to the Board in November 1995, one month following the
announcement of the agreement in principle between Peru and its creditors. The loan was
disbursed less than a month after Board approval and closed three weeks later. Direct costs in
the preparation and supervision of the loan totaled just over US$74,000.



Borrower Performance
The Government of Peru, under the leadership of the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
brought together an expert team of advisers and negotiators, which worked with patience and
determination to complete the DDSR operation and assure the achievement of its objectives. The
Govermment was thus successful in its strategy for restoring Peru's creditworthiness as one of the
principle elements of its reform program.
Lessons Learned
The long process leading up to Peru's DDSR operation reconfirms (i) the costliness to an
economy of breaking its links to the international economy and adopting a go-it-alone strategy;
and (ii) that success in reestablishing international creditworthiness ultimately depends on the
quality of the country's macroeconomic management and reforms. While the Bank and the other
IFIs can play an important catalytic role, as they did in the Peruvian case, the quality of the
country's own program and will to implement it are the decisive elements in making the
operation successful.



PART I: PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
1.   After the debt crisis of 1982, the Government of Peru suspended most debt service
payments to its external creditors. Arrears grew rapidly, and the moratorium was progressively
extended to debt service owed to the IFIs and to debts owed by private sector borrowers. In
1986, Peru was declared ineligible for IMF borrowing; it was placed in non-accrual status by the
World Bank in 1987 and by the IDB in 1989. Faced with the threat of expulsion, current debt
service was resumed to the IMF in mid-1 989. Nevertheless, Peru remained effectively isolated
from the international financial community.
2.   The new Government elected in July 1990 introduced a deep and comprehensive
stabilization and reform program and began initiatives to restore the country's links to the
international financial community. Arrears were cleared to the IDB in September 1991, and with
the IMF and the Bank in March 1993. Successive rescheduling agreements were reached with
Paris Club members in 1991, 1993, and 1996, the last including a multi-year restructuring
intended to eliminate the need for future reschedulings. In October 1995, the Government of
Peru and the Bank Advisory Committee, representing private, commercial creditors, announced
an agreement in principle to restructure and reduce the present value of outstanding debt and
arrears to commercial banks and suppliers.
3.   The Government requested support from the Bank, IMF, IDB, and the Export-Import Bank
of Japan (JEXIM) to help finance the up-front costs of the debt and debt service reduction
agreement (DDSR). Bank support included the US$183 million DDSR loan and US$50 million
set-aside from a parallel US$100 Pension Reform Adjustment Loan (PRAL). These operations
were approved by the Executive Directors on February 11, 1997, and the loans were signed on
February 26. The DDSR agreement between Peru and its commercial creditors was closed on
March 7, 1997. Support from the IMF included SDR 149.95 million in funds set aside from its
existing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and an SDR 71.66 million Augmentation Loan. IDB
provided a stand-alone DDSR loan of US$233 million. The JEXIM's support consisted of
US$100 million in cofinancing for the Bank's PRAL and the IMF's EFF. The remaining costs
(about US$688 million) were financed by the Government from its own resources.
4.   The interrelated objectives of the DDSR Loan were to reduce the burden of future external
debt service to a level consistent with Peru's debt servicing capacity, and thereby also to reduce
market uncertainty over Peru's ability and willingness to meet its debt service obligations. The
DDSR would thus serve to lower inhibitions to private investment, both domestic and foreign,
and enhance the country's ability to sustain its reform efforts. The reduction of market
uncertainty was expected to be reflected in improved access to international capital markets with
lengthening maturities and a falling country-risk premium on debt and an increasing flow of



2
private direct investment. This, in turn, would be reflected in strong macroeconomic
performance and would provide additional support to the reforms.
5.    Given the quality of macroeconomic management sustained over six years and the
continuing reform program, investor and lender attitudes toward Peru were already visibly
improving prior to approval of the DDSR operation, particularly as expectations rose that full
restoration of relations with creditors would soon be realized. Thus, the objectives of the Loan
were reasonable and realistic. At the same time, sustaining the reform effort was essential for
achieving the growth and poverty objectives central to the Government's program and to the
Bank's assistance strategy.'
B. Achievement of Objectives
Reduced Debt Burden
6.    The DDSR agreement covered US$10,576 million of public and publicly guaranteed debt
to commercial banks and private suppliers, including contractual interest of US$6,370 million
(Table 1).2 The menu of options for debt principal included a debt buyback and three debt
exchange instruments: a par bond, a discount bond, and a front-loaded interest reduction bond
(FLIRB). The principal amounts of the discount and par bonds were fully collateralized by the
pledge of US Treasury zero-coupon bonds; in addition, payment of six months interest on those
bonds were secured on a rolling basis by the pledge of cash or permitted investments.4 The
principal of the FLIRB was not collateralized, but six months interest was secured on a rolling
basis for the first 11 years. Contractual interest was reduced as a result of a recalculation of
interest rates. The remaining eligible interest was reduced via partial payments prior to closing,
cash payments on the closing date, and an exchange for PDI bonds. The agreement allows the
repurchase of bonds at any price and time, provided certain conditions are met by the
Government of Peru.5
Inasmuch as this was a one-tranche, fast-disbursing operation, with implementation effected at the signing of the
agreement with creditors and the simultaneous disbursement of the Loan funds, project implementation was not
an issue.
2The final figures shown here differ slightly from those foreseen at the time of the Memorandum of the President
(Report No. P-7030-PE of November 25, 1996). According to Government calculations, past due interest was
reduced, by US$2,417 million as a result of a recalculation at interest rates lower than those originally
contracted. Not included in the above figures is US$593.5 million in principal and interest exchanged in
privatization agreements.
3Details of the terms of the exchange instruments for both principal and eligible interest are given in the DDSR
MOP, op.cit., Table 1, p. 4.
4Interest collateral was based on a reference annual interest rate of 7 percent for the discount bond, and on the basis
of a gradually rising interest rate for the par bond (3 percent in years 1-15, 4 percent in years 16-25, and 5
percent in years 26-30).
5These conditions are set out in full on page 111-10 of the "Republic of Peru, Term Sheet for the 1996 Financing
Plan."

7.   From the menu, creditors elected to convert 40.8 percent of principal into FLIRBs, 24.7
percent into discount bonds, and 4.3 percent into par bonds; the remaining 30.1 percent of
principal was retired via buyback at a weighted average price of about 36 cents on the dollar. As
regards eligible interest, 60.8 percent was converted into the PDI bond, 30.5 percent was retired
via buyback, with the remaining 8.7 percent retired with cash payments before and at closing.
8.   The DDSR Loan thus enabled Peru to restructure about 40 percent of its public and
publicly guaranteed debt and to reduce its face value by US$3.2 billion, excluding forgiveness of
interest.6 The debt reduction equivalent (DRE) was US$4,551 million, or 55.8 percent of the
eligible debt7 and 11.4 percent of total public and publicly guaranteed debt (Table 2). The DDSR
operation thus achieved debt relief for Peru at a significantly lower financial cost than a market-
based debt reduction (Table 3). At 31.5 cents on the dollar, the buyback equivalent price (BEP)
was 55 percent lower than the post-deal price (PDP), a discount greater than that achieved in
most previous Brady deals.

counterfactual scenario) are shown in Table 4. The up-front costs of the agreement totaled
US$1,475 million, of which $346 million consisted of cash payments to reduce the amount of
eligible interest, $950 million to the debt buyback, and the remainder to the costs of principal and
interest collateral for the new bonds. After an initial negative impact on cash flow (-US$230
million) in the first year, compared to the counterfactual projection, annual debt service relief in
subsequent years is projected to average about US$167 million. The projected net present value
of the cash-flow savings amounted to US$2,045 million (3.3 percent of GDP), with an internal
rate of return (compared to counterfactual debt service) of 27 percent.8 In addition, interest rate
risk was substantially reduced via the conversion of 85 percent of the eligible debt (after
buyback) into fixed-rate instruments for the next 10 years.9
6 The estimated interest forgiveness is not included in the calculations of the impact of the DDSR agreement.
Inclusion of PDI forgiveness would raise the DRE estimate to 66 percent of eligible debt.
s The details of this calculation may be found in DDSR MOP, op.cit., pp. 12-13.
9 Taking post-Brady bond conversions into account, the percentage of Brady bonds outstanding with fixed interest
rates for the next 10 years has risen to 92.5.

Flexibility of Debt
10.   The DDSR agreement, coupled with the additional lending from the IFIs, resulted in an
increase in the relative exposure of IFIs (including use of IMF credit), from 20 percent of Peru's
public and publicly guaranteed debt before the agreement to 28 percent in 1997. In addition, the
post-agreement share of bonds in public and publicly guaranteed debt rose to 14 percent.
Consequently, Peru's flexibility to adjust future debt service obligations via rescheduling was
reduced. Nevertheless, Peru's high international reserves and enhanced access to external
financing (see below) provides greater room for maneuver in its overall debt management.
Access to External Financing and Investment
11.   A principal benefit expected from the completion of the DDSR agreement was the
reduction of uncertainty regarding Peru's ability and willingness to service and repay its financial
obligations. Indicators of creditworthiness in the eyes of external lenders and investors may be
signaled by changes in international reserves, trends of real interest rates in the domestic market,
and exchange rate movements. More specific indicators include the amounts, interest rates, and
repayment periods of financing available from external lenders, the number and type of lenders
and investors demonstrating willingness to commit funds to Peru, prices in international markets
of the bonds issued in the DDSR debt exchange, flows of direct and portfolio investments.
Recent developments for some of these indicators are presented in Table 5.
12.   Greater confidence on the part of savers and investors, both national and foreign, was
also expected to strengthen economic growth prospects and sustain reform efforts. Table 6
compares recent macroeconomic performance with expectations at the time of the DDSR loan.
13.   Peru's economic performance and perceptions of its creditworthiness are discussed in the
paragraphs below. It must be recognized, however, that Peru's creditworthiness, access to
external resources, and overall economic trends respond to many factors beyond the signing of
the DDSR agreement. Arriving at the agreement in the first place depended on debt holders
having become convinced of the Government's seriousness in meeting the new commitments to
be undertaken, as reflected in its negotiating positions and, more importantly, in its overall
program of macroeconomic stabilization, structural reform, and reintegration into the
international economy and financial system. At the same time that the DDSR agreement was
necessary to underpin the sustainability of the Government's economic program, it was the very
credibility of the economic program that laid the basis for the DDSR agreement and its
sustainability through time. The indicators discussed below, therefore, necessarily reflect many
factors and actions taken over time, and not just the signing of an agreement at a moment in time.
Growing appreciation of Peru's track record and related expectations of the increasing
imminence of the agreement are thus reflected in improving indicators prior to the agreement.
Reserves, capital inflows, and exchange rate
14.     Table 5 shows recent trends for international reserves, the nominal exchange
rate, domestic financial markets, and private long-term capital flows. Between the



9
announcement of an agreement in principle with private external creditors in October
1995 and the end of 1997, Peru's international reserves grew by more than US$4 billion,
or almost 70 percent. The exchange rate moved approximately in line with inflation
differentials with major trading partners between September 1995 and the beginning of
1997, remaining stable in nominal terms through the first 10 months of 1997 in reflection
of the growing capital inflows, and depreciating only slightly during the last two months
in the wake of the Asian financial crises. Capital inflows from foreign private direct
investments, exclusive of privatizations, rose steadily from a quarterly average of
US$361 million in the first three quarters of 1995 to $433 million from the last quarter of
1995 to mid-1996, and to $464 million from mid-1996 through September 1997. Foreign
private portfolio investments grew similarly, averaging quarterly US$46 million, $87
million, and $93 million, respectively, for the same periods.
Terms of external financing
15.   Available information suggests that the completion of the DDSR agreement has had a
significant impact on the terms of foreign financing to Peruvian private borrowers, despite only
small reductions so far in the high mandatory provisioning requirements demanded by bank
regulatory agencies in the originating countries, particularly in Europe. Ceilings on Peru risk
have been raised and, in contrast to two years ago when only short-term credit was available,
banks are now offering term credits, in some cases as long as ten years to prime borrowers.
External lines of credit available to the Peruvian banking system have increased significantly,
and the share of such funds in total bank liabilities rose from 16 percent to 24 percent between
end-1966 to November 1997.
16.   New sources of finance, including foreign pension and mutual funds are reportedly
entering the market. Many private borrowers are now able to access external funds directly, and
spreads to prime private borrowers have reportedly fallen by 40-60 percent, to as low as 30 basis
points over LIBOR.10 Interest rates on short-term working capital loans were reported to have
dropped about 100 basis points during 1997 (prior to the Asian financial crisis), with interest
rates on foreign trade financing falling some 25-50 basis points. By late 1997, COFIDE, the
state-owned, second tier development bank, was going to the external market for funds without
seeking a government guarantee and was attracting funds at 50-75 basis points less than a year
earlier.
17.   Another factor reportedly improving Peru's perceived creditworthiness and access to
external financing has been significant investment by foreign banks over the past year in the
local market. The share of foreign capital in the total capital of the banking system increased
from 27 percent to 41 percent during 1997. One effect of this foreign participation has been
increased competition within the banking system, reflected in falling spreads.
10 In this regard, lenders responded to Peru's improved creditworthiness more rapidly than the rating agencies, with
Peruvian borrowers being accorded better terms than similar borrowers in other Latin American countries
having higher ratings. Standard & Poor's has recently upgraded its evaluation of Peruvian sovereign debt,
rating it at the same level as that of Argentina and Mexico.

Domestic financial markets
18.    Peru's improving access to external capital has been reflected both in domestic interest
rates for foreign currency deposits and in the growth of the Lima stock exchange. As seen in
Table 5, average interest rates for dollar accounts in the commercial banks have fallen steadily
since September 1995, with the decline particularly marked for term deposits since mid-1996,
after a brief run-up in the first half of the year. The Lima Stock Exchange Index rose steadily
over the period (up some 41 percent between September 1995 and September 1997), before
being impacted by the Asia crisis. Foreign participation in the Exchange doubled from an
estimated US$2.6 billion at the end of 1995 to US$5.2 billion by September 1997.
Macroeconomic Performance
19.    The Peruvian economy went through a period of adjustment in 1996 after experiencing
very high growth rates in 1994 and 1995. The Government's demonstrated detertnination to
prevent overheating of the domestic economy, to maintain external accounts viability, and to
pursue a debt agreement with its creditors reinforced Peru's growing reputation for sound
economic management, reassured investors and the international financial community, and
established the basis for a strong economic performance in 1997 and beyond (see Table 6). GDP
growth exceeded 7 percent in 1997, compared to 2.8 percent in 1996, led by increases in exports
and rising private investment. This resurgence of growth occurred in the context of falling
inflation (below 7 percent), improved fiscal accounts, and a reduced current account deficit. The
impact of the El Nifno phenomenon is likely to dampen this performance in 1998, but these
generally positive trends should be sustainable through the end of the decade.

20.   Structural reforms have continued, albeit not at the pace of the early years of the present
Government. In addition to the reforms undertaken under the Pension Reform Adjustment Loan,
continued privatizations, particularly of the holdings of Petroperu, the state petroleum company,
enabled disbursement of the Bank's Privatization Adjustment Loan by January 1998. Other
privatizations were carried out, most notably in the mining and fisheries sectors; a new program
for the concessioning of major infrastructure investments was launched, and first steps were
taken toward the rationalization and privatization of the costly state sugar cooperatives and
coastal hydraulic projects; good start-up progress was achieved in the titling and registration of
informal urban properties; and important steps were taken to improve access to and the efficiency
of the judicial system. Progress has been less even in the trade area, with some additional
protection for the agriculture sector reducing the benefits of an overall lowering of average tariff
levels. Other pending actions for the modernization and decentralization of government and the
closing of some gaps in the legal framework--e.g., the passage of a new water law--remain to be
implemented.
C. Bank Performance
21.   The Bank, in close collaboration with the IMF and the IDB, played a key role over seven
years in the process of completing Peru's reintegration into the international economy and
financial system. In its early stages, this role consisted of assisting the Government in the design
of its stabilization and reform program and in organizing the workout of its arrears with the IFIs.
Completion of the arrears workout permitted a series of adjustment loans in support of the
reforms undertaken and the reinitiation of investment lending. The Bank throughout maintained
a close dialogue with the economic team and the sector ministries. These efforts helped to
establish the basis for the sustained economic growth necessary to restore Peru's debt-servicing
capacity and attractiveness to new capital inflows. Bank staff also assisted Peru and its creditors
in various stages of the negotiations, making presentations to creditors' meetings and
participating in the "roadshows".
22.  Peru's successful DDSR agreement could not have been completed without the financial
support of the Bank, IMF, and IDB. The Bank's performance in bringing this operation to
fruition, including the close working relationship maintained with its IFI partners, was highly
satisfactory. Direct costs in the preparation and supervision of the loan totaled just over
US$74,000, involving 24 staff-weeks spread over FYs 1996 and 1997. A Briefing Note was sent
to the Board on November 19, 1995, one month after the announcement of an agreement in
principle between Peru and its creditors to restructure the debt. Disbursement of the DDSR loan
took place on March 6, 1997, and the loan closed on March 31, 1997.
D. Borrower Performance
23.    The Government, under the leadership of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, brought
together an expert team of advisers and negotiators, which worked with patience and
determination to complete the DDSR agreement and assure the achievement of its objectives.
The Government was thus successful in its strategy for restoring Peru's creditworthiness as one
of the principle elements of its overall reform program.

E. Lessons Learned
24.     Rather than providing new lessons, the long process leading up to Peru's DDSR
operation and its ultimate completion reconfirm (i) the costliness to an economy of breaking its
links to the international economy and adopting a go-it-alone strategy; and (ii) that success in
reestablishing international creditworthiness ultimately depends on the quality of the country's
macroeconomic management and reforms. While the Bank and the other IFIs can play an
important catalytic role, as they did in the Peruvian case, the quality of the country's own
program and will to implement it are the decisive elements in making the operation successful.

ANNEX I
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW FROM
BORROWERS PERSPECTIVE
LOAN NUMBER 4133-PE



REPUBLIC OF PERU
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE
Project Implementation Review from Borrower's Perspective
RE: LOAN No. 4133 PE FOR US$ 183 MILLION
L Introduction
On February 26, 1997 Loan No. 4133-PE for US$183 million and Loan No. 4134-
PE for US$50 million were signed by the Republic of Peru ("Peru") and the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("the Bank"). The loans have been
successfully disbursed and implemented and this is the first implementation report
submitted by Peru pursuant to their terms and conditions.
]L Overall Assessment of the Projects
1.    Project Objectives
The general objective of the loans was to finance debt and debt service reduction
(DDSR), normalizing relations with commercial creditors and reestablishing
creditworthiness.
The objectives of the Loan 4133-PE were'
From Peru's perspective, all the above objectives have been achieved successfully.
2.    Peru's performance during the evolution of the Loans:
Savings: The savings were achieved through retroactive contractual interest rate
recalculation of eligible interest, reduction in interest rates (Par Bonds, Flirbs and PDI
Bonds) and actual principal forgiveness (Discount Bonds). As can be seen in the table
below, the Brady Plan was a cost-effective transaction. From a total fUS$10.6 billion of
eligible debt, total savings amounted to US$5.4 billion.
In addition; US$50 million was set aside from Loan No. 4134-PE to finance a portion of the cost of
the acquisition of collateral to secure principal on the Collateralized Discount Bonds and
Collateralized Par Bonds.



SAVINGS OBTAINED IN THE BRADY PLAN
(In million of US$ dollars)
Eligible Debt on March 7, 1997                                10,575.7
1. Reduction in interest:
- Recalculation                    2,416.7
- Buyback                            711.5
- PDI bonds                          456.4
Total                                                          3,584.7
II. Reduction in principal
- Buyback                             810.8
- Discount bond                       648.4
- Par bond                             85.9
- PLIRB                               404.8
Total                                                          1,769.9
HI. TOTAL SAVINGS (I+1)                                        5,354.6
Other Benefits: In addition to the savings described above, DDSR has had a
beneficial impact on the fiscal position and on the structural reforms program implemented
by the current administration, due to the reduction of the debt service. Another very
important benefit relates to international capital markets at spreads lower than those
outstanding prior to the closing of the Brady deal. This is reflected in the observed
appreciation of the Brady bonds in the secondary market. The above reflects a growing
confidence in Peru, which is supported by a perception of diminishing risk by both
Peruvian and international investors.

Peru has provided the Bank with the necessary information on the economic,
financial, social, institutional, and other conditions related to the DDSR operation.
3.    Bank's performance during the evolution of the Loans:
The loans were the result of a long and thoughtful process to structure DDSR for
Peru. During negotiations, Bank staff were very helpful in explaining the Bank's
guidelines, policies and procedures, while being sensitive to Peru's concerns, needs and
limitations.
m. Operational Phase of Proiect.
The loans were one component of the Plan. The IDB, Eximbank of Japan and the
IMF also supported this operation. Peru requested disbursal shortly before the closing and
this was accommodated under the loans. Operationally, the transactions and the
objectives have been met.
IV. Conclusion
The Loans together with the financial aid of other IFIs permitted Peru to normalize
and resolve commercial debt defaults that had existed since 1983. Peru has been pleased
with the response of the international financial markets to both DDSR and the structural
reform programs implemented to globalize and modernize Peru's economy. Currently,
Peru has access to less expensive capital to finance its various needs. This strategy should
have important social benefits in reducing poverty and creating a stable fiscal base as the
economy expands.
