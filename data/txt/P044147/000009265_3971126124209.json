reforms necessary to create conditions for\n            a resumption of growth and improvement in living conditions\n            in Moldova. To achieve this objective, critical reforms need\n            to be undertaken in: i) improving financial discipline; ii)\n            privatizing the energy sector; iii) accelerating land reform\n            and privatization; iv) reforming the pension system; and v)\n            completing enterprise privatization, specially for\n            small-scale enterprises. SAL II will have three fundamental\n            benefits. First, the reform program supported by the SAL II\n            will address key bottlenecks, and enhance the prospects of\n            long-term growth and improved living standards by setting in\n            place a comprehensive program of reforms that will span the\n            1998 Parliamentary elections. Second, it will provide\n            short-term budgetary support essential for maintaining the\n            level of basic public services. The availability of low\n            cost, non-inflationary budgetary financing will help\n            consolidate Moldova's economic stabilization. Third, it\n            will provide necessary foreign exchange to purchase imports\n            critical for Moldova's economic activity while\n            maintaining creditworthiness. Finally, measures supported by\n            SAL II --payments discipline and completion of privatization\n            and land reform-- are necessary conditions for sustainable\n            growth and creditworthiness."}, "docdt": "1997-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
