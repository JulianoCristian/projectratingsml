      institutional development impact. Lessons convey that the\n            Bank could have taken a more realistic approach regarding\n            the level of adjustment Moldova was being forced to make in\n            restoring economic growth, by addressing longer-term, and\n            deeper-structural adjustments in the definition of project\n            objectives. Hence, the agreed measures led to significant\n            reduction of program effectiveness, conducive to extended\n            implementation delays. Instead, front-loading conditionality\n            prior to Board presentation, or the use of single tranche\n            operations, could have been useful tools under circumstances\n            of intense resource constraints, as is the case of Moldova.\n            Furthermore, the inability to coordinate foreign assistance,\n            should be guided by the Bank's assistance in donor\n            coordination. Regardless of success, the privatization\n            program as a whole, was not sufficiently deep, neither was\n            the agricultural privatization - which seemingly, only\n            provided a means of subsistence to the rural population.\n            Therefore it is worth considering the privatization process\n            early on, focused on post-privatization market development\n            for agriculture, and, on the need for strong political will\n            regarding industrial privatization."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
