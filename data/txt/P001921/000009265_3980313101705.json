sanitary conditions of the populations in Port\n            Louis, targeting the city's southern districts,\n            industrial zones and affected coastal zones; ii) reverse the\n            current trend of environmental pollution on the island and\n            in its coastal zone; and iii) support Government efforts to\n            implement priority institutional and technical measures\n            identified in the Sewerage Master Plan. The project has\n            three components. First, the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage\n            System component includes land acquisition and compensation,\n            construction of pipelines and sewers, pumping stations,\n            treatment plant, sea outfall, industrial pretreatment, and\n            supervision works. Second, wastewater sector equipment and\n            expertise component includes sector studies, sector\n            expertise, and equipment to support a CWA(Central Water\n            Authority)/WWA (Waste Water Authority) joint billing system.\n            Third, the WWA institution-building component includes WWA\n            program management assistance, WWA personnel training, and\n            support for industrial waste management program implementation."}, "docdt": "1998-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
