Some lessons learned included: 1) Regularly\n            reviewing the organizational effectiveness of implementing\n            agencies and quickly addressing weaknesses can help ensure\n            that agencies perform as effectively as possible; 2)\n            Introducing joint billing for water and wastewater can\n            increase public acceptance and minimize costs for\n            administration of the scheme; 3) Raising awareness of\n            industries of their responsibility for environmental\n            management and working with them to find a solution can be\n            more effective than a confrontational approach; 4) Laws\n            allowing losing bidders to put an injunction on\n            implementation can result in significant project delays; 5)\n            Public outreach and incentives are essential to encourage\n            people to pay for services that provides a public rather\n            than private good; 6) Encouraging development partners to\n            delegate the supervision of their project funds can help\n            reduce the transaction costs to government of dealing with\n            multiple partners; 7) Including from the beginning a\n            well-designed house connection program in the project to\n            accompany construction of treatment plants will help assure\n            that it achieves its environmental objectives and financial\n            sustainability; and 8) Thoroughly preparing a project\n            monitoring and evaluation system prior to the start of a\n            project will ensure that stakeholders can track progress\n            towards the project objectives as soon as implementation starts."}, "docdt": "2007-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
