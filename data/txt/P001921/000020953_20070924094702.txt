1.       Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance)

Country and sector background. At the time when the project was being prepared in the mid-
1990s, Mauritius had become a middle income country with per capita gross domestic product
(GDP) of about US$3,550 per year. A major source of growth was expansion of the high-end
tourist industry that attracted visitors seeking a tropical climate, pristine white sand beaches, and
crystal clear waters for swimming, snorkeling, water skiing, and other water sports. By the mid-
1990s, tourism contributed 5.7 percent of GDP. During the same period, rapid growth of
residential and industrial development in Port Louis had resulted in noticeable pollution of rivers
and land, which prompted the government to undertake an emergency program to connect
industrial polluters to the sewerage system. While this helped relocate the problem, it did not
solve it, as Mauritius had no facilities to treat industrial effluent. Instead, the wastewater
together with domestic sewage was discharged untreated to the sea through short sea outfalls
built in the 1970s. Several incidents of coastal pollution by untreated sewage led to the
temporary closing of beaches and to a public demand for the government to address the issue.
The 1988 national environmental action plan named the inadequate disposal of wastewater as a
priority area for government attention.

The government responded by developing in 1993 the sewerage masterplan that laid out a 20-
year program (1993­2012) to expand the network and to construct new pumping, treatment, and
discharge facilities to serve households and industries throughout Mauritius and Rodrigues. The
masterplan also specified the most urgent investments required to reverse damage to the
environment and to protect public health. These were facilities serving the Port Louis
conurbation (home to over one-third of Mauritians), Grande Baie, and Plaines Wilhems. The
masterplan further explored several options for upgrading the sewerage system serving Port
Louis. It concluded that the least-cost solution was to construct two new treatments plants,
associated works, and marine outfalls, one at Baie du Tombeau to serve the northern parts of the
city and one at Montagne Jacquot to serve the southern districts. To further save on capital and
operating costs, the masterplan proposed primary treatment of sewage with disinfection, with the
effluent to be discharged to the sea through long sea outfalls and the sludge disposed of at the
sanitary landfill at Mare Chicose. Recognizing the financial, technical, and institutional
challenges of implementing the 20-year national sewerage program, the authorities sought advice
and financial assistance from development partners--including the World Bank, the European
Investment Bank, the European Commission, the African Development Bank, French
Development Cooperation, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, and the Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa--in establishing financially-sustainable wastewater services.

Rationale for World Bank involvement. The World Bank's involvement in the program was
important for several reasons. First, the Bank brought a focus on institutional development and
policy reform that is essential for the long-term sustainability of the improved services. Of
particular value was its assistance with designing a tariff system for wastewater services. Also
critical was its help in establishing an autonomous wastewater management authority, with new
responsibilities for project and facilities management. Second, the Bank helped the government to

develop a program to encourage industries to pretreat their wastewater to a defined standard before
discharging it to the public sewerage system. This would not only reduce the costs to the state of
handling and treating industrial effluent, it would also help in mobilizing resources to operate the
system, because industries must pay each year for their discharge permits. Third, it assisted the
government to establish its house connection program through support for a pilot program providing
free connections for households that would otherwise have relied on septic tanks. This has led to a
much higher demand for connections than the previous approach, helping to ensure both a long-
term revenue stream for wastewater services and reduced damage to the environment and human
health from uncontrolled seepage of sewage into groundwater and the sea. Fourth, the Bank helped
the wastewater authority to recognize the importance of public outreach in encouraging households
and businesses to value and pay for wastewater services and to accept the inevitable disruptions
associating with constructing the works. As a result of Bank involvement in the program, the
wastewater management authority has established a permanent office for public relations. Fifth, the
Bank offered unbiased advice on choice of technologies, enabling the authorities to resist pressures
by foreign suppliers of expensive, but inappropriate high technology approaches. Sixth, the Bank
helped to secure soft loan resources for the program from a parallel financier, the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) (formerly, the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund).
This helped the government to meet its objectives of financing the program with the cheapest
sources of finance possible.

Contribution to higher-level objectives. The project's objectives were consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the World Bank's Board of Directors on April
22, 1997. In particular, it supports the CAS objective to safeguard the environment by
improving wastewater management and physical planning in urban areas and along the seaboard.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The development objectives of the project were to: (a) improve the health and sanitary conditions
of the population of the southern districts of Port Louis and affected coastal zones, and (b)
reverse the trend of environmental pollution on the island and in its coastal zone, and (c) support
government's efforts to implement priority institutional and technical measures identified in the
sewerage masterplan.

The project appraisal document contains in a table in annex 1 a set of key performance
indicators. They are:

·       Percentage drop in waterborne diseases (hepatitis A, eye, and skin diseases).
·       Improved potable water quality.
·       Decreased levels of biological oxygen demand (BOD), organic, and chemical
        contamination in marine and groundwater in selected areas (sea outfall, Port Louis
        lagoon, selected beaches, and coral reefs).
·       Wastewater authority reformed.
·       Integrated water and wastewater sector policy prepared.
·       Montagne Jacquot wastewater treatment works completed.




                                                   2

The table does not contain quantitative baseline or target values with respect to project outcome
indicators. However, the table presented baseline and target values for some of the output
indicators (a few of which can be considered outcome indicators).

Neither the loan agreement nor the project agreement include the indicators presented in the
annex 1 table. The loan agreement, however, included a schedule of wastewater tariffs to be
established during the period of the project. Increasing tariffs was considered essential to
achieve long-term sustainability of the national sewerage system.

1.3     Revised Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The project's development objectives were not formally revised during implementation. The
loan agreement, however, was amended once to allow procurement of laboratory equipment for
monitoring of wastewater discharged by industries and by the treatment plant.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised; briefly describe the "the primary target group" identified in the PAD and
as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit
from the project)

The primary target beneficiaries were the 200,000 people living and working in the area served
by the Montagne Jacquot sewerage system. All Mauritians were expected to benefit from the
reduced risk of being exposed to an infectious disease and to the economic benefits arising from
growth of tourism. Citizens were also intended to gain from the institutional and policy reforms
that would improve management of wastewater services and help ensure their sustainable
financing. Another beneficiary of the project was the wastewater authority, which would profit
from increased autonomy and improved managerial, operational, financial, and strategic
planning systems.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

The project comprised three components: (a) Montagne Jacquot sewerage system, (b) wastewater
sector equipment and expertise, and (c) wastewater authority institution building. The World
Bank financed the trunk sewerage pipeline, equipment, studies, capacity building for the
wastewater authority, and program implementation. JBIC financed with a soft loan two new
pumping stations (Fort Victoria and Point aux Sables), the Montagne Jacquot wastewater
treatment plant, and the long sea outfall. The government financed aspects of each component.

Montagne Jacquot sewerage system (US$57.2 million)

The component financed the least-cost option for upgrading the sewerage system covering the
southern districts of the Port Louis conurbation, one of the priority projects named in the
government's 1993 sewerage masterplan. Investments covered:

Land acquisition (government). This subcomponent financed the purchase of land in a remote
area of the island for the treatment plant, including land for future expansion and to provide a



                                                  3

buffer zone between the plant and neighbors. The subcomponent also financed acquisition of
rights of way needed for the access to the site and for transmission mains.

Pipelines and sewers (World Bank and government). This subcomponent financed the rising
main (the trunk sewerage pipeline) to carry wastewater from the Fort Victoria and Pointe aux
Sables pumping stations to the treatment plant.

Pumping stations (JBIC and government). This subcomponent financed two new pumping
stations at Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables on the sites of the outdated works. Utilizing the
existing sites would reduce overall investment costs by limiting the need to acquire land and by
allowing use of the existing gravity pipelines transmitting sewage to the pumping stations. The
construction contract also included one year of operations and maintenance to ensure that the
pumping stations were operating as expected at the time they were transferred to the government.

Treatment plant (JBIC and government). This subcomponent financed the Montagne Jacquot
treatment plant, which was designed to provide primary treatment plus disinfection of 48,000
cubic meters of wastewater inflow per day. The plant would stabilize and dewater sludge for
transport by truck to the Mare Chicose sanitary landfill.4 The construction contract also included
one year of operations and maintenance.

Sea outfall (JBIC and government). This subcomponent financed the sea outfall for discharge of
the treated wastewater. The outfall would extend about 695 meters offshore and include six
diffusers at an average depth of 30 meters spaced 10 meters apart to ensure that the effluent
rapidly and adequately mixed with the seawater.

Industrial pretreatment (government and industry). Among the policy reforms supported by the
projects was the establishment of a system governing the discharge of industrial wastewater to
the Mauritius public sewerage system. Under the system, industries would have to obtain
permits specifying the maximum allowable concentrations of various pollutants to be discharged
and the level of fines to be imposed if the standards were violated. This subcomponent, financed
by industry, supported the construction of facilities to treat their effluent to the agreed standard
prior to discharge.

Supervision of works (government, JBIC, and World Bank). This subcomponent financed
independent consultants to supervise the works.

Sector equipment and expertise(US$57.2 million)

This component financed studies to underpin the policy and institutional reforms. It also
financed expertise to help design a wastewater services billing system and water meters to
facilitate implementation of the system.

Studies (World Bank and government). This subcomponent financed (a) mapping of the sewer
networks, (b) a household connection survey, (c) a geographical information system and digital


4   The World Bank financed the construction of the landfill under the Mauritius Environmental Monitoring and
Development Project that closed in 1998.



                                                       4

software, (d) institutional studies for the midterm review, and (e) a project implementation audit.
It also financed several activities to raise awareness of the objectives of the program and project,
the benefits of paying for services, and the plans for road closures and other construction-related
disruptions.

Expertise (World Bank and government). This subcomponent financed experts to design and
install a joint water and wastewater billing system and train staff on its use.

Equipment (government). This subcomponent financed the procurement of water meters to the
specifications of the central water authority to ensure that water use of all dwellings connected to
the sewerage system could be monitored and billed.

Wastewater authority institution building (US$3.8 million)

This component assisted the wastewater authority transform itself from a division of the Ministry
of Public Utilities to an autonomous agency responsible for constructing, operating, and
maintaining wastewater services.

Wastewater authority program management (World Bank and government). This subcomponent
financed technical assistance to help the wastewater authority assume its new responsibilities as
an autonomous organization. This included assistance on cost accounting, preparation of terms
of reference for studies and contracts, contracting procedures, and management of project
contracts. It also involved building of capacity for operations and maintenance of treatment
plants, and provision of services to consumers.

Wastewater authority staff training (World Bank and government). This subcomponent financed
the training of staff in (a) managing the national sewerage program, including contracting of
works and services, and supervision of construction and operations and maintenance; (b)
planning and programming of future investments; (c) managing environmental issues; (d)
managing projects and facilitating private sector involvement in provision of wastewater
services.

Implementation of the industrial wastewater management program (World Bank and
government). This subcomponent financed support for implementation of the national sewerage
program. It included assistance for developing a framework for negotiating agreements between
industry and the wastewater authority on effluent standards, on a timetable to install an operate
pretreatment facilities, and on monitoring arrangements. It also involved help to strengthen the
wastewater authority to monitor and enforce compliance with the standards and regulations.

When it became apparent that the pipelines and sewers would cost one-third less than originally
estimated (over US$4 million), the government and the Bank added a new activity to the project
in early 2003--a pilot program to connect some 3,350 households to the Montagne Jacquot
sewerage network.5 The program tested the response of households to the offer of free
connections, with the aim of securing long-term revenues for the provision of services and
reducing environmental damage from the seepage from private septic tanks into groundwater and
the sea. The connections program had always been part of the national sewerage program, but
the Bank had not earlier planned to participate in its financing. The change helped to focus the
attention of the wastewater authority on the issue (it created a department with the sole
responsibility for the connection program) and to mobilize funds from other development
partners for the connection program. In addition, the Bank and the government decided to
finance the procurement of laboratory equipment to monitor the water quality using funds that
were not needed for water meters, which were purchased under another project. The changes
were widely discussed with the stakeholders and were approved by Bank management, because
they strengthened the ability of the program and the project to meet its objectives.

The project closing date was extended twice. The first extension of two years to June 30, 2005
was granted to allow completion of the pumping stations, treatment plant, and sea outfall (all
under JBIC financing), implementation of the newly agreed house connection program, and
achievement of the planned policy and institutional reforms. The second extension to December
31, 2006 was given to enable completion of the JBIC-financed physical works and the pilot
connection program. At the time that the government had submitted its extension request, JBIC
had already approved an extension of the closing date of its loan to December 25, 2008 (JBIC's
closing date is later than the Bank's to allow it to finance one year of operations and maintenance
that is included in the overall contract for the treatment plant).

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigation identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory. Although the project is rated satisfactory in
three of the main areas of quality at entry (relevance, government ownership, and
appropriateness in relation to implementation capacity), it is rated moderately unsatisfactory at
entry because of weaknesses in the project logframe and because of a possible lack of readiness
for implementation at the time of Board presentation.

The project was relevant because it addressed a priority of the government (as set out in 1988
national environmental action plan the 1993 sewerage masterplan) and fit well within the CAS,
particularly its goal of safeguarding the environment through better wastewater management. In



5   The cost of the main sewerage pipeline was much less than expected because the tendering process attracted
bids from firms that had not earlier bid on such projects. Estimates has been based on the offers of firms that had
previously supplied such pipelines.



                                                           6

addition, the project was in integral part of the government's national sewerage program, which
greatly facilitated government's coordination of development partner assistance to the program.

The project was well designed; it were based on thorough prefeasibility and feasibility studies
and a comprehensive environmental impact assessment. Moreover, it covered all aspects of
wastewater management, from construction and operation of facilities, to financial management,
to planning for future expansion and possible adoption of tertiary treatment for reuse in irrigation
systems. In addition, it offered the least-cost solution to managing wastewater in an
environmentally sound manner--primary treatment with disinfection prior to discharge into the
sea through an outfall of 645 meters at a depth of 30 meters. Drawing on lessons of experience
with wastewater management in other countries, the design included measures to strengthen
capacity of the wastewater authority. It also included assistance to develop a joint water-
wastewater billing system aimed at ensuring that the authority was able to mobilize resources
from beneficiaries at the lowest possible administrative costs. The project design was
appropriate in relation to capacity of the government to both execute the works and to operate the
new sewerage system. The pumping stations and treatment plant were designed using widely-
used and readily available technology, which were well within the capacity of the wastewater
authority to maintain and operate. By contrast, a sewerage system providing secondary or
tertiary treatment would not only have been much more expensive to build and operate, it would
also have demanded a high level of skills to operate.

The project appraisal document noted alternative approaches, the trade-offs between them, and
the rationale for the final decisions. The project was classified appropriately as environmental
category A. An environmental impact assessment that included a social assessment identified
potential risks and specified measures to mitigate any negative impacts that could arise from the
project. The project appraisal document generally foresaw the risks the project would face and
identified adequate mitigation measures, although it underestimated the risks of delays. A
thorough appraisal of procurement and financial management arrangements helped to ensure that
resources were used as intended. A government sector policy statement specified the
commitment of the government to the project, its intention to introduce wastewater tariffs and to
establish a joint water-wastewater billing system, and its plans for institutional reforms.
Agreement with a cofinancier, JBIC, ensured that Mauritius would benefit from the lowest-cost
financing terms available. Indeed, this was the first project that benefited from JBIC's
accelerated cofinancing agreement with the World Bank that uses a simplified procedure to
implement co-financing schemes more effectively. Responding to lessons of experience, the
engineering design and procurement documents for the first year's activities were complete by
Board presentation. The project implementation plan had also been appraised and found to be
realistic and of satisfactory quality. The loan agreement included only the standard financial
covenants, which was appropriate.

However, the project design suffered from two weaknesses at entry, which account for the
moderately unsatisfactory, rather than fully satisfactory rating. The first relates to weaknesses in
the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. Although the project incorporated an M&E
framework to track project implementation progress and outcomes, the project logframe
contained poorly-specified indicators, some of which were not closely related to project
interventions. It also lacked baseline and target values. These deficiencies were addressed



                                                  7

during implementation of the project. The second weakness was the inclusion of a loan
effectiveness condition--the borrower has acquired land for the works--that proved difficult to
meet and ultimately led to delays in the start of the project by nearly a year. The Bank team
agreed to this as an effectiveness condition because the government assured the team that the
acquiring the land would take no more than three months. However, this proved to be
unrealistic. Other effectiveness conditions--the wastewater authority has selected consultants
and technical experts to help with institutional strengthening, the borrower has adopted a
program for monitoring of wastewater quality, and JBIC's loan agreement has been executed and
delivered and all its conditions for disbursement have been fulfilled--were appropriate and were
met with no delays. The inclusion of the condition related to JBIC's loan agreement ensured that
the resources of both organizations would be available simultaneously.

QAG­No QAG at entry.

2.2     Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, midterm review, project at risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Implementation was moderately satisfactory, due to significant delays in implementation of the
pumping stations and wastewater treatment plant. The delays arose for two reasons, neither of
which could have been foreseen at the time the project was prepared. The first was the decision of
the wastewater authority to consider an alternative technology to the agreed project design, that of
injecting treated sewage into the island's lava tunnels instead of discharging the effluent to the sea.
The idea of the alternative design arose in response to a then newly-completed geological survey
that revealed the locations of numerous lava tunnels that could potentially receive the wastewater,
saving the cost of the long sea outfall. However, to thoroughly explore the option, a feasibility
study and a detailed environmental assessment were needed. This required 18 months. Ultimately,
the studies showed that the approach involved unacceptable risks to the groundwater and to
organisms living in the tunnels, and was rejected when the Ministry of Environment refused to
issue a permit for the process. A new general manager and several senior officers were appointed
to lead the authority following this decision to ensure that the works were implemented as agreed.
The second delay arose due to litigation by a losing bidder on the works. The law in Mauritius
allows losers to place an injunction on implementation until the case has been decided in court. In
this case, nearly one year passed before the court ruled in favor of the tender board, and the project
could resume. To avoid such problems in the future, a new procurement act was passed in late
2006 that restricts the ability of unsatisfied bidders to stop procurement from proceeding. Litigants
who win their cases will now be entitled to financial compensation, but will not be able interfere
with implementation of projects deemed by the government to be priority projects.

A study of the costs and benefits of house connections led to the decision to offer free house
connections on a pilot basis. A midterm review prepared in November 2001 helped in addressing
key issues that were slowing progress towards the project's development objectives. For example,
to increase demand for house connections, it recommended that the government issue a regulation
to requiring property owners to connect to the sewerage network when feasible. It also proposed
that the wastewater authority appoint an experienced person to head the house connection unit. An
organizational review resulted in reorienting the authority toward serving the needs of customers



                                                    8

and the establishment of a customer service unit, and the upgrading of staff skills and information
technology.

Implementation arrangements were generally satisfactory. The decision to implement the project
through an existing government entity--the wastewater authority--ensured that the capacity
created under the project would be used to implement the national sewerage program as a whole.
It also helped promote good coordination between the policy, regulatory, environmental, and
investment aspects of the program. However, delays until late 2000 in passing the wastewater
management authority act--which transformed the authority into an autonomous body--reduced
the effectiveness of the implementing agency during the early years of the project as it tried to
work out its roles and responsibilities in relation to other entities. The transformation process
also resulted in disruptions to the work program, as staff were divided between the new
wastewater management authority and the Ministry of Public Works. Once the decisions were
made, time was needed to fill vacancies and for staff to learn their new roles and responsibilities.
The specification of roles and responsibilities through the contract of delegation with the
government helped in getting work back on track.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Design. As previously mentioned, the project appraisal document included a logframe in annex
1 with both outcome and intermediate output indicators. However, knowledge of how to use
such a tool for monitoring was much more limited at the time the project was prepared than
today, and the logframe reflects this weakness. For example, the logframe does not contain
baseline or target values for any of its outcome indicators. Although it names the government
agencies that would generally be responsible for tracking specific indicators, it does not identify
data collection instruments. Had the project teams done more to identify both baseline data and
data collection instruments, they likely would have realized that one of the outcome indicators--
percentage decline in hepatitis A, eye, and skin diseases--could not be tracked because the
epidemiological studies that could establish a link between public sanitation and health were not
being undertaken in Mauritius. They would also have become aware that little reliable data on
the ambient quality of marine and groundwater were being collected through the normal
government processes, making monitoring of changes impossible without a project-specific
study. The other outcome indicators specified in the table are either unrelated to the project
(drinking water quality) or refer to outputs rather than outcomes (reform of the wastewater
authority, integration of water/wastewater sector policy, and completion of Montagne Jacquot
works).

Some of the output indicators were well-specified with baseline and target values, and could
reasonably serve as outcome indicators. For example, the number of structures connected to the
sewerage system is an access indicator and relates directly to the project's environmental
objectives. Similarly, the quality of industrial effluent discharged to the sewerage system is
linked to the objective of reducing pollution. In addition, the establishment of a cost-recovery
system is connected to the goal of creating financially-sustainable wastewater management
services. The European Commission uses these three indicators among others (although more
precisely specified) to determine government's eligibility for financing under the variable
tranche of its budget support grant. This ICR reports on progress with respect to indicators that



                                                  9

serve as reasonable proxies of the project's outcomes, although these were not specified in the
project's logframe at appraisal stage. These are indicators related to access (number of structures
connected to the sewerage system), to water pollution (concentrations of pollutants in wastewater
discharged to the ocean from the treatment plant), and to financial sustainability (tariff collection
ratio and financial sustainability ratio).

Implementation. Not surprisingly, the team did not track during project implementation the
indicators related to health or potable water quality. The team did, however, commission a
baseline study that was completed in August 2004 of the state of the marine environment
(including, water quality, extent of biodiversity, and the state of the coral reefs) in the vicinity of
the two sea outfalls to be closed, the outfall to be opened, and several control sites. The Ministry
of Environment is expected to repeat the study in 2009 or 2010 to ascertain the environmental
impacts of the project. This will supplement monitoring that the ministry already undertakes to
assess the impact of various projects of the national sewerage program on the environment.

The government team did track many of the output indicators, presenting the values in the
quarterly progress reports. It reported not just on implementation of the physical works, but also
on progress with establishing the tariff system and agreeing with industries on the discharge of
effluent. The Bank team reflected the findings in the implementation supervision reports.

Utilization. The government and the Bank used the monitoring information to identify areas of
particular challenge and to develop measures to address them. Specifically, the teams noted the
lag in forging agreements with industries on their role in reducing wastewater pollution. As a
result, the wastewater management authority decided to establish a special unit to accelerate the
program. The project implementers also observed the slow pace of connecting homes to the
sewerage system. This led them to encourage the government to adopt policies that would lower
the costs of connecting, while raising the costs of failing to do so.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project complied with all safeguard policies, including the fiduciary safeguards. Especially
noteworthy is its compliance with the environmental management plan for implementation of the
main sewage pipeline, treatment plant, and sea outfall. All have been constructed with minimal
environmental disturbance (the pathway of the sea outfall is undetectable without a guide) and no
social disruptions. Both the plant and sea outfall have so far been operating in accordance with
the highest environmental standards. Project accounting and auditing have consistently been
conducted in accordance with the development credit agreement.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, operation & maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The transition arrangements to operation of the Montagne Jacques sewerage system are
complete. The works contractor is operating and maintaining the system until January 2008, a
period of one year following the handover of the facilities to the government. The wastewater



                                                  10

management authority will then take over its operations and maintenance, which it plans to
handle in-house. The authority will continue to implement the other projects of the national
sewerage program as planned, drawing on its institutional capacity built under the project. The
government has indicated that it would like the Bank to remain engaged with the sewerage
program, either through direct financing of a project or through dialogue in the context of general
budget support.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project's overall objectives were, and remain, relevant. They reflect the importance of
environmental quality to human health, to the economy, and to the quality of life in Mauritius.
They are also in line with trends observed in many countries--that the demand for improved
environmental quality and better sewerage services grows in step with the nation's wealth. As
mentioned in section 1.1, the project's objectives are consistent with the objectives of the Bank's
1997 CAS and with the country's national environmental action plan. They are also in
conformity with the objectives of the Bank's 2002 CAS, which explicitly supports the
government's own goal of preserving the environment through better solid and liquid waste
management. Finally, the project's objectives are consistent with those of the 2006 country
partnership strategy, which supports government's aim to protect the environment.

The overall design of the project was appropriate for country environmental conditions and
economic circumstances. The project supported the least-cost sewerage treatment technology
consistent with the objective of protecting the coastal and marine ecosystems, rather than
alternative technologies that cost more, but do not offer greater benefits. Operating the chosen
technology is also well within the capabilities of Mauritians.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in annex 4)

The project achieved its development objectives. While impact on human health will not be
apparent for some time, the sanitary conditions for inhabitants of the southern coastal districts of
Port Louis have improved. The number of structures connected to the Montagne Jacquot sewerage
system (under World Bank finance) has risen by 1,400, while the number connected nationwide
has expanded from about 24,000 in 1997 to 60,000 in late 2006. At the end of 2006, about 30
percent of Mauritians were connected to the sewerage network, compared with 20 percent in 1997.

Environmental degradation from the discharge of polluted wastewater has been reversed. The
volume of wastewater treated by public treatment stations rose from 20.2 million cubic meters in
1997 to 30.5 million cubic meters in 2005.6 The start of operations in January 2007 of the
Montagne Jacquot treatment plant adds over 17 million cubic meters to this total. While the

impact on the coastal and marine environment of the closure of the old outfalls and the opening of
the new one will not be known until a follow-up to the baseline study can be conducted, the quality
of the coastal ecosystem in the vicinity of the Baie du Tombeau outfall that was closed in late 2000
has improved dramatically. Annual average concentrations of chemical oxygen demand have
fallen by 60 percent, concentrations of total phosphorous has shrunk by half, and concentrations of
total nitrogen has declined to imperceptible levels.7 Quality of water in the lagoon of the Baie du
Tombeau has also improved significantly, and now complies with guidelines for coastal water
quality. The lagoon has been declared safe for swimming, the coral reef is recuperating, and the
number of individuals of a given species and the diversity of marine life are increasing.8

Water quality in the vicinity of the new long sea outfall at Montagne Jacquot is expected to meet
guidelines for coastal water quality. Monitoring data show that treatment is removing nearly 40
percent of organics and over 60 percent of chemicals and total suspended solids contained in the
influent (table 1). As a result, the effluent complies with the limits for concentrations of organics,
chemicals, and suspended solids. This is in contrast to the previous situation, when effluent was
discharged to the lagoon without treatment. Daily monitoring of the quality of influent and of
effluent will enable the plant operators to detect and address potential problems quickly. Annual
monitoring of groundwater, surface water, and marine and coastal ecosystems will reveal the
longer-term environmental benefits of the national sewerage program.

The institutional performance of the wastewater sector has also improved. Revenues generated
through tariffs now cover all operating and maintenance cost of the wastewater management
authority and the interest on the investment loans. Prior to the project, the costs of operations were
met entirely through allocations from the government budget. The wastewater management
authority is also now a much more effective organization, capable of planning and managing a
large investment program, operating and maintaining the sewerage system, informing the public of
its role in fostering a better environment, and responding quickly to the demands of consumers.
Additional planned reforms to clarify its roles and responsibilities in relation to other government
entities, strengthen it human resource policy to enable it to attract and retain qualified staff, and
improve its accountability framework are expected to enable the authority to more readily avoid
delays in implementation and to meet future challenges.

(Net present value/economic rate of return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and financial rate of return)

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

Given project investment costs of US$56.5 million, actual revenues generated through user fees
during 2004­06 and projected revenues during 2007­36, and estimated environmental benefits,
the project has a net present value of US$8.5 million and an internal rate of return of 12.2
percent. This assumes a discount rate of 10 percent. The main assumptions of the analysis are:
(a) the capital costs are incurred between 2000 and 2006; (b) the lifetime of the civil works is 30
years and the lifetime of the mechanical and electrical works is 15 years, with investment for
replacement taking place in 2021 and 2022; (c) the real annual revenues of the wastewater
management authority rise by 10 percent in 2007, 2008, and 2009 from tariff increases and
increasing household connections and by 3 percent thereafter; (d) the total operations and
maintenance costs remain constant in real terms between 2006 and 2036; and (e) the real value of
environmental benefits rises by 3 percent a year between 2006 and 2036 due to a rising
population, increasing number of visitors, and rising demand for a clean environment linked to
expanding incomes. The table below compares the current estimates of net present value and
internal rate of return for the project compared with the estimates made at the time of project
appraisal.

Cost benefit analysis: Current calculations compared with appraisal estimates (US$)
                                       Current estimates              Appraisal estimate
Net present value                         8.5 million                     30.5 million
Internal rate of return                   12.2 percent                    19.2 percent

The estimates of the economic benefits of the project are lower than those estimated at the
project appraisal stage for several reasons. The first is that estimates of revenues from user fees
are now much lower (by 60 percent) than at appraisal stage. The current estimates are based on
actual performance of the past three years and on projections of future revenue using
assumptions of tariff increases and growth in house connections.

The second major reason for the differences between the current estimates and those at appraisal
is the approach used to calculate the environmental benefits from the project. The current
analysis estimates environmental benefits as (a) avoided medical costs due to reduced incidences
of illness from ingesting contaminated water and food, (b) estimated willingness to pay to restore
and maintain the beaches and lagoons of south Port Louis for full recreational use, and (c)
estimated impact on tourism should Mauritius's reputation for offering a healthy and pristine
beach holiday experience suffer from disease outbreaks or degradation of the lagoon and beach
environment. The current analysis does not include estimates of rising land values--which were
included at appraisal stage. Although land values may indeed rise in the area of the formerly
polluted beaches due to the operation of the new Montagne Jacquot sewerage system, accurate
estimates of the increases are not possible at this time. However, including estimates of rising
land values using the same estimates as used at appraisal stage would increase the net present
value of the project to US$32 million and the internal rate of return to 22.4 percent. In addition,
the current analysis takes a broader approach to estimating the benefits of the project on tourism



                                                  13

revenues than that taken at appraisal stage. In the current analysis tourism revenues are affected
by not only potential outbreaks of epidemics, but also by the general degradation of the coastal
and lagoon environment. All tourists come to Mauritius to enjoy its beaches and opportunities
for water sports. A decline in the quality of this environment would likely have a stronger and
longer-lasting impact on tourism than a transitory outbreak of disease. Overall, the current
analysis estimates the total environmental benefits to be slightly higher (by about 10 percent)
than estimated at appraisal stage.

Although incremental benefits are estimated to be lower than at appraisal stage, so are
incremental costs. The current estimates are based on actual investment and operations and
maintenance costs, and projections of investment costs to replace mechanical and electrical
equipment in 2021 and 2022. Overall, incremental costs are estimated to be about 36 percent
lower than estimated at appraisal stage.

Details of the updated analysis are presented in annex table 1. A summary of the analysis
prepared at appraisal stage, with the results presented in U.S. dollars rather than in Mauritian
rupees.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, 2001/02­2005/06

The wastewater management authority has generated a surplus in each of the five years during
2001/02­2005/06. The authority has also consistently generated positive cash flows from its
core operations, resources it is using to fund operations and maintenance, depreciation, and a
contribution for interest on the investment loans.

The financial ratios of the wastewater management authority reveal its performance over time
and provide an indication of its ability to finance its operations with its revenues. All three
indicators beneath the table above show that the ability of the authority to generate a surplus has
been deteriorating over time. The operating ratio, which is the proportion of expenses covered
by the wastewater fee, has fallen steadily since tariffs were last increased in 2002/03, and has
been above 1 for the past two years. A table with details of the financial analysis is presented in
annex 2.

To ensure that the wastewater management authority is able to meet its future obligations--
which will increase sharply during the next two years as the new treatment plants come
onstream--the government plans to raise tariffs and is considering reducing the number of tariff
bands. A tariff study completed in December 2006 shows that to cover operations and
maintenance costs plus 25 percent of depreciation, the charges for households consuming 20
cubic meters per month would have to rise by about 27 percent, from US$3.42 per month to
US$4.35 per month (average tariff of 7 rupees per cubic meter).9 This would represent about 1.3
percent of median household income, and 2.5 percent of income of the poorest 13 percent of

households. Charges for nonresidential consumers would have to rise from 15.5 to 20 rupees per
cubic meter. Achieving full cost recovery would require nearly quadrupling tariffs for residences
(to 17 rupees per cubic meter for the first 20 cubic meters for residences, or US$11.82 per
month). This would not be affordable to the majority of households. It would also require
raising the tariff for nonresidential consumers to 54 rupees per cubic meter. Because bearing the
full costs of the system would not be affordable to the majority of households, the government
will have to bear some of the costs of depreciation. From an economic point of view this is
justifiable, because the project provides benefits that all Mauritians and visitors to the country
enjoy, whether or not the buildings they occupy are connected to the sewerage system. The
government will present its plans in a new sector policy letter that is expected to be finalized by
July 2007.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating         S

Achievement of the objectives of the project is rated satisfactory. The project objectives were
and remain relevant. The project design is also appropriate for Mauritius. The project achieved
its development objectives, although with delays, none of which could have been foreseen. The
project's choice of technology is appropriate for the economic and environmental context of
Mauritius. The project has a positive net present value and internal rate of return. Satisfactory
performance along all three parameters justifies an overall outcome rating of satisfactory for the
project.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

None.

(a)     Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

The government and Bank project teams paid particular attention in the design of the project to
ensure that wastewater tariffs were affordable to the poorest 20 percent of the population. They
proposed adopting a rising block tariff scheme, with the first 10 cubic meters per month
attracting a rate less than one-sixth that charged for consumption above 250 cubic meters a
month (see table 2). A household of four consuming the Mauritian average of 20 cubic meters
per month would therefore pay about 110 rupees per month (US$3.50). This is less than 1
percent of in 2001/02 median monthly household income of 11,150 rupees per month, and less
than 2 percent of the incomes of the 13 percent of Mauritians earning less than one-half the
median income.10

Although not an aim of the Bank-financed project, the national sewerage program is making a
special effort to connect low-income housing estates to sewerage systems. Houses in unsewered
estates use cesspools or septic tanks to discharge waste, which often leak or overflow to
contaminate groundwater, streets, and walkways, threatening drinking water supplies and human
health. The program has connected over 4,000 poor households to the sewerage system since
2003. Increasing access to the poor to the sewerage network is an indictor under the European
Commission's budget support operation.

(b)     Institutional change/strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development)

The project helped to bring about important institutional reforms aimed at increasing the
effectiveness and efficiency of sector management. It supported the formulation of the
wastewater management act 2000 that established the wastewater management authority as an
autonomous governmental entity out of the former wastewater authority, a division of the
ministry of public utilities. It also assisted with the development of two contracts that describe
the responsibilities of the wastewater management authority. These are the contrat de délégation
under which the authority provides wastewater services using the sewerage and treatment
infrastructure leased from the Ministry of Public Utilities, and the convention de maîtrise
d'ouvrage déléguée under which the authority is the delegated contracting agent and contract
manager for new works to implement the national sewerage program. To help the new
wastewater management authority to execute its responsibilities, the project financed training
both in-country and abroad in investment planning, contract management, financial management,
procurement, supervision of operations and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation. It also
assisted with putting into place a new wastewater tariff policy and a mechanism for collecting
revenues through joint billing with the central water authority. This has proved effective; the
wastewater management authority collects about 88 percent of the amount billed. In addition,
the project supported the development of legislation compelling building owners to connect to
the public sewerage system if technically feasible, with the connection provided for free. This
has strengthened the financial position of the wastewater authority, while reducing the risk of
environmental contamination from onsite wastewater disposal.

A review of the effectiveness of the institutional arrangements carried out by external consultants
in October 2006 found that the arrangements are working satisfactorily overall, although reforms
are needed to improve management effectiveness. Especially important are reforms to clarify the
roles and responsibilities of the wastewater management authority in relation to government

and to strengthen incentives for the authority to complete investments on time and within
budget.11

A major project-supported institutional reform was the establishment of a framework for
controlling the discharge of industrial wastewater into the public sewerage system. The project
assisted with defining the standards for industrial effluent, determining incentives to ensure that
industries complied, arranging for monitoring, and establishing the process of negotiating
agreements with polluters. Although slow in starting, the wastewater management authority by
late 2006 had issued nearly 150 discharge permits to industries. It is on track to issue 200 by
July 2007, covering all the major polluters with access to the sewerage network. The wastewater
management authority has regularly monitored the quality of effluent from the industries'
pretreatment facilities and has found it to largely comply with the agreed standards. The
implementation of the industrial pollution control program has helped to reduce contamination of
the environment, while ensuring that the costs are borne by the polluter.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating       N

The risk to development outcome is rated negligible to low.

The government in office in 1994 initiated the national sewerage program, of which the project is
a part. Subsequent governments have consistently backed the implementation of the program,
and mobilized finance from multiple development partners for the required investment. Support
is broad; parliament has played an important role in enacting legislation designed to strengthen
sector management, including the 2000 wastewater management act and its 2004 amendments.
Assistance to build the capacity of the wastewater management authority has helped to create a
strong institutional foundation for implementing the investments and operating the network.

The design of the sewerage system is appropriate for local economic and environmental
conditions. The decision to use well-known technology ensures that the costs of construction
and of operating and maintaining the system are as low as possible, while still achieving the
country's environmental objectives. Choosing relatively uncomplicated technology also ensures
that skills to operate the system are available locally.

One concern is the reluctance of the government to increase tariffs, which have remained
unchanged since 2003, on the grounds that this action would meet with resistance from the
public. While this has not yet affected the ability of the wastewater management authority to
meet its costs, operating and maintenance costs are projected to rise rapidly during the next few
years as the new projects come onstream. Accelerating the house connection program will help
in mobilizing additional revenues. However, this will not be sufficient. A report by an external
consultant indicates that the government will in addition have to raise tariffs by 27 percent in
2007 and then rise in step with inflation to generate the funds needed to fully fund its operations.
The government through a new sector policy letter to be issued in July/August 2007 will indicate
its commitment to raise tariffs to the level required to allow the wastewater management
authority to meet its financial obligations over the long term, while ensuring that services remain
affordable to the poor. Gaining public acceptance of tariff increases will require determined
public outreach explaining the important environmental, health, and economic benefits of the
program and the responsibility of all citizens to contribute to the costs. The alternative is for the
government to fund the operations with tax revenues. This would be acceptable from an
economic perspective, because all inhabitants of Mauritius gain from an improved environment,
even if they do not benefit directly from the sewerage services.

Benefits of investments in capacity building and institutional strengthening are likely to be
sustained. Improvements in planning, contract management, financial management, and
procurement processes have increased the effectiveness and efficiency of wastewater service
provision, enabling it to meet its growing responsibilities. As the demands grow, so will the
need to enhance organizational effectiveness.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)

 Rating      MU

The Bank's overall performance in ensuring quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory. The
Bank's performance in identification was satisfactory. Improving public sanitation in Mauritius
was a priority for the government and citizens of Mauritius to protect human health and the
environment. The government prepared a national sewerage program in 1992 laying out a 20-
year investment program. It requested the participation of the World Bank in financing some of
the investments and in helping with the policy and institutional reforms. The Bank responded
appropriately, providing a sector investment loan, mobilizing concessional finance from JBIC
(through the first accelerated finance agreement with the Bank), and providing extensive advice
with institutional, technical, and environmental issues. The design of the works incorporated
lessons learned from experience in Mauritius and other countries with equivalent environmental
conditions and at similar stages of development.




                                                 18

The Bank's performance in preparation and appraisal was satisfactory in most respects. Detailed
design specifications and costings were prepared. The procurement documents for the first
year's activities were complete and ready for the start of project implementation. The project
implementation plan had been appraised and found to be realistic and of satisfactory quality. An
environmental impact assessment had been undertaken. A comprehensive financial analysis had
been completed. (This was later highlighted by the Bank as a good practice example of financial
analysis.) Risk and mitigation measures were identified. The division of responsibilities
between the World Bank and JBIC were agreed. Appraisal of implementation arrangements was
satisfactory. The Bank's project team decided to provide support through the government's own
systems, rather than through a free-standing project implementation unit. It assessed the
government's fiduciary management capabilities and found them satisfactory, while proposing
measures to further strengthen them.

However, more effort should have been made to ensure that key performance indicators were
specified carefully and that baseline and target values were included for most outcome indicators
in the project's logframe. Greater realism with respect to the amount of time required to acquire
land may have encouraged the team to delay appraisal and Board presentation of the project.
(However, the bank withholding its commitment may have encouraged the government to seek
financing from another source.) These two deficiencies result in a moderately unsatisfactory
rating for Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry.

(b)     Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

 Rating      S

Bank performance in supervision was satisfactory. The Bank fielded 16 supervision missions
during the project's eight and half years of implementation. Missions generally took place two
times a year. Missions lasted about two weeks each and typically comprised two or more
members, including foreign and local consultants investigating a wide range of technical and
operational issues. In recent years supervision missions have generally coincided with the annual
joint government donor review of wastewater sector investment and operational performance. This
has contributed to mutual learning and agreement on solutions to issues, and to enhanced partner
coordination of support to implementation of the national sewerage program.

During the early years, supervision missions focused primarily on progress with institutional
strengthening plans; implementation of policy reforms, particularly of the cost-recovery measures
and the industrial wastewater management program; performance of the house connection
program; and execution of the sewerage works. Much effort was made to explore the costs and
benefits of an alternative technology--injecting wastewater into boreholes--and to encourage the
government to come to a decision. In the later years, supervision focused increasingly on outputs
rather than processes, and on establishing a system for monitoring project impacts on the
environment. It also focused on institutional and policy issues, particularly on progress with
financial sustainability and reaching agreement with industries on effluent pretreatment.
Supervision continued to pay attention to procurement, financial management, and reporting. The
midterm review highlighted the delays in project implementation and proposed several measures to
overcome them. This led to a change in the top management of the wastewater management



                                                 19

authority. The project development outcome and implementation progress were consistently rated
satisfactory.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

 Rating       MS

The Bank's overall performance was moderately satisfactory. In lending, the Bank responded to
the government's request to support its national program to reduce pollution from improper
discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. Drawing on lessons learned from
global experience, it assisted in designing a sewerage system that matched local capacities and
needs. More importantly, the Bank supported a range of policy and institutional reforms
designed to improve the management and financial sustainability of services. The Bank also
helped to mobilize concessional finance for the project from JBIC. However, quality at entry
suffered from weaknesses in the project monitoring and evaluation framework and from an
effectiveness condition that led to delays in effectiveness. Supervision was thorough. In
supervision, the Bank played an important role in maintaining the focus the policy and
institutional issues, which, while meeting resistance, would ensure that the large investment
program would yield its expected environmental benefits. Indeed, representatives of the
government and of other development partners repeatedly mentioned in interviews the important
role the Bank played in moving forward the difficult policy and institutional issues. Bank
supervision missions also regularly reviewed compliance with fiduciary, environmental, and
other safeguards.

The dedicated oversight of the World Bank's task team leader was instrumental in keeping
implementation of the project on track, despite delays in project implementation. His knowledge
of the technical, policy, institutional, and environmental issues of wastewater management was
essential to success. The expertise and dedication of other members of the project team was also
important. Finally, the continuity of the task team leader and of team members was essential in
maintaining a close dialogue with the government project team and with the other development
partners participating in the project.

5.2      Borrower Performance

(a)      Government Performance

 Rating       MS

The government's performance in implementation was moderately satisfactory. Government
ownership and commitment to the national sewerage program was high. The government agreed
through a sector policy letter to a number of policy and institutional reforms, including introducing
tariffs for wastewater services and raising them as needed to cover operating and maintenance
expenses and some capital costs. The government maintained good relationships with all
participating development partners. It also specified the arrangements for operating and
maintaining services once the loan closed. It consistently provided its agreed counterpart funds.




                                                  20

Although the government identified implementation arrangements, it was not able to institute them
until the parliament passed the wastewater management authority act in 2000. During 1998­2000,
the government shifted the implementing agency from the Ministry of Public Infrastructure to the
Ministry of Environment and finally to the Ministry of Public Utilities, before establishing the
wastewater management authority under the Ministry of Public Utilities in August 2001. The
government did not act quickly enough to resolve various issues impeding implementation
progress, such as the dispute over choice of technology for disposal of wastewater. It also failed to
resolve human resource policy issues that limited the ability of the implementing agency to recruit
and retain staff. All these factors contributed to implementation delays. As the entity responsible
for the policy, planning, programming, and funding of wastewater services, the government is
ultimately accountable for sector performance.

(b)     Implementing Agency Performance


 Rating      MS

The performance of the implementing agency--the wastewater management authority--was
moderately satisfactory. The commitment of the wastewater management authority to meeting
the development objectives of the project never wavered. However, during the early years of
project implementation, its top management lost its focus on implementing the agreed project
design, and instead decided to investigate the feasibility of an alternative, untested, technology
that had been recommended by a consultant. Rather than quickly concluding that the alternative
would cost no less than the original design and would pose unknown risks to the environment,
the general manager commissioned a series of studies to investigate the issue. Only when the
Ministry of Environment refused to license the technology and the Ministry of Public Works
dismissed the general manager was a decision made to proceed with the original design.

With new leadership in place, the wastewater management authority performed capably. It
complied with all environmental, social, and fiduciary safeguards. It prepared comprehensive
quarterly project progress reports on time, and used the monitoring information to tackle
implementation challenges. It also maintained good relations with the development partners,
complying with their various procurement, financial management, and reporting requirements.
In addition, it established a permanent office to communicate its mission to the public and
encourage homes and businesses to connect to the system and pay for services. Now it is taking
steps to strengthen its capacity to execute the remaining investments and to operate and maintain
the existing system, including measures to attract and retain qualified staff.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

 Rating      MS

The overall performance of the borrower was moderately satisfactory. The government
demonstrated its commitment to the national sewerage program from identification to
completion, and met its counterpart funding obligations. The implementing agency performed
adequately, particularly in the later years of implementation. It handled procurement and
financial management in accordance with Bank guidelines. It also ensured compliance with the



                                                   21

Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies. However, overall Borrower performance
was marred by the long delays in implementing works, some of which could have been resolved
much more quickly.

6.      Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Regularly reviewing the organizational effectiveness of implementing agencies and quickly
addressing weaknesses can help ensure that agencies perform as effectively as possible. The
wastewater management authority has been an autonomous government entity only since 2001.
A review of its organizational effectiveness has just been undertaken. This has confirmed the
overall benefits of the transformation, while identifying reforms that can further strengthen its
performance.

Introducing joint billing for water and wastewater can increase public acceptance and
minimize costs for administration of the scheme. The project supported the introduction of a
joint billing arrangement with the central water authority. This greatly facilitated bill collection.
It also helped build public acceptance of the charges, as customers can observe the link between
the water consumed and wastewater discharged.

Raising awareness of industries of their responsibility for environmental management and
working with them to find a solution can be more effective than a confrontational
approach. The wastewater management authority held several workshops with industries to
discuss their role in maintaining a livable environment. While industry initially resisted
investing in pretreatment facilities because of their cost, most polluters eventually came to the
conclusion that sound environmental practices make good business sense. Most are now
entering into agreements with the authority on effluent standards.

Laws allowing losing bidders to put an injunction on implementation can result in
significant project delays. In Mauritius losing bidders have had the right to stop projects until a
court can hear and resolve a case. This has sometimes led to delays of a year or more in the
implementation of projects. Mauritius has just enacted a new procurement law that restricts the
use of injunctions. Aggrieved parties will now be able to collect financial damages if they win
their case, but not to stop project implementation.

Public outreach and incentives are essential to encourage people to pay for services that
provides a public rather than private good. The majority of households in Mauritius dispose
of their wastewater in private cesspools or septic tanks. They do not pay the environmental costs
of their decisions, which are borne by the society as a whole. Communicating the importance of
connecting to the public sewerage for environmental management can persuade people to pay for
services that provide a public benefit. Eliminating the capital cost for doing so and requiring
them to connect when technically feasible is also effective.

Encouraging development partners to delegate the supervision of their project funds can
help reduce the transaction costs to government of dealing with multiple partners. The
Bank assumed most of the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the JBIC-financed
investments. This arrangement worked very well, reducing JBIC's cost of supervision and the


                                                 22

transaction costs for government. Encouraging more such collaborative undertakings can further
increase the effectiveness of aid. Of course, the development agency that assumes responsibility
for the project supervision must be sure to have resources and expertise to effectively carry out
its responsibility.

Including from the beginning a well-designed house connection program in the project to
accompany construction of treatment plants will help assure that it achieves its
environmental objectives and financial sustainability. The national sewerage program
contained a component for house connections. However, at the start of the project, little thought
had been given to the measures that would be needed to encourage households to connect. Not
until the government later realized that demand for connections was too low ensure the financial
viability of the sewerage system did the government seek advice on what to do. The measures
the government subsequently adopted--including offering free connections and passing a law
requiring that households connect if feasible--have helped accelerate the connection of new
customers.

Thoroughly preparing a project monitoring and evaluation system prior to the start of a
project will ensure that stakeholders can track progress towards the project objectives as
soon as implementation starts. Ensuring that baseline and target values and sources of
information are specified at the beginning of a project can help the project team assess whether
proposed indicators can be used at reasonable cost, whether others should be considered instead.
The lack of well-specified indicators and baseline and target values in the project logframe has
forced the use of substitute indicators in determining project outcome.

Annex 3: Outputs by Component

Component 1: Montagne Jacquot sewerage system (US$57.2 million)

The outputs of this component are satisfactory.

·      Land acquisition. The government acquired land for the treatment plant in a sparsely
       populated part of the island. The location chosen is especially suitable for discharge of
       the treated effluent, because the barrier reefs that surround most of the island are not
       present at the site. This ensures that the effluent is rapidly diluted with ocean water.

·      Pipelines and sewers. This rising main (the trunk sewerage pipeline) to carry wastewater
       from the Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables pumping stations to the treatment plant was
       built to a high standard at a cost one-third that of estimated at appraisal. The
       unexpectedly low cost was due to the use of international competitive bidding procedures
       that attracted bids from firms that had not earlier bid on such projects. The cost of the
       main sewerage pipeline was much less than expected because the tendering process
       attracted bids from firms that had not earlier bid on such projects. Estimates has been
       based on the offers of firms that had previously supplied sewerage pipelines. The savings
       were used to finance a pilot house connection program that connected over 1,700
       buildings to the Montagne Jacquot sewerage system.

·      Pumping stations. Two new pumping stations were constructed as planned: one at Point
       aux Sables with the capacity to pump 25,000 cubic meters of effluent per day to the
       treatment plant, and one at Fort Victoria with capacity of 23,000 cubic meters per day.
       Both were built on sites used for the primary treatment facilities constructed in the 1970s.
       The older works will remain available to handle wastewater during emergencies, such as
       during a cyclone.

·      Treatment plant. The Montagne Jacquot treatment plant was built to provide primary
       treatment plus disinfection of wastewater. It is treating nearly 40,000 cubic meters of
       wastewater per day, close to its capacity of 48,000 cubic meters per day. The plant also
       stabilizes and dewaters sludge for transport by truck to the Mare Chicose sanitary landfill.

·      Sea outfall. The sea outfall for discharge of the treated wastewater has been constructed
       and is being used. The outfall reaches about 695 meters offshore and includes six
       diffusers set at an average depth of 30 meters spaced 10 meters apart to ensure that the
       effluent rapidly and adequately mixes with the seawater.

·      Industrial pretreatment facilities. About 150 manufacturing plants have individually or
       jointly installed facilities to treat their effluent to an agreed standard prior to discharge to
       the public sewer. Another 50 more are expected to do so by July 2007. At this point, the
       200 most polluting plants on the island will be pretreating their wastewater.

Sector equipment and expertise




                                                    28

The outputs of this component are satisfactory.

·     Studies. All of the planned studies have been completed. These include (a) mapping of
      the sewer networks, (b) a household connection survey, (c) a geographical information
      system and digital software, (d) institutional studies for the midterm review, and (e) a
      project implementation audit. The first of the studies allowed the wastewater authority to
      plan its sewerage investment program and to identify buildings illegally connected to the
      network. The second provided the basis for the household connection pilot. The others
      allowed better management of the investment program and of the sewerage services. The
      awareness raising activities have helped to encourage households and businesses to
      connect to the network and pay for the services.

·     Expertise. The joint water and wastewater billing system was put into place and has been
      functioning well for the past few years.

·     Equipment. The water meters were not procured under the project, as originally planned,
      because the central water authority procured them itself using other sources of finance.
      Instead, laboratory equipment was purchased and installed and staff trained on its use.
      The equipment is being used to regularly monitor the quality of influent and effluent at
      the treatment plant, the quality of the receiving water, and the quality of industrial
      discharges.

Wastewater authority institution building

The outputs of this component are satisfactory.

·     The wastewater authority has been transformed into an effective organization capable of
      effectively implementing the national sewerage program, of providing wastewater
      services to consumers, and of successfully negotiating agreements with industrial plants
      on pretreatment of wastewater. Among other activities, the authority has established a
      system for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the discharge standards and
      regulations.

Annex 4: Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Economic analysis

Given project investment costs of US$56.5 million, actual revenues generated through user fees
during 2004­06 and projected revenues during 2007­36, and estimated environmental benefits,
the project has a net present value of US$8.5 million and an internal rate of return of 12.2
percent. This assumes a discount rate of 10 percent. The main assumptions of the analysis are:
(a) the capital costs are incurred between 2000 and 2006; (b) the lifetime of the civil works is 30
years and the lifetime of the mechanical and electrical works is 15 years, with investment for
replacement taking place in 2021 and 2022; (c) the real annual revenues of the wastewater
management authority rise by 10 percent in 2007, 2008, and 2009 from tariff increases and
increasing household connections and by 3 percent thereafter; (d) the total operations and
maintenance costs remain constant in real terms between 2006 and 2036; and (e) the real value of
environmental benefits rises by 3 percent a year between 2006 and 2036 due to a rising
population, increasing number of visitors, and rising demand for a clean environment linked to
expanding incomes. The table below compares the current estimates of net present value and
internal rate of return for the project compared with the estimates made at the time of project
appraisal.

Cost benefit analysis: Current calculations compared with appraisal estimates (US$)
                                       Current estimates              Appraisal estimate
Net present value                         8.5 million                     30.5 million
Internal rate of return                   12.2 percent                    19.2 percent

The estimates of the economic benefits of the project are lower than those estimated at the
project appraisal stage for several reasons. The first is that estimates of revenues from user fees
are now much lower (by 60 percent) than at appraisal stage. The current estimates are based on
actual performance of the past three years and on projections of future revenue using
assumptions of tariff increases and growth in house connections.

The second major reason for the differences between the current estimates and those at appraisal
is the approach used to calculate the environmental benefits from the project. The current
analysis estimates environmental benefits as (a) avoided medical costs due to reduced incidences
of illness from ingesting contaminated water and food, (b) estimated willingness to pay to restore
and maintain the beaches and lagoons of south Port Louis for full recreational use, and (c)
estimated impact on tourism should Mauritius's reputation for offering a healthy and pristine
beach holiday experience suffer from disease outbreaks or degradation of the lagoon and beach
environment. The current analysis does not include estimates of rising land values--which were
included at appraisal stage. Although land values may indeed rise in the area of the formerly
polluted beaches due to the operation of the new Montagne Jacquot sewerage system, accurate
estimates of the increases are not possible at this time. However, including estimates of rising
land values using the same estimates as used at appraisal stage would increase the net present
value of the project to US$32 million and the internal rate of return to 22.4 percent. In addition,
the current analysis takes a broader approach to estimating the benefits of the project on tourism



                                                  30

revenues than that taken at appraisal stage. In the current analysis tourism revenues are affected
by not only potential outbreaks of epidemics, but also by the general degradation of the coastal
and lagoon environment. All tourists come to Mauritius to enjoy its beaches and opportunities
for water sports. A decline in the quality of this environment would likely have a stronger and
longer-lasting impact on tourism than a transitory outbreak of disease. Overall, the current
analysis estimates the total environmental benefits to be slightly higher (by about 10 percent)
than estimated at appraisal stage.

Although incremental benefits are estimated to be lower than at appraisal stage, so are
incremental costs. The current estimates are based on actual investment and operations and
maintenance costs, and projections of investment costs to replace mechanical and electrical
equipment in 2021 and 2022. Overall, incremental costs are estimated to be about 36 percent
lower than estimated at appraisal stage.

Details of the updated analysis are presented in annex table 1. A summary of the analysis
prepared at appraisal stage, with the results presented in U.S. dollars rather than in Mauritian
rupees. Note that converting rupees to dollars slightly reduces the appraisal-stage estimated net
present value and internal rate of return for the project.

It should be noted that the full cost of collecting, treating, and disposing of wastewater through
the Montagne Jacquot sewerage system--about US$0.19 per cubic meter--is not high by
international standards. For example, the cost of collecting, treating, and disposing of
wastewater in metropolitan Washington, D.C. is about US$0.65 per cubic meter.12




12  Comparing the costs per cubic meter of the Montagne Jacquot sewerage system with that of a U.S. city is
useful, even though labor costs are much higher in the U.S. than in Mauritius. This is because most of the costs of
operating the system are related to the investment costs for the works, spare parts, fuel, and chemicals, which cost
about the same or more in Mauritius than in the U.S. Data on the costs of operating sewerage systems in other
island nations or in developing countries of similar income are not readily available.

WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, 2001/02­2005/06

The wastewater management authority has generated a surplus in each of the five years during
2001/02­2005/06. The authority has also consistently generated positive cash flows from its
core operations, resources it is using to fund operations and maintenance, depreciation, and a
contribution for interest on the investment loans.

The financial ratios of the wastewater management authority reveal its performance over time
and provide an indication of its ability to finance its operations with its revenues. The working
ratio, operating ratio, and surplus in relation to revenue show that the ability of the authority to
generate a surplus has been deteriorating over time. The operating ratio, which is the proportion
of expenses covered by the wastewater fee, has fallen steadily since tariffs were last increased in
2002/03, and has been above 1 for the past two years.

To ensure that the wastewater management authority is able to meet its future obligations--
which will increase sharply during the next two years as the new treatment plants come
onstream--the government plans to raise tariffs and is considering reducing the number of tariff
bands. A tariff study completed in December 2006 shows that to cover operations and
maintenance costs plus 25 percent of depreciation, the charges for households consuming 20
cubic meters per month would have to rise by about 27 percent, from US$3.42 per month to
US$4.35 per month (average tariff of 7 rupees per cubic meter).13 This would represent about
1.3 percent of median household income, and 2.5 percent of income of the poorest 13 percent of
households. Charges for nonresidential consumers would have to rise from 15.5 to 20 rupees per
cubic meter. Achieving full cost recovery would require nearly quadrupling tariffs for residences
(to 17 rupees per cubic meter for the first 20 cubic meters for residences, or US$11.82 per
month). This would not be affordable to the majority of households. It would also require
raising the tariff for nonresidential consumers to 54 rupees per cubic meter. The government
will present its plans in a sector policy letter that is expected to be finalized by July 2007.

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.     Assessment of the Project Objectives , Design , Implementation and Operational
       Experience.



1.1    Project Background:

       The rapid growth of residential and industrial development in Port Louis and the
       surrounding regions had resulted in noticeable pollution of the lagoons at Bain Des
       Dames and Point Aux Sables in which the industrial and domestic sewage was
       discharged untreated through short sea outfalls built in the year 1970 and 1975
       respectively, as Mauritius had no facilities to treat the wastewater.

       To address the problem, the Government developed in 1993 the sewerage master plan
       funded under a grant by the African Development Bank. The objective was to elaborate a
       master plan for the comprehensive development of wastewater facilities to abate and
       control wastewater pollution in the Island of Mauritius and to provide an orderly guide
       for implementation over the plan period of 20 years. The Port Louis area was one of the
       regions highlighted as in need of urgent attention in order to halt the degradation of the
       lagoons and reverse the damage to the environment.

       It concluded that the least-cost solution was to construct two new treatments plants,
       associated works, and marine outfalls, one at Baie du Tombeau to serve the northern parts
       of the city and one at Montagne Jacquot to serve the southern districts. To further save
       on capital and operating costs, the master plan proposed primary treatment of sewage
       with disinfection, with the effluent to be discharged to the sea through long sea outfalls
       and the sludge disposed of at the sanitary landfill at Mare Chicose. Recognizing the
       financial, technical, and institutional challenges of implementing the 20-year national
       sewerage program, the Government sought financial assistance from the World Bank.

1.2    Project Objectives:

       The development objectives of the project were to:

       (a) improve the health and sanitary conditions of the population of the southern districts
           of Port Louis and affected coastal zones, and

       (b) reverse the trend of environmental pollution on the island and in its coastal zone, and

       (c) to implement priority institutional and technical measures identified in the sewerage
           master plan

1.3    Assessment of Project's Objectives

       The following key performance indicators were to be used to assess the Projects
Objectives :
       ·       Percentage drop in waterborne diseases (hepatitis A, eye, and skin diseases).



                                                40

      ·       Improved potable water quality.
      ·       Decreased levels of biological oxygen demand (BOD), organic, and chemical
              contamination in marine and groundwater in selected areas (sea outfall, Port Louis
              lagoon, selected beaches, and coral reefs).

      ·       Wastewater authority reformed.
      ·       Integrated water and wastewater sector policy prepared.

      ·       Montagne Jacquot wastewater treatment works completed.

1.4.1 Design

      The project was based on thorough pre feasibility and feasibility studies and detailed
      design and environmental impact assessment carried out by internationally reputed firms
      in the field of wastewater and environment. These studies formed part of the Project
      components. The Project included studies to cover all aspects of wastewater
      management, from construction and operation of facilities, to financial management, to
      planning for future expansion and possible adoption of tertiary treatment for reuse in
      irrigation systems.

      The feasibility study after thorough investigations of various alternatives, sea current
      studies, etc. offered the least-cost solution to managing wastewater in an environmentally
      friendly manner. It recommended primary treatment with disinfection prior to discharge
      into the sea through an outfall of 835 meters at an ultimate depth of 30 meters. By
      contrast, a sewerage system providing secondary or tertiary treatment would not only
      have been much more expensive to build and operate, it would also have demanded a
      high level of skills to operate. The pumping stations and treatment plant were designed
      using widely-used and readily available technology, which were well within the capacity
      of the wastewater authority to maintain and operate.

      Since Mauritius lacked the hands on experience in the field of wastewater treatment and
      disposal, the Bank advised the Government to include in the design of the Project,
      measures to strengthen capacity of the wastewater authority by way of Technical
      Assistance from international Consultants, training the (wastewater management
      authority) WMA staff in procurement processes. In order to reduce pollution at source,
      the industries were encouraged to sign Industrial Agreements, agreeing to respect the
      discharge limits for disposal of their wastewater into our sewer networks. The design also
      included assistance to develop a joint water-wastewater billing system aimed at ensuring
      that the WMA was able to mobilize resources from beneficiaries at the lowest possible
      administrative costs.

1.5 IMPLEMENTATION OF MONTAGNE JACQUOT SEWERAGE AND SANITATION PROJECT

     This project is a key element of the Sewerage Master Plan, being the southern Port Louis
     counterpart of the Baie du Tombeau project for northern Port Louis. Implementation of these




                                                 41

      two projects will effect significant improvement in the coastal environment and improved
      operational security of the sewerage system. The project comprises the following elements:

    ·   Part A - the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System.
    ·    Part B - Sector Studies comprising mapping of sewer networks, a household connection
        inventory and feasibility study, a geographical information system and digital software
        study, a review of sector institutions, public awareness campaigns in respect of the national
        sewerage program, and carrying out a project implementation audit and other related
        studies.

    ·   Part C - Institutional strengthening of the WMA.

The physical component under part A comprise:

    1. Two new pumping stations at Fort Victoria and Point aux Sables to deal with existing and
        forecast additional flows from the regions of central and Southern parts of Port Louis,
        Grand River North West (GRNW), lower Beau Bassin and Coromandel including the
        Industrial regions of Plaine Lauzun, Pailles Guibies, Coromandel and La Tour Koenig
        and transfer them directly to Montagne Jacquot Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP).
        The proposed arrangement maximizes use of existing gravity sewers leading to the
        existing pumping stations at these locations.

    2. The rising main is continuous from Fort Victoria to Montagne Jacquot with wastewater
        from the Point aux Sables being directly injected into the rising main. Wastewater from
        additional future gravity sewerage from the Pailles Guibbes areas along the route of the
        rising main will be similarly injected into the rising main by an additional pumping station.
        The rising main comprises 3.67 km of DN 900 pipe from Fort Victoria to Point aux Sables
        and 4.29 km of DN 1200 pipe from there to Montagne Jacquot. The existing pumping
        stations at Fort Victoria and Point aux Sables will be retained for use in emergencies.

    3. Wastewater treatment works at Montagne Jacquot providing primary treatment with
        disinfection of the treated effluent by chlorination before discharge to the sea through a sea
        outfall. The plant will have an initial capacity of 48,000 m3/d with provision for future
        expansion to 60,000 m3 /d. Sludge will be stabilized using lime and dewatered and disposed
        of in the Mare Chicose sanitary landfill.

    4. Sea outfall of 835 meters long terminating with a diffuser section at an average depth of 30
        meters below sea level.

Implementation was originally intended to be by means of four construction contracts: one for
construction of rising main, one for construction of WWTP, one for construction of pumping
stations, and one for construction of sea outfall including 3 years operation and maintenance
following completion. The contract for the WWTP and pumping stations now includes one-year
operation and maintenance following completion.




                                                  42

The tendering procedures of the Central Tender Board Act 2000, and the procedures for
procurement of goods and services of the World Bank and JBIC were strictly followed. The
conditions of contract was in accordance with FIDIC 4, adapted to suit the requirements of the
funding agencies.

The environmental mitigatory measures emphasized in the environmental management plan of the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report formed part of the obligations of the contractors
for the construction of the rising mains, the WWTP and pumping stations and the sea outfall. The
required health and safety regulations were duly respected. The Ministry of Environment at
irregular intervals was inspecting the sea outfall site in order to ensure that the contractor and the
WMA were not contravening the EIA requirements. The above enabled the WMA to comply with
the environmental management plan for implementation of the main pipeline, treatment plant, and
sea outfall.

All the three works have been constructed with minimal environmental disturbance and no social
disruptions. The Project has been regularly audited, both by internal and external auditors.

The construction of the WWTP and the two new pumping stations commenced on 1 March 2005
and was completed on 31 January 2007. The diversion of the wastewater flows to the newly
constructed treatment plant at Montagne Jacquot started on 15 January 2007. The rising main,
the two pumping stations of Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables as well as the newly constructed
WWTP at Montagne Jacquot were successfully commissioned on 31 January 2007.

The WWTP and the pumping stations are under one year of operation maintenance and the
defects liability period, which started on 1 February 2007and will expire on 31 January 2008.

1.6 Operational Experience

Average flows of 41,645 cubic metre/day is being treated at the WWTP against the design flows of
48,000 cubic meters per day. The treated wastewater has met 95 percentile compliance for COD,
and 100 percentile for BOD and TSS. The stabilized sludge is reaching the 28% dry solids content,
which is the requirement for disposal at the landfill site at Mare Chicose. No complaints have been
received from the inhabitants around the pumping stations and the treatment plant and neither
during the transportation of sludge to the landfill site.

The contractor is forwarding monthly progress reports on the operation and maintenance of the
Plant including laboratory test results for the parameters listed in the previous section of the report.
The composite samplers purchased by the WMA under the project is at present stationed at the
inlet and at the outlet of the chlorination tanks. Regular samples are collected by the WMA
laboratory personnel, one half of which is handed over to the contractor for testing and the other
half is tested at the WMA's lab. This helps to check the contractor's accuracy of test results.

2        Assessment of the Outcome of the Project against the agreed Objectives

The agreed objectives listed in section 1.3 are assessed as follows :




                                                  43

2.1    Percentage drop in waterborne diseases (hepatitis A, eye, and skin diseases)
       The percentage decline in hepatitis A, eye, and skin diseases--could not be tracked
       because Mauritius, not being affected by epidemics due to waterborne diseases , has no
       measures in built to link public sanitation to health. Furthermore we are not in the
       presence of any reports regarding health hazards linked to the previous mode of discharge
       of wastewater into the sea.

2.2    Improved potable water quality

       The aim of the Project was to protect the marine environment by stopping the discharge
       of untreated wastewaters into the sea. Therefore the main scope of the Project was to
       transfer the wastewater from their present location points of discharge (short sea outfalls
       at a depth of 3 meters) to the new wastewater treatment Plant located at Montagne
       Jacquot. This did not have any link in improving the potable water quality.

2.3    Decreased levels of pollutants discharged into the ocean

       Prior to the Project's implementation, untreated wastewater with BOD ­ 200~300 mg/l,
       TSS of 150~250 mg/l, faecal coliforms of 3.5 x 10^ 6~2.2 x 10^ 6 was being discharged
       into the marine environment. These were not in accordance with the standards for
       discharge into the ocean.

       Tabulated below are the outcome of the Project after its implementation .

       17 million cubic meters of treated wastewater disposed into the ocean.




                                                44

     The Ministry of Environment is supervising an environmental audit, consisting of a team
     set up at the level of the Government to monitor the impacts of the wastewater projects
     being implemented under the national sewerage program. Bi-annual reports are
     generated, addressing the marine environment, the benthic water quality, the underground
     water quality , the lagoonal water quality etc. These are compared with the results of
     those of the previous years, thereby tracking the improvements in the Project areas. These
     reports are also discussed at the joint donors meetings which are held twice a year.

     The quality of the coastal ecosystem in the vicinity of the Baie du Tombeau outfall that was
     closed in late 2000 has improved dramatically. Annual average concentrations of chemical
     oxygen demand have fallen by 60 percent, total phosphorous has shrunk by half, and total
     nitrogen has declined to imperceptible levels.14 Quality of water in the lagoon of the Baie
     du Tombeau has also improved significantly, and now complies with coastal water quality
     guidelines. The lagoon has been declared safe for swimming, the coral reef is recuperating,
     and the number and diversity of marine life are increasing. The impact on the coastal and
     marine environment of the closure of the old outfalls and the opening of the new one will
     be noticeable in about 5 to 6 years, the environmental audit team will monitor these
     changes/improvements.

2.4  Wastewater authority reformed

     The WMA has been set up in accordance with the Waste Water Management Authority
     Act in August 2001, which was adopted by parliament, proclaimed and gazetted. The
     "convention de maîtrise d'ouvrage déléguée" and "contrat of delegation" between the
     Government and the WWA were signed in September 2001. A Board of Directors has
     also been appointed.

     The restructuring and staffing of the WMA have been carried out and completed. In
     particular, given the scope and complexity of the national sewerage program, and as
     advised by the World Bank, the WMA staff has been strengthened with experienced
     national professionals in the field of project management, finance and accounting. Steps
     are also being taken to reinforce the operation and maintenance section to efficiently
     operate and maintain the WMA assets.

     The WMA is now a much more effective organization, being capable of planning and
     managing large investment programs, operating and maintaining the sewerage system,
     informing the public of its role in fostering a better environment, and responding quickly to
     the demands of consumers.

     Additional planned reforms are already in their initial stages. These include:

   · Clarity of WMA's roles and responsibilities in relation to other Government entities,
   · Strengthening its human resource policies to enable it to attract and retain qualified staff,




                                                45

   · Improved accountability framework to enable the authority to avoid delays in
     implementation and to meet future challenges.

     The institutional performance of the wastewater sector has improved since its autonomous
     status. Revenues generated through tariffs now cover all operating and maintenance cost of
     the wastewater management authority and the interest on the investment loans. Prior to the
     WMA Act, the costs of operations were met entirely through allocations from the
     Government budget.

2.5  Integrated water and wastewater sector policy prepared.

     Joint billing of water and wastewater services was designed and is being implemented as
     one of the outcomes of the Project.

2.6  Montagne Jacquot wastewater treatment works completed:

     The construction of the WWTP and the two new pumping stations commenced on 1
     March 2005 and was completed on 31 January 2007. The diversion of the wastewater
     flows to the newly constructed treatment plant at Montagne Jacquot started on 15 January
     2007. The Rising Main, the two Pumping Stations of Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables
     as well as the newly constructed Wastewater Treatment Plant at Montagne Jacquot were
     successfully commissioned by the 31 January 2007.

     The test results on the influent and effluent flows tabulated above shows that both the
     influent and the effluent flows comply fully with the environmental standards for
     discharge into the ocean. The moisture content of the dewatered sludge is also complying
     with the requirements of the landfill site in Mare Chicose.

     The WWTP and the pumping stations are under one year of operation maintenance and
     the defects liability period, which has already started from 1 February 2007 and will
     expire on 31 January 2008.

3    Evaluation of the Borrowers performance during the preparation and the
     implementation of the Project and Lessons learned.

3.1  Borrowers Performance

       The Government of Mauritius is represented by the Ministry of Public Utilities. The
       Government disbursed the counterpart funding in accordance with the loan Agreement.
       The Government's commitment to the implementation of the national sewerage program
       never wavered. High level of importance was attached to the protection of the
       environment and public sanitation.

       The Government tracked the performance of key indicators and presented these values
       in the quarterly progress reports. It reported not just on implementation of the physical
       works, but also on progress with establishing the tariff system and agreeing with



                                               46

     industries on the discharge of effluent. The Government observing the slow pace of
     connecting houses to the sewerage system, adopted the policy of free house connection,
     while at the same time ensuring regulations are in place for compulsory connection to
     the sewer system.

     The Government agreed through a sector policy letter to a number of policy and
     institutional reforms, including introducing tariffs for wastewater services and raising
     them as needed to cover operating and maintenance expenses and some capital costs.
     Revenues generated through tariffs now cover all operating and maintenance cost of the
     wastewater management authority and the interest on the investment loans. Prior to the
     Project, the costs of operations were met entirely through allocations from the
     Government budget.

     It identified implementation arrangements and followed through on its commitment to
     strengthen the implementing agency, including transforming it from a Government
     division to an autonomous Government entity. The Government maintained good
     relationships with all participating development partners. It also specified the
     arrangements for operating and maintaining services once the loan closed. It consistently
     provided its agreed counterpart funds.

     Government has consistently backed the implementation of the program, and mobilized
     finance from multiple development partners for the required investment. Parliament has
     played an important role in enacting legislation designed to strengthen sector
     management, including the 2000 wastewater management act and its 2004 amendments.
     Assistance to build the capacity of the wastewater management authority has helped to
     create a strong institutional foundation for implementing the investments and operating
     the network.

3.2  Implementing Agency's Performance

     The commitment of the WMA to meeting the development objectives of the project
     never wavered. The tendering procedures of the Central Tender Board Act 2000, and the
     procedures for procurement of goods and services of JBIC was strictly followed. The
     Conditions of Contract was in accordance with FIDIC 4 , adapted to suit the requirements
     of the funding agency (JBIC) .

     The Environmental mitigatory measures emphasized in the environmental management
     Plan of the EIA report formed part of the obligations of the contractors for the
     construction of the rising mains , the WWTP and pumping stations and the sea outfall .
     The required health and safety regulations were duly respected.

     The Ministry of Environment , at irregular intervals were inspecting the sea outfall site in
     order to ensure that the contractor and the WMA were not contravening the EIA
     requirements. The above enabled the WMA to comply with the environmental
     management plan for implementation of the main pipeline, treatment plant, and sea
     outfall.



                                            47

All the three works have been constructed with minimal environmental disturbance and
no social disruptions. The Project has been regularly audited, both by internal and
external auditors. Both the plant and sea outfall are operating in accordance with the
highest environmental standards. Project accounting and auditing have consistently been
conducted in accordance with the development credit agreement

The WMA complied with all environmental, social, and fiduciary safeguards.
Comprehensive quarterly project progress reports were prepared and submitted in time.
The WMA also maintained good relations with the development partners, complying
with their various procurement, financial management, and reporting requirements. In
addition, a permanent public relations section has been established to improve
communication with the public and deliver customer satisfaction. A house connection
and customer care unit has also been setup for improving the rate of house connections
and to promptly deal with the customers.

The number of house connections connected to the Montagne Jacquot sewerage system
(under World Bank finance) has risen by 1,700, while the number connected nationwide
has expanded from about 24,000 in 1997 to 60,000 in late 2006. At the end of 2006,
about 30 percent of Mauritians are connected to the sewerage network, compared with 20
percent in 1997.

The WMA under the Bank's financing has effectively trained its staff both in-country
and abroad in procurement processes and financial management. A new wastewater
tariff policy and a mechanism for collecting revenues through joint billing with the
central water authority has been successfully implemented under the guidance of the
Bank staff. The WMA is now collecting about 88 percent of the amount billed. In
addition, regulations were drafted for compelling building owners to connect to the
public sewerage system if technically feasible, with the connection provided for free.

A framework for controlling the discharge of industrial wastewater into the public
sewerage system has been established. Regulations for meeting the standard for
discharge into sewers has also been passed, which has effectively compelled industries
to have their own pre treatment facilities in order to meet the standards. The WMA by
late 2006 has issued nearly 150 discharge permits to industries and by 2007, all the 200
polluting industries will be issued with permits for discharge into sewers.

The WMA is regularly monitoring the quality of effluent from the industries' pre
treatment facilities and it is found that most of the time they comply with the agreed
standards. The implementation of the industrial pollution control program has helped to
reduce contamination of the environment, while ensuring that Industries comply with
the regulation.

However, we need to acknowledge the delay in Project completion due to which the
loan closing date needed to be extended twice. Reasons for the delays are expounded
below.



                                       48

3.2.1  Delays in Implementation:


         The physical components of the Montagne Jacquot project (Part A) have been delayed
         mainly for the following reasons :

       (i) Wastewater authority considered an alternative technology of injecting treated
           effluent into the island's lava tunnels instead of discharging the effluent to the sea.
           The idea of the alternative design arose in response to a recently-completed
           geological survey that revealed the locations of numerous lava tunnels that could
           potentially receive the wastewater, saving the cost of the long sea outfall. However,
           to thoroughly explore the option, a feasibility study and a detailed environmental
           assessment were carried out. This required 18 months.

       (ii) The alternative proposed by WMA (injection of the treated effluent via boreholes)
           was finally rejected by Government in late May 2001, following the decision of the
           Ministry of Environment not to grant the EIA license for the proposed alternative of
           injection. The additional studies to consider alternative effluent discharge options
           took more than 18 months and, this by itself, has delayed the project by at least the
           same duration.

       (iii) A further delay of nearly six months was caused due to the finalisation of the list of
           prequalified contractors for the construction of the WWTP and the outfall. Other
           causes of delay are related to the slow procurement process, which resulted in late
           award of the consultancy contract for the review of detailed design, tender documents
           and supervision of the works contract.

       (iv) The delay also arose due to litigation by a losing bidder on the works. Tenders were
           launched to the 6 pre-qualified bidders on 23d July 2002. Five bids were received at
           the Central Tender Board on 22 October 2002. The consultant submitted his final
           evaluation report in April 2004 and the WMA was in the process of seeking the no
           objection of the Central Tender Board for the award of the contract, when one of the
           losing bidders served a notice dated 16 June 2003 on the Central Tender Board, the
           WMA, the Ministry of Public Utilities, and the consultants requesting that the
           evaluation process be stopped and that all bids be re-evaluated.

       After a lengthy legal process, on 18 November 2004, the Supreme Court judgment set
       aside the applicant's case, with cost.

  (v) The transformation process also resulted in changes in procurement processes, transfer of
      WMA staff, recruitment of additional staff to fill the vacancies created by the outgoing
      WMA staff, adapting to new roles and responsibilities etc . The specification of roles and
      responsibilities through the contract of delegation with the Government, guided the
      WMA in adapting to its new role.


  (vi) The Environmental Sewerage and Sanitation Project proved to be more involved and
      complex than originally foreseen. Moreover the wastewater authority going through the




                                                49

        process of change to the wastewater management authority led to change in procurement
        process, which also added to the delays.

3.2.2 Lessons Learned

    (i)    Once the Design of a Project has been finalized and agreed upon by all the
           stakeholders concerned, it should not undergo unwarranted changes/review.

    (ii)   Once the process and technology has been finalized, investigating new and unused
           technology which would result in delays to the project, cost overruns and loss of
           revenue to the authority and loss of benefit to the end user should be avoided.

    (iii)  Detailed investigation should be carried out in the feasibility/detailed design phase in
           order to opt for the most appropriate and user friendly technology suitable for the
           Project .

    (iv)   Taking due note of the lengthy procurement processes, tender documents and
           specifications should be clear and precise, thereby not leading to numerous
           clarifications being sought both by the bidders and the WMA. This would also help in
           preventing unsuccessful bidders from litigation.

    (v)    Clear and precise tender documents would also help in minimizing claims from the
           contractors for extension of times & costs , leading to time and cost overruns.

    (vi)   Timely award of works and completion would also reduce the effect of inflation on
           the cost of the works.

    (vii)  Once the decision for an award has been made, the decision should be implemented,
           irrespective of threats and litigation from unsuccessful bidders. This issue has already
           been addressed by the Government in the new Public Procurement Act 2006 (Act 33 of
           2006) has been approved by the Parliament and will be proclaimed shortly . This Act
           imposes restrictions on unsatisfied bidders requesting to review of the ongoing
           procurement process. Furthermore this Act also makes provision for the public body,
           certifying the urgent public interest considerations, require the procurement
           proceedings to proceed. In the event the litigants wins their cases will now be entitled
           to financial compensation, but will not be able to stop the project implementation. In
           the event they loose the case , then their deposit will be forfeited.


4       Evaluation of the performance of the Bank and the co financers

4.1     The World Bank's performance

        The World Bank's involvement in the program was highly beneficial to the Government in
        implementing one of the major recommendations of the master plan. The Bank , with their
        wide experience in various developing countries in the wastewater sector has contributed to
        the improvement of the environmental and sanitations conditions and in the institutional
        building and creating the WMA for the efficient managing and operating of the country's
        assets, which are being constructed under the national sewerage program.

        The Bank brought the Government's focus on the institutional development and policy
        reforms that were essential for the long-term sustainability of the national sewerage
        program. The Bank assisted and guided the WMA and the Ministry of Pubic Utilities in


                                                 50

designing the tariff system for wastewater services. This being the key performance
indicator in the loan agreement, the Government had to comply in its implementation.

Prior to the Project, the WWA was a division under the Ministry of Works. In accordance
with the Central Tender Board Act all contracts exceeding 1 million Mauritian rupees
needed the Central Tender Board's approval. Most of the works being in excess of the limit
prescribed in the Central Tender Board Act required the Central Tender Board's approval.
The WWA therefore had very limited powers for implementing works. Therefore, it was of
critical importance to establish an autonomous WMA, with new responsibilities for project
and facilities management. By the new WMA's status we now have authority to implement
works up to the limit of 25 million Mauritian rupees. This has indeed facilitated the WMA
in its implementation of the projects. The Bank's foresight in recognizing the need for
autonomy for the then WWA, helped the MPU to effectively address this issue and limit
delays in implementation.

The Bank, in order to encourage the polluters to treat the wastewater at source, advised and
guided the WMA/Government to develop a program to encourage industries to pretreat their
wastewater to the defined standards before discharge to the public sewerage system.
Currently 150 industrial discharge permits have been issued and the WMA is planning to
have issued all the 200 polluting industries with discharge permits by June 2007. The Bank,
in its regular missions, not only addressed the Project which it financed, but also assisted the
WMA in establishing the house connection program, an offshoot of the national sewerage
program for the overall financial stability of the WMA. Furthermore, in order to expedite the
house connections and to ensure the financial sustainability of the sewerage systems, the
Bank financed the pilot house connections program providing free connections for
households. This has led to a much higher demand for connections than previously, where
the owner had to bear the cost of connection which averaged from 20,000~50,000 Mauritian
rupees. The new policy of free house connection helped to ensure both a long-term revenue
stream for wastewater services and reduced damage to the environment and human health
from uncontrolled seepage of sewage into groundwater and the sea.

The Bank also helped the wastewater authority to recognize the importance of public
outreach in encouraging households and businesses to value and pay for wastewater services
and to accept the inevitable disruptions associating with constructing the works. The Bank
financed an information campaign exercise, which included audio and video campaigns
promoting the importance of good sanitation and a waterborne sewerage system . This has
finally resulted in the wastewater management authority establishing a permanent unit for
public relations.

Most importantly, the continuity of the Bank's task team leader and of the team members
on the Project from its initial stages of Project appraisal to its implementation and the
completion has enabled the WMA and the Government to develop close relations with the
Bank which is reflected in the successful completion of the Project.




                                          51

    The mutual understanding between the Bank and the WMA and the transfer of knowledge
    and skills from the Bank staff to the WMA has enhanced the capacity building in the WMA
    for the future projects we envisage.

    Even though the Bank does not have an office in Mauritius, the Bank is the only funding
    agency which regularly makes its supervision missions to Mauritius. In these missions, the
    Bank staff have always imparted a wealth of knowledge in diverse fields, be it social,
    financial, contract management or technical . They have always offered unbiased advice be
    it on the choice of technologies, alternate options proposed by bidders and foreign suppliers,
    etc. Bank supervision missions also regularly reviewed compliance with fiduciary,
    environmental, and other safeguards.

    The dedication of the World Bank's task team leader and his foresight was instrumental
    in keeping implementation of the project on track, despite delays in project
    implementation. His knowledge of the technical, policy, institutional, and environmental
    issues of wastewater management was essential to success. The expertise and dedication
    of other members of the project team was also important.

    Most importantly, the open mode of communication between the WMA and the Bank staff
    reduced the bureaucracy in obtaining the Banks approvals and no objections. This enabled
    the WMA to act with no delays.

    The Bank also helped the Government in securing a soft loan for the program from a
    parallel financier, the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) (formerly, the
    Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund). This helped the Government to meet its
    objectives of financing the program with the cheapest sources of finance possible.
    Furthermore the Bank and the co-financing agency's procurement procedures being more or
    less similar, this helped in better co ordination among the concerned stake holders involved
    in the Project .

    The Bank actively participates in the Donor co-ordination meetings set up at the level of the
    ministries' technical divisions, by contributing useful measures for tracking and monitoring
    the national sewerage program and in proposing key performance indicators for measuring
    the success of the national sewerage program implementation. During one of the donor co-
    ordination meetings, the need to measure the achievement of the national sewerage
    program's objectives were discussed at length, resulting in the setting up of the
    environmental audit committee, chaired by the Ministry of Environment. Last but not the
    least, the Bank, at no point in time has ever interfered in any way whatsoever, in the
    evaluation and the award process.

4.2 The co-financer--JBIC


    The Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) funded the major component of the
    Project in the sum of US$33.6 million as soft loan when compared to the World Bank's loan
    of U$12.4 million. This enabled the Government to obtain the cheapest source of funding.
    JBIC, recognizing their lack of staffing, relied mostly on the World Bank to supervise the


                                               52

   components funded 100% by them . However, due to the team relation between the JBIC,
   the World Bank, and the WMA , this means of supervision was carried out without any
   major problems.

   The only problem which the WMA encountered was in obtaining JBIC's feedback and their
   no objections. JBIC, being very bureaucratic, all requests needed to be formally forwarded
   in their respective formats to JBIC via courier. The lack of continuity of the JBIC staff on
   the Project also resulted in delays in obtaining feedback on critical issues such as approval
   for awards, etc.

   JBIC's procurement for services required quality based procurement process to be followed.
   The WMA considers that better value for money could have been obtained if quality and
   cost based procurement process would have been followed.

   At no point in time were there any disagreements between the Banks and the WMA, and the
   Project has been successfully completed .

5  Proposed Arrangements for the operation of the Project

   Under the contract de delegation, the WMA has the responsibility to operate and maintain
   all the wastewater assets owned by the Government.

   The transition arrangements for the operation and maintenance of the Montagne Jacques
   sewerage system are complete.          The works contractor is currently operating and
   maintaining the system until January 2008, a period of one year following the handover
   of the facilities to the Government. Under the works contract, the contractor has already
   submitted all the relevant O&M manuals, procedures and training material. The WMA's
   O&M staff have attended training sessions provided by the contractor for the operations
   of the equipment and systems. Currently the WMA's O&M personnel are obtaining
   hands on experience from the contractor operating the plant.

   Studies carried out by independent consultants funded by the European Commission,
   have compared various options including outsourcing and in house operation, and have
   demonstrated that in-house O&M is cost effective and more economical. The wastewater
   management has already taken steps for recruiting additional staff for the O&M of the
   plant. Interviews have already been carried out and the O&M will be shortly
   strengthened.

   Under the ongoing technical assistance funded by the European Commission
   consideration is being given for training the WMA's staff in the design and process
   aspects of the WWTP. In December 2006, WMA has taken over the O&M of the first
   WWTP at Grand Baie, which treats wastewater to tertiary level. Compared to Grand
   Baie, the WWTP at Montagne Jacquot is much less expensive to operate, and it does not
   demand a high level of skills to operate.

   The ultimate aim of the WMA would be to operate and maintain in-house the St. Martin
   WWTP, which is designed to treat flows up to 69,000 cubic meters to tertiary level and
   the effluent is disinfected by ultaviolet radiation prior to re use for irrigation purposes.
   The WMA's laboratory is also being strengthened in order to face the challenge of
   monitoring compliance of these treatment plants with those of the standards for



                                             53

discharge. The WMA is confident that we shall meet the ultimate goal of creating a
technical hub of knowledge and expertise in the field of wastewater treatment , collection
and disposal.
