which\n            constructs a wastewater treatment plant (WWT) at Montagne\n            Jacquot in Mauritius to improve sewage disposal and minimize\n            industrial pollution. During project design, a buffer zone\n            will be created around the WWT plant site perimeter to help\n            reduce noise and offensive odors. If trees are planted in\n            the buffer zone, potential odors carried inland by sporadic\n            onshore breezes will also be further diminished. Noisy\n            equipment will be enclosed. During construction, contractors\n            will deploy silt curtains to minimize disturbance of\n            sediments on the sea floor; locate and place anchors to\n            avoid damage to the reef and massive corals; prevent and\n            control discharges from vessels; contain waste fuel oil and\n            retain garbage until properly disposed of onshore; provide\n            emergency spill containment facilities; light construction\n            vessels to ensure against collision with vessels in coastal\n            waters; plan work hours to minimize nuisances and\n            disturbance to the community; and plan trench digging to\n            coincide with slack tide--or conditions which minimize\n            deterioration in water quality. During operation, the plant\n            manager will ensure that effluent quality is monitored daily\n            and problems remedied as soon as possible; ensure that\n            sludge is dewatered and regularly removed to the landfill;\n            ensure rapid diagnosis and repair of industrial and\n            wastewater leaks, spills, and blockages, and alert\n            communities to health hazards."}, "docdt": "1997-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
