EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.0.  Introduction
The Government of Mauritius commissioned the Sewerage Master Plan stud! in 1992.
and one of the key recommendations was that the present sewage disposal arrangements
for the Port Louis South and Lower Beau Bassin / Coromandel areas should be
improved by constructing a waste water treatment plant at Montagne Jacquot.  By
implementing the Monta-ne Jacquot project. public health and sanitation. the terrestrial
and marine environment around Port Louis would be improved and protected: and the
project would help to restore sustainable development of economic activities in tile area
aftected by the current sewage disposal arrangements.   The project also aimed to
minimise industrial pollution by recommending pre-treatment options ftor industrial
effluents destined for the new waste water treatment plant.
Additional studies carried out in 1994 and 1996 suggested a preliminar' design 'for the
Montagne Jacquot plant based on disposal of treated effluent through an ocean1 outfall.
and re-use of treated effluent for irrigation of west coast agricultural land.
Subsequently. the Waste Water Authority commissioned three studies. The first was to
design the various components of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation
project consisting of pumping stations. transmission mains pipelines and an ocean
outfall. and to carry out an environmental impact assessment (EIA). The second was to
evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of re-use of treated effluent for
irri-ation: and the third. to review the institutional and financial arrangements necessar%
ftor implementing the sewerage master plan for Mauritius. The present document
reports the results of the EIA carried out bv Black and Veatch Interniational.
Environmental Consultancy Unit. and should be read in conjunction with the Montagne
Jacquot planning and preliminary design reports, and the reports on the economic
feasibility of waste water re-use for irrigation as well as the institutional studies.

2.0.   Brief description of the Montagne Jacquot project
.\ nex\ waste xvater treatmiient plant will be constructed at Montagne Jacquot to treat
domestic. commercial and industrial waste water from the Port Louis South. Lower
Beau Bassin and Coromandel areas. which together include the main industrial areas
and residential areas in southwestern Port Louis.  The project includes ne%N pumping
stations at Fort Victoria and at Pointe aux Sables to replace the existing works and
ocean outfalls. risinul mains to deliver the waste water to the Montagne .lacquot
treatment plant. as well as a new outfall at Montagne Jacquot for disposal of treated
effluent to the ocean.
3.0.   Policy, legal and administrative framewvork.
The Environmental Protection Act (1991) of Mauritius provides the legal framework
for implementing the National Environmental Policy. which aims to foster harmonN
between qualitv of life. environmental protection and sustainable development for
present and future generations of Mauritians.  In order to comply with the EPA. all
major developments and infrastructure projects now require an Environmental Impact
Assessment. The present EIA therefore follows the guidelines issued from the MEQOL
for carrvin- out and reporting an EIA. Additional guidelines which apply to coastal
developments have also been incorporated into the EIA study.
As the Montagne Jacquot project will be jointly funded by the World Bank. the
Oxverseas Economi:c Cooperation Fund (OECF) and the Government of Nlauritius. the
environmental impact assessment requirements of all three were incorporated into the
EIA programme for the Montagne Jacquot project. The common features ol all three
seis of guidelines provide for:
0 a description of the project components and the environment potentially affected b\
the proposed project.
0  idenitification of significant positive and negative environmental impacts of the
project and assessment of their significance.

O  an analysis of alternatives for the project.
0  identification ofn measures to mitigate environmental impacts and proposal for a
mitigation plan.
C  an environmenital monitoring plan.
In addition. the World Bank and OECF echo the provisions of the National
Environmental Policy of Mauritius in highlighting the need to address particular issues
in the EIA.   These include biodiversitv protection. coastal and marine resources
management. industrial hazards. land settlement and cultural issues. The 'orld Banlik
also requires recommendations for environmental management and training to be
included in the EIA. Consequently. this EIA report includes all these requiremiienits. to
produce a coherent evaluation of the Montagne Jacquot project suitable for decision
making bv all the relevant funding organisations.
4.0.   The environment affected by the project
T'he environment affected by the project consists of the drainage area to be serviced by
the waste water collection svstem. It consists of approximately the southern halt' of the
Port Louis Sewerage System. which includes the built up areas of Port Louis South.
Cassis. Belle Village and the Plaine Lauzun Industrial Zone: and the lower Beau Bassin
reuion includingw the Coromandel and La Tour Koenig Industrial Estates. the Pointe aux
Sables communitv and residential areas to the south. The affected area includes
sections of four of the countrv's nine administrative districts, namely the Black River.
Plaines Wilhems. Moka and Port Louis.
The coastal waters likely to be affected by the new discharge from the ocean outfall.
stretch from the Pointe aux Sables reef to south of Montagne Jacquot. in an area some
X)( m  to I km  ottshore.  The area currently affected bv the existing discharge
arrangements stretches from Port Louis to the southern end of the Pointe aux Sables
reef. with impacts visibly apparent along the shoreline. in shallow lagoon waters and on
the sea floor.

5.0).   Principal significant impacts associated with the project
Impacts of the project were evaluated according to their magnitude. duration and extent.
and those w hich were found to produce highl' significant impacts were further
revxiewed. to determine whether thev were reversible. irreversible or cumnulative. the
likelihood of'their occurrence and potential risks also associated with their effects.
It was concluded that the overall effects of the Montagne Jacquot project wvill be
overwvhelmingly positive, since it will result in major improvements in quality of life
and environmental quality in the areas affected bv the present discharge arrangements.
In turni these improvements are likely to result in a reduction in public health hazards.
and revitalised ecoInomy1N in the tourisin. property. real estate. and services sectors in the
currenitlv affected area. The improvements in coastal water quality will also assist in
the rehabilitationi of coastal ecosvstems in the long term.
From the results of the environmental impact analysis it was evident that the principal
silnificant negative impacts of the project on the community would occur during the
construction phase. during laying of the main transmission pipeline if the land-based
option was adopted. when congestion of traffic, noise. dust and general disruption will
cause considerable irrconvenience. In addition. even although the effluent will meet
anticipated standards for water quality. there will be longer term  impacts on water
quality and benthic communities off Montagne Jacquot in the effluent discharge area
which will be significant. but limited in extent to the immediate discharge area. The
outfall location off Montagne Jacquot is one of the few breaks in the barrier reef
encirclinue Mauritius where minimal damage to reefs and lagoon waters from an effluent
discharue would be experienced.  The potentiallv affected benthic and planktonic
communities at the site were evaluated and no conservation-worthy species or unique
habitats which could be a particular concern were found. The proposed treatment plant
processes. including disinfection. will produce an effluent which should consistentlv
maintain water quality in the discharge area suitable for recreational swimming and
divino. Thus. the discharge is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on
activities whiclh currentlv occur in the area. Because the areas off Fort Victoria and

Mon,)ta,guIe Jacqtuof Sewe rage a,tdu Sm Iljaltion Project  Euiviromnenlal Impclt hn    !,L4'Nessmenl1
Pointe aux Sables currently impacted by effluent discharge are so seriously degraded.
and the proposed disposal area off Montagne Jacquot has no significant conservation-
wsorthy resources. the project is not expected to adversely affect biodiversit\ protection
in Mauritius.
Approximatelh I0 ha ot land will be used for constructing the Monta-ne .Jacquot works.
The land is currently undeveloped. unoccupied. and not used for anv beneficial purpose
such as agricultural production or recreation. Also. it is immediately adjacent to the
Petite Verger prison wlich detracts from its value for alternative purposes. Construction
of the treatment plant will not result in displacement of any residential. business or
commercial properties. If the land-based option for the transmission mains pipeline is
adopted. it will also be necessary to purchase easements across a small number of
private properties. No residences. business or commercial properties will need to be
relocated. and following construction of the pipeline. the land can be returned to its
CLurrenit use.
6.0.   Mitigation plan
Based oni the results of' the environmental impact review. mitigation measures were
identified to reduce or avoid negative impacts and enhance beneficial impacts. The
mitigation plan devised for the Montagne Jacquot project aims to ensure that all project
activities are manaoted so as to reduce or avoid negative environmental impacts and
enhance positive and beneficial impacts. The plan identifies mitigation activities to be
carried OUt in each phase of the project. from planning. to design. through construction.
operationi and decommissioninu- stages.  The responsibilities for carrying out the
mitiuation measures are allocated to individuals or groups involved in the program.
The most important mitigatorv activities identified for the Montagne Jacquot project are
directed at:
I ) minimisin- the disruption caused bv construction phase activities. particularly along
sections of routewavs where land-based sections of the transfer pipelines will be
placed:

4) recommending appropriate regulator. monitoring. and liaison procedures to assist
the WWA in pollution cointrol and monitoring of industrial and sew-age effluellts.
5) optimising economic benefits for the currently affected communities following
improvements in environmental quality.
The main groups ol people identified with responsibilities for mitigatioln *ere: the
Waste Water Authoritv. design engineers. the resident engineer during construction. the
contractors. the WWT plant manager. plant operators and lAPs. The actions required
to meet mitigoation objectives are summarised in a series of tables for eachi uroup. The
costs of implementing the mitigation plan are also discussed.
7.0.   Environmental management and training
The environmental management and training  requirements of the pro'ject are
substantially dependent on the extent to which recommendations in the parallel
institutional study for the Waste Water Authority. the preliminary report of which was
recently completed by Consulting Engineering Services (India) PVT LTD. The
regulatorv control of industrial activity is in its infancv in Mauritius. with nexw
wastewater legislation about to be formulated. Once the legislative framekxork has been
consolidated. pollution control and a monitoring strateg can be put in place. together
vith the necessary capacity building both in government and the private sector. Action
plans for developing and implementing appropriate pre-treatment facilities tor industrial
vxastes can then also be devised and supported by for example. pricing incentive
sclhemes to encourage recvcling and treatment of wastes bv industrv.
Adequate environmental management of the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant. will
depend partly on the success of the WWA strategy for re-organisation. capacity
building  and  implementation  of environmental management measures. These

developments will also be essential to assist in successful implementation (it' other
seweraTe and sanitation projects planned for Mauritius over the next twentN years.
8.1).   Monitoring programme
Although framework programmes for monitoring effluent discharges and effluent
quality control are in the process of formulation. legislation controllino wastewater
discharges has yet to be finalised. Until the legislation is in place and dexelopment of
the quality control and pollution control divisions within the WWA is complete. it will
be difficult to  brinuT existinu  industrial wastewater discharges  undel control.
Nevertheless. the present studv makes recommendations for monitoring which is likely
to be necessary to comply with regulations for effluent quality discharged to sexers and
coastal waters. as well as for monitoring coastal water quality. This information will
also benefit design and location of future wastewater treatment plants in :91auritius.
9.0.   Conclusions and recommendations
The analvsis of the current condition of communities and coastal waters in the Port
Louis area carried out during the environmental impact assessment indicated that the
proposed Montagne Jacquot project will have overwhelming positive and beneficial
enxironmental and socio-economic impacts.  If improvements are not made in the
present sitLatioii. it is clear that the worst affected communities in Bain des Dames and
l'ointe aux Sables will remain seriouslv economically disadvantaged and wNill have to
contiinue to tolerate a seriously degraded environment which impacts their qualit% of life
on a daily basis. For many vears the communities in the Bain des Dames and Pointe
aux Sables areas have witnessed the decline in coastal water quality and disappearance
ol' local fisheries resources. and have repeatedly made appeals to government to address
the problem of sewage and industrial waste disposal off Fort Victoria and the Pointe
aux Sables reef' The proposed Montagne Jacquot project will respond to those appeals
and will result in the correction of many of the degraded conditions.

Although a variety of negative impacts associated with the project have been identified.
the,  are  viost notabl associated with the construction phase. and mill be particulark
acute durietnoa the construction of the land-based transmission mains pipelile if thls
optioin is adopted. These impacts are temporary however. and small in comparison with
the improvements in quality of life which will be experienced by the affected
comml1llunlities in the loiin term.
The effluent discharge from the new ocean outfall off Montagne Jacquot w\ill also
negatively impact benthic communities in the immediate discharge zone. Because the
main frinuing reef surrounding much of Mauritius is not present offshore tiom the
Montagne Jacquot site. it is an ideal location for an ocean outfall. The relatively
exposed nature of the proposed discharge point and impacts already sustained b\
benthic communities from the exposed conditions and discharges from the existing
outfalls. have resulted in relativelv low species diversity. with only common and
ubiquitous species present. The benthic communities in the proposed discharge zone do
not have conservation significance and are not a concern with respect to conservation of'
hiodiversitv resources in Mauritius as a whole.
The Montagne Jacquot WWT plant will be located on a I Oha site which is currently not
used for agriculture or anv other beneficial purpose. There will be no need to relocate
any residences. business or commercial properties. Access to the shore tor recreation
w;ill be maintained despite the presence of the plant. and so ensure that current
recreational activities along the shoreline need not be disrupted.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Environmental Impact Analysis are
therefore that:
(a) A newv WWT plant should be built at Montagne Jacquot. The plant should consist of'
preliminary treatment. primary treatment and disinfection works. The primarx sludge
should be dewatered with belt filter presses and stabilized with lime. The facilities
should be constructed at Montagne Jacquot because it is an excellent site for such a

facility. and certainly the best available because of its relatively remote nature. and
because it avoids the need to relocate any properties.
(b) The' construction of the transfer pipelines along the main road between Fort Victoria
anid Pointe aux Sables is acceptable. despite traffic congestion and disruptioni during the
coinstruction period. The construction of the transfer pipeline across the mtoutl of the
(ranad Ris er North W'est would also be acceptable. although the offshore alternative
would result in highier construction cost. a number of technical uncertainties. some
limited neuative environmental impacts in the lagoon and difficulties of' carryinc out
routine maintenance and repairs in future. Once construction is completed. both of the
buriedl pipelines would typically function without significant communit) impact.
(c) The ocean outfall should be constructed off Montagne Jacquot to a depth of' -',m and
distance of 645m from the shore to achieve a 14.000 fold dilution of' effluent at the
nearby sensitive target locations. This level of dilution together with primar% treatment
and disinfection of effluent will ensure that all components of the discharge from the
\A'UT plant are diluted to acceptable levels to achieve the desired water quality- in
receiving waters.
(d) As institutional capacity building and legislative provisions assist the driN,e towards
improved pre-treatment of industrial waste waters at source. and as the %alue of fresh
water continues to increase. that wastewater re-use for irrigation ot' west coast
auriculture should be considered in conjunction with upgrading the Montagne .lacquot
\WA'WT plant to secondary treatment.
(e) With the implementation of the Montagne Jacquot project. a comprehensi\e tronitorinu
programme along the lines recommended in the EIA will be implemented. with the
assistance of Albion Fisheries Research Centre and outside help if necessar\  The
intormation collected will be invaluable for future desiun of treatment '\o\rkls and
makinu decisions about appropriate treatment options at other sewerage and sanitation
projects in Mauritius.
et) That capacity building for environmental management within the W'aste Water
Authority will be provided as an integral component of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage
Project.

1.0   INTRODUCTION
1.1   Background
The Government of Mauritius launched the Sewerage Master Plan Study in 199' with
the main objectives being to identify long tern solutions for the safe disposal ot human
and industrial waste waters in Mauritius. One of the projects of the Sewnerage Master
Plan is the Montagne Jacquot Environmental Sewerage and Sanitation Project which
concerns the treatment and disposal of the waste waters from Port Louis South and
Lower Beau Bassin/Coromandel (Figure 1.1). The waste water treatment (WWT) plant
is to be located at Montagne Jacquot. south of Port Louis and near Pointe aux Sables.
This studv was undertaken for the- Waste Water Authority (WWA). Ministry- for Public
Infrastructure' . Government of Mauritius (GOM).
Between 1994 and 1996 a number of studies were conducted on the pollution loads
from the industrial zones of Coromandel and Plaine Lauzun as well as at the Fort
Victoria and Pointe aux Sables treatment works (SETEGUE-ERM-SIGM.A-SAM-
SOON 1994-1996). On the basis of these surveys SETEGUE proposed a preliminary
design of the WWT plant at Montagne Jacquot based on an ocean outfall to dispose of
treated effluent. with a view to re-using the treated effluent for irrigation of the Westem
coast agricultural land.
Subsequent to the SETEGUE studies. an environmental assessment of effluent disposal
into the lagoonal waters at Pointe aux Sables and of the proposed outfall at Montagne
Jacquot was done by SOGETI (1994-1996). This study also highlighted the frauilitv of
the Pointe aux Sables lagoon ecosystem and the extent of eutrophication presently
occurring there.
In Februarv 1997 a Pre-feasibilitv study on the Montagne Jacquot Environmental
Sewerag,e and Sanitation Project was undertaken by Magoarou and Sam-Soon. This
investigation resulted in a number of conclusions and recommendations for the project.
The main conclusion was that the implementation of the Montagne Jacquot Project is
necessary to protect public health. water resources and lagoonar water. particularly at
Pointe aux Sables.

Montagne Jacquiot Sewerage and Sanitation Project       Environmental Inmpact 4ssessment
The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Montagne Jacquot Project forms the basis
of the present document. A separate report on the Detailed Design and Preparation of
Tender Documents is also being undertaken and will be submitted at a latter stage. The
Baie de Tombeau Project. which is dealing with treatment and disposal of residential
and industrial effluents north of Port Louis. also forms part of the Sewerage Master
Plan. A Feasibilit' Study for this project was carried out by GIBB (Mauritius) in
December 1993 and was followed by a marine survey of the coastal region north of Port             a
Louis (CSIR 1996).
1.2   Objectives of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project (Study I)
Studv I of the Montagne Jacquot Environmental Sewerage and Sanitation Project
covers the detailed design. preparation of tender documents and environmental impact
assessment. whilst Study 2, which is being carried out by a French Consultancy. BRL
In-enierie. will address the "Sanitary. Technical and Economic viability of re-use of
treated effluent for irrigation purposes":
The Terms of Reference for Study I were as follows:
a) study the available data:
b) review the waste water treatment plant alternatives:
c) review the treated effluent and sludge disposal options,
d) collect the necessary additional data including field and laboratory tests to finalise
the design criteria:
e) prepare an environmental impact study for the project,
f) recommend the most cost effective and environmentally sound alternative:
g) update the feasibility report and:
h) prepare the detailed design (Phase 1) of the selected waste water treatment plant.
related infrastructure and buildings. fencing etc.
The main aims of the Montagne Jacquot Project are to protect and improve public
health and sanitation of the population around Port Louis. protect the terrestrial and
marine environment. and to maintain sustainable development of economic activities of
the country.
In addition. the project aims to minimise industrial pollution by recommending
pretreatment of industrial effluents. to reduce the organic and suspended solid loads to
the future waste water treatment plant.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project        Environmental Impact Assessment
2.0   Montagne Jacquot Sewerage Project
2.1   Project Purpose
Of the three main sources of water pollution in Mauritius, two are from waste water
sources. The first causes contamination of domestic water supplies as a result of
overflowing of sewage during cyclones and floods. and the second from disposal of
industrial waste (e.g. dyes) into natural water bodies (MOQL 1991). This emphasises
the need to improve the present state of sewage management in Mauritius. The third
source of water pollution is from contamination of underground water by leaching of
aorochemicals, pesticides and fertilisers.
The purpose of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project is to provide a
long termn solution for the treatment and disposal of waste water in the Port Louis South
and Lower Beau Bassin/Coromandel area. to achieve pollution abatement to a level that
allows the disposal of treated effluents in the natural environment and to maintain
sustainable development of economic activities of Mauritius. This project is part of the
overall Sewerage Master Plan (1992) for Mauritius. the main objectives of which are to
provide long term solutions for the safe disposal of human and industrial waste waters.
2.2   Project Location
The Island of Mauritius is located at approximately 20°S and 57°E and covers an area
of 1 860 km2 (Figure 2.1). The coastline is only 200 km long and is almost completely
surrounded bv fringing coral reefs. except for opposite river mouths. estuaries and a
15.5 km stretch on the south coast. Port Louis is the capital citv of Mauritius and is
one of the oldest settlements in the country. Port Louis was first sewered in the early
1880's and the sewerage system extended and reinforced in the 1920's and from the

There are four main sewer networks in operation in the country. two of which serve
Port Louis and discharge at Fort Victoria and Roche Bois outfalls. In the Port Louis
area there are three sewage outfalls discharging sewage into the sea: Fort William. Fort
Victoria. and Pointe aux Sables (see Figure 1.1). In the Port Louis system. preliminary
treatment (screening and disintegration of solids) is carried out at Roche Bois and Fort
Victoria. and includes mainly the following built-up areas (see Figure 1.1):

Industrial Estate and for the domestic effluent of Beau Bassin North. This s% stem also
serves the La Tour Koenig development and the Pointe aux Sables CHA Estate.
The trunk sewer serving the zones flows by gravity from Lower Beau Bassin via
Coromandel and La Tour Koenig to the Pointe aux Sables pre-treatment works (coarse
screening only). From there it is discharged via a 0.65 m diameter asbestos cement
outfall. just beyond the fringing reefs of Pointe aux Sables.

2.3   Project Description
2.3.1  Project Overview
The Montagyne Jacquot Sewerage Project will consist of new sewaae pump stations at
the existing Ft Victoria and Pointe aux Sables works. a transmission main to carrv the
waste water from the pump stations to the treatment plant. a new waste water treatment
plant located at Montagne Jacquot. and a new ocean outfall to discharge the treated
effluent to the coastal waters. This section of the report describes alternative facilities
that were developed and evaluated for each of the major project components. and
recommendations which resulted from the evaluations. In some cases the evaluations
have not been completed. so no definite conclusions are presented.
2.3.2  Pumping, stations and Transmission Mains
2.3.2.1 Pumping Stations
The Gibb sewerage master plan proposed constructing a new pumping station near the
GRNW. and a second pumping station at the Pointe aux Sables works. In the
preliminary design it was concluded that a better alternative would be to eliminate the
proposed new St Louis pumping station, and construct a new pumping station at the Ft
Victoria works instead. The second pumping station will be constructed at the Pointe
aux Sables works.
For the new Ft Victoria pumping station the possibility of modifying the existino
structure and installing new mechanical and electrical systems was considered in detail.
It was concluded that the cost of modifying the old station would exceed the cost of
constructing a new one. and the old one should be retained for possible use in
emergencies.
For the two new pumping stations. three options for pump station configurations were
considered:
Option 1: a traditional wet well/dry well station similar to the existing pump station at
Fort Victoria.
Option 2: a standard submersible pump station configuration using a wet well. with
submersible pumps mounted on rails. submerged in the wet well.

Option 3: a wet well/dry well station which minimizes the wet well volume by- utilizinc
variable speed pumps controlled by a flow meter placed on the influent sewer.
2.3.2.2 Transmission Mviain Roiutes
Two principal alternative routes for the transmission main to carrv the waste water from
Fort Victoria to Montagne Jacquot were developed and evaluated. The routes were as
follows (refer to Figure 1.1. Section 1.0):
Alternative Route I
This route would pass from the Ft Victoria pumping station. cross the Grand River
Northwest (GRNW) in the vicinity of the two bridges. across the area near the La Tour
Koenig industrial estate. then along a series of small roads running parallel to the coast
road through the Pointe aux Sables community to the Montagne Jacquot site. Other
features of this route are:
0 The new pumping station at the Pointe aux Sables works could also discharge
directly into the transmission main. thus eliminating the need for a second
transmission main from that location to Montagne Jacquot.
0  Waste water from Lower Beau Bassin. Coromandel. La Tour Koenic industrial
estates, and future sewerage systems for places such as Richlieu and Petite Riviere
would be connected to the existing sewer system leading to the Pointe aux Sables
works. From there it would be pumped into the transmission main.
0 The transmission main from the St Louis Pumping Station to the Richlieu header
manhole would not be needed.
0 The gravity sewer from the Richlieu mranhole down to the Montagne Jacquot site
would not be needed.
0 The cost of pumping would be less. since the elevation of the Montagne .lacquot site
is approximately 40m lower in elevation than the treatment works at Richlieu.
The negative impacts of Altemative Route I would be mainly during the construction
phase since the building of a pipeline of this nature would pass along a heavilN
congested main road.
Alternative Route 2
The second alternative route would be offshore. almost directly from Fort Victoria
southwest. across the shallow waters and the mouth of the Grand River Northwest to

the lagoon at Pointe aux Sables. through the lagoon parallel to the shore. then back
inshore and to the Montagne Jacquot site at the southern end of the lagoon. This route
would reduce or eliminate all of the problems associated with construction of this
transmission main through the developed community and along the most congested
roadwavs and through commercial districts.
The advantages of this route are primarilv associated with avoiding the disruption of
the community and tratffic congestion during construction.  It would also be
significantly shorter. Negative impacts would be that it would probably have a
significantly higher construction cost than Alternative Route 1. and it would have
temporary. adverse impacts on the lagoon environment during construction.
2.3.3  Review of Waste Water Treatment
Waste water treatment processes are grouped into categories according to the level of
treatment provided.  Treatment levels provide progressively greater health and
environmental protection bv removal of greater amounts of impurities. but at a
progressively greater cost.
Preliminarv Treatment - consists of removal of large, bulky materials and grit. Bar
screens (course or fine) are used to remove large materials such as boards. rags. and
plastic items which are not readily biodegradable and which can cause problems with
mechanical equipment. Bypasses are usually required so that a screen can be taken out
of service for repairs or maintenance. Finer screens collect smaller suspended materials
which normally pass through the bar screens. Grit (e.g. sand) can be removed bx.
gravity in settling basins or can be separated from the flow with centrifugal devices.
Primarv Treatment - consists of sedimentation basins which remove suspended matter
by allowing it to settle to the bottom. From the bonom the settled matter is collected
with a raking mechanism and pumped to the sludge processing facilities i.e. primary
sludge collection. Floating matter such as oil and grease is skimmed from the surface
of the basin and pumped to the sludge processing facilities.
Secondary Treatment - consists of biological processes. using microorganisms. which
remove suspended and dissolved organic matter and other impurities from the waste
water. It also includes a secondary settling process to separate the microorganism
population  from  the treated flow.   The most common types of suspended

.Iontagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitatiaen Project        Environmental Impact A.ssessment
microorganism population systems are aerobic lagoons. activated sludge units. and
extended aeration units.
Factors which can inhibit or disrupt the biological activity include the presence of toxic
substances. large fluctuations in flow and strength of the influent waste water. and large
fluctuations in the concentration of total dissolved solids. temperature or pH. Any of
these conditions which have an adverse impact on the microbiological population can
reduce the treatment efficiency.
Tertiarv treatment - a process that removes nitrogen and phosphorous. and greater
removal of suspended solids and dissolved organic matter than secondary treatment.
Disinfection - a process which kills microorganisms and lowers the concentration of
bacteria to levels considered safe for public health. and for the health of the ornoanisms
present in the receiving waters or disposal sites. Water quality standards typically
establish the allowable concentrations of bacteria in the plant effluent. and disinfection
processes suitable for achieving those standards can be selected. In the United States
disinfection of the treated waste water effluent is almost universallv accomplished by
the addition of chlorine. Alternative chemical agents can be used. such as ozone or
other halogenated compounds: and other disinfection processes are available. such as
exposure to ultraviolet light.
2.3.4 Water Quality and Treatment Standards
It is possible to design waste water treatment processes which will meet virtuallv anv
water qualitv standards or effluent standards. In general, as the level of treatment
increases. both the capital costs for the facilities and their operating costs increase
exponentially. In Mauritius water quality standards have been adopted for rivers and
streams used for water supply. for ground water and for lagoons. but not for the ocean
water along the coast. No water quality standards have been established for water used
for irrigation or for various types of recreation.
2.3.4.1 W ater Oualitv Standardsfor Ocean and Irrigation Waters
Following consultation with the WWA. Black & Veatch International concluded that
the water quality standards proposed by the Gibb sewerage master plan for ocean waters
and for irrigation water should be used as the basis for the design of the Montagne
Jacquot works. The water quality standards presented in the Gibb sewerage master plan

international guidelines. taking into account the characteristics and sensitivity of the

specified and monitored regularly for waste water treatment plants. and which are used
as the basis for design of treatment works are COD. BOD(5). N. P and TSS. The
remaining parameters are not normally found in municipal waste w;aters in
concentrations which would cause the indicated standards to be violated. or which
might interfere with the operation of a typical waste water treatment plant.
2.3.4.2 Microbiological Standards
The recommended microbiological standards presented in the Gibb sewerage master
plan were based on EC standards for direct contact recreation. and South African
standards for sea water. Standards recommended for recreational waters are: faecal
coliform < 100/lOOml (80% of samples): faecal coliform < 2000/lOOml (95%  of
samples): faecal streptococci < 100/lOOmi (900/o of samples).
Concentrations of faecal coliform in waste water varv widelv. Typical concentrations
indicated by previous studies are:
0  either 108/1 00ml for effluent that received essentially no treatment. or 1Ol/ I OOml for
effluent that received primary and secondary treatment. but no disinfection.
(SOGETI 1995)
0  the faecal coliformn concentration in raw sewage was typically between lO"'l OOml
and 10/ lOOml; industrial waste waters would tend to produce a raw sewage
concentration closer-to 106/1OOml: the effect of biological treatment processes was
to reduce the concentration by 2 to 3 logarithm units which would result in a
concentration of around 104/lOOml or 103/lOOml (Magoarou and Sam-Soon 1997.
prefeasibility report)
The concentration of coliform organisms in waste water which receives onlx primary
treatment and no disinfection will typically be in the range of IO /I OOml or IO 1 OOml.
Therefore. the effluent from a primary treatment plant cannot meet the microbiological
standards for body contact recreation mentioned above. The concentration of coliform
organisms in a waste water which receives secondary treatment and no disinfection will
meet the standards at times, but not with any certainty.
2.3.4.3 Waste Water Treatment Plant Effluent Standards
No standards for the performance of municipal waste water treatment plants in terms of
effluent limits have been formally adopted by the Government of Mauritius. Ministry

for the Environment. The water quality standards for the receivinu water (ocean) and
for irrigation water were therefore used to select the treatment processes for the
Montaane Jacquot works.
2.3.5  Waste Water Treatment Plant
Several consultancies have provided planning and development inputs to the oVlontagne
Jacquot WWT plant over the last few years. However. the final recommendations for
the major components of the project were developed bv Black & Veatch International
following detailed review of all of the previous planning and preliminary design
reports. The following'descriptions of design criteria and alternative treatment facilities
and effluent disposal methods do not include details of much of the preliminar) work
carried out in previous studies. The reports containing the details of the previous work-
are listed in section 10.
2.3.5.1 WVacxie Water Flow
The first phase of the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant will be designed with capacity to
treat the flow projected to occur in 2005. The average daily dry weather flow was
projected to consist of 16.000 m3/day of industrial waste water and 32.000 m3/'dav of
domestic and commercial waste water in that year. The pumping stations at Fort
Victoria and Pointe aux Sables. the transmission main from those pumping stations to
the Montagne Jacquot site. and the primary hydraulic structures at the WWT plant will
be designed with capacity to deliver the peak wet weather flow projected for the vear
2017. The peak wet weather flow was projected to be 3.9 times the average daily flow.
and the total average daily dry weather flow for 2017 was projected to be 6(0.000
m3/day.
2.3.5.2 Waste Water Characteristics
The waste water to be treated by the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant will consist ot' a
combination of domestic. commercial and industrial waste water produced in the
service area. The fraction of total flow projected to be produced b! industries will
decline from  33 percent in 2005 to approximately 25 percent in 2017.  The
characteristics of the waste water produced by the domestic and commercial sources in
the service area are expected to be typical of normal domestic sewage.  The
characteristics of the industrial waste water will be that of textile industries. since they
will produce approximately 90 percent of the total volume of industrial waste water.

affected the sizing and selection of treatment processes considered in the rev'iew and
evaluation of waste water treatment and disposal alternatives.
The detailed study by SETEGUE (1996). on the industrial effluents being discharged
into the existing sewer network. recommended a number of actions that should be
undertaken by responsible authorities to control the undesirable impacts of the
industrial  waste waters on the sewerage system  and on the receiving waters.
SETEGUE made recommendations for several specific industries to have pretreatment
works which would remove solids. equalize flow and remove suspended solids and
-rease before discharging their effluent. The most recent evaluation of the components
of wastes discharged from a selection of industries in Mauritius is shown in Appendix 1.
which summarises results from a range of food processing. paint. and textile houses.
The management of industrial waste water from the industries in the study area is an
important component of the overall program to control pollution from the waste waters
produced in the service areas. The Waste Water Authority recently commissioned an
institutional / legislative review to address the problems of updating industrial waste
management legislation and capacity building in government to implement pollution
control legislation. A review of the sources and characteristics of industrial waste water
in the Montagne Jacquot service area is presented in Appendix Q. This review also
identifies those industries which will be required to take actions to control their waste
water discharges.
2.3.5.4 W;isle Water Treatment Alternatives
Several altemative processes were considered in determining the components for each
of two scenarios. Alternative processes were evaluated using factors such as estimated
construction and operating costs. reliability, ease of operation. complexity of equipment
and required levels of maintenance.
The level of treatment provided by either of the two scenarios can be changed in the
future if there are changes in the effluent,quality requirements. The treatment processes
proposed for phase I of the two scenarios are considered to be appropriate for both the
two altemative effluent disposal methods. The plant will be designed so that the waste
water flows through all process units and out through the ocean outfall under the force
of gravity. Pumping will only be required for sludge management. a plant industrial
water system. and an internal sewer system.

could be added at anv time in the future. with minimal change required in the existing
works.
Preliminarv Treatment - Flow would enter the plant at a headwork-s structure where
screens and grit removal equipment would be located. Since corrosion is often a
problem at headworks structures. the components would be constructed of corrosion
resistant materials. Hydraulic elements would be designed to minimize turbulence.
Screening - Bar screens would separate large objects from the influent flow- to protect
pumps and other rotating equipment. Drum screens would be provided to remove
smaller solids to prevent blockages in sludge pipes and protect the belts on the filter
presses. The screens would be cleaned with spray nozzles which would deposit the
residue in portable containers. The containers would be manually transported. the
residue combined with the grit then transported to a sanitary landfill for disposal. A
bypass channel would be provided for use when a screen is out of service for repairs or
maintenance.
Grit removal - Grit would be removed by equipment using centrifugal forces. The grit
collected in the unit would be pumped to a cyclone and washing machine. The cleaned
grit would be deposited in portable containers. It would be manually transported to a
hopper for holding and eventual discharge into an open truck for transport to the
sanitarv landfill for disposal. The underflow from the washed grit would be returned to
the plant flow.
Primarv Treatment - From the headworks structure the flow would be divided equally
among four primary clarifiers utilizing the principal of geometric symmetry. Provision
would be made to allow minor adjustments to the flow to each primary clarifier using
manually adjustable gates or similar device. A chemical addition point would be
provided upstream of the flow splitter to allow injection of chemicals to aid in settling
the solids in the primary clarifiers. The chemical would be thoroughly mixed before the
flow splitting operation.
Primary  sedimentation - Four circular primary sedimentation basins wvould be
constructed in phase 1. Each would include a center feed well. peripheral weirs.
rotating sludge collector with rakes to move sludge to a central sump and a surface
mounted skimmer arm to move floating solids, oil and grease to a collection sump.

llfon-agne Jacquo! Sewerage and Sanitation Project      Environmental Impact 4.ssessment
Disinfection - Disinfection would be provided using chlorine solution and an open
basin to provide satisfactory contact time. Chlorine gas would be withdrawn from
cvlinders of liquid chlorine under vacuum, through chlorinators to chlorine injectors
which would form the chlorine solution. The chlorine solution would be injected into
the waste water flow at the influent to the chlorine contact basins. Two basins would
be constructed to operate in parallel so that either one can be taken out of serxvice for
repairs or maintenance. The chlorine feed rate would be paced by a flow meter placed
on the effluent channel of the basins. The feed rate would be adjusted manually in
order to maintain a chlorine residual target of about 0.1 mg/I.
Flow measurement - The plant flow would be measured with a venturi flume or weir
placed in a channel at the effluent of the chlorine contact basin. The depth of flow
would be measured with an ultrasonic instrument which would convert the depth into
flow rate. The flow would be recorded and displayed at the instrument. located at the
flow meter.
Ocean Outfall - The effluent from the plant would be discharged by gravity to the open
sea off the coast of Montagne Jacquot through a pipe line leading to a series of six
diffusers at an average depth of -30 m. The outfall would be approximately 645 m out
from the shore line. and the diffusers spaced at 10 m intervals at the outer end. to
prevent intermixing, before the plumes reach the surface.
Slud-e Processing - Positive displacement primary sludge pumps would deliver the
sludge collected from all clarifiers to two holding tanks. The holding tanks would be
mixed with recirculating pumps.
The sludge processing equipment would be located in a separate building. divided into
a chemical storage and handling area. control room and filter room. From the sludge
holding tanks the sludge would be pumped to belt filter presses for dewatering. The
belt filter presses would require chemical feed equipment for conditioning the sludge.
and a pressurized water system for belt cleaning. The filters would be controlled with a
computer based svstem provided as part of the filter package. The filtrate would be
collected in the plant sewer system and returned to the headworks. The dewatered
sludge would be carried on a conveyor belt to a mixer where it would be stabilized with
lime. The facilities would be designed to allow sufficient lime to be added and mixed
with the sludge to raise the pH above 11.5 for 30 minutes. This would kill pathogenic
bacteria and control odors. From the mixer the sludge would be loaded into trucks
which would haul the dewatered. stabilized sludge to a sanitary landfill for disposal.

removing these substances. Providing treatment to reduce those substances to meet the
standards for irrigation would add significantly to the total cost of treatment. and was
considered to be totallv unfeasible. These substances are typically contained in
industrial waste waters. and are best controlled at the source. by preventing their
discharge into the sewers.
The critical effluent limits which determined the recommended treatment processes
were BOD(5) of 30 mg/l. TSS of 45 mg/I. and faecal coliform concentrations of
1 000/1 00ml.
For this scenario. the plant would be designed so that the waste water flows through all
process units under the force of gravity. Pumping within the plant would only be
required for sludge management. a plant industrial water system. and an intemal sewer
system. The effluent could flow by gravity out through the ocean outfall. It would
have to be pumped through pipelines to agricultural areas for imrgation.
The processes for Scenario 2 would consist of preliminary treatment workls including
bar screen and grit removal, followed by primary sedimentation basins. The primarv
sedimentation process would be followed by aeration basins for secondary treatment. A
final process for disinfection would be provided. probably consisting of chemical
treatment using chlorine.  When not used for irrigation. the effluent would be
discharged through an ocean outfall at a depth of 20 m.
Sludge produced by the primary clarifiers would be dewatered using a belt filter press
and stabilized with lime. Secondary sludge would be thickened with a dissolved air
flotation unit and dewatered with the primary sludge. Preliminary treatment. primar
treatment. primary sludge processing, and disinfection works for Scenario 2 would be
essentiallv identical to those described for Scenario I.
Secondarv Treatment - The effluent from the primary treatment units would be carried
to two rectangular activated sludge basins. The basins would be configured to provide
an anoxic zone to allow for denitrification and aerobic zones for treatment. Oxvgen
would be supplied by platform mounted. slow speed rotating surface aerators.
Flow would pass from the aeration basins to circular final clarifiers which would be
furnished rotating scrapers with rakes to move the settled sludge to a central hopper.
From the secondary clarifiers the flow would pass to the chlorine contact basins which
would operate in the same fashion as described for Scenario 1.

A portion of the effluent from the aeration basins would be separated and sent to a
dissolved air flotation unit for thickening. The thickened waste activated sludge would
be combined with the primary sludge and dewatered on belt filter presses. The
dewatered sludge would be stabilized with lime. deposited in hoppers. then carried by
truck to a sanitary landfill for disposal.
Return activated sludge pumps for all secondary clarifiers would be located in a
common pump building. A backup pump would be provided for each pair of sludge
pumps. The pumps would be centrifugal pumps. discharging to a common header
which would carry the return sludge to the influent to the aeration basins. Pump
operation would be controlled with manually adjustable timers.
2.3.6  Effluent Disposal
Two alternative effluent disposal methods were considered in the preliminar\ planning
and development of the Montagne Jacquot project. One disposal alternative wvas to use
the effluent for irrigation of agricultural lands; the second. to discharge the effluent to
the ocean.  The level of treatment provided by the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant
would be determined by the water quality required for the altemative disposal options.
Thus. two waste water treatment scenarios were developed. One was based on water
quality standards for ocean waters: the other. for irrigation water.
2.3.6.1 Irrigation
A study was commissioned by the Waste Water Authority in early 1997 bv BRL
lngenierie to determine the feasibility of using municipal treatment plant effluent for
irrigation in Mauritius. Preliminary findings of the study included a review of the
sanitary. technical and economic viability of re-use. It was estimated that the effluent
from the initial phase of the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant would provide enough
water to irrigate approximately 1300 hectares, and it was determined that there
definitelv was a need for this water. The approximate increase in sugar production due
to the additional water supply would be approximately 13 000 tonnes per year if all that
land were put into cultivation. It was noted. also. that the use of treated effluent for
irrigation could also release fresh water for more valuable uses such as potable or
industrial water supplies.

'vlanyagnie Jalcquot Sewerage and Sanitationt Project     Environmental Impact .4ssessment
The preliminary findings of the feasibility study also identified a number of factors that
would affect the use of the Montagne Jacquot plant effluent for irrigation. The salinity
ot' the water and its sodium content are too high to be used directly for irrigation: the
effluent would need to be diluted bv a ratio of approximately I volume of effluent to 4
volumes of natural water.  Salts in irrigated water supplies can harm plant growth
physically b- limiting the uptake of water. and chemically by metabolic reactions
caused  by toxic constituents.   However, specific  limits of permissible  salt
concentrations for irrigated water cannot be stated because of the wide variations in
salinity tolerances among different plants e.g. for groundnuts the tolerance level is 1620
mg,/I TDS. and for potatoes it is 660 mg/I TDS (DWA 1986).
The Montagne Jacquot site is located near the coast at a relativelv low elevation: the
effluent would have to be pumped to between 50 and 100 meters higher elevation.
Fields currently under irrigation are near the site. but limited in size. The planters in the
vicinity are typically small to medium in size.
The feasibilitv study also concluded that the effluent would have to be treated to
secondary treatment standards, with disinfection to reduce the concentration of
microorganisms in the effluent. It was concluded that water treated to this level could
be pumped to the La Ferme water system where it would be adequately diluted. and
from there used to irrigate sugar cane fields. However. it was noted that the principal
difficulty with implementing this program would be its cost. It appeared that the use of
treated effluent from the St Martin waste water treatment facility would provide a larger
quantity of irrigation water. and it could be accomplished at a more modest cost since it
did not have several of the disadvantages noted for the Montagne Jacquot project.
Based on the preliminary results of the feasibility study it was concluded that the
characteristics of the waste water at the Montagne Jacquot project made it unsuitable for
irri(gation without dilution, due to high salinity and sodium concentrations caused by
industrial waste waters. Also, the cost of pumping the treated effluent from the
Montagne Jacquot site to agricultural lands would be significant. Sewage treatment
processes are not effective in removing salinity or sodium from waste water. A
program to implement controls on industrial waste water which would reduce the
salinity and sodium to acceptable levels would require a complex combination of
political. institutional. industrial, economic and social factors. It would be impractical
to implement such a significant change in the industrial waste water management
program before the first phase of the Montagne Jacquot project was implemented.
Finally. the cost of providing the higher level of treatment described in Scenario 2 could

not be recovered from the sale of the waste water for irrigation. For these reasons. it
was concluded that it would be unfeasible to rely on agricultural irrigation for disposal
of the treatment plant effluent. at least for the immediate future (five to ten years).
2.3.6.2 Ocean Ouiffall
The location for an ocean outfall was studied in detail by two of the preliminary project
development documents. The Gibb master plan (1992) collected preliminary data on
the characteristics of the coastal waters and conducted mathematical model studies to
determine the potential extent and location of the effluent plume resulting from
different outfall configurations.  The SOGETI report provided a more extensive
evaluation of the outfall. with collection of field data on bottom characteristics.
currents. winds. and ambient waters. Black & Veatch International used the phvsical
data collected by SOGETI to analyze alternative outfall configurations and developed
the preliminary design of an outfall.
The Gibb master plan (1992) considered discharging effluent from a facilitx which
provided essentially no treatment. via an outfall either to a depth of 30 m or 50 m into
the sea. Based on the preliminary analysis using mathematical models of the outfall
configurations and receiving water characteristics. the report concluded that an outfall
depth of 30 m appeared to be sufficient to provide satisfactory dilution of the effluent
from the Montagne Jacquot plant. even if essentiallv no treatment was provided. but it
cautioned that a more thorough analysis should be conducted.
The 1995 SOGETI report included a detailed review of the effects of alternative ocean
outfall configurations for the Montagne Jacquot plant. Their analysis considered
alternative outfall discharge depths of 100 m. 50 m. 30 m and 3 m. The analysis of
water qualit, parameters concluded that the bacteriological standard would be the most
critical. and the mathematical modeling focused on concentrations of coliform in the
receiving waters. Most of the mathematical modeling was performed on an outfall
placed at 100 m. SOGETI concluded that an outfall to a depth of 100 m would provide
satisfactorv dilution for untreated waste water, but that such an outfall was impractical
for technical and financial reasons. For a plant providing secondary treatment with no
disinfection. the report concluded that a 645 m long outfall to a depth of 30 m would be.
adequate to meet the coliform standard at the adjacent shore and at the Pointe aux
Sables lagoon and reef.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project        Environmental Impact Assessment
Black & Veatch International prepared an analysis and preliminary design of an ocean
outfall using the physical parameters developed by the SOGETI report for the
conditions at the Montagne Jacquot site. Based on the results of the mathematical
model. it was concluded that a properly designed outfall to a depth of 20 m. with
appropriate diffusers. would achieve a dilution factor of approximately 4500 at the
Pointe aux Sables reef and lagoon. An outfall to a depth of 30 m would achieve a
dilution factor of approximately 14.000 under similar conditions.
2.3.7 Recomnmended Treatment and Effluent Disposal
The preliminary results of the evaluation of using the effluent from the Montaune
Jacquot plant for irrigation concluded that it would be unfeasible due to the high
salinity of the effluent, because of the cost of providing the required secondary
treatment. and because of the cost of transport of the effluent from Montagne Jacquot.
Therefore . it was concluded that the treated effluent should be discharged to the ocean.
For ocean disposal. the recommended waste water treatment processes and disposal
facilities for the Montagne Jacquot plant are those described in Scenario 1. The plant
should consist of preliminary treatment works with bar screens. drum screens and grit
removal units: primary clarifiers: disinfection: and disposal of the effluent through an
outfall. The primary sludge should be dewatered using belt filter presses and stabilized
with lime.
An outfall to a depth of 30 m will achieve a dilution factor of approximately 14.000
between a point 645 m offshore and the Pointe aux Sables reef and lagoon. In
conjunction with a disinfection process in the treatment works. this outfall will provide
assurance that the microbiological standard will be consistently met at the Pointe aux
Sables reef and lagoon. All other ocean water qualitv standards will also be met with
the proposed treatment plant facilities and this outfall. The recommended outfall
should be constructed to 30 m depth. 645 m offshore.
2.3.8  Sludge Management and Disposal
Sludge management and disposal is always one of the most difficult aspects of waste
water treatment.  Sludge processing is expensive in terms of labour requirements.
chemical and energy requirements. For these reasons, almost all waste water treatment
plants are engaged in a dynamic and evolving sludge management program. which
changes from time to time in response to the practical. economic and regulatory
environment in which it must operate.

The pianning and review of alternatives for sludge processing and disposal for the
Montagne Jacquot plant began with the Gibb sewerage master plan in 1992. and
continued with the plans and preliminarv designs presented bv SETEGUE et. a] in 1996
and the 1997 prefeasibility report developed by Magoarou and Sam-Soon. The 1997
update to the prefeasibilitv report. prepared by Black & Veatch International included a
review of the previous studv results.
The 1992 sewerage master plan provided a general review of advantages and
disadvantages of sludge processing altematives. including sludge thickening using
gravitv settling. centrifuges and air flotation operations: sludge stabilization using
anaerobic digestion. aerobic digestion. lime stabilization. heat treatment. and
composing; and secondary consolidation following digestion with sludge conditioning.
mechanical dewatering with plate presses and belt presses. vacuum filters. and drvino
beds.  A general review of the sludge stabilization alternatives is presented in
Appendix E.
Based primarilv on consideration of capital costs and complexity of process operations.
Black & Veatch International recommended lime stabilization for the primary sludge
produced by the Montagne Jacquot plant. Lime is produced and is readily available on
Mauritius. The process operations can be readily adjusted to meet the requirements of
changLing sludge characteristics and production volumes. Dewatering of the sludge on
belt filter presses will reduce the volume and also assist in handling of sludge.
Once the sludge has been processed. stabilized and dewatered. it is necessary to dispose
of the remaining mass. Although it is common practice to burv it the sludge in a
landfill. it is possible to further reduce the volume by incineration, then dump it into the
sea. or spread it on the land.  Each disposal alternative has advantages and
disadvantages. A general review of sludge disposal alternatives for Mauritius is
presented in Appendix R.
The dewatered. lime stabilized sludge will be transported from the Montagne Jacquot
WWT plant to the Mare Chicose landfill in trucks, operating generally in tandem with
the belt filter press operations. The belt filter presses will typically operate five davs
per week. Conservative estimates were made for the quantities of sludge to be disposed
of in the landfill. so the facilities would be able to process and dispose of the total
sludge produced. under unfavorable conditions. The average daily primary sludge
production (raw. wet. unprocessed) under these circumstances would be about 590

m,/day. The primary sludge will be dewatered on the belt filter presses. and lime will
be added to stabilize the dewatered sludge cake. At full plant capacity. the average
weekly sludge production delivered to the landfill will amount to 480 m3'wk. or an
avera(ge of 95 m3/dav for the five operating days each week. Bv using truck-s with 10
m3 capacitv. 50 trips to the landfill will be required each week. or 10 trips per day for
each of the five working davs each week.
Ten trips to the landfill each day will require 20 truck passages on the roadwavs
between the WWT plant and the landfill. since each trip requires two passages. It was
concluded that 20 truck passages per day was an insignificant increase in the total
traffic on the main roadways between the WWT plant and the landfill. but would be a
large increase in the total truck traffic on the small residential streets in Pointe aux
Sables. Nevertheless. the capacity of even the small residential streets in Pointe aux
Sables far exceeds 20 vehicles per day. and there would essentially be negligible impact
when the total volume of traffic is considered.
For planning purposes it was assumed that each sludge hauling truck would be able to
complete two trips to the landfill each working day. Thus. five trucks would be
required. The estimated capital cost for these five trucks was Rs 40 million.
The total cost of sludge management must include the cost of disposal at the Mare
Chicose landfill. The estimated operating cost for transportation of the sludge to the
landfill was Rs 3.5 million per year. In addition to that. the cost of disposal at the
landfill was estimated to amount to Rs 320 per m3. which would amount to Rs 8
million per vear.
Impact on Mare Chicose Landfill
The Mare Chicose landfill was designed to receive 650 tonnes/day. or 850 m3/daN of
municipal solid waste. Thus. when the waste water flow to the Montagne Jacquot
WWT plant reaches its design capacity. the lime stabilized sludge from the plant will
amount to an average of 6 to 9 percent of the nominal capacity of the landfill. In other
terms. if the sludge disposal continued through the entire life of the landfill. the lime
stabilized sludge would occupy 7 to 9 percent of the total volume of the landfill. This
would decrease the effective capacity of the landfill to receive municipal solid waste.
and consequently. hasten the time when new solid waste disposal facilities will be
required.

The disposal of the lime stabilized sludge in the Mare Chicose landfill would not
significantlv affect the capability of the leachate treatment svstem to manage leachate
produced in the landfill. The sludge would displace an equivalent amount of municipal
solid waste (MSW). and the characteristics of the combined sludge/MSW  leachate from
the co-disposal facility will not be significantly different from the leachate from an
ordinary MSW landfill.
The lime stabilized sludge will be processed at the landfill just like ordinary MSW. It
can be compacted with the MSW and covered on a daily basis to control odors and
nuisance vectors. Its moisture content of less than 70 percent will allow it to be pushed
and spread in lavers. much like stiff inud.

3.0 POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
3.1   Environmental Protection in Mauritius
The main goal of the National Environmental Policy of Mauritius is to foster harmony
between quality of life, environmental protection and sustainable development for
present and future generations. Attributes of the policy relevant to the present study
include:
0 requiring environmental impact assessment of any major development project.
O to complete the National Sewerage Plan.
0 controlling pollution at source and to the extent possible. requiring the polluter to
pay.
0 effecting the Master Plan for waste management.
The Montagne Jacquot Environmental Sewerage and Sanitation Project is one of
several projects planned as part of the National Sewerage Plan over the next 20 vears. It
will result in a substantial improvement in effluent quality in comparison with the
present waste water currently being discharged into the sea at Port Louis. and thus
greatly improve the quality of life for the communities and the marine life in the
affected area around Port Louis. and also eventually result in improvements in the
economy of the area.
3.1.1  Thle Environmental Protection Act, 1991
The Environmental Protection Act (EPA) Act no. 34 of 1991 establishes the le-al and
institutional framework for the management and protection of the environment in
Mauritius. and is the mechanism through which environmental policv is implemented
(latest edition is October 1996). The Act is divided into several parts. and those
particularly relevant to the present study are parts II. which provides for the
establishment of the National Environment Council the policy making body in
government. and part III. the Environment Coordination Committee which caters for
coordination of public departments engaged in environmental protection and pollution
control. and Part IV which relates to the requirement for Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) in relation to new projects. Other pertinent parts of the act cover
pollution control in the coastal and maritime zone (part VII), and part X which covers
enforcement powers of government, and the enactment of preventitive measures for
pollution control.

3.1.2 Administrative Procedures
In 1989 the Government of Mauritius established the Department of Enviroinment to
provide the institutional framework to oversee the implementation of conseration and
environmental protection legislation in Mauritius. Subsequentlv there was development
and clarification of responsibilties in government for different aspects of policy
development. setting of national standards and enforcement functions. so that by 1991.
the agencies involved in environmental protection in Mauritius and their responsibilities
were as shown in Appendix F. To make the environmental decision-makingl process
more democratically oriented and consultative the Enviromnental Advisory Council of
Mauritius was also established with representatives from ministries. industries. NGO's.
educational institutions etc.
According to the Fourth Schedule of the Environmental Protection Act. 1991.
government enforcing agencies are responsible for supervising enforcement of National
Environmental Standards and notices. orders and directives issued under environmental
law. They are responsible for verifying compliance with environmental laws. and for
conducting regular monitoring. sampling and analysis so as to ensure compliance.
The enforcing agency with responsibility for inland waters and effluents is the
Permanent Secretary to the Ministrv responsible for water resources. This is now the
Waste Water Authoritv in the Ministry of Public Infrastructure (see section 8 for
details). As the WWA has the responsibility of controlling and monitoring industrial
effluent discharges to inland waters. rivers, coastal waters. etc. it has been sug-ested an
amendment to the Fourth Schedule of the EPA to make the WWA also the enforcingi
agency for control of effluent discharge to sewers (See CES institutional study). In
addition to the in-house monitoring and control of discharges by the WWA. the Albion
Fisheries Research Centre is responsible for monitoring coastal water quality in
discharge zones of wastewater treatment plants and provides water quality information
for correlation purposes (R.H. Prayag. DoE. pers. comm).
The enforcing agency with respect to reviewing and managing environmental impact
assessments is the DOE. which is also responsible for setting and maintaining national
environmental standards for water. noise. odours and solid and liquid wastes.

3.1.3  Application for an EIA license
Because of the potential environmental impacts associated with the Montagne .lacquot
Project. the Project must apply for an EIA License, prior to its implementation. This
requires that
* a full Environmental Impact Assessment is carried out.
the "Project Proponent". the Ministrv for Public Infrastructure. will submit the EIA
to the Director of the Department of Environmnent of the Ministry of Environment &
Quality of Life (MEQOL). for the purpose of complying with the legal procedure
for EIA license application.
*  the EIA must comply with the Environment Protection Act (Act no 34 of 19'9 1).
the EIA must comply with the environmental requirements of the funding acencies.
which in this case are the World Bank and the OECF.
According to the EPA 1991 the EIA has to cover a range of issues. but as a minimum
should include the following:
a) the location of the undertaking and its surroundings;
b) the principle. concept and purpose of the undertaking:
c) the direct or indirect effects that the undertaking is likely to have on the
environment:
d) the social. economic. and cultural effects that the undertaking is likely to have on
people and society:
e) anv actions or measures which may avoid, prevent. change. mitigate or remedy the
likely effects of the undertaking on the environment. people and society:
f) the inevitable adverse environmental effects that the undertaking is likelx to have on
the environment people and society. if it is implemented in the manner proposed by
the proponent:
g) the irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which will be involved
in the undertaking. if implemented in the manner proposed by the proponent:
h) any alternatives to the proposed undertaking;
i) such other information as may be necessary to a proper review of the potential
environmental impact of the undertaking. (See also Appendix G).
The EPA report guidelines from the Department of Environment (DOE). indicate that
the aim of an EIA is to ensure that potential problems are foreseen and addressed at an
early stage in the project's planning and design (See MEQOL, 1993a). In Mauritius an

submitted to the DOE (the decision-making authority) as part of a permit application
for the project.
The suggested outline of an EIAR (MEQOL 1 993a ) is as follows:
0  Title Page: full title. team/consultancy responsible for the EIA. date
0 Non-technical summary: 1-2 pgs. simple language. outline the project and

Considering the above environmental guidelines for Mauritius. the proposed WWT
plant at Montagne Jacquot and the construction of the associated pipelines will be
designed to minimise negative impacts on the environment and to enhance the positive
impacts on the local communities.
3.1.4. Coastal water quality standards and effluents standards
Legislation particularly relevant to the present project is that covering wastewater
discharges to coastal waters, and the quality of industrial effluents discharged to sewers.
Also the water quality standards for coastal ocean water need to be considered since the
Montagne Jacquot WWT plant will discharge to these coastal ocean waters.

requires a full EA. Or Category B - may have adverse environmental impacts. but are
less siWnificant than Categorv A. e.g. water supply and sanitation projects.
Potential environmental issues recognised by the World Bank which are relevant to the
present studv are:
e  Biological diversity: the Bank promotes conservation of endangered plant and
animal species, critical habitats. and protected areas.
O  Coastal and marine resources management: guidelines include planning and
management of coastal marine resources. including coral reefs. mangroves. and
wetlands.
O  Cultural sites: protection of archaeological sites. historic monuments. etc.
O  Industrial hazards: all energy and industrial projects should include a formal plan to
prevent and manage industrial hazards
O Land settlement: carefully review land settlement in relation to phvsical. biological.
socio-economic, and cultural aspects
World Bank requirements for a full EIA report are essentially the same as those
required by local Mauritian legislation. but additional sections on policy. legal and
administrative background as well as an environmental management plan are also
required by the World Bank.
3.2.2  Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, Japan, Environmental Requirements
The Overseas Economic Development Fund (OECF) is a development finance
institution of the Japanese government. providing long-term, low-interest loans to assist
the self-help efforts of developing countries. The OECF principallv provides Official
Development Assistance (ODA) loans to developing countries. which includes the
Republic of Mauritius. The OECF has a cooperative partnership with other funding
institutions such as World Bank. the African Development Bank etc. The type of ODA
loan given to the Govermnent of Mauritius for the Montagne Jacquot Environmental
Sewerage and Sanitation Project is called a "Project Loan" which mainlk covers the
procurement of facilities. equipment. machinery, materials, civil engineering works.
installment works and consulting services.
The OECF compiled Environmental Guidelines in 1989 (revised 1995: revisions will
come into force August 1997) that must be adhered to before finance is approved for
any OECF funded project. The guidelines will ensure that each project's impact on the

environment will be taken into account and measures will be devised to counteract
negative impacts. if there are any. For large-scale projects. such as those with the risk
of significant impacts on the environment. the recipient country must submit an EIA
report which must be made available to the public for review.
The OECF is particularly concerned about the role of Women in Development (WID)
and endeavors to understand the role of women in the society of the project area. and to
monitor how women contribute and participate in the project. The "OECF Guiding
Principles on Women in Development" in 1991 can be used to help mitigate negative
impacts on women resulting from projects. The OECF consistently emphasises the
importance of harmony between development and environmental protection. in the
context of sustainable development. and so environmnental protection measures must be
undertaken throughout the project cycle in accordance with the OECF Environmental
Guidelines. The salient features of the guidelines are as follows:
1. Environmental Pollution - air and water pollution, noise. vibration. offensive
odours etc.
o Where the Borrower's country has regulatory environmental standards. such
as emission standards. those standards are to be strictly observed
0 Where the Borrower's country has administrative guidelines. such as
environmental standards. the measures adopted must not militate against the
attainment or maintenance of those standards.
0 Where the Borrower's country has no such standards. the standards of Japan
or other countries or international organisations are to be referred to. In this
case. close consultation between the Borrower and OECF is necessary.
2. Natural Environment
0 Legislation and international agreements or conventions to which the
Borrower's country is a party must be complied with.
0 A project shall be carried out in such a way that it will not have any
considerable adverse effect on the habitat or the principal flora and fauna of
the area.
0 Measures must be taken to protect rare and endangered species in the area.
3. Social Environment
0 Impacts on people who will have to be relocated should be assessed. and
appropriate measures adopted.

3.3   Interested and Affected Parties (IAPs)
IAPs affected. either positively and/or negatively, by the proposed Montagne .lacquot
development were identified as follows:
1. Land Owners: Planters/Sugar Cane Owners. Other Land Owners
2. Water Consumers ( industries and agriculturalists in the Study Area etc.)
3. Neighbouring residential communities (Bain des Dames. Pointe aux Sables.
Montagne Jacquot)
4. Government agencies (water quality - CWA: waste waters - WW.A: marine
resources - AFRI)
5. Government Ministries (MEQOL)
6. Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) (Friends of the Environment. MMCS
etc)
During the Scoping Phase of the EIA a number of groups and individuals in the public
and private sectors were consulted about the proposed development (Table 3.1 ). A
formal record of the Scoping Sessions and the principal issues and concerns raised by
each group/individual is provided in Appendix H. Additional scoping sessions were
conducted in the communities currently worst affected by the existing waste water
discharge arrangements. The issues raised in community meetings are also summarised
in appendix H.

* The Montagne Jacquot WWT plant will be located on a vacant section of land
southwest of the Petite Verger prison. as shown in figures 1.1 and 4.8 at the end of
this report. The land is owned by several individuals. and will have to be purchased
from those individuals.
* The new pumping stations at Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables will be constructed
on the grounds of the existing treatment works. No additional propertv will be
required at these locations.
* The site access road and the transmission mains route from Fort Victoria to the Point
aux Sables works and from there to the Montagne Jacquot site (alternative I see
section 2) were located to the maximum extent possible along existing roadways
within the rights-of-way, and across property owned by the Government of
Mauritius. or controlled by parastatal agencies such as the Development Bank of
Mauritius. Although the final alignment of the transmission mains has not been
established. the transmission mains will not cross any propertv occupied b% a
residence along any of the altemative alignments. so no displacements will be
necessary.
* Alon(T one of the alternative .transmission main alignments and along the access
roads to the new WWT plant site.. the new works will affect property owned by
either individuals. companies or institutions. The Waste Water Authoritv will
purchase way-leaves for construction of the pipeline and access roads across these
properties.
3.4.1 Land Acquisition Procedures
Land acquisition by the Government of Mauritius can be carried out in two wavs:
* Private Agreement
* Compulsory Land Purchase
3.4.1.1 Private Agreement
The Ministry of Housing and Lands is the agency responsible for land acquisition for
the state. The first step in the process of land acquisition is for the agency that needs
land to provide a legal description and survey of the property required. The Ministry of
Black & Veatch International            3.10       Policy, legal and administrativeframework



Alontagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project       Environmental Impact .4s.sessinent
Housing and Lands then completes a title search to identify the owners of the property.
and starts negotiating with landowners after completion of the title search.
3.4.1.2 (Comprulsorv Land Purchase
If necotiations with landowners fail or if the purchase involves long strips of land with
numerous individual landowners. the Government may find it expedient to proceed by
compulsory purchase under the provision of the Land Acquisition Act. For compulsory
acquisition the Government proceeds with the issue of two notices as follows:
* Notice under Section 6
After the owner of the land has been identified. a notice under section 6 of the Act is
served on the owner to notifv him of the Government's intention to acquire his land for
a public purpose. This notice should be published in two issues of the Government
Gazette and two daily local newspapers within seven davs interval between the two
publications. This in effect gives the surveyor and engineer entry to the land to
complete all survey works as well as site investigations.
* Notice under Section 8
After procedures under Section 6 have been completed. a Notice under Section 8 is
published and served on the landowner. This notice is published in two issues of the
Government Gazette and two daily local newspapers within seven days interval
between the two publications.
A Section 8 Notice can be,served immediately after a Section 6 Notice. In practice.
there is always a time lag between the two Notices so as to allow the Land Survevors to
complete survey reports and drawings. The Govermnent gets a clear title to the land
upon transcription procedures of the Section 8 Notice at the Registrar's General's
Office. The transcription procedures take approximatelv one to two months.
Government officers and Contractors have entry to the site once govemmeni obtains
title to the land.
3.4.2  Pavment of Compensation
Once the notice under Section 8 is served. the dispossessed owners submit a claim for
compensation to the Ministry of Housing and Land. Government valuation officers
assess the amount of compensation to be paid by the Government. If the negotiations

.Montag,ne Jacquot Sewerage aiid Sanitation Project     Environmental ImpactlAssessment
between the two parties are successful. the government pays the agreed compensation to
the owners after the signing of a deed of acquittance prepared by a notary.
However. if there is no consensus in the negotiations. the matter is referred to a Board
of Assessment under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. The Board of
Assessment consists of a chairman appointed by the Chief Justice and two members
appointed bv the Ministrv of Housing. The 4ward of the Board of Assessment is final.
However the dispossessed owner can still appeal to the Supreme Court of Mauritius if
he believes the compensation awarded is insufficient.
3.4.3  Wayleaves
For wayleaves. the procedures as described previously are applicable.
3.4.4 Time Frame
For the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage Project all surveys (cadastral. etc.) will be
completed within two months. Once all the necessary documents have been submitted
to the Ministry of Housing and Lands. it takes about 3 months to complete all
procedures under the Land Acquisition Act before title is transferred to the
Government.
3.4.5 Buiffer Zones
In order to protect the public from potential exposure to nuisance conditions and to
reduce the possibility of complaints regarding the operation of the Monta-ne Jacquot
WWT plant. buffer zones of 200 m and 400 m will be established around the perimeter
of the WWT plant site. This buffer zones will be identified on maps filed with the
Ministrv of Housing and Lands. and activities within the buffer zone will be controlled
through the use of zoning restrictions and permits. The kinds of activities that will be
prohibited within the 200 m buffer zone include all developments which would result in
regular or prolonged activities by individuals or groups. such as residential housing.
churches. schools. offices. and certain industries. Activities beyond the 200 m buffer
zone. but within the 400 m buffer zone would not be prohibited. but all land owners
would be advised of the presence of the WWT plant and the potential for nuisance
conditions arising from plant operations. Activities which would be permissible within
the buffer zone include developments which require only occasional visits or those
*Ihich would employ only a few individuals and require large space. such as

agriculture. livestock operations, automobile wrecking yards. or warehousing. Other
activities would also be permitted in which individuals could choose to participate. such
as recreation at the sea shore. picnicing. hiking. or camping.

4.0    DESCRIPTION OF THE AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
(Padya 1984; Proag 1995; NPDP 1995: SOGETI 1995)
The Study Area for the environmental impact assessment consists of the drainage area
to be serviced bv the waste water collection system i.e. the Port Louis Sewerage
Svstem which includes the built-up areas of Port Louis South. Cassis. Belle Village.
and the  Plaine Lauzun Industrial Zone (see Figures 1.1 and 2.1). The eastern
boundary is at Pointe aux Caves on the coast southwards to the road going to Albion
(near Canot). the southern border includes Vuillemain. the western border includes the
drainage area of Tranquebar. and the northern border is the coastal harbour area of
Port Louis. The Study Area includes sections of four of the nine administrative
Districts: Black River. Plaines Wilhems. Moka. and Port Louis.
4.1    Physical Environment
4.1.1   Topography, geology and soils
Topography
In the Study Area. the western part (west side of the Grand River North-West -
GRNW) descends gradually from an altitude of about 230 m. characterised by
undulating uplands surrounded by mountain ranges. down to the coastal plain at
Montagne Jacquot. The proposed WWT plant at Montagne Jacquot is located 10 to 30
m above sea level (see Plate 4.1 and Figure 4.1). To the east of the GRNVW is the Port
Louis CBD. surrounded by mountain peaks. The highest point of these mountains is
the peaks Quion Bluff and Speargrass Peak. with a maximum height at Junction Peak
of 350 m asl.
GeolSgy
Except for the beaches. the coral formation of the reefs and limited extents ot alluvium
(e.g. estuary of Black River). Mauritius is entirely volcanic in origin. The western part
of the Study Area is comprised of intermediate aged lava (3.5-2.0 mvo) whilst the
outcrops and area around Port Louis is old lava (6.2-5 myo) (Figure 4.2). This area
forms the Curepipe groundwater basin which is made up of basalt lava flows.
At 5mva a relatively calm period (1.5 my) occurred during which intense erosion took
place. after which a younger volcanic series arose. Of this younger series. which
consists of early. intermediate and late lavas. only intermediate lavas are found in the
Study Area. These consist of grey granular-textured alkali basalts i.e. doleritic
Black & Veatch Interiiatonal            4.1                Description of tIle envirtonment

basalts). The agglomerates are composed of pebbles of olivine basalt set in a matrix
of scoria and ash. There is a small portion of sandy coast at Pointe aux Sables. which
is predominantly basalt boulders with pebble areas between the boulders. but with a
few small sandy areas (see Plate 4.2).
.Snil.s
As the volcanic rock weathered. fertile soil was formed in manv areas of the island
which formed agriculturally important soils, and since the Study Area falls into the
subhumid climatic zone of the island. the soils are mainly lowland humic soils. but
also shallow stoney soil and dark clay soil inland of Port Louis (Figure 4.2). Low
humic latosols (zonal soils) occur in the subhumid and lower rainfall zones - in areas
with a distinct dry season. The depth of these soils varies from about 60-100 cm with
good internal drainage and low organic content. The beach area at Pointe aux Sables
is comprised of beach sand.
4.1.2   Climate
The Study Area falls into the Northwest climatic zone. which is within the subhumid
part of Mauritius. In general. the wettest months in Mauritius are in Februarv and
March with the rainy season ranging from December to April and the dry season from
September to November. The high summer rainfalls arise from low pressure troughs.
weak depressions and occasional tropical cyclones passing over the island. e.g. a total
of 812 mm of rain has been recorded in 24 hrs as a result of a tropical cvclone.
Localised falls of high intensity also occur during thunderstorms. Drought conditions
do occur occasionally. particularly in the subhumid zone.
Ruin/atll
The average annual rainfall in Mauritius varies from 1 300 mm on the east coast to
4 000 mm on the Central Plateau. and is 900 mm on the west coast. The Study Area
therefore has an average annual rainfall of less than I 000 mm (the annual rainfall
exceeds 1 000 mm only once in 4 years) - the Line Barracks rain gauge near Port
Louis has an average annual rainfall of 946 mm. The coastal section where Pointe aux
Sables and Montagne Jacquot are has an average annual rainfall of 800 mm.
Rain gauges in the Study Area are at Richelieu (67 m altitude) near Petite Riviere and
Fort William (6 m altitude) near the Fort Victoria Sewerage Works (see Figure 4.1) -
the monthly rainfall from 1951-1980 is shown in Figure 4.3. The highest rainfall

occurs during summer and autumn i.e. December to March. and the lowest in winter
and spring i.e. May to November
Lon- term  rainfall trends (1960 - 1990) are such that abnormally wet periods
(1 - 3 years) tend to be balanced by dry periods (up to 10 vears).  Maximum daily
rainfall is important to consider since it may give rise to local floodin< because
drainaie outlets and sewer systems cannot cope e.g. in the west the max. daily rainfall
is 150 mm with a return period of 3 years. The mean annual evaporation in the
western coastal areas is more than 1870 mm.

Winds
The prevailing winds in Mauritius are the South East Trade winds which blowN in a
ESE direction over the island, with speeds of 1-25 knots. Tropical cyclones blowv over
Mauritius. particularly between Januarv and March. with wind speeds up to 256 km/h
recorded. and average speeds of 166 km/h. Over the last 30 year period. a total of 24
cvclones occurred i.e. one cyclone every 1.3 years. The impact of these cy clones. in
terms of rainfall on the island varies at different locations e.g. from the same 30 vear
period relevant to the Study Area rainfall recorded was: max in January 1980 Cyclone

easterlv wind of > 1Om/s during winter. but also an occasional north-easterlv wind of
< 6 m/s (SOGETI 1995. Figure 4.4). The autumn wind rose (March-April 1995)

indicates a more dominant easterly wind (8-10 m/s). but still with a relatively
dominant south-easterly component. Occasionally the wind blew northerly. north-
westerly. and westerly but never more than 6 m/s.

4.1.3   Thie Aquatic Environments
4.1.3.1  River catchments
Mauritius is divided into 25 main and 22 minor river basins. each corresponding to a
main river. The catchment areas relevant to the Study Area vary from 15 to 1 5 kmn
and consist of two major and two minor river basins. The largest major basin is the
GRNW catchment which covers 114.57 km and consists of the followingT rivers:
GRNW. River Moka. River Profonde. River Cascade, River Terre Rouge. River
Plaines Wilhems. and River Seche.
In the Study Area. the main river is the GRNW with only the branching off of the
River Plaines Wilhems and River Moka being seen (Figure 4.1). East of the GRNW
the St Louis basin covers a small area (14.51 km2) and consists only of the St. Louis
Stream. The Port Louis area is a combination of the St. Louis and Tombeau basins
and covers a total of 52.23 Ikm . The Study Area only includes a small section of this
basin. The River Tombeau is the main river in this area with a few smaller streams
running into the harbour.
West side of the GRNW is a section of the Belle Eau/GRNW basin with the Belle Eau
River beimz the main river (Figure 4.1). Other small streams and canals are also
present in this part of the Study Area. The Pointe aux Sables and Montagne .lacquot
areas are within both the GRNW and the Belle Eau (18.06 km2) basin and receive
water from a number of water tanks in the area which are ultimately fed from La
Fermne Reservoir via the La Ferme Canal i.e. no actual rivers in this area.
4.1.3.1  Surfalce and groundwater supplies
The domestic water supply in the Study Area is from the Port Louis water supply
svstem (PLS) which includes the southern suburbs of Pointe aux Sables. Petite
Riviere. Pailles etc. Rainfall is the only source of water on the island and provides

Monittagne Jacyuot Sewerage and Sanitation Project      Environmental Impact Assessment
water for the PLS in the following forms: surface water (58.29 m3/d) and groundwater
(38.50 m3/d). which gives a total of 96.79 m3/d. There has been a piped water system
in Port Louis for nearly 200 years which is presently controlled by the Central Water
Authority (CWA). The main source of surface water for the PLS is the Grand River
Nortlh West at the Municipal Dyke (see Figure 4.1).
Ground water levels fluctuate seasonally due to recharge from rainfall and irrigation
and discharge from pumping. Mauritius is divided into four main and three small
groundwater basins. The Study Area occurs in the northern section of the Curepipe
basin. The Curepipe basin extends from Curepipe Point to meet the coast from the
north of the River du Rempart to the mouth of the GRNW. with an overall slope of
3.5%. Surface and groundwater drainage is to the north-west of this basin.  The
quality of ground water in the Study Area is:
0 predominantly soft water (pH 6.7 - 7.3) but with an area of hard water (pH 7.5)
0 low calcium levels (iso-calcium = 19.2 - 21.2 mg/I)
0 iso-magnesium predominantly below 15 mg/l with a value of 19.7 mg/l inland of
the Study Area
0 total hardness i.e. Ca and Mg content, is below 95 mg/l which is in the category of
"moderately soft water" by the CWA (hard water is 200 -300 mg/l).
4.1.3.3 Irrigation
Water demand for irrigation is increasing and varies according to weather conditions.
The Western coast irrigation system extends over about 4 000 ha of coastal plains.
2 500 ha being served by furrow irrigation and 1 500 ha by overhead and drip
irri-ation. Water is distributed via concrete canals and a few earth canals. An annual
volume of about 60 Mm3 would be required to satisfy the irrigation needs of the total
area. This system is operated and maintained by the CWA but water deliveries are
often not necessarily in synchronisation with crop requirements and irrigzation
efficiency declines accordingly.
The La Ferme Reservoir has a capacity of 11.9 x 10 m3 and mainly receives water
from its own catchment. The La Ferme irrigation system covers the western part of
the Studv Area and covers approximately 1 317 ha. The water from this reservoir is
distributed to this area via the La Ferme Canal. This system has access to a number of
springs (e.g. St. Antoine. Le Bosquet) which supplement the shortfall from La Ferme
reservoir. There is a small-scale irrigation project at Pointe aux Caves.

Montagne Jatcqluot Sewerage and Sanitation Project        Environmental Impact -As.sessmenh
4.1.3.4   Water pollution sources
Water pollution arises from either "point" or "non-point" sources. In the study area
waste waters from industry. commercial and domestic sources are discharged to the
sewage collection system. transported to the works at Fort Victoria and Pointe aux
Sables and discharged to the sea through outfall pipelines which terminate in shallowA
water. with no diffusers to aid in dispersion of the effluent. These are the principal
sources of water pollution in the study area.
Non-point sources are also major contributors to water pollution in the study area. and
include agrichemicals from agricultural land. and storm water runoff from the
community. In addition. the water pollution problem in Mauritius is exacerbated
during periods of high rainfall. Since the sanitary sewer system does not have the
capacity to transport increased volumes of waste water which result from inflow of
rain water. sewers can overflow, discharging waste water into open water courses.
The Montagne Jacquot sewerage project will provide relief from point sources of
pollution at the Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables sewer outfalls. The new treatment
plant will remove significant quantities of pollutants from the raw waste water before
it is discharged to the sea through the new outfall.
4.1.3.5  T/he marine environment
Coastal currents are mainly dependent on the Great Southern Equatorial current
flowing on an east-west axis. so that the currents on the west of the island have a
north-south direction during the wet season (Dec to April) and a south-north direction
during the drv season (June to October). The drogue studies carried out by SOGETI
(1995) in relation to the proposed outfall site confirmed these general trends. with
drogues moving offshore in a westerly or southwesterly direction in December. and
offshore in a northerly or north easterly direction in June (Figure 4.5).
There are two main tvpes of waves affecting the western coast of Mauritius: those
which are generated by storms out in the Indian Ocean. and more locally generated
waves. caused by the passage of tropical cyclones. Cyclone-generated waves can reach
heights of 13 m and since the west coast of the island is very steeply shelving and
deep water is reached quickly. only waves approaching at oblique angles to the coast
are likely to be affected by the shoreline.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project        Environmental Impact Assessment
The strengzth and direction of currents vary according to wind direction and tides.
which are semi-diurnal with a weak amplitude. The tidal regime for Port Louis and
environs are characteristic of an open ocean svstem with relatively small amplitude
variation e._z. min and max levels recorded for September and November 1995 were -
0.39 m to 0.38 m relative to mean sea level (CSIR 1996).
During the SOGETI study (June to March 1994 - 1995). current measurements were
carried out just off Pointe aux Caves. at 30 m depth and varied between
0.1 - 0.15 m/sec with the direction changing according to the tide from north east to
south west. Similar and equally feeble current speeds were measured off Port Louis
during the CSIR studv ( 1996) and were only greater than 0.25 m/sec for less than 1%
of the time and principally from the north. Existing information on current speeds and
direction is very limited and insufficient to reflect the annual ranges. or even diurnal
variations in the study area. However. measurements carried out by SOGETI off the
proposed outfall site suggested that the circum-insular currents do not affect the
inshore coastal waters significantly. and so should not be included in the
hvdrodynamic model.
Water quality measurements taken in the sea during the SOGETI study (June and
December 1994) close to the proposed outfall site indicated ranges for key parameters
as follows:
0  conductivity ranges from 3 000 mS/m and 4 1 OOmS/m;
0 turbidity from 0.0 to 5:2 NTU depending on currents and presence of effluents:
0 pH in June was 6.5-7.4. and in Dec the pH was 6.3 - 6.8;
0  dissolved oxygen was 65 - 70% saturation;
0 temperature in summer was 270C summer and 25.50C winter:
0 faecal coliform was < 1/lOOml.
These ranges of values were used to carry out the hydrodynamic modeling at the outfall
site.

to the evolution of plants and animals unique to the island. However. very little of the
indigenous vegetation and fauna still exist today and most are concentrated in 16
nature reserves found in the southern part of the Island. green natural areas and the
Black River Gorges National Park (NPDP 1995). The closest nature reserve to the
Study Area is Le Pouce - which just outside the eastern border of the Study Area.
4.2.1.1  Fwiiinal
The only mammals indigenous to Mauritius are two species of fruit bat (one of which
is now extinct and the Mauritius fruit bat). although monkeys, hares. mongoose. and
deer exist, thev are introduced and occur mostly in hunting reserves or inland forest.
Mongooses were introduced to the Island from India to help control the populations of
rats. The only snakes are the Indian wolf snake. and two species of boa constrictor.
There are only nine indigenous bird species left in Mauritius. 16 of which have
become extinct (including the dodo). e.g. the Mauritius cardinal (Foudia rubra). the
flycatcher (Terpsiphone bourbonnensis). the cuckoo shrike (Orancina fvpicus). and
the Mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus. The most common endemic species is the
tic-tic Zosterops borbonica. which has adapted well to a man-made environment.
Since the land in the Study Area consists mainly of built-up urban areas and
agricultural land (predominantly sugar cane). the likelihood of natural fauna occurring
there is minimal and therefore would not be affected by the proposed Montagne
Jacquot Project.
4.2.1.2  1 egelation (Dr.J Gueho, MSIRI).
Less than I percent of the area of Mauritius is covered by indigenous vegetation which
occurs mainlv in the Black River Gorges National Park. The original vegetation in
Mauritius consisted of palm savannah along the coast. low altitude Diospyros forests.
and Sapotaceae forest on the plateau. In the Study Area. the mountains around Port
Louis are the main green area consisting of scattered scrub and a small section of
planted forest (see Figure 4.7) but with no natural vegetation.

Since the Study Area has no more indigenous vegetation and is mainly land converted
for agriculture or built-up areas. the proposed development will have no impact on any
natural vegetation resources. The site allocated for the new WWT plant. adjacent to
the Prison at Montagne Jacquot is covered by secondarised' savannah grassland
dominated by the grass Heteropogon contostrts and scattered swards of Themedia dilui
with a few isolated trees (e.g. Pithecellobium  dilui) (see Plate 4.3). Appendix J
summarises the species present on the site. which include occasional weeds and
naturalised woody species e.g. Tephorsia perpuria. Waltheria indica. Leucaena
leurotphalu, Lantana camara. Setaria. and Trichodesma zeylaica.
Stunted isolated examples of Albizia lebebeck and Flacourtia indica occur. and the
presence of the climber. Passiflora foerida. a passion fruit plant was also noted
(Plate 4.4). Rare on the site was Ziziphus mauritiana. a low tree 2-3 m high. with the
following  plants being  occasional:  Tribulus terristris. PhYllanthzs  ul-inariza
(a medicinal plant), Melochia pyrmidata. Boerhavia coccinea. Ageratum cornloides
Euiphorbia hirta. Cassia tora (Plate 4.5), Wikstroemia indica. Panicum maxinmum (in
isolated swards). Amaranthus hvbridus. Dacrvloctenium  ctenoides. and a izround
creeper Ipomoea obscura.
The area which has been proposed for the new WWT plant at Montagne Jacquot has
no conservation value whatsoever. mainly because of the secondarised vegetation
present on the site.
4.2.2   Marine Environment
The weathering action of waves. tides. hurricanes. and flooding have created diverse
coastal habitats with numerous beaches. lagoons. bays, rocky shores. and scoured river
mouths. Several surveys have been taken of these coastal ecosvstems (Hodilkin 1959:
Hodgkin and Michel 1963: Fagoonee 1990).
4.2.2.1  Roc4- shore intertidal zone: Pointe-autx-Caves to Montagne Jacquot
The intertidal zone from Pointe aux Caves to Montagne Jacquot is exposed to the full
impact of wave action. since this stretch of coast is not protected by a barrier reef -
like the beach at Pointe aux Sables. This section of rocky shoreline is significant since
the proposed outfall pipeline will be built through this section of coast
established after original vegetation was removed

The rockv intertidal zone at Pointe aux Sables has been studied2 and comprises three
littoral zones with characteristic fauna and algal zonation pattems (Table 4. 1). The
supra-littoral zone is the highest zone on the shore   and is never immersed.
Gastropods. such as Littorina mauritania are abundant in the cracks of the rocks and
since the splashes from  the waves still reach this zone. patches of algae. such as
Eciocarpus are present.

exposure (Plate 4.6). Molluscs (e.g. Siphonariaferruginea. Patelles spp.) and chitons
(Acanthopleura borbonica) are also found in this zone.
The sub-littoral zone is usually covered in water. except during spring low tides. High

4.2.2.2  (oastal waters
Most of the coastline of Mauritius is fringed by coral reefs. and consequently the
coastal waters in these areas are calm since the sea is enclosed in lagoons. The coral
reef in the Studv Area is part of the peripheral fringing reef which is a narrow rim (less
than 25 m wide) cut at intervals bv surge channels and narrow breaks or large passes.
such as at the harbour entrance and the GRNW river mouth at Port Louis (Figure 4.5)
(SaIm. 1976).
The coastline off Pointe aux Sables (± 4 km) forms a sheltered lagoon with a fringing
reef approximately 1 km from the coast (Figure 4.5). At the southern part of Pointe
aux Sables the fringing reef curves inland and almost closes off the lagoon. South of
this point. between Montagne Jacquot and Pointe aux Caves. there is no fringinc reef
and the seabed drops off to a depth of 50 m within about 700 m from the shore. The
seabed in this area consists of volcanic flagstone with a thin laver of coral. which is a
buttress-and-valley zone of volcanic origin (Faure and Montaggioni 1971).
The following is a brief description of the present state of marine life (and sources of
information) at different sites in the Study Area: Fort William to Fort Victoria (ERM
1995. pers obs2 ); Pointe aux Sables (SOGETI 1995: ERM 1995: pers obsi. Montagne
Jacquot (AFRC survey. pers obs.): Pointe aux Caves (SOGETI 1995).
Fort William to Fort Victoria (ERM 1995. pers obs)
From Fort William southwards the fringing reef is still intact although it is covered by
a dense algal mat. This reef is comprised predominantly of dead corals and thick
sediment deposits and with some fish life (e.g. rockcods). a few sea urchins and
calcareous algae (ERM 1995). The diving surveys by ERM in this area noted the
presence of raw sewage and solid wastes floating in the water.
The impact of raw sewage effluent on the marine environment in this area is self
evident. with sewage sludge and debris deposited on the shoreline between Fort
William and Fort Victoria (Plate 4.9).
Pointe aux.Sables (SOGETI 1995: ERM 1995; AFRC survey June 1997: pers obs.)
The diving surveys done by ERM (during 1994) in the Pointe aux Sables indicated a
gradient in the condition of the barrier reef and the lagoon from north to south. In the

northern section. near Port Louis. live coral cover was poor (0 - 5%) with hard corals
and verv few fish. Dead coral rubble covered in brown algae was very evident with
nil visibility. The low visibilitv was mainly due to sediment input from the GRN'W.
The southern section of the reef was in a better condition with verv good visibilitv and
abundant fish life (e.g. damsel fish. goatfish. eels. wrasses etc.). The percentage live
coral ranged from 50 to 80% in most places. with no visible signs of pollution.
However. the percentage live corals decreased rapidly from the south end to the
middle of the reef. where the Pointe aux Sables outfall is present.
The SOGETI diving surveys (during June/July 1994 and March/April 1995) similariy
reported the poor state of corals. extensive growth of algae. proliferation of
herbivorous urchins. and the disappearance of fish populations. particularlx in the
northern section of the lagoon. In addition. the trend towards improvement in the
coral reef communities from the Pointe aux Sables outfall southwards is also clear.
although the condition of corals on the external slopes of the reef is clearly still quite
poor with high percentages of necrosing or already bleached corals.
The nearest site to the proposed outfall surveyed by the SOGETI was transect TRI.
some 300m short of the Pointe aux Sables headland. At depths around 7 - 10 m hard
corals were relatively uncommon and mainly represented by massive PoriteLs (of the
luiea - lobata) group. Pocillopora eydouxi. and some plate forms in the process of
necrosing. At higher levels, corals were more abundant (20 - 40% cover) but many of
the colonies were moribund or necrosed and sometimes crushed. As well as the
Porite.s spp and Pocillopora spp. noted at greater depths there were several species of
Acropora. but with onlv the extremities of their branches still livinLi. Alcvonarians
(genus Sarcophyton) were dispersed and not particularly rare. whereas the urchins
.SIomopneustex variolus and Echinus calamaris were common even abundant in some
areas. probably attracted by the algal carpets. which are evidence of the elevated
nutrient levels.
The impact of raw sewage effluent on the marine environment at Pointe aux Sables is
also evident from the condition of the shoreline where extensive beds of algae (e.g.
l;lvu) are exposed at low tide up to Ikm from the entry of the outfall into the sea.
There are also dense accumulations of putrefying algae at high water level which add
to the unsightly and degraded appearance of the beach (Plates 4.10a. b). The Pointe
aux Sables reef and lagoon are currently being monitored by the AFRC. as part of
their Marine Pollution Monitoring Programme. Recent photographs taken on 3rd June

Although the Fort William. Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables areas all show
evidence of coastal pollution. the Fort William/Fort Victoria area is worse than the
beaches further south. because of the accumulation of sewage in embav ments.
overbearing malodours and the impact of both on the fishing communities operating
there (see Section 4.3).
.M lonta,gne Jacquot (SOGETI 1995: AFRC survey, pers obs.)
The SOGETI study did not include a marine biological survey of the proposed outfall
route at Montagne Jacquot. Consequently a diving survey to assess the extent and
condition of corals found along the proposed pipeline route was carried out by the
Marine Conservation and Pollution Monitoring Division of the Albion Fisheries
Research Centre (AFRC) during May 1997, as part of the present EIA study. The
main objective of this diving survey was to establish the extent of reef communities at
the break in the fringing reef off Montagne Jacquot. and if corals were present. to
identifv them and assess their current state of health. This would allow an evaluation
of the suitability of the site for the proposed pipeline.
The methods used to assess the nature of the sea bed and the condition of the corals
was according to the "line intercept transect" method (English et al. 1994). which is
currentlv being used by the AFRC to monitor environmental impacts at various sites
on the coast of Mauritius. -This technique assesses the sessile benthic community of
coral reefs according to different lifeform characteristics (see Appendix H). which
provides a morphological description of the reef communitv.   Three dives were
undertaken at 30 m. 13 m and at 8 m, and transects completed at both the 13 m site (
Stn 1) and the 8 m site (= Stn 2) and a photographic survey at 30m.
The GPS readings were taken with a Garmin GPS 95 Model. and corresponded to the
approximate heading proposed by the SOGETI report and were: S207 10'22.1:
E057'25'30.8. corresponding to 650 m offshore and 30 m depth.
In addition to the AFRC diving survey. and underwater video was taken along the
whole length of the proposed outfall i.e. from a depth of 28 m up to = 2 m depths.

algal mats - mainly on the sand patches. Live corals, such as encrusting (e.g. Porites
spp.). massive and submassive corals (see Appendix K) were present. A small
percentage of dead massive coral (< 2%) was present, whilst soft corals were
relatively abundant (7.3% of cover).

In summary. the combination of underwater surveys and video clearly demonstrated
the nature of the seabed and the state of the sub-littoral marine environment off
Montagne Jacquot, the proposed site of the ocean outfall. Although the fringing reef
breaks at this point. and the substratum is characterised mainly by rock. sand and
rubble, there is up to 30% coral cover at depths around 7m. which reduces to around
15-20% with increasing depth. Corals with associated infauna. encrusting sponges
and algae. which are the predominant taxa. are all common. ubiquitous species in
Mauritius. with no rare. endangered or even uncommon species identified. Because of
the break in the fringing reef. and the exposed nature of the headland at Montagne
Jacquot. only the most robust corals appear to survive, and this together with low
species diversity is frequently characteristic of impacted environments.
4.3    Socio-Economic Env;ironment
This section of the EIAR' describes the socio-economic environment in the Studv
Area. The human population directly affected by the proposed Montagne Jacquot
sewage and sanitation project is described in terms of composition. household
structure and household income. The affected population includes the residential and
artisanal fishing communities which live in close proximity to existing sewage outfalls
at Bain des Dames and Pointe aux Sables. and near the site of the new WWT plant at
at Montagne Jacquot.
Land use. land ownership. economic activities. industries. historical/cultural sites. and
recreational sites in the affected area are also discussed in this section.

4.3.1   Affected Populationi and community structure
(NPDP 1993)
The population of Mauritius is divided into four types of ethnic groups: general
population (includes the descendants of Europeans and the freed slave population).
Indians. Indo-Mauritian (Indians born in Mauritius) and the Chinese. The estimated
population size in June 1990 was 1 025 448. on a land area of 186 500 ha. with the
growth per annum between 1983-1990 being less than I percent. This makes
Mauritius one of the most densely populated agricultural islands in the World. with
considerable pressures on land resources.
In 1983. the urban population constituted 41.7% of the total population in Mauritius
but had declined by 1990 to 40.5%. The majority of this urban population (55.3%) is
concentrated in the urban districts of Plaines Wilhems and Port Louis. a large portion
of which is in the Studv Area for the proposed project (see Figure 1.1. Section 1.0).
The public services and infrastructure in the Plaines Wilhems and Port Louis areas are
therefore under considerable pressure.
The average household size in Mauritius decreased from 4.8 persons in 1983 to 4.4
persons in 1990. From the 1990 census, the proportion of the population in the age
group 0-14 years was expected to fall from 29.3% to 27.8% in 1994. The working-age
group has increased at a faster rate than the rest of the population. so that in the 1990
census 13 000 unemploved people were recorded. which is only a 3.2%
unemployment rate.  Women have become more active in the labour market with a
consequent need for child care services and assistance with management of
households.
Since the majoritv of the manufacturing industries in Mauritius are concentrated
around Port Louis (see Section 4.3.3) it is significant that 34% of the projected
emplovment in 1994 was in the manufacturing industry. and 41% of the working
population were emploved in industry-related occupations (e.g. craft and related trade
workers. plant and machine operators and assemblers).
These demographic trends have implications over medium and long-term trends e.g.
there will be a fall in the school age population. with the result that health and other
support services will require corresponding changes.

4.3.1 .I Communities affected by current arrangementsfor sewage disposval
The investication for the present EIA found that there is a strong awareness among the
inhabitants of Bain des Dames and Pointe aux Sables as to the nature and extent of the
pollution problem caused bv sewage and industrial discharges. The fishermen of both
these communities are particularlv aware of the problem and have been active in
voicing their opinion to government in the past few years. which has also often been
reported in the local Press.
These media reports highlighted incidents such as the discharge of used fuel.
detergents and chemical compounds (e.g. the Mauritian L'Express 30th May 1997 -
see Appendix I). During heavy rains, effluent flows out of the Lataniers and Caudan
River estuaries. and deposits garbage such as plastic bottles. dead animals. used water
from dyeing plants. and rubber pieces into the sea.
Other media reports have documented the following:
0 Air pollution and sewage discharged from the chemical fertilizer factory in Bain
des Dames.
0 The impact of untreated sewage effluent. particularly from the Tour Koenig
Industrial Zone. is a threat to the marine life at Pointe aux Sables area ( 1 8th Dec
1994: 5th July 1995). The Society for the Protection & Conservation of the
Environment (SPACE) noted that the rivers had been transformed into drains"
for discharge of polluted effluents from the industrial estates.
O The discharge of waste water from the housing estates of the Mare Gravier area.
and the wastes of the Export Processing Zone of Coromandel. are being
discharged in the sea hardly a few metres from the Pointe aux Sables lagoon (5th
March 1997)
0 The presence of dead fish floating in the area of Bain des Dames and Pointe aux
Sables has been reported on various occasions (11th Dec 1994. 25th Feb 1997).
The communities which are most seriously affected by the current sewage discharge
arrangements are at Bain des Dames and Pointe aux Sables.

The Pointe aux Sables area is referred to as the 'Debarcadere' area since a Sunday
open market is held here and it is where the fishermen have a work post. There were

about 3.800 residents in the Pointe-aux Sables communitv (1990 census). and
according to unofficial information from the census office. some 4.000 residents in
1996. Most of the residents in the area fall within the skilled and semi-skilled
categJories. with incomes ranging from Rs2000 to RsSOOO monthly. The issue of
obtaining more information on incomes. and more personal information relevant to
this studv. is a sensitive issue in Mauritius. Incomes for example are regarded as a
completely private atfair.
Community meetings/interviews. using an informal approach. were conducted duringt
May 1997 on three different occasions with the fishermen of the Pointe aux Sables
area.
0  At the first meeting. one spokesman for the fishermen described the present
situation and the problems encountered at Pointe aux Sables.
0  On the second occasion. the area was visited and various people met and
interviewed in Pointe aux Sable area so as to obtain the views of residents.
0 The third visit was on a Sunday morning. Sundav being market day. and thus more
people would be readily available. It was an opportunity to obtain different points
of view from the residents of the Pointe aux Sables beach area. includin- some of
the youngsters. They were willing to relate their problems and also offered
suggestions as to their expectations for their area.
The issues raised from these interviews and in community meetings are summarised in
Appendix H.
Bain des Dames Communities
The Bain des Dames area borders the relatively calm bay near the mouth of the
GRNW river mouth (see Figure 1. I). This bav is very sheltered due to the preserice of
a strip of rock that was laid ten vears ago to support the existing sewage outfall at Fort
Victoria. At the north side of the bay is the Port Louis Harbour and the Mer Rouge
area. where a major land fill project has been carried out. In the bay a ship wreck is
visible directly opposite Bain des Dames.
The Fort Victoria Treatment Works and a Central Electricity Board (CEB) oil turbine
station are found at the south side of Bain des Dames. At the north side of the bav is a
fish landing station which is near a sewer canal carrving discharge from inland sites
(e.g. Cassis and Caudan).

Montagne Jo qcurot Sewerage and Sanitationr Project      Environmental impact .4ssessment
There are a number of important public buildings. sites and residential areas at Bain
des Dames including a Social Welfare Centre under construction. a football ground. a
Green area designated as a recreational centre by MEQOL and a Hindu Temple
(refer to Figure 4.8). In addition there is a housing estate (better known as -cite-)
w,khich houses 30 families. and other houses for + 200 families (I 000 individuals). The
population at Bain des Dames was estimated at 450 (100 families) in the 1990 census.
and according to the census office. may now even be reduced because of the insanitary
conditions prevailing in the area. Most of the residents are working class e.g. manual
labourers. but there are also about 70 fishermen operating in the area.
The impact of the sewage effluent is very evident in Bain des Dames - extensive
eutrophication is occurring in the area indicated by the layer of green algae on the
surface of the rocks (see Plate 4.9). accumulation of algae and rubbish (e.g. plastic
bottles. material etc.) on the beach. The discharge of waste from the sewage works is
exacerbated bv the presence domestic waste from the residential area of Cassis. The
road from Cassis to the beach is boarded on both sides by an uncovered drain which is
used as a general rubbish dump by the community. There is presently little being
done by the Department of Health. Sanitary Dept.. to control domestic waste disposal
into the drain. and this. combined with the impacts of sewage have resulted in the
aesthetics of the area being completely destroyed.
Noise and air pollution from CEB turbine is another problem in the area. Residents
have complained repeatedly to the CEB, and there is presently an active group
pressurising the CEB to shift the station. The noise from the turbine is easily
detectable in the residential area and causes constant vibrations within the houses.
Community meetings held at Bain des Dames during May 1997 resulted in a number
of issues bein, raised. which are reported in Appendix H.
4.3 .1.2 Otfcilitr of life and economic prospects of affected communities
The sociological survey has highlighted the negative impact of sewage effluent on the
living standards of communities in both the Pointe aux Sables and Bain des Dames
areas. Both communities are suffering from diseases (e.g. skin and gastrointestinal
problems) and extremely poor living conditions as a result of untreated sewage
accumulating in embayments or being deposited on the beaches near residences.

Montagne Jocqitw Sewerage and Sanitation Project               Environmental Impact -issessment
The decline in the fisheries in the affected areas is probably partly due to overfishing.
but the situation is exacerbated bv environrmental degradation resulting from diverse
non-point sources of pollution and decline in the overall productivitN of coastal
ecosv stems. The economic prospects of the affected areas are unlikelv to improve until
environmental degradation can be halted. and improvements in public health can be
achieved. as the first steps towards improved quality of life.
4.3.2.  Land use
The land use patterns in Mauritius during 1986 are shown in Table 4.4. It is clear that
the dominant land use in the country is agriculture which comprises 48.3% of the total
land area. Sugar cane is the main agricultural product (93% of all agriculture). with
35%  of the land being occupied by forests. shrubs. grasslands and Lrazini  lands.
Note that only 1.3% of the land is natural forests. About half of the land in the Study
Area is being used for sugar cane (Table 4.4. Figure 4.7) which is concentrated west of
the GRNW and on the border of the Pointe aux Sables residential area. A small
percentage of other cultivation (e.g tea) also occurs in the Study Area.

A small area of planted forest (i 3%) occurs in the Pouce Valley and near Guiby Peak
(Figure 4.7). Other vegetation in the Study Area is the savannah grassland at
Montagne Jacquot (see also Figure 4.8) which covers less than one percent of the

whole Stud- Area. and scattered scrub occurrinz on land not occupied by sugar cane
or the built-up populated areas around Port Louis.
The residential area at Pointe aux Sables stretches along both sides of the main road
travelling2 parallel to the coast. The side bordering the sea consists of bungalows built
in the 1970s. and the opposite side of the road is mainly occupied by older people.
Some fairly neu- apartment blocks were built and were donated to the lower class by
the GOM. These apartments are called the Cite housing estates and are behind the old
residential area i.e. further from the sea. No new bungalows are being built at Pointe
aux Sables since this area does not attract new investors or tourists at present4.
A wetland used to exist opposite the Debarcad&re (the market area at Pointe aux
Sables) but has since been filled and buildings built over it.
The proposed spatial pattern of development and distribution of the major land uses
are shown in Figure 4.7. Major new developments are concentrated in a limited
number of locations, and in the Study Area. the following NPDP Planning Zones are
relevant:
(I) Port Louis
(2) Pailles
(3) Pointe aux Sables
(25) Beau Bassin and Rose Hill
A "Green field" development is a term used by the NPDP which is the use of presently
undeveloped sites within built-up areas and inside settlement areas. in the Studv Area
there is only one area identified as "available" i.e. vacantuncultivated. under utilised.

Other plan proposals in the Study Area include:
0  three separate 300 ha plots has been allocated as housing land by the Ministry of
Housing. Lands and Country Planning. They are situated on a "Green Field" site at
the edge of the existing Pointe aux Sables residential area (Figure 4.7 and 4.8).

4.3.3.  Economic Activities
A-riculture
The agricultural sector plays a vital role in the social and economic development of
Mauritius. Sugar cane is the dominant crop in the agricultural industry with sugar
and its bv products contributing to 34% of the total foreign exchange earnings in 1989
(MEQOL 1991). Recent figures show that cane sugar and molasses contributed to
930/% of the total non-EPZ domestic exports of agricultural products (Table 4.5). CuT
flowers provide a low volume/high value export product which also contributes to the
agricultural economy of the Island.

Fishing
The fishernan of the Pointe aux Sables and Bain des Dames areas form part of the
artisanal fishery in Mauritius. which consists of coastal operations in lacgoons and
alon- the extemal edge of the barrier reef down to the 200 m isobath. These fishing
grounds spread over an area of 1 020 km2 with an annual landing of 1 353 tonnes in
the 1980's and 1 612 tonnes in the 1990's (AFRC Annual Report 1995). The NPDP

1993 tforecasted that this level was not likelv to be exceeded in the foreseeable future
since the sustainable limit has been reached (See also 4.3.1. 1). The most common fish
species captured by the artisanal fisherv frorn the lagoon stocks on the west coast are:
capitaine (Lethrinus nebulosus). dame berri (L.mahsena). and cordonnier (Siganus
sitlur). Ourite (Octopus vulgaris) are also abundant in the catches of the w\est coast
fisherv.
The onlv other fishing industry in Mauritian coastal waters are the Bank Fisheries
which consist of deep water shrimp and fish catches on the Rodriguan. Northern and
Soudan Banks. and along the Mauritius-Seychelles ridge (includes Save de Malha and
Nazareth Banks and the St Brandon group of islands) (Figure 2.1). the industrial
fisherv (mainly tunas). and aquaculture. The deep water fishery is not directlx
affected by the proposed development although it is indirectlv affected in that the
fisherman presently working close inshore. will be forced to start fishing in deeper and
deeper waters and impact on these fish populations.
A"Ianuiwtruring- industries
Manufacturing industries include: (a) agro-industries (sugar and tobacco processing
etc). and (b) export products (such as sugar. tea and textiles and garments etc.). The
Export Processing Zone (EPZ) is a dvnamic sector in the manufacturinmz sector and
contributed MRs 15 333 to the export market in 1996. Most of these export products
were manufactured articles (95%) such as textiles, and miscellaneous articles (MEPZ
1996). emphasising the overall importance of the manufacturing industry.
The textile industry contributes to environmental degradation in two principal ways: a)
effluent from dyeing activities and b) textile cuts, wastes and used wrapping materials
(includes plastic products and cartons (MEQOL 1991). Appendix I shows the quality
of typical waste water effluents from dyeing activities. The Prefeasibility Report
Update (Black & Veatch International June 1997) indicated that color and salinitv and
some amount of fabric particles (in the form  of TSS) from effluents of textile
industries will not cause violation of ocean discharge standards. Although color and
turbiditv are not normally considered a serious pollution problem. high color presents
aesthetic problems and TSS can form sludge deposits if discharged in significant
quantities (See also Section 2 and Appendix Q).
Both the Coromandel and Plaine Lauzun Industrial Estates are owned by the
Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM). and most major industrial activities in the
service area of the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant are located in these estates. The

proportion of all industries connected to the sewerage systems in the Studv Area are:
Port Louis - 47.6%: Upper Plaines Wilhems - 18.3% (MEQOL 1991).
No suLgar factories or textile stone washing plants are located in the Study Area
(Fioure 4.7) and so this source of pollution is not a problem. There is at least one
stone crusher near the Study Area - these plants provide construction material and the
main problem is dust emissions during the crushing process.
.NPDP (1995) plan proposals for economic development
The projections to the vear 2010 show that there will be an increase mainly in
manufacturing. some construction. retailing. transport and offices. whilst numbers
employed in agriculture will decrease. Within the manufacturing sector. the GOM is
trving to diversify industry to include value-added export products (e.g. jewelry etc.).
The planning strategy is to provide a better spatial distribution of emplovment areas in
relation to places of residence - since the present trend is for industries to move to Port
Louis where it is alreadv congested i.e. no new land for large-scale manufacturing is
permitted in the Port Louis area.  The Pointe aux Sables inland area has been
designated as one of the Planning Zones in the country which covers 89 ha of land
allocated for large-scale manufacturing. and 5 ha for small-scale (< 10 emplovees)
manufacturing (see also Figure 4.8).
Policv No. 1.9 is a plan proposal to allocate land for polluting industries. such as
textile factories e.g. a 20ha site at Beau Vallon near the airport and Mahebouria.
4.3.4.  Recreation
In addition to the residential properties along the beach. there are two public areas at
Pointe aux Sables which can be used for recreation: (a) the place known as
-'Debarcadere- where the fishermen operate, and (b) the public beach area about I km
to the south (see Figure 4.9). The beaches are affected by the existing sewage
discharge from the Pointe aux Sables works. The area declared as a Public Beach' by
the local authoritv does not have a specific name and but is a well manaued and
landscaped area.  There is.- however. evidence of pollution on the beach (see also
secton 4.2.2). Recreational fishing occurs on the rocks at Montagne Jacquot (pers obs.
and see Plate 4.2) and people use the cliff just to the south of Montagne Jacquot as a
diving platform (see Figure 4.9).

The cultural and historical sites present in the Studv Area are indicated in Figure 4.9.
Historical buildings/structures which are in close proximity to the proposed
development are:
a) Transfer mains pipeline. Alternative I (seeFigure 1.1)

5.0   PREDICTION AND EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
The overall environmental impacts of waste water projects are positive since they
prevent or alleviate the effects of pollutants on the human and natural environments
(World Bank 1991). In addition. installation of a waste water collection and treatment
works provides an opportunity for more effective control of industrial wastewater
through pretreatment and connection to public sewers. and offers the potential for
beneficial reuse of treated waste water.
Some of the observed environmental impacts which result from discharging untreated
sewerage effluent into the sea at Pointe aux Sables and Fort Victoria have alreadx been
highlighted in Section 4 (see Plates 4.9 and 4.10. Press Release in Appendix M).
However, a more detailed evaluation of both the positive and negative environmental
and socio-economic impacts. which might be expected as a result of the Montagne
Jacquot project. is provided in this section of the EIAR.
5.1   Assessment Criteria
The approach used to assess the significance of the potential impacts is to apply
"significance ratings" to each impact using objective criteria. such as magnitude. extent
and duration of that impact to yield a final evaluation of the significance of impacts.
The use of significance ratings reduces the number of variables which need to be
considered bv the decision-maker. whilst providing pertinent information about the
implications of the proposed project. -Appendix N summarises the assessment criteria
used in this study.
There are four main parts of the Study Area which will be affected by the proposed
project:
I. The proposed site at Montagne Jacquot allocated for the new WWT plant
2. The proposed site of the new outfall into the ocean at Montagne Jacquot
3. The new pipeline route transferring waste water from the Fort Victoria and Pointe
aux Sables works to the new WWT plant at Montagne Jacquot.
4. The existing works and ocean outfalls at Pointe aux Sables and Fort Victoria.
As the possibility of waste water re-use for irrigation does not appear to be a viable
alternative in the short term (see 2.3.6.1) and at least until further studies are

commissioned. the potentially significant impacts of this aspect of the project have not
been included in the evaluation.
The principal potential negative and positive environmental impacts (environmental
and socio-economic) arising as a result of the project are summarised in the followine
Table 5.1 which shows potential impacts during the construction and operational phases
of the project. together with their significance ratings. suggested mitigation measures.
and the significance of the impact before and after mitigation.

After the impact analysis shown in table 5.1 had been completed. impacts which were
rated as highlv significant were evaluated to assess their potential for reversibility or
irreversibilitv, cumulative effects. their probability of occurrence and the risks
associated with them. This evaluation is shown in Table 5.2. below.

The table shows that the risksassociated with all the highly significant positive and
negative impacts were considered to be low. Irreversible negative impacts included the
loss of I Oha of land for the proposed WWT plant site. and the impact of the
wastewater discharge on benthic communities in the discharge area. The project is
expected to result in cumulative and positive impacts on coastal water quality and
coastal ecosvstems. as well as public health and sanitation. with downstream beneficial
effects for realisation of economic potential of the Bain des Dames and Pointe aux
Sables areas.

Land must be acquired for different components of the project. The largest area will be
the approximately 10 ha Montagne Jacquot WWT plant site. It is located in an open.
undeveloped area southwest of the Pointe aux Sables community   The site is
unoccupied.  It is unused for any beneficial purposes. The ground is generally too
steep. too rockv and too dry for agricultural use. The nearest residents are the prisoners
in the Petite Verger Prison located immediately northwest of the site.
In addition to the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant site. it will be necessary to purchase
easements or rights-of-way for placement of the transmission pipe line across private
property. if alternative I is adopted for the transfer pipeline. The alignment of the pipe
line mostly follows existing public roadways. but there are sections which will
apparently cross private lands. Since the property surveys for the pipe line route have
not been completed. it is not possible to identify the property owners. or to establish
exactlv how much land will be required. However. the alignment was chosen to avoid
crossing any residential property or any property occupied by business or commerce
which would have to be relocated (see also section 3). The longest sections of easement
acquisition will be across land under cultivation just inland from Pointe aux Sables.
Following construction the land can be returned to its current beneficial use. and no
residents will be displaced as a result of implementing the Montagne Jacquot project.
5.2.2  Construction phase impacts
The principal significant negative impacts associated with the Montagne Jacquot project
will be experienced during the construction phase. If alternative I is adopted. this will
be mainly during trench digging to lay the main transfer pipeline from Fort Victoria via
Pointe aux Sables works to Montagne Jacquot. Whether the route chosen is along the
main road (alternative I) or across the mouth of the GRNW and through the lagoon off
Pointe aux Sables (alternative 2). mitigation of the negative impacts is not a
straightforward matter. As shown in Table 5. 1.. the disruption to traffic. congestion and
inconvenience during construction along the main road cannot be avoided if the land-
based route is adopted. as there are no other potential routes further inland. The
offshore-based option avoids the disruption along the road. but has cost implications.
both during the construction phase. and later as a result of routine maintenance and
repairs. Whichever option is chosen. the contractors will need to be closely supervised.

and competent management of the construction activities.
5.2.3  Impacts of the effluent discharge on water qualit, in receiving waters
The tvpical characteristics of the effluent to be discharged from the first phase of the
Montagne Jacquot WWT plant were presented in Section 2.3.5 which described the
treatment processes to be provided. A comparison of the typical effluent qualitv with
the water quality standards for the ocean indicates that there are no pollutants expected
in the waste water which would cause a violation of the standards. even without
considering the effects of a reasonable mixing zone in the vicinitv of the outfall. or the
further dilution effects of the effluent as it is carried away from the point of discharge.
The 1992 Gibb sewerage master plan provided a preliminary analvsis of the level of
dilution that might be required for a typical waste water effluent to meet international
ouidelines for coastal water quality standards. The analysis considered conservative
parameters such as temperature. salinity, turbidity. suspended solids. and dissolved
oxygen: nutrients in the form of common nitrogen and phosphorus compounds: toxic
inorganic substances consisting primarily of the heavy metals: and microbiological
organisms. It was assumed that toxic organic substances such as pesticides would be
controlled at the source, before entry into the public sewers. The required dilutions for
each of the water quality parameters were calculated. and found to range from
negligible dilution. required to achieve temperature standards. to 100.000. to meet the
standard for fecal coliforms for direct contact recreation. The dilutions required for the
parameters considered by Gibb (1992) are summarized in Table 5.3.
The mathematical model of the ocean outfall constructed to a depth of 30 meters
predicted that the typical dilution that would be achieved between the location of the
outfall and the sensitive receptors at the Pointe aux Sables reef and lagoon was 14.000.
Applying this dilution factor to concentrations of any reported pollutants reduces their
concentration to below the maximum acceptable levels set for lagoon water quality.
without considering any possible attenuation in the concentration of substances due to
biological or physical processes. For example, if the concentration of ammonia in the
effluent discharged from the ocean outfall is the highest value measured at the Pointe
aux Sables works. 85 mg/I. and if no attenuation was achieved in the ocean as the waste
water moved down to the lagoon. the concentration in the lagoon would be 0.006 mg/I.
which is well below the acceptable standard of Smg/l.

With a dilution factor of 14,000 and no die-off of bacteria between the outfall and the
lacoon. the concentration of fecal coliforms in the effluent could be as high as 106 '100
ml and still meet the standard of 100/100 ml. However. disinfection of the effluent will
provide assurance that the coliform concentration is consistently below the required
standard. so that the discharge for the proposed WWT plant at MontagTe Jacquot will
consistently achieve the microbiological standard.
5.2.3.1 Heavy metal and pesticide contamination
These pollutants are mentioned because they have been associated with serious
environmental pollution incidents at various locations around the world. The best data
on the occurrence of heavy metal in the coastal environment of Mauritius was published
by SOGETI in its 1995 report on the inspection and analvsis of the effects of the waste
water discharge at Pointe aux Sables. Samples of bottom sediment were collected at
about 20 locations along four transects across the Pointe aux Sables lagoon. from the
beach to the reef. The results of the analyses are shown in the following Table 5.4:

The sediment samples were analysed for copper. zinc. nickel. lead. chromium and
manganese. Unfortunatel,. no bottom sediments were collected and tested from along
the coast away from  developed areas, to provide an indication of the typical
concentration of these substances in the ambient, unaffected sediments. The results of
the SOGETI sampling program indicated that the concentrations of these metals were
higher in the sediments in the vicinitv of the drainage ditches. near the Grand River
North West end of the lagoon, and in the vicinity of the Pointe aux Sables works
outfall. A previous study had also shown that the concentration of manganese was
significantly higher in sediments from the GRNW than in sediments elsewhere alona
the coast. No other conclusions could be drawn as-to the probable source of the metals.
A measure of the significance of the concentrations of heavy metals shown in the table
can obtained bv comparing the concentrations found in the sediments with the
concentrations of the parameters considered to be acceptable in sewage sludge. The
U.S. EPA has established maximum limits for heavy metals that should not be exceeded
in sludge that is sold or given away, for use by the general public or others for any
purpose. The sludge is considered safe for any use if the concentrations are below the
values shown in the table. The 'safe' concentrations of these substances in sludge
ranged from 20 to 165 times the mean concentrations found in the sediment samples. It
was concluded that the concentrations found in the sediments were not a significant
problem. Also. even if the heavy metals found in the sediment samples were caused
wholly by the existing sewage outfall. the fact that the concentrations were generally
lo%A is a good indication that the discharge of heavy metals in concentrations found in
the Pointe aux Sables sewage effluent is not a significant threat to the environment.
No data are available on the concentrations of pesticides in the marine environment near
Pointe aux Sables or Montagne Jacquot. nor are any data available on the

M1'Iontagne Jiicquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project        Environmental Impac .AssessmenJ
concentrations of these substances in the waste water.  However. most pesticide
contamination is due to contaminated storm water runoff from agricultural lands. rather
than from point source waste water discharges. Based on a review of the industries in
the Montagne Jacquot project service area. there is no reason to suspect that significant
quantities of pesticides would be present in the industrial waste waters discharged to the
seu-eragye system.
5.2.4  Impacts of effluent disch arge on reef communities
Althou-h the wastewater discharge at Montagne Jacquot is expected to fall well within
the required effluent standard and to achieve the desired water quality standards in the
receiving environment, the actual environmental impacts of the discharge on reef
communities cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of the available information.
Experience from elsewhere suggests that the performance of individual outfalls and
environmental impacts on living communities. depends so much on the physical
dispersion characteristics of the receiving environment. that generalisations can be
misleading.
The most vulnerable organisms in the discharge area are the sessile benthic fauna. as
thev have no possibility of moving. Typically, corals are among the first organisms to
be affected by elevated nutrients and increased DOM in a wastewater dischar-e. as they
are adapted to micromolar concentrations of nutrients and rapidly become necrosed and
die-off. The situation may be exacerbated by the presence of bacteria and viruses. some
of which may survive'disinfection at the WWT plant. to attack necrosing coral tissues.
Other sessile organisms such as sponges and encrusting algae are also likelv to be
adversely affected in the inrimediate discharge area. although some algal species will
benefit from the elevated nutrient levels and grow more prolifically. providing light is
not attenuated by increased concentrations of suspended solids.
Although some baseline research has been carried out into water quality in local reef
ecosystems by the Albion Research Centre. impacts of existing wastewater discharges
have not been monitored over time or in sufficient detail to allow extrapolation to the
proposed discharge and prediction of potential impacts. Also. there is insufficient
species specific information to allow prediction of environmental impacts of the
proposed discharge on individual species.
The extent to which both corals (which tend to illicit most concern) and non-coral
species are impacted bv sewage discharges, is in fact very poorly substantiated for

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanilation Project        Environmental Impact A-Jssessment
tropical reef ecosystems. Results of a review of nutrient levels which can cause
eutrophication in coral reef systems were reported by Bell in 1991. following analvses
conducted at Kaneohe Bay. Hawaii and Barbados. It was concluded that eutrophication
can occur at inorganic nitrogen concentrations of about 0.014 mg/l and phosphate (as
phosphorus) concentrations of 0.003 to 0.006 mg/l. The report further considered it
likely that the addition of nutrients would lead to eutrophication which would cause
significant changes in the coral reef community bv promoting the growth of
phvtoplankton and benthic algae. Phytoplankton compete with the photosvnthetic
zooxanthellae in corals for light, and thus interfere with coral growth. Benthic algae
also interfere with the life processes that ordinarily occur at the coral surface. and
to-ether with filter feeders directly compete with corals for space. It is worth noting
that the highest concentrations of N and P in untreated waste water discharged from
Fort Victoria and Point aux Sables were 101.6 mg/I and 49.5 mg/I respectively. After
primary treatrnent the expected reduction in N and P will be around 20% and 15%
respectively. Consequently as the treated effluent is discharged from the ocean outfall
and diluted approximately 14000 times. it seems unlikely that the N and P
concentrations will be sufficiently high after primary treatment to cause eutrophicating
conditions. except in the immediate discharge zone.
The effects of sewage effluent on coral reef communities were also reviewed in '-Effects
of Sewage Pollution on Coral Reef Communities" (Pastorak and Bilyard. 1985). The
report concluded that although a wide range of impacts from sewage on coral reef
communities have been reported. little or no impact has been observed in well flushed
waters. Discharges into poorly flushed lagoons are the most damaging and have caused
major changes in species composition and abundance. The three components of sewage
considered most detrimental to coral communities were nutrients. sediments. and toxic
substances. Nutrient enrichment mainly from terrestrial sources has caused significant
impacts over substantial areas of the Great Barrier Reef. and so reduction in nutrient
concentrations from both point and diffuse sources is now a pivotal strategy in the Great
Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority water quality improvement programme. As settled
solids will be removed from the discharged effluent during primary treatment at
Montagne Jacquot. heavy sediment loads which may be lethal to corals. and lesser
quantities which may inhibit the growth or alter species composition. are not expected
to cause problems in the discharge area off Montagne Jacquot.
Rogers (1990) described the variety of mechanisms used by corals in coping with
sediments. Where currents and wave action are strong, water movement will help keep
sediment particles from settling on corals. and corals will exert less energy in sediment

rejection. A common problem in working with corals is that field studies frequentli
vield contradictory results. which may also differ from laboratory results. which means
that site specific and species specific information is necessary to predict impacts of
effluent discharges accurately. In the present case. the lack of species specific
information. in particular means that the implications of the proposed wastewater
discharge for individual species cannot be predicted
Despite the system of diffusers and expected dispersion and dilution performance of the
outfall. the relatively slow bottom currents in the discharge area at some periods of
year. mav militate against steady removal of effluent out of the main discharge area.
leading to eutrophication of coastal waters off Montagne Jacquot in comparison with
areas not affected by wastewater discharges. The extent of this effect will onlh be
established during follow-up monitoring water qualitv surveys. The target water quality
standards which the discharge will be required to meet to allow recreational activities in
the waters off Montagne Jacquot. and the introduction of a disinfection stage into the
effluent treatment process. means that the potential health hazards for swimmers. divers
etc. in the vicinity of the outfall will be negligible.
As mentioned above, because of the extreme sensitivity of corals to elevated nutrient
concentrations, it is highly likely that some bleaching and death will be observed in
communities near to the discharge and some damage can be expected to extend as far as
Pointe aux Sables reef. However. the extent of the area impacted by the discharge
cannot be predicted accurately at present. and it would only be possible to reduce this
area if hieher levels of treatment were installed at the WWT plant.
Inevitably loss of corals leads io progressive deterioration of the reef ecosvstem. since it
is dependent on coral productivity to drive the system. so that the greater resilience of
associated species becomes more or less irrelevant. Whilst it is obviously preferable to
avoid anv deterioration in coastal marine communities and reef ecosvstems in particular
because of the manv important resource generation and protection functions the! serve.
there are verv few locations around the coast of Mauritius where it is possible to avoid
coral reefs. The site adopted for the Montagne Jacquot outfall is one of the fesx breaks
in the reef on the west coast of Mauritius suitable for an outfall. where the
consequences of some deterioration in reef communities (not of exceptional quality or
diversitv) are acceptable. on grounds of making possible the urgent and very necessarv
improvements in environmental qualitv further north.

5.2.5 Impacts of tize Montagne Jacquot WWT plant
The impacts resulting from normal operation of the new WWT plant at Montagne
Jacquot will depend to a large extent on whether the plant is efficiently and properly
managed. The potentially significant impacts can be mitigated in the course of normal
operations at the site and/or through supervision and monitoring of staff activity A
plant of this type can produce offensive odors. and if they prove to be unacceptable to
the local residents. as a result of their frequency. duration or magnitude. new odor
control facilities can be constructed. Additionally if the sludge disposal operation is not
managed cleanly and efficiently. it is likely to result in complaints from the general
public. The technology on site will be relatively straightforward to manage. and so the
most important element in maintaining future trouble free operations is to ensure that
the plant staff are conscientious and committed to running a well managed operation.
But no matter how efficientlv the WWT plant and associated operations are managed. it
seems unlikelv that it will be possible to avoid some localised impact on property
values in the vicinity of the plant. However. the inclusion of the 400m buffer zone.
planted up with trees will do much to mitigate the negative impact on property values.
which may recover once local residents realise that a modem-day WWT plant which is
properly managed need not have the same offensive environmental impacts as many of
it's predecessors.
5.3.  Potential positive impacts associated with the project
The environmental and socio-economic impacts of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage
and Sanitation Project are expected to be overwhelmingly positive. The present
discharge arrangements in the Port Louis area and south beyond Pointe aux Sables are
resulting in extremelv poor environmental quality. unacceptable impacts on human
health and well-being. The degradation of the marine enviromnent is so serious that
only a few species can survive in the areas affected bv waste water discharges.
Removal of the discharge point to the proposed location off Montagne Jacquot.
combined with treatment and disinfection. is expected to result in major improvements
in environmental quality in coastal waters. along the shoreline and in the coastal
v illages from Port Louis to Montagne Jacquot.

5.3.1  Benieficial impact of rehabilitation of coastal ecosystems
The implementation of the Montagne Jacquot Project. and in particular the
decommissionin- of several outfalls and their replacement with a single ocean outfall
off Montagne Jacquot. is expected to have some immediate beneficial effects. but
because of the exceptionally serious degraded state of the local marine environment.
natural rehabilitation of the currently affected areas will take some time. It is possible
however, that as a result of a single cyclonic event. the coastal embayments will be
flushed out and residual settled sewage sludge will be carried offshore - but cvclonic
events cannot be depended upon to have this effect. It is more likely that normal seaside
activities such as swimming. fishing, various activities in boats and beachcombiny will
only be resumed in the Bain des Dames and at Pointe aux Sables after several vears. as
locals overcome their concerns about health risks and realise that these activities can
become a part of their normal lives. As the contributions from the port and the GRNW
to coastal pollution have not been evaluated and will not be diminished by the proposed
project. it could take many years before improvements are recognised. Natural
rehabilitation mav be assisted nevertheless. by communitv efforts at beach cleaning.
removal of waste garbage from the shoreline. In the longer term. rehabilitation of
coastal ecosystems should include recovery of the coastal fishery to some extent.
providing there are no other adverse impacts which halt the rehabilitation process.
5.3.2  Beneficial impacts of improved healtih of affected communities
The undermining effect of poor health resulting from frequent ear. nose and throat
infections. and respiratory disease as well as debilitating skin infections such as those
frequently experienced by fishermen in the area, has a serious undermining effect on the
energy and industry of any community. Restoration of better health and morale to those
currently affected communities in the Bain des Dames and Pointe aux Sables areas. is
likely to result in initiatives for self-improvement and developing economic actixits.
5.4.   Economic costs and benefits of the Montagne Jacquot project
The economic costs of the project can be divided into the capital cost of financing the
construction of the facilities. the annual costs of operating and maintaining them. and a
variety of other costs to the community as a whole. The most readily apparent costs are
the values of goods and services and altemnative investments that have to be foregone
because the money is expended for the sewerage project instead of something else.
This can be approximated by the initial capital costs of construction and the ongoing
Black & Veatich International            5.16                       Environmental impacts



Monlagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitatioji Project          Environmental Impact Assessment
monetary costs of operation and maintenance. The economic costs associated with the
project include all costs to the people of Mauritius (and visitors- and foreicn monies).
not just those directly incurred by the Waste Water Authority. Examples of these
external costs are the lost time and added expense of travel and inconvenience due to
traffic congestion during construction. and the intangible costs due to nuisances such as
odors from sludge hauling trucks. or noise from the pump stations. or unsightly
industrial facilities. The cost of damage to the ocean and the local environment is
another type of cost that cannot be quantified.
Economic benefits can be as difficult to quantifv as some economic costs. It can be
argued that the value of the benefit of having better sewerage facilities is at least equal
to the cost of providing the facilities - otherwise the community would elect not to
build them. The economic benefit of cleaner water at Bain des Dames and at Pointe
aux Sables will be certain. but providing accurate estimates of the value is not possible.
Rational approaches have been developed to estimate the value of recreation. for
example. but these estimates typically only consider verv limited aspects of the total
experience. One method considered appropriate is to measure how much individuals
would be willing to pay for the benefit (or to avoid the cost), but this measure also has
many drawbacks since the willingness to pay varies with countless parameters among
the countless individuals participating in the recreation. Also. the value of better health
among the local population cannot be accurately estimated. For example. there are no
data or statistics on the incidence of illnesses (of all kinds) which can be attributed to
exposure to the unsanitary conditions. nor any data which can be used to determine the
extent to which the unsanitarv conditions can be attributed to the sewerage svstem. nor
anv data on the costs incurred by the population due to ill health from these causes.
The costs which can be fairly accurately estimated (as compared to those mentioned in
the preceding paragraphs) are the capital costs, finance costs. and annual operation and
maintenance costs. As part of the project planning process. capital and operating costs
were estimated for the proposed treatment planL for the transmission pipe lines. and for
the two new pump stations at Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables. as shown in Table
5.5 below.
Operating costs for waste water systems are primarily due to the cost of labor to operate
and maintain the system. the cost of chemicals required for process operations. the cost
of supplies and spare parts to maintain the facilities. and the cost of electricity to
operate the processes. These costs typically increase as flows increase. The preliminarv
estimate of probable annual operating cost in 2005 and beyond. for the proposed waste

water treatment facilities at Montagne Jacquot was Rs 30.5 million per vear. The
annual cost of operating and maintaining the proposed pump stations and transmission
mains was estimated to be Rs 5 million per year.
The cost of financino the construction of the proposed facilities must also be considered
as part of the total project cost. The financing cost will depend primarily on the source
of the money borrowed to pav for the construction and the terms of the loans. Several
alternative financial packages are being considered. The estimated effective interest
rate over the life of the loans will be between 6.5 and 7.0 percent. based on constant
valued Rupees. On this basis. the equivalent annual cost of the loans will be between
Rs 95 million and Rs 100 million per year.
5.4.1  Realisation of economic benefits of tlhe project
The realisation of manv of the potential economic benefits of the Monta(gne Jacquot
project will depend on a multitude of factors, including macro-economic conditions
prevailing in the next few vears. the capacity and will of government to assist
communities with development of skills and business opportunities. the time scale of
rehabilitation of coastal water quality and natural ecosystems as well as motivation and
initiatives by local communities themselves.
There is little doubt that development of strategic plans with the relevant gtovernment
agencies for regeneratin- and enhancing economic opportunities of the worst affected
communities. will help them to realise the economic potential of the area. Because of
the proximity of the Bain des Dames and Pointe aux Sables communities to the main
commercial centre of Mauritius. and the recognition they have already received as
potential recreational zones in the city, it is likely that development of the services and
propertv sectors and development of tourism. may well assist in the diversification of
economic activity and expansion of employment opportunities in the area.

5.4.2 Development of service sector and propertv market
Improvements in environmental quality in the Bain des Dames and Pointe aux Sables
area. and especially the removal of offensive odors and negative aesthetic impact of raw
sewagye and miscellaneous debris on the shoreline. will almost inevitably result in these
areas becoming more sought after, both for residential and business / commercial
premises. with consequent direct impact on real estate prices. A port-side location is
advantageous for a whole range of businesses and, commercial activities servicing the
port itself and international and local trade through the port. so that marine equipment
and service providers. small boat and yacht building. cartographic and marine suppliers
and many others types of business are likely to show renewed interest in the area as a
direct consequence of improvements in environmental quality The pressure for space is
already being felt in the central port zone. and in the long term. if plans to expand the
economic free trade zone are realised. there will almost certainlv be renewed interest
from the property and investment sectors in the Bain des Dames area in particular. The
associated drive for improved infrastructure. especially in relation to water. sewage and
communications and roads. will drive up property prices still further. and stimulate the
building sector to improve / adapt and renovate existing properties or build new ones.
Similarly, development of businesses which depend on raw materials or products
landed at the port - will also look on the area with renewed interest. These might range
from fish restaurants to software houses. but property close to the port and main island
infrastructure is likely to be a prime consideration. Despite the new developments
which have occurred'in the main port area. Bain des Dames. with it's remaining
traditional homes. mix of cultures and colonial properties. will be highly sought after to
develop restaurants. wine bars and jazz clubs etc.
5.4.3  Development of tourism sector
Although the time scale of rehabilitation of coastal ecosystems is difficult to predict. the
potentiallv positive economic benefits resulting directly from improvements in water
quality in the Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables areas. will immediately- make it
feasible to conduct a range of recreational activities in coastal waters which have
previously been avoided by locals and tourists The traditional / fishing communities
Bain des Dames and Pointe aux Sables are ideally located for developing water based
activities. Sightseeing. fishing and diving from shore-based boating enterprises. as well
as visiting the port or reefs accessible from the port base. may well become potential
business development areas. Sailing, wind-surfing. canoeing. water skiing and other

wind or motor-driven activities all become possible near Fort Victoria and in the Pointe
aux Sables lagoon with improved water quality. with associated potential for expansion
of hire companies to service tourists along this stretch of coast. Bird wvatching and
photographic tours. boat trips to attractive localities along the coast. may all find a
market close to the port and contribute to the incomes of local communities.
5.4.4  Rehabilitatioin of coastal fishery
The prospects for rehabilitation of the coastal fishery are difficult to predict - much
depends on the rate at which natural functions are restored to the coastal ecosy stems.
and the extent to which spawning areas for the main coastal fish species have been
irreversiblv damaged. There is insufficient information available at present to provide a
realistic evaluation of the prospects. but clearly. for those traditional fishinu
communities in the area who currently have to travel long distances to fishing grounds
further south. incurring time and additional costs. the gradual rehabilitation of coastal
fisheries closer to home is a very important issue. There is little doubt that a return to
sustainable exploitation of fisheries in easy access of their home port. would be widelx
supported bv the local traditional fishing communities.
5.4.5 Protection of biodiversity resources
The extent to which coastal marine and estuarine biodiversity resources have been
irreversibly damaaged by the current disposal arrangements is impossible to predict. To
our certain knowledge there were no detailed evaluations of the coastal marine
resources prior to the present degraded situation developing in the Port Louis area. and
there is really only anecdotal'evidence to testify to the gradual decline in fishery and
coral reef ecosystems off Port Louis and Pointe aux Sables. Although it is very unlikely
that the natural resources base in coastal waters close to Port Louis will ever fully
rehabilitate, the partial restoration of normal ecosystem functions will assist to some
extent in the rehabilitation of west coast waters, by reducing inputs of' untreated
effluents. Because of the gross deterioration in water and sediment quality. it is highly
unlikely that any exceptionally protection-worthy species have survived. although
confirmation of this presumption will have to await more detailed studies. At this stage.
the most we can say is that the improvements that the Montagne Jacquot project will
bring to the area. can only benefit protection of biodiversity. by reversing the trend
towards increased degradation of the directly impacted and adjacent ecosystems.

Montagite Jacqnot Sewerage and Sanitation Project       Environmental Impact Assessment
Field studies carried out during this environmental impact assessment indicate that there
are no conservation-worthy biodiversity resources in the area which will potentially be
impacted by the new discharge off Montagne Jacquot. Although common species of
coral are present in the area, there is relatively low species diversity. with maximum of
30% coral cover at 7m depth in the discharge area. It appears that these communities
are already impacted to some extent from the combined effects of phvsical storm
damage to the reef and eutrophication originating at the existing discharges.
5.5.   Economic costs and risks of the no-project option
For the communities which are currently tolerating the gross irnpacts of the present
lamentable situation. the costs of not implementing the Montagne Jacquot project are
incalculable. All the potential improvements mentioned above in quality of life. health
and transformation of the economic prospects in the affected communities will simply
not materialise. Whilst it is often helpful to provide estimates of economic costs and
benefits in hard currency. in the present case. there are many unknowns which make
such a calculation meaningless. Realisation of potential economic benefits depends on
many factors which are outside the scope of this study to determine such as long term
macro-economic trends and motivation from within the communities themselves to
diversify economic activity. Equally an assessment of the costs incurred through the
present situation depend partly on information which it is impossible to establish
correctlv - such as the costs of medication to treat illness resulting from the existing
discharge arrangements in the worst affected communities and the indirect costs of poor
health in terms of unrealised human potential and social capital. Because of the
hypothetical nature of the quantitative economic evaluation, it has been excluded from
this EIA.
5.6.   Potential irreversible and residual negative impacts of the project
The irreversible and residual negative impacts of the Montagne Jacquot project are
those negative impacts for which no mitigation measures have been identified and
which are irreversible once they have occurred (see table 5.2.) Taking the main
components of the project in turn, these impacts may be summarised as follows:
0 direct loss of land as a result of locating WWT plant at Montagne Jacquot.
0 associated loss of recreational opportunities along shoreline boundary of site.
0 decrease in value of real estate adjacent to WWT plant site.
0 limitations on the use of land adjacent to the plant for residential developments.

Montague Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project           Environmental Impact .4.xSe.Ssment
These residual negative impacts in relation to the site are inevitable. and as far as we
can discern. there are no mitigrating measures which can be taken at that location to
offset the impacts. Information which emerged in scoping sessions (see Appendix H)
should be verified regarding granting of planning permission for new- residential
developments. since these may be fundamentally affected bv the need for a buffer zone
around the Montagne Jacquot plant.
With respect to the location and functions of the ocean outfall. residual negative
impacts will result from
O  the placement of the outfall structure at the proposed location with inevitable loss of
benthic communities along the pipeline route.
O  the discharge of treated effluent from the outfall. with inevitable impacts on benthic and
planktonic biota.
With care on the part of the contractors to minimise disturbance during the pipeline
emplacement operations. the direct losses of benthic organisms and general disruption
of the communities can be kept to a minimum. Certainly the benthic infauna are very
resilient and normally recover rapidly. but damage to corals cannot be reversed - once
the calcareous structural components have been damaged there is no possibility of
restoration except in the long term. It is inevitable that communities in close proximity
to the discharge which are subjected to elevated nutrient levels. will deteriorate. but the
full extent of permanent damage to the marine communities in the outfall area will onl-
be understood following intensive monitoring of the area over a number of vears.
If the transfer pipeline between Fort Victoria and Montagne Jacquot follows the land-
based route. the main concern in the long term is the increasing pressure on an
infrastructure corridor which is already congested. If electric cables. telephone lines.
potable water mains. sewers. storm drains or other infrastructure need to be laid or
repaired along the same route. the problems of interference become increasingly acute.
The offshore-based route on the other hand has no such constraints. and once the
pipeline is laid it is very unlikely that there will be interference from other
infrastructure. However. it will be essential for the offshore trench digging operations to
be managed efficiently with implementation of all recommended mitigation measures.
if further environmental degradation in the marine environment is to be avoided.

6.0   ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
6.1.  Alternatives to be considered for the Montagne Jacquot project
The main options which will need to be considered before final decisions are made
regarding the components of Montagne Jacquot to be implemented are as follows:
0  Firstly whether the project should go ahead at all; do the socio-economic and
environmental benefits outweigh the costs. and are the necessary financial resources
available to meet capital. operation and maintenance costs? The consequences of the
'no-project' option will therefore be evaluated.
0  Secondlv. the location of project components must be reviewed. includint the
preliminarv decisions which fixed the Montagne Jacquot site for the WAWT plant
together with the location of the outfall (see Figure 1.1). and the final route of the
transmission pipe lines. There are two general options regarding the route of the
transfer pipeline from Fort Victoria to Pointe aux Sables. The land-based option follows
communitv roads for most of the route. whereas the offshore-based route avoids
particularly congested stretch of road in the vicinity of the GRNW and passes across the
mount of the river and through the shallow lagoon just off the Pointe aux Sables beach.
0 The final choice which will need to be made concerns the level of treatment to be
installed at the WWT plant. The two options being considered are firstly. primary
treatment with disinfection. and the effluent discharged through the ocean outfall. or
alternatively, secondary treatment with ocean discharge of effluent.
6.2   Evaluation of alternatives
The project altematives shall be compared in terms of their potentially significant
environmental and socio-economic impacts. including capital. operational and
maintenance/repair costs. The weighting system used to evaluate each pair of options
simplv used a negative (-) and positive (+) weighting to evaluate the consequences of
one or the other option for the key environrmental and socio-economic issues
considered.
6.2.1  Evaluation of the no-project option
The following Table 6.1 summarises the key environmental and socio-economic issues
identified in the EIA and evaluates the consequences of the Montagne Jacquot project
being abandonned (ie. the no-project option) or being implemented.

The analysis is simplistic. It implicitly assumes all listed issues have the same relative
value: it only provides a single response (positive / negative) for infinitely complex and
interrelated issues; it groups complex issues into single items: it relies exclusivelv on
qualitative evaluation. Nevertheless. its value is that it distills the complex questions
and issues into specific conclusions. The result is that the analysis demonstrates the
overwhelmingly positive benefits which are likely to flow from the implementation of
the Montagne Jacquot project where enviromnental and socio-economic issues are
considered. in comparison with the no-project option.

The financial implications associated with capital. operation and maintenance costs are
the most important negative consequences of implementing the project. However. most
of the favorable financial implications could only by described qualitativelN due to the
difficulty of assigning monetary value to many of the environmental and socio-
economic costs of allowing the present situation to continue. There are inevitably costs
resulting from health impacts. from direct loss and degradation of marine resources.
losses from unrealised economic potential. reduction in social capital through loss of
well-being and quality of life in the affected communities and so on. These costs are
extremely difficult to quantify in conventional economic terms.  However. it is
generallv recognised that natural systems which have lost the ability to sustain
theilselves or the communities which were in the past dependent on them. result in
serious direct and indirect costs with ramifications far bevond the visible pollution
effects which constitute most people's evervday experience of ecosvstem deterioration.
6.2.2 Evaluation of location of project components
Montagne Jacquot Project Site. The site of the proposed waste water treatment plant
was first recommended in the 1992 sewerage master plan prepared bv Gibb (Mauritius)
for the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues. The principal advantages of the location
are:
O There is sufficient open land to provide a site large enough for initial facilities and
future plant expansions.
O It is remote from densely populated or residential areas. yet close enough to the
community to avoid the cost of excessive transmission pipe line costs.
O The plant will not displace any residential properties.
0 It is in a location alreadv served by water and electric utilities.
0 The shore line at that location is not protected by offshore reefs and lagoons. so those
valuable ecosvstems will not be directly damaged: deeper ocean waters are closer so
the ocean outfall can be shorter: and ocean currents and tidal movements provide better
dispersion of the effluent.
O The site is near to active agricultural areas which could benefit from reuse of the
effluent if it is determined to be economically feasible: the location aids the potential
for this reuse because of its proximity to potential reuse areas.
0  The plant will not takLe existing agriculturallv productive land out of production.
0 The site is lower in elevation than other potential sites further inland. which makes the
cost of transmission of the waste water lower.

Wountagne Jacquot Sewerage and Satitation Project           Environmental Impact Assessmenr
O The site is currently undeveloped and is designated as beyond the approved residential
zone in the NPDP (deferred zone). The site is rockv and dry. with poor soil and has
Iow value for agricultural use.
0 The nearest occupied property is a prison. which generally detracts from the value of
the property for alternative uses.
0Although there have been preliminary plans made by property owners in the vicinity
of the site to construct residential units. no residences or businesses exist within about
600m of the site.
0 Although there is a small amount of activity along the shoreline (fishing etc.) access
througth the buffer zone will allow these activities to continue.
The unfavorable characteristics of the site are that it has a relatively steep slope and is
underlain by basalt rock at shallow depths which will make excavation expensive. and
the placement of the structures on the site may be dictated by the ground surface
elevation rather than preferred geometric arrangements. Finally. the site is adjacent to
the coast which despite the presence of the Petite Verger prison. may have potential
value for recreation. scenic and aesthetic opportunities. and construction of the
treatment plant will conflict with these alternative uses.
It was concluded that the favorable characteristics of the site far outweighed the
unfavorable characteristics. No other location was identified which possessed all of the
favorable characteristics of the Montagne Jacquot site. although several were observed
which were more level and which had more soil over the subsurface basalt rock. The
site review was carried out by examining maps and by visual inspection of open lands
between Fort Victoria and Montagne Jacquot.
Transmission Pipeline Route. The main impacts associated with both the offshore
and the land-based option for the transfer pipeline occur during the construction phase
of the project. Once the pipeline is in place. it serves it's vital transfer function wx ithout
interfering with the lives of people living or working near it. The pipeline might only
become problematic during routine maintenance or if leaks develop and repairs become
necessarv. However. it was primarily to avoid the construction phase impacts of laying
the transfer pipeline along the main road. that the offshore based option has been
considered at all. The offshore-based option clearly has essentialIh the same
characteristics as the land-based option. in that if it fimctions without developing leaks.
or is damaged in any way. there are unlikely to be problems associated with it. except
during routine maintenance or repairs. when many of the impacts experienced during
the construction phase will again occur. However. the offshore based option is more

Table 6.2 below shows that the two options emerge as being very similar in this simple
analvsis. On the one hand the land-based option is the preferred option if cost.
technical requirements and availability of construction equipment are considered
whereas the offshore based option is preferred when the construction phase impacts are

6.2.3  Evalulation of alternative treatment options
The treatment options were evaluated on the basis of the following:
* environmental impacts of wastes discharged after treatment using different
alternatives,
* relative costs of alternative treatment options - (ie. capital. maintenance. operating).
* resources and skills required to operate and maintain plant based on different
alternative treatment options,
* legal implications - to what extent could effluent discharged from alternative
treatment plants meet water quality standards in receiving waters.
- - The deficiencies in background scientific data on marine organisms from Mauritius.
mean that the impacts of different levels of treatment at the WWT plant. cannot be
meaningfully compared at present. The level of treatment selected for a new- plant is
usually based on the water quality standards of the receiving waters. typically classified
according to their beneficial uses - as general, bathing waters or for protection of
conservation-worthy habitats or species. or the minimum treatment requirements
established by the appropriate regulatory authority. The standards are therefore set after
taking into consideration as many of the relevant factors that are known. and the
standards can be adjusted as conditions or requirements change.
Nevertheless. Table 6.3 below summarises the predicted characteristics of waste water
effluent following primary or secondary treatment at the WWT plant. and the likely
water quality in the receiving environment off Montagne Jacquot and impacts on
coastal marine communities in comparison with the present situation.
There is no doubt that installing secondary treatment at Montagne Jacquot WWT plant
will result in a higher quality effluent being discharged with removal of a larger
percentage of all the main components with potential for causing impacts. Notably the
reduction in BOD. COD. TSS. total coliformns. N and P. result in higher standards of
water quality being acheived in the receiving waters, with consequent higher standard
of protection for marine communities in the discharge area.. As has already been
discussed in section 2. the recommended alternative treatment option of primary
treatment plus disinfection with chlorine is based on the need to meet proposed national
water quality standards in the receiving waters (Gibb. 1993). Experience from
elsewhere has shown that it is not possible to predict the exact nature and extent of the
environmental impacts at a particular location, as they are dependent especially on local
dispersion characteristics of the receiving waters. The comrnunities in the proposed

discharge zone are not considered to be particularly conservation-worthy. because of
the break in the fringing reef. poor phvsical state of the reef off Montagne Jacquot and
limited species diversity in comparison with other sites in Mauritius. There is alwavs a
drive for higher standards of treatment. but the gains in environmental protection have
to be realistically balanced against the willingness of society to pay for improvements.

6.3   Recommended combination of options for Montagne Jacquot project
The evaluation of alternatives which have been considered for the Montagne Jacquot
project suggests that the following conclusions and combination of options should be
adopted on environmental and socio-economic grounds:
O All the evidence gathered in the environmental impact assessment suggests that the
Montagne Jacquot project is urgently required to address a situation which has long
been unacceptable for the affected communities, particularly in the Pointe aux Sables
and Bain des Dames area. If the no-project' option is adopted. the prospects for
improvement to local pollution which adversely affects both human communities and
marine ecosystems in the Port Louis area will be very bleak indeed. with no possibility
of restoration of natural functions in ecosystems or rehabilitation of communities with
associated economic and social revival. It is strongly recommended that the 'no-
project' option be rejected.
O The Montagne Jacquot site possesses many significant advantages which outweigh the
disadvantages of the site. notably the fact that there will be no need to relocate or
disrupt in any way residences, businesses or existing commercial operations. No other
location offers better advantages. The Montagne Jacquot site should be chosen for the
proposed waste water treatment plant.
, OThe analysis of alternative transmission pipeline routes indicates that the land-based
option will result in significant negative impacts during construction of the transfer
pipeline. However. when construction costs are considered. the potential for use of
local labor and technology for construction. the lower risk of unanticipated costs and
delays. and the lower risk of pipeline corrosion are all considered. the land-based route
is the preferred option. There are many impacts which humans are prepared to tolerate
for a better life. and although it is evident that local communities would prefer to avoid
the disruption and inconvenience during construction along the land-based route.
concems regarding additional damage which may be sustained by the reef communities
if the offshore option were recommended, will need to be discussed with the
community. It appears that technical and financial considerations will anvwav drive
the final decision with respect to these two options for the transmission mains pipeline.
O  The decision regarding the level of treatment to be provided by the proposed Montagne
Jacquot WWT plant was determined by the effluent water quality standards proposed
for ocean discharges and potential environmental impacts of effluent on benthic
communities. It was also supported by considerations of capital. operation and
maintenance costs. The level of treatment can be upgraded in the future if water

quality standards change, or other factors indicate that the quality of the effluent should
be improved.
The recommended combination of treatment processes for the Montagne Jacquot
treatment works is therefore preliminarv treatment with screening and grit
removal, primary  treatment and  disinfection.   The recommended  sludge
management system is dewatering with belt filter presses, stabilization with lime,
and disposal by hauling the sludge to the Mare Chicose landfill.  The
recommended effluent disposal method is to discharge the effluent to the sea
through an outfall 645 m long, at a depth of 30 m.
It is worth mentioning that no matter which level of waste water treatment is provided
at the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant, the project will acheive major environmental and
social benefits simply by transferring the point of discharge to a less sensitive site at a
break in the fringing reef. with better dispersion characteristics which is more distant
from human communities and their associated fishing and recreational activities.
Although there will be environmental impacts on the benthic communities in the new
discharge area. by implementing a comprehensive environmental monitoring program
(see section 9). and taking action to control components of the discharge if necessarv. it
will be possible to restrict impacts on marine communities to a limited area around the
point of discharge.

7.0.  MITIGATION PLAN
7.1.   Introduction
The main purpose of the mitigation plan is to provide a strategy for environmental
protection whereby all the activities associated with the Montagne Jacquot project
through design, construction and comnissioning of the plant. to operation are
controlled and monitored to ensure that time and national resources are not wasted
through lack of ongoing care, and that problems occurring during the project are
identified and rectified to prevent damage to the environment. The mitigation plan
addresses specific impacts identified in the EIA. If some issues have been overlooked.
the mitigation plan should be amended in consultation with the regulatory authorities to
ensure effective mitigation is implemented.
The mitigation plan therefore aims to ensure that:
I project activities are managed so as to reduce or avoid negative environmental and
social impacts and enhance positive impacts,
2. the currently affected communities are better off after the project is implemented.
3 precautions are taken against damage, and claims arising from damage are handled
in a timely manner,
4. information flow between the client. the consultants. contractors and affected parties
is optimised to ensure all role players are aware of their particular responsibilities.
5. the commissioning of the WWT plant is not delayed due to problems resulting from
addressing IAP or other concerns arising in the course of constructing the plant.
6. affected structures, roads and natural features are protected during construction then
rehabilitated according to the guidelines in the mitigation plan.
7. local labour and entrepreneurs from the affected communities are used throughout
the project and for project related activities wherever possible,
8. accurate records of the progress of the project are kept. including objections. so that
responsibilities can be allocated in the event of claims against the client.
9. monitoring reports are produced for regulatory bodies. their frequenc) and content to
be agreed in advance of work commencing on the construction phase.
1 Omechanisms are in place for reviewing the efficacy of the mitigation plan. and any
improvements made in the course of the project, so that other similar projects may
benefit from the experience gained on the Montagne Jacquot project.

Montagne Jatcquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project         Environmental Impact Assessment
7.3.   Main categories of mitigation measures identified in each project phase
7.3.1  Design phase
Many of the most significant environmental impacts of the project can be addressed in
the design phase. and are therefore mainly the responsibility of the design engineers. In
particular. the location and design of the ocean outfall potentially has a critically
significant mitigatory effect on the efficient dispersion of effluent.
The nature and level of treatment adopted will, together with outfall design. determine
whether the desired dilution/dispersion of effluent to ensure water quality standards off
Montagne Jacquot and in the vicinity of the nearby Pointe aux Sables reef and lagoon
are actually achieved. Despite having carried out hydrodynamic modeling. the
idiosyncrasies of currents at individual discharge points often cannot be predicted. and
so the efficacv of the design will only finally be tested when the results of follow up
water quality monitoring become available.
The proposed site of WWT plant at Montagne Jacquot also achieves important
mitigatory effects by virtue of its location. The site was chosen partly because it was
available, but also because the environmental and socio-economic impacts would be
minimal as a result of its location. The plant itself will not be noisy and is not expected
to create offensive odors. Nevertheless. it is prudent to include a buffer zone around the
perimeter of the WWT plant site to assist in minimising these potential impacts still
further. Disturbance caused by traffic along routes to the plant as a result of deliveries
of personnel. supplies for maintenance. removal of sludge to landfill etc. should also
cause minimal disruption to nearby communities. The nearest population to the site
that will be affected by these impacts is those individuals living at the prison. If trees
are planted in the 400m buffer zone around the works, the potential visual impact of the
site. and odors carried inland by sporadic onshore breezes will also be further
diminished.
7.3.2  Construction phase
The main responsibilities for mitigation during the construction phase of the Montagne
Jacquot project rest with the Contractors appointed to construct the WWT plant. outfall
and transfer pipeline. The Resident Engineer will however, have responsibility for
monitoring the implementation of mitigatory actions by contractors. and will need to
implement his own system of internal checks to ensure that mitigatory actions are

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project          Environmental Impact Assessment
carried out satisfactorily. In exceptional circumstances. the Waste Water Authority may
need to use its authority to call a halt to construction activityv if the contractors refuse to
adhere to the requirements of the mitigation plan contained in the contract documents.
In order that there can be no misunderstandings regarding who is responsible for
particular mitigatory activities recommended for the construction phase. the mitigation
plan should be appended to tender documents. This will ensure that contractors include
the cost of mitigatory actions into their bids, and will provide a reliable mechanism for
enforcement. In fact, most of the recommended actions involve no capital cost, but
depend on the contractor managers adopting a responsible attitude to environmental
protection, ensuring construction activity is properly planned. then using their
managerial skills to ensure mitigatorv actions are correctly implemented.
The mitigatory actions recommended during the construction phase have the following
principal objectives:
1. to maximise safety. security and environmental protection measures according to
the requirements of local industry standards,
2. to minimise disturbance to residents caused by noise. dust, polluted runoff. and
sediment etc, and to minimise inconvenience / congestion caused by restricted
traffic lanes and single file traffic along routes between Fort Victoria and Montagne
Jacquot during trench digging and laying of transmission pipeline if land-based
route adopted,
3. to minimise disturbance to marine ! estuarine benthic and fish communities. and
minimise deterioration in water quality during pipeline laying operation if offshore
based route adopted.
4. to minimise disturbance of benthic infaunal, coral reef and fish communities off
Montagne Jacquot and to avoid collisions and inconvenience to offshore vessels
during construction of the ocean outfall,
5. to minimise disturbance through increased heavy traffic. noise. dust. activity at the
Montagne Jacquot site and along access roads during site preparation and plant
construction.
The detailed mitigatory actions to achieve these objectives are summarised in
Tables I to 7. but with regard to the construction of the land-based transfer pipeline.
which is potentially the most disruptive component of the projects they particularly
concern:

0  liaison with affected communities to allow them to plan for the construction phase

During construction of the WWT plant at Montagne Jacquot. the mitigatorn actions
mainlv involve efficient planning and management of contractors on site to minimise
the potential disruption caused by heavy machinery. noise etc. at the site and along
access roads to the site. to prevent unauthorised dumping of waste materials around the
WWT plant site or along access roads. to manage traffic efficientlv to minimise
congestion and to deal with complaints from communities affected by construction
activity.
Similarly. during construction of the ocean outfall, efficient planning and management
of the operation is essential. Contractors should endeavour to cause minimal
disturbance to the sea floor: for example. by deploying silt curtains where disturbance
of sediments is anticipated. locating and placing anchors to avoid damage to the reef
and massive corals, containing waste fuel oil and retaining garbage on board until it can
be properly disposed of on shore. In addition. the construction vessels should be marked
with lights to ensure there is no risk of collision with vessels using the coastal waters.
The detailed requirements for safety. security and environmental protection to meet
industry standards in Mauritius, are summarised in Appendix P together with the
guidelines for mitigatory action for contractors commissioned to construct the
transmission mains pipeline.
7.3.3   Operationalphase
Once the pipe laying operations are complete the general public should be blissfully
unaware of the new infrastructure linked to the new WWT plant at the Montagne
Jacquot site. Therefore mitigatory activity will primarily be the responsibility of the
Plant Manager (PM) and it will mainly be a matter of exercising good and proper
management of the WWT plant. Most of this activity should be covered by the
management manuals devised for operation of the WWT plant. which will outline
procedures for managing or otherwise responding to:

5. safetv measures. including fire protection equipment, procedures for access to
confined spaces, limiting hazardous and toxic gas exposure, training in proper and
safe operation of all equipmenL training to avoid exposure to hazardous situations
such as high voltage electrical gear. safe driving training. and general safety
procedures to avoid personal injury such as muscle strains or damage to eves. ears.

6. dealing with noxious conditions such as odors from inlet structure and related
equipment. sludge management facilities, or septic tank dumping station:
7. handling dangerous or corrosive chemicals such as chlorine gas and quick lime:
8. handling other special chemicals such as polymers:
9. cleaning sludge trucks to avoid accumulation of offensive deposits:
10. maintaining plant grounds in a suitable manner:
11. maintaining secure plant site to prevent injury to public or damage to plant
facilities:
12. handling operational problems such as spills. or overflows of chemicals. sludge.
pump stations. etc.
In addition. it will be essential for the PM to be appropriately motivated and trained to
manage the plant and its operators to achieve a high quality performing plant. This will
entail keeping equipment working properly by regular maintenance and repair. regular
monitoring of effluent quality. monitoring of influent for general water quality
parameters as well as hazardous wastes and special industrial waste water arriving at the
plant. The PM will also need to take responsibility for liaison with the general public.
and deal with complaints to community satisfaction by provision of monitoring or other
information.
7.3.4 Decommissioning phase
The life of the plant is likely to be at least 50 years. providing regular maintenance and
repairs are carried out. Whether the proposed waste water treatment and solids handling
facilities at the plant will be supplemented by more advanced treatment works in a
shorter time frame cannot be accurately predicted, but there is no reason to suppose the

planned transmission pipelines and pumping stations delivering waste water to the
Montagne Jacquot site. or any of the proposed  treatment works will need  be
decommissioned because of equipment failure in the foreseeable future. In the event
that the Montagne Jacquot site is required for an alternative use in future. it is a
relativelv straightforward process to dismantle the plant. demolish concrete structures.
backfill excavations and remove and dispose of mechanical and control equipment.
There should be no accumulation of hazardous or toxic materials at the site which
would require extensive remediation measures if the site is abandoned. The sludges
will be removed to a landfill site during the normal course of operation.

7.5.   Cost of the mitigation plan
The direct costs of implementing the mitigation plan will be very modest. as nearly all
the recommendations depend on good and proper management of construction
activities, then on high standards of operation at the plant itself. Consequently these
costs are already included in the cost of the project. However. the following are
suggestions for activities which could help to minimise environmental impacts and
enhance beneficial impacts of the project. which do have cost implications:
0  appoint a multi-disciplinarv task team (MEQOL. MEPD etc.) to assist communities in
Pointe aux Sables and Bain des Dames to rehabilitate the area. by improving (eneral
environmental quality. upgrading infrastructure etc. to assist the communities in
realising  the economic and recreational potential associated  with  improved
environmental quality. through development of tourism. accommodation. services etc..
to cater for the nearby port area and commercial centre.
0  the site at Montagne Jacquot will be surrounded by a 400m buffer zone. The whole
site could benefit from a tree planting scheme in the buffer zone to screen the plant
completely. This would not only minimise the visual impacts, but also provide a buffer
against odors penetrating inland when sea breezes are onshore. The plant perimeter
should be situated so that the public continues to have access to the shoreline. so that
even if divers and swimmers become less numerous than at present. walking and
fishing from the shore need not be prohibited.
0  Construction of this new WWT plant and its ocean outfall provides an extremely
valuable opportunity for monitoring the impact of a discharge from a new ocean outfall
into an area not previously impacted by waste water effluent.  Local research
institutions should be encouraged to develop a monitoring program. which expands on
the statutory requirements of monitoring water quality.  Also, provision for
environmental monitoring should be incorporated into the operational budget of the
WWhT plant, since this could provide invaluable information for managing the new
plant efficiently and the design of future WWT plants and outfalls. No such
information is available at present from Mauritian waters. and only scant information
is available from other sub-tropical I tropical ecosystems.

Montagne Jacquo: Sewerage and Sanitation Project      Environmental Impact Assessment
8.0   ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING
8.1   Legal and Policy background
One of the key recommendations of the National Sewerage Master Plan for Mauritius
was that a Waste Water Authorit) should be set up. Subsequently. the WWA Act was
passed by the National Assembly in June 1991 and promulgated in late 1996. The
development of a comprehensive waste water management policy is still underwav
however, and until this task is complete and new legislation has been promulgated.
there is lack of tools to enable the WWA to provide incentives and put pressure on
industrv to manage its waste more safely. economically and efficiently.  The
preliminarv report of the institutional study for the Waste Water Authoritv carried out
bv Consulting Engineering Services (India) PVT LTD (CES; 1997). suggested that
comprehensive new legislation is required to respond to the multiplicity of factors
involved in controlling industrial pollution, and that this would be more effective than
making amendments to the existing legislation.
In the mean time, the Environmental Protection Act (1991) has given the WWA the
responsibility for control and monitoring of wastewater discharges to ensure that the
water environment is not polluted. for ensuring that industry undertakes to treat its
wastes-before discharge and ensuring that effluent quality from industrial and WWT
facilities is regularly checked. The Montagne Jacquot project is one of several priority
projects recommended in the master plan currently being managed by the WWA. and
the environmtental management and monitoring by the WWA will be central to ensuring
successful implementation of the project. Experience gained in the Montagne Jacquot
project will also be valuable for other projects planned over the next twenty year period.
8.2.  Institutional Framework for Waste Water Management
Following the initial review of the preliminary report of the institutional study (CES.
1997) the WWA concluded that the proposed reorganization of the WWA should be
modified to include a substantial involvement of private contractors. The WWA would
then gradually be transformed into an organization which would rely on private firms
who would assume responsibility for construction, operation and maintenance of all
new works, as well as increasing responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the
existing sewerage system. To implement the first stages of this shift to contract
operations the WWA will issue contracts for at least three years of operation and
maintenance by a private contractor following completion of construction of major
BlacA & Veatch International          8.1         Environmental management and training



Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Saniiation Project        Environmental Impact Assessment
waste water treatment facilities and pump stations. including the Montagne Jacquot
WWT plant. and the Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables pumping stations.
8.2.1  Waste WaterA uthority Organization
In order to respond effectively to the new order. the WWA will need to modify its
organizational structure. The institutional study (CES, 1997) suggested that the WWA
should be separated into three principal units, reflecting the basic concepts contained in
the preliminary report, but also reflecting the shift toward more involvement by private
contractors and private consultants for operation and maintenance functions. The new
organization will enable it to effectively manage the contractors responsible for the
major capital improvements program and new responsibilities related to operation and
maintenance of the new facilities.
The proposed new Project Management Unit -- or an equivalent unit. as established by
the final institutional analysis report -- will have the primary responsibility for qualitv
control in the WWA. which will include monitoring of treatment plant effluent.
collection and analyses of samples. monitoring discharges of industries entering sewers.
and performance evaluations of treatment plants. An organization chart for the Quality
Control Wing of the PMU is shown in Appendix 0. Although some of the staff
proposed in Appendix 0 will be provided through consultants or through private
contractors. the responsibilities assigned to the wing will be carried out by a staff of
approximately 15, with qualifications in engineering, biochemistry. and laboratory
services. A summary of the qualifications that will be required for the key personnel in
this wing is presented in Annex 3.3.2(B) in Appendix 0.
Based on a review of the scope of its responsibilities and the activities of the Pollution
Control Unit in 1996. the institutional study (CES. 1997) concluded that this unit needs
to be expanded as a matter of urgency. The inauguration of the new National
Laboratories Complex in Reduit on June 18. 1997 provides strong evidence that the
monitoring of the environment and natural resources will be given significantly higher
priority in the coming years.
It was also concluded by the institutional study that the operation and maintenance of
the new treatment works and pump stations should be performed by private contractors.
and this transition to facilities management by the private sector has been recognized as
a goal of the WWA. Privatisation will provide the skilled personnel and expertise
necessary for proper function of these facilities. It will also provide separation between
Black A Veatch International            8.2         Environmental management and training



Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project        Environmental Impact Assessment
the operation and maintenance function of the WWA and the monitoring of compliance
functions of the WWA. which will allow the new qualitv control wing to exercise
greater control over and enforcement of effluent standards.
8.2.2  Linkages Withi Otlher Organizations
One of the institutional considerations reviewed by the CES study (1997) was the
relationship between the WWA and other parastatal and government departments.
Appendix 0 shows the linkages between the WWA and other organizations. and the
institutional report describes the responsibilities of the various agencies. the
requirements for legal understandings on the division of responsibility. and how they
will have to interact at the operational level.
8.3   Industrial Wastewater Management
The management of industrial waste waters is a complex problem which involves
competing interests associated with technical problems. legal issues. institutional
responsibilities and  public interests.   Comprehensive  industrial waste water
management must involve several government ministries, quasi-government agencies
which promote and manage the industrial estates, the industries themselves. the public.
the economy of Mauritius and the environment. It will require changes in many
institutional arrangements. which will only evolve over several years.
A detailed review of the industrial waste water generated in the Montagne Jacquot
service area is presented in Appendix Q.  The appendix includes a review of
recommended effluent standards, which will be implemented into regulations by the
Ministry of Environment and the Waste Water Authority. Pre-treatment systems will
be required at many industries to meet the new effluent standards. The expected pre-
treatment facilities for the major industrial waste dischargers and their estimated
construction cost are also presented in Appendix Q. As the primary agency responsible
for the sewage collection system and the quality of the effluent from the Montagne
Jacquot WWT plant, the WWA will develop a program for monitoring the effluents
from industries. The monitoring program is described in Section 9 of this EIA report.
8.4   Environmental Training Requirements
Once effective legislation has been passed. the training requirements for implementing
the pollution control and monitoring programs. and to allow the WWA to discharge its
Black & Veatch International            8.3         Environmental management and training



o1ontagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project      Environmental Impacr Assessment
duties effectively. are considerable. The institutional study will be responsible for
defining in detail exactly what the training and staff requirements will be for
monitoring. laboratorv and engineering support. but as there are strono moves afoot to
privatise many operations including management of wastewater treatment facilities. the
requirements will change depending on the pace of the privatisation program and
depending on which operations are targeted first.
There are awareness building requirements and training needs at every institutional
level in government and throughout industry. The situation in Mauritius is similar to
the situation which was common throughout Europe and the United States several vears
aggo. and which is still evident in some non-transformed industries. In order to build a
sustainable economy. and to protect Mauritius' natural resource base. environmental
protection has to be taken seriously. Increased pressure for regulation and effective
enforcement of waste water legislation and pollution control in general will then come
from within the country. as well as from consumer markets outside the countrv.
As in other countries throughout the world, Mauritius has been involved in a mass
environmental education programmne which should heip to improve public awareness of
the problems. Several NGO's have played a central role in these programmes. but the
WWA could do much to assist the process. There have also recently been short courses
in environmental and coastal zone management at the University of Mauritius. which
were attended by a wide spectrum of interested individuals from government. NGOs.
business and industry: This all helps the general understanding of the issues. and why
environmental protection needs to be a priority in national planning and economic
development initiatives.
The specific training needs which will be required to ensure successful implementation.
management and monitoring of the individual water and sanitation projects. will only
be identified when the final provisions of the WWA Act are known. However. the
present situation suggests the following individuals will be required as a minimum for
management and operation of the new WWT facility at Montagne Jacquot and
implementation of the WWA monitoring functions:
O well educated individuals with good basic skills will need to be recruited as managers
for the WWT plants. who can be trained through both course work and intensive on the
job training. The prospective plant managers will need to be conscientious individuals.
committed to high standards of management and operational performance at the plants.

M1onmtagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project      Environmental ImpactlAssessment
In addition, plant operators with similar personal attributes of being conscientious and
committed. but with technical rather than managerial abilities will also be required.
O The programs at the National Laboratories Complex will require individuals with a
scientific background to university level. who are trained to oversee the pollution
control monitoring programme. Depending on the final provisions of the neA WWA
Act. basic programmes will have to be devised for screening of industrial discharges
and water quality monitoring in freshwater and coastal waters. The staff should also be
sufficiently experienced to be able to liaise with independent scientists regarding
specialist monitoring required in relation to particularly toxic wastes or discharges with
multiple inputs.
0 additional laboratory staff with suitable qualifications in chemistrv will need to be
trained for the Quality Control division of the WWA. to analyse samples of industrial
or wastewater effluent
Other specialists who may potentially be in demand once the WWA policies begin to
take effect are those who would seek ways to optimize the management of industrial
wastes through reuse programs, internal recycle. partnering with other industries with
similar or complementary waste problems. or finding economic or alternative
applications for waste disposal.  The incentives of the economy and economic
competition will ensure optimal solutions are devised for waste management programns.
In aeneral. it has been demonstrated in many situations that effective pollution control
makes good economic sense.
8.5.   Costs and financing training -for environmental management
The costs of environmental training related to the Montagne Jacquot project should not
be considered in isolation. since many of the capacity building requirements concern
the WWA as a whole and are not project specific. The CES study will be addressing the
precise capacity needs of the WWA. as well as training and resource requirements.
Nevertheless. it is pertinent to draw attention to the fact that although suitable
graduates with tertiary level education in appropriate disciplines will almost certainly
be available in Mauritius to fill technical positions at the National Laboratories
complex, and to carry out routine monitoring functions. individuals with the skills and
experience suitable for coordinating, managing and implementing the national
wastewater management and monitoring program may not be available locally or at
least benefit from some experience outside the country. Consequently. provision
should be made for post-graduate work experience / study overseas within a waste

9.0   ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
The environmental monitoring responsibilities in the WWA will be performed by the
Quality Control Wing of the Project Management Unit. as described in Section 8. The
monitoring will be performed by the scientific unit of the wing which will employ a
staff of four laboratory technicians. two biochemists, and one senior biochemist. under
the direction of the manager of the wing who will also be the principal biochemist.
The Quality Control Wing will collect and analyze samples of industrial discharges to
sewers. of the effluents from waste water treatment plants, and within the waste water
treatment plants to evaluate their performance. The dav to day performance of the
waste water treatment plants and the testing associated with plant operations will be
performed by the plant operating staff.
9.1   Monitoring Program
Tlhe monitoring program of the Quality Control Wing will be divided into the industrial
sector and the domestic sector.
9.1.1  Industrial Waste Water Monitoring
There are approximatelv 175 industries in the service area of the Montagne Jacquot
WWT plant. All but, about 20 discharge to the sewage collection svstem. Industrial
waste water monitoring will be carried out at two levels. The first level will be the
routine screening level. and the second. the detailed evaluation level. A different
sampling and analysis program  will be developed for each individual industry.
depending on the typical characteristics of the waste water produced by that industry.
and the amount of waste water it produces. Those industries which produce only
domestic waste water, or which produce waste water which is equivalent to domestic
waste water in terms of specific contaminants and concentrations of those contaminants.
will not be monitored on a regular basis.
Routine screening will be perforrned on those industries which produce large quantities
of pollutants either in terms of high volume and high or low concentration or low
volume and high concentrations. but which do not discharge priority pollutants such as
those which are potentially toxic or hazardous. The specific parameters to be measured
will be determined by the effluent discharge standards established by the WWA and
Ministnr of Environment. as well as the type of contaminants expected to be contained

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project        Environmental Impact Assessment
in the waste water from an individual industry. and by the waste water characteristics
used to calculate sewage disposal tariffs. The specific parameters to be monitored by
the existing industries in the Montagne Jacquot service area are described in Appendix
Q.
Normal effluent monitoring will consist of a composite sample compiled over one
operating day from each industry twice each year. The industry will be requested to
provide records of water consumption (including all sources of water) which will be
used to estimate average daily flow. The water consumption and the waste water
characteristics will be used to determine the waste water disposal tariff. and to verify
that the industrv is meeting the effluent limits imposed by regulations.
Those industries which have the potential to discharge significant quantities of priority
pollutants will be subject to both the routine screening and detailed evaluations. The
detailed evaluations will be conducted once each year. The detailed evaluation will
consist of requirements for the industry to report on its operations. and will include
sampling and analysis of the effluent. The report on operations will include a tabulation
of average daily quantities and specific types of chemicals used in processes which
contribute to the waste water effluent. and records of water consumption (all sources).
The detailed evaluation sampling will consist of a composite sample compiled over one
operating day. The samples must be collected on a day which is representative of the
normnal facility operations. The samples will be tested for the same parameters as in the
routine screening, plus those pollutants either known to be associated with that
industrial activity or those chemicals used in the processes.
9.1.2  Domestic Waste Water Monitoring
The domestic waste water monitoring will be conducted at the influent to and effluent
from the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant. Weekly samples will be collected for the
plant influent and effluent. The samples will be flow proportioned. composite samples.
assembled by the WWT plant staff on a routine basis. The weeklv samples will be
analyzed for the routine pollutants included in the effluent water quality standards for
an ocean discharge: i.e. pH. COD. BOD(S), TSS. In addition. once each year a
composite sample will be collected at the influent and the effluent and analyzed for the
special parameters contained in the water quality standards for ocean discharge:
cadmium. chromate. mercury. and nickel. In addition. a weekly grab sample will be
collected at the influent to the chlorine contact basin. and this as well as the plant

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Saititation Project     Environmental Impact Assessment
influent and effluent weekly samples will be tested for total coliform. A grab sample of
plant effluent will also be tested for residual chlorine concentration once each week.
9.1.3  Monitoring of Marine Environment at Montagne Jacquot
Monitoring of the environmental impact of the effluent from the Montagne Jacquot
WWT plant will not be carried out by the WWA on a regular basis. The WWA will
have neither the equipment nor the qualified personnel required for collecting samples
in the ocean near the outfall, or for conducting surveys of the areas on the sea floor at
that location.
The Albion Fisheries Research Centre (AFRC) of the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine
Resources have expressed an interest and willingness to be involved in an
environmental monitoring programme for the new WWT plant. and the DOE have
indicated that data generated in the AFRC monitoring programme will be used for
correlation purposes in enforcing water quality standards. Extensive water quality and
coral community monitoring is already underway in Mauritian coastal waters and
adding sites in the discharge area off Montagne Jacquot would simply represent an
extension of this programme. The commissioning of a new ocean outfall discharging
treated effluent should yield invaluable data to allow the prediction of impacts from
similar discharges into coastal waters elsewhere in Mauritius. Information on the
quality of effluent discharged from the WWT plant. would then also provide important
background data against which environmental monitoring results could be interpreted.
9.1.3.1 Water qualit
The coastal waters monitoring programme should commence before construction work
begins in the proposed outfall location. to provide background information on ambient
conditions in the discharge area and monitoring should continue through the
commissioning period of the new ocean outfall. The precise content and frequency of
sampling for the monitoring programme will depend to some extent on the resources
and staff available at the AFRC, but should finally be agreed between the AFRC and
the regulatory body. Bearing in mind the likely characteristics of the discharged
effluent. the following key water quality parameters should initially be monitored as a
minimum: pH. temperature. TSS. conductivity, nutrients (N. P) and faecal coliforms.
Ideally, water quality surveys taking in these parameters should be carried out using
automated equipment as far as possible.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project          Environmental Impact Assessment
Once the new WWT plant has been commissioned. it will be necessary at first to carry
out monitoring surveys regularly along the axis of the effluent plume. at different
conditions of tide, current and season. to evaluate the effect the discharge has on local
water quality. After the main area impacted by the discharge has been delimited in
terms of the above parameters, it will be possible to refine the water quality monitoring
programme. and carry out survevs four times per year (current frequency of AFRC
program at other sites). or following any major changes in treatment process. intluent
or effluent composition. Some of the analyses are time-consuming and will have to be
critically evaluated in terms of the information they yield. As the main concern at
present in terms of local ecosystems is the potential for elevated nutrient concentrations
in the discharge zone, it may be appropriate to reduce parameters measured to pH and
conductivity, which are very easily determined, and nutrients (nitrogen and
phosphorus). which together with BOD determinations would provide the most
important information.
Monitoring will provide checks on the water quality in the discharge area and adjacent
coastal waters, particularly in respect of nutrient levels, which are the principal concern
in the long term. However. until the coastal water quality standards have been finalised
by the DOE, the precise requirements of the water quality monitoring programme
cannot be finalised, but should be agreed with the DOE on an interim basis until
legislation is promulgated.
9.1.3.2 Healtl of bentlhic communities
The diving survey carried out at the proposed outfall location showed that the area
likely to be impacted by the discharge at the break in the fringing reef is characterised
bv mixed character substratum. with areas of flat reef, often with encrusting coral
species. giving way to patches of sand, with scattered massive and sub-massive corals.
The corals in the proposed discharge area were live and appeared to be in good
condition. although as the proposed discharge site is very exposed. corals appear to
have been subject to storm damage.
The mixed character of the sea floor suggests that an approach which evaluates not only
the health of corals. but also the benthic infauna is appropriate. As the corals do not
form a continuous reef flat, it may be appropriate to map individual massive corals in
the discharge area, and regularly monitor the degree of bleaching and dead/moribund.
infection with bacterial disease etc. Alternatively, an approach such as that already
described in section 4 (see English et al. ) using permanent quadrats along a fixed

transect parallel to the axis of the effluent plume (should change direction with season)
would also be appropriate. since it also builds on that already being carried out by the
AFRC at other sites around Mauritius.
One problem with carrying out this type of survey in an area impacted by waste water is
the potential health impacts for the divers carrying out direct observations on corals.
Although there is obviously the possibility of doing this work remotely. the costs
involved are usually prohibitive. Consequently, as an alternative (or in addition) to the
above. soft sediments could be sarnpled for meiofaunal analysis. The dominant
meiofaunal populations in soft marine sediments are nematodes. which as a taxon, are
good indicators of sewage and industrial waste contamination. with some species
flourishing and others being eliminated. Because of the rapid turnover of meiofaunal
populations, and the community structures which evolve in response to particular
wastes discharge. the extent of the impact of a discharge area can be much more
precisely defined with meiofaunal analysis than with larger benthic infaunal organisms.
The skills necessary for carrying out this type of analysis are probably not vet available
in Mauritius, but increasingly, meiofaunal analysis is being used as an indicator of
marine ecosystem health, which is generally expressed in the changing diversitv.
species composition and density of meiofaunal organisms.
9.1.3.3. Use of monitoring data in environmental management
The main objectives of carrying out water quality and benthic community monitoring in
the discharge zone offshore from Montagne Jacquot, is to provide assurance that the
recommended treatment process at the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant achieves the
required levels of concentration of TSS, faecal coliforms, nutrients etc. to meet water
qualitv standards in the receiving waters. The main unknown is that hvdrodvnamic
modeling is invariably carried out using limited data sets (see sections 2 and 4). and the
theoretical dilution / dispersion characteristics of effluents need to be verified once the
local conditions of tide. currents and wave action are interacting on a daily basis.
The results of water quality monitoring will need to be scrutinised on a regular basis.
and if as predicted the impacts of the discharge are negligible on the receiving waters.
the water quality monitoring can be reduced to screening checks. On the other hand.
there may be instances which lead to water quality in the discharge zone not meeting
the required standard. in which case the nature of the problem will need to be diagnosed
and action taken to remedy the situation. There may have been operational problems at

the plant of a temporarv nature leading to discharge of effluent below standard. there
may have been a new industrial discharge to the WWT plant with unanticipated
impacts. These tvpes of problem can then be addressed by the WWA and tackled at
source to prevent any further deterioration in water quality.
Monitoring water quality alone is not alwavs sufficient to guarantee the health of
marine benthic communities in a discharge zone - occasionally parameters which either
cannot be measured for technical reasons, or parameters not known to affect the health
of local species  are identified. Consequently. checking the health of benthic
communities in the context of the  monitoring program  will provide additional
assurance that the discharge is only having a limited effect on benthic communities. and
one is acceptable given the predicted performance of the treatment plant. quality of final
effluent and the predicted impact of the discharge.
9.2   Liaison Between Montagne Jacquot WWT Plant and Regulatorv Agencies
For at least the first three years the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant will be operated by a
qualified firm under contract to the WWA. The firm will have full responsibility for
operating the plant in accordance with all regulations. and will be required to monitor
treatment processes as part of its norrnal duties. It will operate as an independent
contractor. in the same way that an industry operates its waste water facilities. and the
contract operator will be subject to the rules of all regulatory agencies.
9.3   Costs of equipment, personnel and training
The industrial and domestic wastewater monitoring programs linked to the Montagne
Jacquot project will be carried out by the Quality Control Wing of the Project
Management Unit. The staffing requirements of the unit have alreadv been considered.
and the equipment and capital cost involved in setting up this unit will be covered
further by the institutional study. Clearly a substantial amount of the monitoring
workload of the unit will be linked to industries in the service area of the Montagne
Jacquot project.
The costs and equipment required to carry out water quality and benthic community
monitoring will be modest providing the program can be developed as an extension of
that already in place and implemented by the Albion Fisheries Research Centre using
equipment possessed by the Centre. There will be the additional costs of materials. fuel
and time involved in monitoring the Montagne Jacquot discharge area. but until the

requirements of the program have been discussed with the AFRC and the DOE. and the
restrictions the AFRC mav need to impose with respect to time. staff and analytical
capacity. it is not particularly helpful to discuss cost in detail.

APPENDIX E: Sludge Management Methods
The amount or degree of stabilization of the organic matter required for disposal is one of the primary variables
which determines the sludge processes to be used. The second variable is the amount of dewatering provided to
reduce the volume of the sludge.
The most frequently used stabilization processes are lime addition, aerobic digestion and anaerobic digestion.
Ocean disposal is also an option for sludge produced on Mauritius. The most frequentlv used dewatering
processes are sand drying beds, centrifuges, and belt filter presses. Composting is also used for further
stabilization and dewatering of digested sludge.
Anaerobic Stabilization
The anaerobic stabilization process was described in the both the Gibb sewerage master plan and the SETEGUE
report. Anaerobic digestion is an efficient means of stabilizing sludge and results in a product which can be
disposed of without causing nuisance conditions. However, it requires a high capital cost for the process units and
equipment, and can be difficult to operate effectively. It has a relatively low operating cost, associated with
mixing the contents of the digesters.
Aerobic Stabilization
Aerobic digestion of sludge is essentially an extension of the activated sludge or extended aeration process. The
TSS concentration in the aerobic digester is maintained at a higher level than in the activated sludge process
basins, and the detention time is longer. It is well suited to stabilization of waste activated sludge, but not for
primary sludge because of the high oxygen demand of the raw sludge and potential for initial release of odors.
Aerobic stabilization process units have lower capital cost than equivalent anaerobic process units, but their
operating costs are significantly higher due to the power requirements of the aeration system.
Lime Stabilization
Lime stabilization of sludge can be used to control odors, prevent contamination by pathogenic organisms, and
reduce the attraction of vectors. It is not a biological stabilization process. Lime stabilization consists of adding
sufficient lime to the sludge to raise the pH to above 11.4 for a period of at least 30 minutes. The lime kills
bacteria and prevents the production of odors. This process has low initial cost, but requires continuing use of
lime which results in relatively high operating costs. The addition of lime to the sludge increases the mass of
sludge that must be delivered to the disposal site. Primary sludge requires between 100 and 150 g of hydrated
lime per kilogram of solids. Secondary sludge from biological processes is more difficult to stabilize using lime,
and requires between 300 and 500 g/kg. Black & Veatch International concluded that the most appropriate sludge
stabilization process for the Montagne Jacquots works would be to use lime stabilization. This was based
primarily on the simplicity of the process and its low capital cost The mechanical equipment requires no
sophisticated monitoring and control instrumentation. The process can be easily adjusted to changing conditions
of sludge quality and quantity. It can be started and stopped to match the operation of the sludge dewatering
equipment. The chemical handling can be done manually or with automated equipment. The proper chemical
dosage can be determined using testing procedures that are within the capability of most treatment plant operators.
Since capital costs are relatively low, changing to alternative or more comprehensive sludge stabilization
processes in the future will not require abandonment of large investments.

Montagne Jacquot Sewage and Sanitation Project                    Environmental Impact Assessment
Sludge Composting
Sludge composting is a method of stabilizing sludge which relies on low temperature oxidation in open piles. The
process relies on a proper mixture of the sludge with a dry, organic material such as wood chips to achieve a
correct moisture and porosity and a forced draft of air to provide oxygen for oxidation and air for drying. It has
been found to be effective and low in cost, but odor control is often a serious problem. It also requires an
informed operator to adjust air rates, monitor temperature and moisture, and mix the piles at proper intervals. The
composted product can be suitable for sale as garden soil amendment or simply spread on open land for disposal.
The primary problem experienced with sludge composting operations is that they routinely produce significant
foul odors which can be distracting to plant staff and offensive to neighbors.
Sludge Dewatering
Sludge is a mixture of organic matter and water. The percent moisture in raw sludge varies from more than 99
percent for dilute secondary sludge, to 96 percent for well settled primary sludge. At this moisture content, the
sludge behaves just like water. For disposal, it must be thickened or dewatered in order to reduce the total volume
that must be transported, and to prevent problems caused by excess water such as runoff from landfills. Sludge
can be dewatered by gravity draining on sand beds or air drying. The most common mechanical dewatering
processes are centrifuges and belt presses. All of these dewatering alternatives were reviewed by the Gibb
sewerage master plan and the SETEGUE preliminary design report.
The most appropriate dewatering process for the Montagne Jacquots works is to use belt filter presses. Although
the capital cost is relatively high, they are generally robust units, and when properly operated produce a sludge
cake suitable for hauling in open trucks and for disposal in sanitary landfills. They do require trained operators to
monitor and adjust the machine and chemical requirements to suit the changing characteristics of the raw sludge,
and to maintain the various components of the machinery.

APPENDIX H: Consultations with lAPs and minutes of public meetings
CONSULTATIONS WITH   PS
1.0. Medine Sugar Estate: Mr. D'Arifat
0 noted extent of property - to the west coast as far as crown lands, in the south to the Grande Riviere Noire and
in the north, patches of cultivation up to area of project,
0  is wastewater effluent suitable for irrigation ? - they currently use raw sewage in open channel irrigation
system with no apparent adverse consequences so no objections in principle, main problem is distance from
Montagne Jacquot treatment works which would normally be prohibitive; estate were interested in treated
effluent from St Martin works which is much closer,
0  health implications of using treated effluent discussed - can be managed in a commercial operation more
easily than for eg. small scale vegetable growing, by introduction of apprdpriate management practices eg.
cessation of irrigation one month before harvesting, using rubber boots to reduce exposure,
0 irrigation channels used for washing and cleaning by a few individuals in local communities even in locations
where sewage is in evidence- implications of introducing wastewater effluent need to be investigated if it is to
be introduced in areas where exposure is not already occurring,
0 planters in north of area use gravity fed open channels to irrigate crops - need to discuss with them the
implications.
0 Medine have recently commissioned a study by STAME (a subsidiary of Unite des Eaux) to investigate their
solid wastes disposal options - could be extended to include liquid wastes / water utilisation options,
including use of treated effluent.
0 Aesthetic considerations and potential practical problems of using wastewater effluent suggest on-site
screening would be advisable, tho none of Medine irrigation is by drip-fed systems (would be more
problematic in terms of blocked nozzles etc).
0 Because of emotive aspects of co-discharging dyes from industrial plants with sewage from municipal
sources in sensitive coastal areas, some thought regarding pre-treatment of industrial wastes would be
necessary; but if it was to be subsequently used for irrigation there would not really be a problem.
0 discussed 'polluter pays principle' in context of Medine as recipient of treated effluents. Irrigation with
municipal-wastes could potentially reduce capital treatment requirement at STW which would benefit the
public. Also why should irrigators pay for treatment of the public's wastewater - especially if treatment not
required for irrigation use ?
0 in general, any arrangement which improves the current situation must be good, but who will pay for water
treated to a higher standard ?
2.0. Albion Research Station : Dr. V. Chineah, M. Nallee, Mme. R. Pillay, M. Chooramum.
Discussed diverse research activities carried out by research station, but none of these specific enough to cover the
area of the project in anything but general terms. The particular disciplines covered by individuals at the centre  L
include:
0 water quality studies and pollution monitoring at selected sites around Mauritius, especially at sites regarded
as sensitive for tourism and protection of existing resources,
0 ecosystems studies (quantitative and qualitative), focussed on representative ecosystems around Mauritius
and especially on coral reef systems; in the process of introducing rec-diver surveys to augment data base,

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                    Environmental Impact Assessment
0  hydro-dynamic studies - measurements of currents and tidal flows to characterise more precisely the hydro-
dynamic characteristics of Mauritian coastal waters,
O fisheries evaluation in collaboration with the ministry personnel, collecting data at fish landings around the
island eg.r Bain des Dames.
(NB. Geophysical studies may have been carried out at the university - Dr. Jutang ?)
O contact Port Authority regarding up-to-date charts, and bathymetric surveys / bottom profiles which may
have been carried out of immediate coastal zone - but no known new reef areas identified in recent past
which do not appear on charts,
0 no formal assessments of coastal fisheries had been carried out in the potential discharge area (but see catch
statistics for west coast fishing communities),
0 there are no assessments of the juvenile fish populations or nurseries in the estuarine areas to the north of the
project area, but these areas are assumed to be important for the species which can tolerate the pollution
concentrations present,
O there are no Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) or artificial reefs in the immediate project area - to their
knowledge these occur further south,
0 there is no formal industry exploiting shellfish in the vicinity of the project area, although clams and oysters
are collected recreationally along parts of the coast,
0 the reef offshore in the project area is heavily eutrophicated as a result of sewage discharges from the existing
ocean outfalls which discharge untreated sewage, and although no recent assessment of the health of the reef
has been conducted, they suspect it is in poor condition,
O they would be concerned about the construction of a pipeline through the lagoon - would it cause even more
damage ? (ie. offshore of Pointe des Sables parallel to the coast) but recommended consulting with the
fishermen at Pointe des Sables who would be more affected than anyone (contact: Mr. Dennis Jackson),
O they know of no notably significant or valuable marine resources in the vicinity of the proposed outfall site
which might be impacted by the development
3.0. Marine Conservation Society: M. Phillippe Lahausse (Tel: 686 3094)
0   Discussed general importance of expansion of diving tourism to Mauritian economy especially in rural
locations,
0  main sites on the west coast are Flic-en-Flac, where there are at least 5 diving centres of a total of 30 on the
island,
0 complaints regarding St. Martin sewage works have been sporadic, but sufficient to indicate there is a serious
problem with the functioning of the works,
O   Pointe aux Sables fishing community exploit the reefs at Fli-en-Flac, offshore FADs and set traps on the reef,
but are always complaining about sewage pollution from the port and Pointe-aux-Sables outfall,
0 concerns regarding impact of sinking the pipeline along the lagoon inshore of the fringing reef, mainly
because of the potential for current-driven sediment to smother such coral communities as still survive along
the reef rim,
O will confirm whether sensitive dive sites exist between Pointe aux Caves and Pointe aux Sables, and offerred
to conduct or participate in dives to ascertain whether there are sensitive coral communities or habitats of
particular value in the vicinity of the proposed outfall, and especially along the fringing reef which may be
vulnerable during the construction phase of the project..
O   diving sites at caves are probably the closest notable conservation-worthy resources,
Black A Veatch International                    xxii                                      Appendices



Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmental Impact Assessment
O  in general indicated that anything which improves the present situation has to be welcomed, but signalled
desirability of involving affected parties more extensively at an early stage to avoid adverse public perception
of the project and dissemination of misinformation.
4.0. Development Bank of Mauritius Ltd.: Mr. Aubeeluck
0  Situation at La Tour Koenig industrial site discussed - road infrastructure in dire need of upgrading, and
allocation of sites almost complete with rapid development of new industries occurring - some of which will
be heavy water users with net total water utilisation of up to 800,000 gallons/day,
0  CWA getting a loan from Development Bank for provision of water supply,
O  SIGMA study of Coramandel industrial estates should be able to provide information on quality/quantity of
effluents from individual industries,
0  all industrial plants on site recommended to integrate sedimentation tanks and rudimentary treatment into
their systems prior to discharge into the common sewer, but the few of them that apparently have adopted this
advice, do not properly maintain their systems so they are ineffective,
O  current overflow problems on site suggest that some sections of piping need to be increased in diameter
and/or replaced - the situation being addressed as a matter of urgency,
0  water is an increasing problem - water supply will be developed for the estate using a Development Bank
loan exclusively for industrial users,
0  the concept of a joint pre-treatrnent works for the industrial estate has not seriously been considered because
of the lack of a site and costs involved, which are perceived to be prohibitive.
5.0. Friends of the Environment: Dr. Monique Koenig
0  they have received many complaints about the sewage discharges around the port and off Pointe-aux-Sables,
and reports of algal blooms,
9  normally the MMCS deal with issues at sea, and FoE with issues on land, but FoE like to be informed,
O suggested that newspaper articles (try Thierry Chateau joumnalist with special interest in tthe environment at
'Le Mauricien')and public meeting in area of affected community would be a good idea (try District
Councils), so that people know what's happening,
0  she does not normally advocate extreme tactics for the group, but lobbying on particular issues to ensure
politicians in possession of the correct facts.
O  members such as herself (PhD Microbiology) or Pamela Leste would be able to comment on technical aspects
of project and EIA, Joseph Gueho (or his assistant Danielle) from the herbarium, the botanical.
6.0. Ministry of Agriculture, Conservation Unit: Mr. Sookun
0  his main concern was if the development would affect 'his' birds - mainly whimbrels, tumstones, plovers etc.
some of which are migratory, but mainly feed on the mud-flats around the port.
0 the main feeding area was first out at Bain des Dames, but this developed as a picnic area and the birds
moved further north towards the container terminal.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmental Impact Assessment
0  they are now proposing to fence the area, and pass legislation to formally declare it as a sanctuary, as these
bird populations have caused problems in terms of the port development and are likely to be under even more
pressure in future,
0  at present the food supply is ample - the mud flats are rich in invertebrate infauna, and there is certainly no
shortage of food - could cessation of sewage discharges affect food supply, as there will be reduced organic
matter supply to flats ?
0  there have been no formal assessments of either the food supply available to these populations, or of water
quality, but data on the bird populations themselves will soon be published.
0  contact Mr. Munro to get the ministry official view regarding the project.
7.0. Association des Pecheurs, Pointe-aux-Sables : Mr. Dennis Jackson
0  condition of the reef has deteriorated steadily over the past 10 or more years and there still seems to be
progressive deterioration to the southern end of the reef. They have seen the reef gradually die-off to the
point where there are no commercially valuable fish to be caught there,
0  water quality in the lagoon is terrible most of the time - there are frequent algal blooms, and the water is
visibly discoloured with sewage most of the time, often with dyes used in industry too,
0  people used to come to the Pointe-aux-Sables beach for picnics, swimming, fishing - but no more as there is a
constant foul odour and sewage debris always present in the water,
0  they are particularly worried that, unless something is done urgently to address the sewage discharges on the
west coast, the entire coast will be like Pointe-aux-Sables in a few years time.
0  there are some fish species and communities which are particularly sensitive - for example, for a few weeks
each year they fish the caves at Albion for a species of especially valuable mullet (the stupid mullet ?) - they
have not seen any at all this year (perhaps they are not so stupid after all!)
0  thought that taking the pipeline through the lagoon may possibly be a better option than along the road, but
the pro's and con's would need to be looked at. If through the lagoon, it should be closer to the shore than the
reef, buried and with the bottom restored flush with the surrounding area.
0  contact Mr. Munboth, Chief Scientific Officer at Ministry of Fisheries regarding sites assessed during
1990/91 EU study. He thinks that there was a site right off Pointe-aux-Sables.
8.0. Irrigation Authority: Mr. Dabeesingh
0  the main issues to consider regarding waste water re-use are the cost of water and the system of irrigation.
0  he calculated the break-even price on the Baie de Tombeau project to be RS 1.80/m3, but he has heard that
after tertiary treatment the cost of water will be RS6/m3 - why should the farmer bear the cost of treating
water to this standard ?
0  there are about 35,000 small planters in Mauritius, 30% of sugar is produced by them, and the GoM doesn't
want to lose them. In general, they have the poorer, dryer, rockier land and have no resources to improve
their land/operations, so the GoM are trying to consolidate them into co-ops, and assisting them with land
development projects. Consequently, all projects are aimed at improving the situation for small farmers,
because the large ones can manage fine,
0  all proposals must be cost effective and appropriate to local conditions - drip irrigation requires high quality
water because of problem of blocked nozzles; overhead systems not appropriate for wastewater re-use

systems because of increased risk of risk of contact with spray and residue on the cane, open channels may
not be appropriate, because of other uses for water, centre pivot no good where many smallholders (<I ha to
1Oha) as coordinating harvest is too problematic,
0  will have to take note of fact that irrigation water wont be needed for three months of the year and STW
designed accordingly - ie. wastewater re-use for irrigation wont reduce capital cost of STW,
0  individual farmers have a lack of knowledge generally in relation to wastewater re-use, and this is potentially
a problem with introducing these systems - peopie have a poor understanding of the issues and it is regarded
as socially unacceptable in many communities eg. veges grown by wastewater systems not sold in
mainstream markets.
0  SIGMA report on west coast irrigation systems provides valuable information relative to understanding
background to decisions/recommendations re irrigation, as each area is different.
9.0. Mauritius Export Processing Zone Association: Mrs Wong
0  industry is feeling under pressure from all quarters at the moment - (including environmentalists) but there
are few signs that they are taking action to improve their environmental performance,
0 industry sees the requirement for higher standards as obstructing industrial development and financial
success, and has not apparently seen this as directly linked to market expansion into the most lucrative world
markets,
0  ISO 9000 / 14000 being advertised like a household cleaner in the media - and following conviction of
several companies in SA after they simply bought the certification, everyone is very sceptical in Mauritius!
0  MEPZA has recently developed an award system to reward corporate achievement and committment to
improving environmental performance, through for eg. improving waste management systems, but there is
little interest in Mauritius at present (5 nominations last year, none this year),
0  industry is reacting to forces around them - and not looking ahead. Water shortages and the increased cost of
pollution abatement measures are bound to have a major impact on profitability in future, but there is a head
in the sand attitude now.
10.0. Central Water Authority: Mr. Rogbeer
0  serious problems of water supply shortages from their own systems - which mean they could not possibly
supply industry,
0  the municipal dyke on the GRNW diverts water from the river in three pipes into the municipal filter beds,
where the water is sand filtered and chlorinated before entering municipal supply,
0  problems arise during heavy rains when the sewers overflow into the river and water is contaminated with
municipal and industrial waste, but this is below their water intake, so potable water is not normally affected,
0  the main industrial areas around the port including Coromandel receive water from an aquifer in the Corps de
Garde area, transported in a tunnel flowing by gravity direct to the industrial estates.
0  industry is proposing to set up an additional supply with Development Bank funding, by constructing a small
impoundment in the lower GRNW below the municipal dyke and to pump water from the river which will be
treated at industry's cost to augment the existing supplies.
0  GRNW is not heavily polluted although the sugar estate at Highland occasionally discharges into the river
and they suspect that other industries discharge at night,
0  they will gladly allow us to look at such monitoring information as they have,

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmental Impact Assessment
0 contact Mr. Rogbeer for introductions,
0 industry definitely needs to install pre-treatment prior to discharging liquid effluent into municipal sewer, and
Development Bank in fact has a programme to support investment by industry in appropriate technology to
do this.
0  industry appears to be concerned that it will soon be facing both higher charges for raw water, but also for
effluent disposal,
0 water used by industry could be managed much better than it is at the moment by ensuring water re-cycling
systems are introduced, water re-use where possible, by ensuring that high quality water not used for
processes that dont need it, good housekeeping in plants etc.
11.0. Ministry of Export Development and Investment Authority
O MEDIA promotes industry for the GoM, provides sites and facilities but none in the proposed Montagne -
Jacquot service area,
0 have strategies for encouraging industry to locate in Mauritius including tax breaks etc. and in the past have
tried to locate industries with similar requirements together eg. liquid effluent disposal, but has not worked
very well.
0 they know that new development will be constrained by water requirements and availability of land, so they
try to identify state land to develop industrial estates to avoid acquisition of land being the main constraint to
development,
0 they expect that increasing numbers of industries will want to come to Mauritius as result of COMESA /
SADEC, but identifying compatibility/feasibility takes time. They do not want Mauritius to get a bad name
through allowing industrial operations which are heavily polluting a licence to site here,
9 their problems will probably be much less difficult once industry does start to pre-treat, as they will be able to
discharge into sewers (as they do now ! - but how many more industries should they allow to come here
without a committment to treat and dispose of their waste responsibly).
12.0. Ministry of Environment and Quality of Life:
First meeting: Mr. Keshore Heeramun
0 essentially the legislation is unchanged since the 1991 Enviromnental Protection Act, which details EIA
procedures, excepting the formal EIA review procedure and appeal process.
0 see Aslam Yadalee of the Standards Division regarding water and effluent standards for the project,
O see Mrs Ng regarding liaison with the Ministry during the EIA, and technical comment on EIA report prior to
submission (since they require 15 copies better to make sure is OK first
0 suggested an orientation session for the entire MOEQL staff might be appropriate.
Second Meeting: Mrs Ng (other MOEQL staff)
0 the reuse of treated effluent for irrigation will be a good thing
0 there are no standards, at present, for effluent diposal into the marine environment. Mauritius will use
probably use a world health organisation's standards as a reference. The best approach would be to have two

scenarios with two different sets of standards (stringent and not so stringent set of standards) and assess the
impact of both on the marine environment.
0  It is very important to look at the impact the project will have on the socio-economic environment i.e. the
communities being affected by the project e.g. the landfill site project, in the north of Mauritius, had to be
abandoned due to public pressure.
0 the Sociologist must investigate the concerns of the residents at Pointe aux Sables
0   Would there be an odour problem with the new WWT works ? - depends on design and prevailing winds in
the area - the prevailing winds blow in the opposite direction to the nearest communities in the study area
0  What sort of personnel are employed at the WWT works ? - it is important to include this in the EIA report.
0  Are we including baseline/background information in the report ? yes
0  Are we including a monitoring programme in the report ? yes
0   The assessment of the EIA report will take ; 3 months. All EIA reports are made available to the public for
comment
0   Have we heard about the approved area of land purchased in the study area ?
0   What is the recommended buffer zone ? GIBB used a buffer zone of 400m - but there are no guidelines
0  Are we putting limits on the industrial effluents ? i.e. will the new WWT plant be able to cope with the
industrial effluent which has heavy metals etc. in it. Certain percentages of these properties of the effluent
will be removed.
13.0. Mauritius Sugar Industry Research Institute: Mr. Daniel Ah Koon
0  crazy to treat water to tertiary standard then use for irrigation,
0   what is required is a proper evaluation of the health risks in particular communities, cultivating particular
crops or for particular markets and whether they are food crops or not before the idea is dismissed,
0  health impacts can be,addressed by a variety of management measures, including changing crops to non-food
cash crops, stopping irrigation some weeks before harvesting, washing fruit before marketting etc. education
also helps,
0  there may be some practical problem associated with different irrigation systems (drip systems as already
mentioned - but insert filter before site, not hecessary to have fully treated water, as drip system not exposed
to workers anyway.
14.0    Ministry of Economic Planning and Development: Mr R. Parboteah (Economist)
0  The Sewerage Master Plan for Montagne Jacquot must have priority - the Pointe aux Sables reef is in a bad
state - if the effluent was discharged outside the reef it would be better i.e. it is important to discharge effiuent
in the right place where impact will be minimal. The Pointe aux Sables outfall is too shallow and does not
disperse effluent properly.
0   The new WWT plant is a very good thing since it will cater for industrial effluent.
0  The MEPD is responsible for monitoring and overseeing projects - they closely follow the implementation of
projects. They are also responsible for the financial side of the projects.
0   What is the Montagne Jacquot Projects time scale ? - it is important to complete the Montagne Jacquot
Project as soon as possible

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmental Impact Assessment
15.0    Ministry of Energy and Water Resources: Dr. Sharma, and assistant
0 will the effluent be treated before discharge?depends on cost and time. The effluent may be reused for
irrigation only after secondary treatment (B). What will be the quality of the water effluent be after
secondary treatment? i.e. they seem very inerested in the reuse of treated effluent for irrigation since water is
a scarce resource
O the quality of irigation water is more important for other food crops but not sugar cane. The assistant will
obtain the International Standards for treated water for irrigation purposes since Mauritius does not have
standards for irrigation water or ocean outfall effluents, only for inland water. There are standards for
drinking water.
0 at present, drip irrigation comprises 10% of irrigation methods used in Mauritius but will increase this to 27%
to conserve water. Other irrigation methods are > 60%.
0 the problem of people using the irrigation channels for washing will decrease since the next generation of
people are more educated and there is better technology
0 the assistant suggested that we need joint evaluation of the St. Martin project and the Montagne Jacquot
project, since there are similarities.
0 how much irrigation water is needed in the Montagne Jacquot area? and how much will be availabe for
irrigation from the WWT plant? 25 000m3 per day (B)
0 why should the agriculture industries pay the cost of treating water? (since they are the ones who will use the
treated effluent). They agreed that since agriculture needs the water and uses most of it - they should pay
since someone must bear the cost. The MEWR predict that before the year 2020 they will need recycled
water.
O because of the lack of surface water, agriculture will eventually depend on treated/recycled water for their
source of water. When is the Montagne Jacquot study to be completed?
O- contact Mr. Toolsee at the Irrigation Authority for information on areas under .irrigation. The main
responsibility of the MEWR is to provide water for whatever it is needed - they locate the source of water
then provide it. The MEWR is also responsible for the control of water pollution.
0 the accumulation of pesticides from irrigation runoff can become a problem over time.
O is water coming into the WWT works both from industries and sewage? if so, what about the presence of
heavy metals in the marine environment? There should be special regulations for industrial effluents.
0 near the Montagne Jacquot project Study Area there is a planned dam development at the confluence of the
Remipart River and the R. Papayes River - this is to supply more water to the westem agricultural estates.
16.0    Ministry of Health: Mr. L Hurpaul (Principal Sanitary Engineer
0  this department has received a number of complaints from the public on the pollution on the beach at Pointe
aux Sables.
O  the present standards for effluent are too low - the new WWT plant would need, at the very least, primary and
secondary treatment.
0 one of the main problems that the sewage situation has got to this bad state is the lack of skilled maintenance
people in Mauritius to service the pump stations of the sewer network. If equipment stops working - it stays
that way for many years i.e. never gets fixed. A good example is at the Fort Victoria works where only two
pumps are working (in fact, all four pumps, when they were all working, are never run simulataneously since

at peak flows the system cannot cope). Therefore, for the new WWT works it is important to use good
quality, simple equipment which requires little maintenance.
O  skeptical about the pumping stations (which will be built to pump sewerage to new WWT work) being able to
cope with maximum flow levels.
0  who is funding the project? World Bank & GOM (40%) and the Japan Economic Development Fund (60%).
0  the local conditions of the sewer system, and the factors affecting it, are very important to consider when
designing and building the new WWT plant. The present sewer networks are old with a high filtration rate.
0  the main responsibility of this department is to address complaints about sanitary problems from the public,
and to inspect the facilities in buildings e.g. kitchens in hotels and restuarants where grease is a big problem -
they should maintain their grease traps which they do not do.
0  how will the Montagne Jacquot project deal with the problem of sludge? disposal of sludge is a big problem
since the landfill site is far away.
17.0    Ministry of Industry: Mr. Domun
0 The ministry is aware of the Montagne Jacquot project, and previous studies (e.g.Sogeti) relating to the
present sewer problem. Mr. Domun mentioned a study done in 1987/88 (Environmental Industry Pollution
Initiative?) and funded by World Bank, which was undertaken to try and deal with the pollution resulting
from industrial effluents. The project identified an area for an Industrial Park where future industries could
operate under more controlled condition - this project was, however, shelved due to lack of funds. In
addition, the existing industries were not able to accommodate changes to their present systems to try and
avoid pollution.
0  the Montagne Jacquot project is long overdue - most of the dye houses are set up adjacent to the sewer
system - which is convenient for the disposal of their effluents.
O the Ministry of Industry has some responsibility to the quality of discharge produced by industries. In the
past, the development of industries in certain areas have been restricted to try and alleviate the existing
pollution problem in those areas. e.g. Coramandel.
O  the fisherman in and around Port Louis have complained a lot about the effluent discharging into the sea.
O  for 7 to 8 years the dye houses have wanted to expand but have been restricted by the lack of water and the
pollution problem.
0  the present trend in industries in Mauritius is in the textile industry where an increase in textile developments
is evident. In other words, the demand for water will increase since the textile industry uses a large amount
of water. The textile industry is very important for economic growth in Mauritius. In fact, the Minsitry is
relying on the Montagne Jacquot project so that they can expand more. The Ministry is also trying to expand
into other types of industries.
0   they import labour for the textile industry (which is very labour intensive) because there is a short supply of
labour in Mauritius.
0  two ways to reduce the present sewer problem is (1) divert the industrial effluents to a separate system, (2)
control the problem at the source i.e. the factories should have screening systems which are maintained.
0   there are too many regulatory authorities responsible for monitoring the different aspects of the industry
operation (water effluent, building structures etc.) - so there is a problem of "who's responsible for what".

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmental Impact Assessment
18.0   Ministry of Housing & Lands, Town & Country Planning Board: Ms Koo
0 the Town & Country Planning Board has already given plans for a housing development and a lease area on
the land adjacent to the prison i.e. the proposed site for the Montagne Jacquot WWT works. She foresees a
big problem with this - the Baie de Tombeau project has a problem with landowneres (who are now sueing).
She advises us to move the site to avoid compensation costs - it costs 45 million rupees for 1 acre of land if
the owner has already been given permission to build on a site.
O what size will the WWT plant be? it would cover an approx area of 15ha with a 400m buffer zone around it.
O in the NPDP Montagne Jacquot was earmarked for urban development.
19.0   Chamber of Agriculture (private company): Mr. Juwaheer, Mr Poisson
O their main worry is that we avoid potential agricultural land - since the site for the Montagne Jacquot project
is not on potential agriculture land they do not have a problem with the project. They would have a problem
if the wind direction was such that they would be adversely affected.
0 is one of the main aims of the project to use treated effluent for agriculture ? yes. They were not sure as to
what the limitations of water quality of treated effluent are if used to irrigate sugar cane - contact Dr.
Soopramanien at the at the MSIR1 for information on the effect of treated effluent water on sugarcane. The
high sodium chloride in industrial waste would be a problem - not suitable for irrigation.
O what is the effect of heavy metals on the marine environment ? what are effects on groundwater resources (an
indirect impact) - would need to examine geology of area.
20.0 Ministry of Tourism: Mr. I. Mijjoo
o there are no active tourism facilities and no known plans for future development of tourism facilities in the
vicinity of the proposed Montagne Jacquot site. The nearest facilities are proposed near Albion.
O the improvements to water quality in the vicinity of pointe aux sables lagoon and reef and Fort Victoria would
be welcome, although there are no active touroism facilities in those areas at present,
0 the ministry recognises the importance of marine resources to the tourism industry and strongly supports the
enhancement and maintenance of water quality.
MINUTES OF PUBLIC MEETINGS
1.0    Issues raised at the Pointe aux Sables community meetings
0 High crime rate in the region.
0 Drug abuse and prostitution is a major concem in this area.
0 The negative impact of pollution created by the sewage effluent
0 Inability to use the beach and the sea for recreation
0 Numerous requests to the authority, about cleaning up the area, have not been responded to.
0 Some residents themselves are contributing to the pollution in the area. e.g. some residents regularly defecate
and urinate on the beach at Pointe aux Sables, a few hundred metres away from the Ddbarcadere. This occurs
because the area is not cleaned regularly enough and therefore encourages people to pollute the area.

0 The youngsters were particularly worried about the lack of recreational facilities. Instead, they tend to hang
around on road sides, which is seen as suspicious behaviour by the police.
0 All the fisherman felt that the sea around the Debarcadere area is totally destroyed due to the polluted
discharge, which makes it impossible to walk in the sea.
0  Divers in the area reported seeing a 'desert' area on the sea bed at Pointe aux Sables. This area is clearly
visible and forms a zone with no visible marine life.
0  Fishing nets get tangled in rubbish deposited in the sea making it is impossible to use fishing nets in this area.
This problem seems to have been accelerated in the past eight to ten years.
0  The fishermen pointed out that when the existing Pointe aux Sables pipeline was built, they used rocks on the
beach to build a wall for the pipeline. This wall has not yet been removed and has become clogged with
debris and is an obstruction to vessels in the lagoon. The sane problem occurs at Bain des Dames.
0  Sewage discharged at Bain des Dames is reaching Pointe aux Sable due to wind action.
0  Resident are willing to assist in the cleaning up of the affected areas, provided they receive the support of the
authority.
0  Fishermen are conscious of the way in which the pollutants are affecting the marine life in the lagoon. At low
tide, the polluted discharge is trapped in the lagoon and the north wind blows the polluted water and debris
towards the land. This happens about four to five times a year.
0 The fisherman are selling contaminated fish to the 'baignans' (wholesale fish merchants), who in turn sell the
fish at the market. Although the fishermen are aware of the health hazards, they need the income..
0  The fishermen are catching 'Mule', a local fish species found in their area, even though is fetches a low price.
They used to catch about 300 - 400 kgs of Mule six to eight years ago, but populations of this species have
declined considerably. Although this is probably from fishing pressure - the fish are being affected by the
sewerage discharge in the lagoon since the fish smell of kerosene (hence the name "Mule petrol". The fish are
sold to the fish merchants , however the residents of the area are aware of the health hazard and do not buy
them.
0  The coast of living for the fishermen in the Pointe aux Sables and Bain des Dames areas (about 50
professional fishermen at Pointe aux Sables and 60 to 70 at Bain des Dames) has increased considerably due
to a combination of reduced fish stocks in their area and the fact that Pointe aux Sables is adjacent to the
restricted zone of Port Louis Harbour. They therefore have to fish in other areas further away (e.g Pointe aux
Piment, Trou aux Biches, Albion, Medine, Balaclave, Flic en Flac) which is costing up to Rsl 200 just for fuel
for one boat per month. For a fisherman who earns Rs.30 to Rs.40 per kg of fish and only manages to catch
about 10 to 15 kg of fish only occasionally, they cannot afford to travel too far to fish.
2.0    Issues raised at the Bain des Dames community meetings
0 Discharge of polluted water - coloured water through the canals leading to the Bain des Dames is a
common feature observed by all residents interviewed.
0 Residents have often observed trucks discharging full loads of polluted liquids, with a strong odour, in
the open tank at the treatment works station. Sometimes complaints are registered and the discharge is
stopped but only for a short while.
O Discharge of human waste occurs often within the sight of residents. This discharge flows through a
canal and reaches the sea on the southern side. It seems that the existing sewer pipes cannot cope with
the waste load since they often over flow.
0 The canals carrying waste from inland from the Port Louis area is a constant problem since they carry
waste from the Port-Louis and Cassis residents and the waste from industries (e.g. factories, dry cleaning
plants). During high rainfall, these canals transport non perishable solid wastes such as plastics and dead
animals.
0  The deterioration of the environment is a major problem in this area.
0 The Ministry of Environment and Quality of Life are presently constructing a green area in the centre of
Bain des Dames, which is used as a football field. However, recently a construction company started
digging the drains next to the football field and dumped the rocks etc. adjacent to football ground. This
"dumping ground" covers an area of about I 000 m2 and now consists of a rocky/muddy area. Recently
the rocks were removed but rehabilitation of the site will take some time.
0  There are no recreational areas in Bain des Dames, for either adults or children. The only area used by
residents seems to be the fish landing station area. It seems that residents, mainly the elderly, spend their

evenings there playing cards, 'petanque', or chatting. Children cannot play on the beach or swim in the
sea and usually end up "socialising" with the adults.
O There are obvious health hazards associated with the level of pollution at Bain des Dames.  The
residents cannot do anything about it and seem to just accept it as being part of the development and
growth of the country. They do, however, expect the authority to take steps to reduce the health hazards.
O The fishermen suffer constantly from skin diseases which they get from being in the water - but they feel
they have no alternative since their livelihood is at stake. Similar skin problems also occur amongst the
children, and hair loss has also been reported amongst the adults.
*0 Children often fall into the water, when they are assisting their fathers when they go fishing, and it is
often imnpossible to get rid of the smell from the body.
0 Fishermen going diving report prolonged stomach problems, headaches and vomiting. Such problems
have been reported even in areas as far as La Pointe, south of Pointe aux Sables, which is where local
residents swim.
0  The fishernen at Bain des Dames are struggling financially since the fish populations have declined
substantially. Contaminated algae and worrns on the shore are used as bait in fish traps. The fisherman
used to use salmon as bait but they need a permit and only one permit is given to six or eight fishermen.
The decline in salmon populations has resulted in this permit system..
0 The fishermen in this area have to go further north up to Cap Malhereux or south-west to Flic-en-Flac to
find fish. This is obviously more costly.

dd:j.. INSTIrUrONAL STUDY FOR WArn WATER AUMl1ORYf__
(vi) Operation and Maintenance (O & M) of the Pumping Stations and
Treatment Plants
Routine 0 & M works of the pumping stations and treatment plants are
carried out by the departmental staff of the WWA with assistance from
other Government Departments for electrical and mechanical problems.
Major repairs are executed through contracts following standard
procedures.
2.6           Environmental Protection
Apart from the role for management of the waste water system within the
country, the WWA has the additional responsibility of advising the Department
of Environment on industrial wastes. These comprise the following activities:
* Review of reports of analysis of industrial wastes carried out by the industries.
 Independent collection and analysis of samples of industrial wastes by the in-
house laboratory of the WWA and also foi Hospitals and Hotels.
U Advice on Reports on Environmental Impact Assessment from industries
including scrutiny of design of treatment plants.
* Advice on sewer systems for institutions and public buildings (new systems
and trouble shooting for existing systems).
l Advice to public.
* In-house analysis of samples from WWA Treatrnent Plants, rivers, estuaries
and lagoons.
According to the latest records, there are 496 industries in the country out of
which 113 industries are connected to the sewer system of the WWA while the
remaining have on-site disposal. These industries are located in major industrial
estates in Plaine Lauzun, Coromandel, Vacoas and La Tour Koenig and in
addition medium industries are in 16 locations. The industries are thus spread
over the entire country.  Most of the industries relate to Textiles, Tannery,
Brewery, Refinery and Food processing.
The staff potential in the WWA dealing with pollution control is not consistent
with the expanding industrial scene with the result that review of analysis of
industrial wastes (especially those entering the sewers which require careful
review to ensure performance of treatment plants) is sporadic and not systematic.
Presently one Engineer and one Technical officer are in charge of the subject and
in addition, services of the in-house laboratory headed by a Biochemist are
available. This laboratory was started in 1993 with a nucleus and has recently
moved to its own building which is part of the laboratory of the Department of
Environment. A review of the number of samples analysed in the laboratory
between July to December 1996 indicates the following monthly averages
* Domestic                     ..      14
* Industries                   ..    21
* National waterbodies          ..    15
* Hotels and Restaurants       ..      8

P..j.d: INSTLrtMONAL STUDY roR WASIE WATER AtMIORrrY
To discharge its role as a support agency to the Department of Environment for
protection of environment in addition to its own work of quality control for the
waste water system, the pollution control unit of the WWA requires to be
expanded.
2.7           Interim  Measures
While the major thrust of the present consultancy is to recommend the structure
of a comprehensive organisation for the Waste Water Authority with parastatal -
status and an adequate legal statute to back it up, it is clear that the installation
of such a system will take time. Adoption of a statute by the National Assembly
and its promulgations have their own time frames depending upon the pressure
on the legislature; transfer of staff from a division of the Government to a
parastatal body has its own procedural complications; persons qualified in
handling and management of waste water are at a premium in the country. On
the odter hand, a massive work prograrnme of about Rs 4 billion has already been
lined-up with funding arrangements from national and international sources. All
these calls for the setting up of a unit specifically meant for project
implementation in the WWA as an interim step. This is being dealt with in the
next section of this Report.

3.0.         PROJECT MANAGEMENT UNIT
3.1.         Role of the Project Management Unit (PMU)
The role of the Project Management Unit is to function as a centralised agency
to be in charge of the new investment programme being taken up by the WWA.
The unit will be responsible for all the activities from Planning to Implementation
and Evaluation of the Projects. A more detailed appreciation of the activities of
the PMU will be evident from the component of a Project Cycle listed in
Annex 3.1.
The PMU will be headed by a Deputy General Manager (Projects) who will be
an officer of the rank of a Chief Engineer and who will be full-time, reporting
directly to the General Manager. The DGM (Projects) will be responsible for all
capital Projects irrespective of the source of funding and the PMU is to he
recognised as the sole agency for project implementation in the entire WWA.
3.2.         Composition of the PMU and Job Specifications
In discharging his functions the DGM (Projects) will be assisted by
m   Full time personnel directly reporting to him,
*   An advisorv Consultant and
*   A Project Monitoring Cell.
Figure 3.2. gives the Organisation Chart for the PMU.
3.2.1.       Full-Time Personnel
This will consist of:
A.  A Technical group
B.  A Finance cum Personnel group.
A.  The Technical group will be divided into three wings - namely Design
Wing, Implementation Wing and Quality Control Wing.
(i) Design Wing
This wing will be responsible for all activities of the Project Cycle
from identification of a Project to fixing contractors for
implementation - that is, Activity A(l) to F(1) of Project Cycle in
Annex 3.1. The wing will coordinate the work of all Consultants and
also respond to queries from Implementation unit seeking clarification
on design based on site conditions.
The Design Wing will also he responsible for Management
Information System relating to all the Projects. IFigure 3.2. 1.(A)l

(ii)  Implementation Wing
This wing will be responsible for all activities relating to
Implementation and handing over to Operation and Maintenance - that
is, Activity F(2) to G (3) of Project Cycle in Annex 3.1. The wing
will also be responsible for reporting to the design wing any variation
in site conditions leading to change in design and would seek the
concurrence of the design wing where the change is of major nature.
[Figure 3.2.1.(B)I
(iii) Quality Control Wing
This wing will have two separate units
(a)   an Engineering unit and
(b)   a Scientific unit
The Quality Control Wing has been framed to carry out activities
H(1) to H(3) of Project Cycle - namely evaluation of the Project. In
addition, the Quality Control Wing will also be responsible for
preserving the quality of ambient environment as provided for in
WWA's statute. The role of the WWA in carrying out the objectives
of the Environment Protection Act for safeguarding the waterfront
will be achieved only by assigning important role to this wing. For
this purpose, this wing will be responsible for scrutiny of proposals
relating to treatnent of industrial wastes and regular monitoring of
samples of industrial effluent. The wing will also provide laboratory
facilities. [Figure 3.2.1.(C)I
A specific role has been entrusted to the Quality Control Wing,
namely quality surveillance of project implementation like cube tests
for concrete, materials used for construction, etc. (Random tests)
B.  The Finance cum Personnel Wing will provide support services to the
Technical group - namely correspondence, passing of bills of contractors.
consultants, monitoring capital expenditure etc.
3.2.2.       Advisory Consultant
As works proposed to be implemented involve technical expertise and as the
works of many Consultants have to be supervised, it is recommended to have a
full-time Consultant on contract basis in an advisory capacity. This Consultant
will be with global experience in the field'of waste water and his contribution will
be all the more necessary if in-house personnel with local experience only is
considered for the post of (DGM Projects). The Advisory Consultant will offer
technical advice on all issues relating to the PMU referred to him by the senior
personnel of the PMU.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmental Impact Assessment
APPENDIX P: General requirement for safety, security and environmental protection and more specific
mitigatory actions for contractors to be carried out during construction of transmission
pipelines
1.0    General requirements for safety, security and environmental protection
The requirements for safety, security and protection of the environment shall be applied to the construction
contractors in accordance with industry standards in Mauritius, and as stated in paragraph 19.1 of the General
Conditions of the Contract (FIDIC, 1987), which state,
"The Contractor shall, throughout the execution and completion of the Works and the remedying of any
defects therein:
(a) have full regard for the safety of all persons entitled to be upon the Site and keep the Site (so far as the
same is under his control) and the Works (so far as the same are not completed or occupied by the
Employer) in an orderly state appropriate to the avoidance of danger to such persons,
(b) provide and maintain at his own cost all lights, guards, fencing, warning signs and watching, when and
where necessary or required by the Engineer or by any duly constituted authority, for the protection of
the Works or for the safety and convenience of the public or others, and
(c) take all reasonable steps to protect the environment on and off the site and to avoid damage or nuisance
to persons or to property of the public or others resulting from pollution, noise or other causes arising as
a consequence of his methods of operation."
In addition, the General Conditions of the contract shall include the following paragraph 29.1 dealing with
interference with traffic and adjoining properties:
" All operations necessary for the execution and completion of the Works and the remedying of any defects
therein shall, so far as compliance with the requirements of the Contract permits, be carried on so as not to
interfere unnecessarily or improperly with:
(a) the convenience of the public, or
(b) the access to, use and occupation of public or private roads and footpaths to or of properties whether in
the possession of the Employer or any other person...."
In addition to the requirements imposed by these general conditions of the construction contract, more
specific requirements shall be imposed by the technical specifications.
2.0.   Specifc mitigatory actons to be carried out by contractors during construction of Transmission
main pipeline: land-based route (alternative 1)
Constructionl methods
In addition to specific construction methods specified in the Section 6.00 series, the following general
requirements shall apply to the work under this Contract:
In performing the work described in the Sequence of Construction, the Contractor shall limit the amount of ditch
open at any one time to approximately 200 m. The work, including excavation, pipe laying, backfilling and
temporary paving, shall be completed before proceeding with the work in the next section.
The Contractor may employ more than one installation crew but not less than 400 m shall separate any two open
trench sections as defned hereinbefore.
Should any portion of the work lag, the Engineer will suspend other portions until the lagging portion is brought
up to schedule. Such action by the Engineer shall be for the purpose of confining the construction work to as
small an area as possible and shall not be used asjustification to request an extension of completion time.
Temporary paving, where required, shall be placed the same day as the ditch backfill.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                      Environmental Impact Assessment
Pipe and fittings shall at all times be handled with great care to avoid damage. In loading and unloading, thev
shall be lifted with cranes or hoists or slid or rolled on skidways in such manner as to avoid shock. Under no
circumstances shall this material be dropped or allowed to roll or slide against obstructions. Pipe and other
material shall be distributed along the right-of-way in advance of installation only to the extent approved by the
Engineer. Such materials shall be so placed as to keep obstruction to traffic at a minimum.
Any work within the pipe and fittings shall be performed with care to prevent damage to the lining. Damaged
lining shall be repaired or the pipe section or fitting replaced as required by the Engineer. No cables, lifting
arms, hooks or other devices shall be inserted into the pipe or fitting. All lifting, pulling or pushing mechanisms
shall be applied to the exterior of the pipe or fitting.
During construction the Contractor shall, by sprinkling with water or by other means approved by the Engineer,
eliminate dust annoyance to adjacent property owners. No additional compensation will be paid to the
Contractor for any costs incurred in complying with this provision.
Use of public streets
The use of public streets and alleys shall be such as to provide a minimum of inconvenience to the public and to
other traffic. Any earth or other excavated material spilled from trucks shall immediately be removed by the
Contractor and the streets cleaned to the satisfaction of the governing authority.
Vehicles must be loaded within all legal weight limits and operated safely within all traffic and speed
regulations.
Access to businesses along the route of the work must be provided by the Contractor at all times.
Care of trees, shrubs and grasses
In the course of the work, it may become necessary to remove trees if they interfere with construction. The
Contractor shall obtain a permit from the Employer and/or other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
work area before removing, relocating and/or pruning any tree. The Contractor shall abide by all requirements
and conditions of the permit, and shall include all costs under the various Bill of Quantities Items, and no other
compensation will be provided.
The Contractor shall be fully responsible for maintaining in good condition all cultivated grass plots, trees and
shrubs. Where maintained shrubbery, grass strips or area must be removed or destroyed incident to the
construction operation, the Contractor shall, after completion of such work in said area, or as directed by the
Engineer, replace or restore to the original -condition all destroyed or damaged shrubbery or grass areas. - Tree
limbs which interfere with equipment operation and are approved for pruning shall be neatly trimmed and the
tree cut coated with a tree paint
Weeded areas need not be replaced with grass, but shall be restored to a "green" area by sowing a variety of
permanent type grass seed, over the area as approved by the Engineer. The grassed or seeded area shall be
watered and maintained until the Engineer is assured a good grass growth has developed, but not to exceed a
maximum period of 60 days.
In order to protect himself from being held liable for any existing tree damage, the Contractor is advised to notify
the Engineer in Writing (with photographic documentation) before proceeding with any work.
Protection of existing utilities. structures and other facilities
Underground utilities, structures and other facilities shown on the Plans are located according to the best
information available, but may vary from both the position and elevation shown. The Contractor shall explore
far enough in advance of his main trench to determine the exact location and condition of such utilities,
structures or facilities so that, before the pipe is installed, the Engineer may change the line or grade of the pipe,
should that become necessary to avoid a conflict.
Black & Veatch International                      xlv                                        Appendices

All cost for changing the grade of the proposed main downward I m or less in order to clear obstructions located
differently than shown on the Plans, or to clear obstructions not shown on the Plans but the location of which
could have become known or should have become known by proper observation of field conditions or the proper
exploratory procedure, shall be included in the prices quoted under the various items of the Bill of Quantities and
no additional compensation will be allowed.
Additional cost, if any, for changing the grade of the proposed main downward more than I m for the same
reasons, will be paid for as "Extra Work" in accordance with the General Conditions.
Changing the grade of the proposed main by rising deflections, or the alignment by horizontal deflections, will
not be considered as extra work, or extra cost, to the Contractor, and in some cases a credit to the Employer may
be warranted.
In all cases where the main is deflected either horizontally or vertically, and the Engineer requires additional
work and items such as paving, air release valve assemblies, and similar items for which a pay item was
established in the Quotation, then such additional work and items will be paid for at the prices quoted.
The Contractor shall determine the locations of recent additions to the systems not shown on the Plans. Extreme
caution shall be exercised to eliminate any possibility of any damage to utilities resulting from his activities. The
location of all overhead utilities shall be verified and the Engineer notified of any conflict which might occur.
The Contractor shall be responsible for determining which poles will need shoring during excavation and shall
provide such shoring and support as is required.
Where it is necessary to temporarily interrupt house or building services, the Contractor shall notify the house or
building owner or occupant, both before the interruption and again immediately before service is resumed.
Before disconnecting any pipes or cables, the Contractor shall obtain permission from the owner, or shall make
suitable arrangements for their disconnection by the owner. The Contractor shall be responsible for any damage
to any such pipes, conduits or cables, and shall restore them to service promptly as soon as the work has
progressed past the point involved.
Various drainage culverts and drainage ditches may be encountered along the route of the work. Any culverts
which are disturbed, damaged or removed shall be repaired, restored or reinstalled. The Contractor shall
document any existing damage to the drainage systems, or if it needs cleaning, prior to doing any work in the
vicinity, so he will not be held responsible: Drainage ditches shall be restored to the original cross sections
existing prior to construction of this work. Ditches shall be left clean and free of all excavated materials or other
materials deposited in them as a result of this construction. All existing headwalls, removed or damaged as a
result of this construction, shall be restored as directed by the Engineer, and the work shall be considered an
incidental item and the cost included in the other items of the Quotation  -
All existing drainage structures and piping shall be considered clean at the start of construction. The Contractor
shall check to verify that this is so. He should notify the governing agency of any damaged or dirty structures or
piping to avoid repair or cleaning at his expense. Copies of such notices shall be sent to the Engineer.
Relocation of existing utilities
The relocation of existing utilities as noted on the Plans, or for the convenience of the Contractor shall be the
responsibility of the Contractor. This work shall be completed by either the forces of the existing utility or the
Contractors forces at the discretion of the responsible utility. If the work is to be performed by the Contractor,
all work shall be done in accordance with the utility company's requirements. Under no circumstances shall the
Contractor be authorized extra payment for this work, and all cost for the relocation shall be the responsibility of
the Contractor.
The Contractor shall also be responsible for the coordination of all existing utility relocations with the
appropriate utilities. Where temporary supports or protective encasements are required during the construction,
the Contractor shall be responsible for this work at no additional cost.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmenta! Impact Assessment
APPENDIX Q: Industrial Waste Water Management
1.     Industrial Activities in the Montagne Jacquot Project Area
In the Montagne Jacquot project service area, there are three main industrial zones, namely:
* Plaine Lauzun;
* Coromandel; and
* La Tour Koenig.
In general, within the Port Louis South area, industrial and tertiary activities (commercial and service sectors
mainly) are predominant.
The 1992 Gibb Sewerage Master Plan (SMP) estimated that about 100,000 employees (non residents) use the
sewerage system of Port-Louis south in addition to the perrnanent residents. Moreover the perimeter groups
together a very important industrial activity where textile manufacturing predominates.
1.1    Plaine Lauzun Industrial Zone
The Plaine Lauzun industrial zone is located at the south entrance to Port Louis and is occupied by more than 80
factories. The activities are varied and include textile manufacturing including dyeing, laundering, chemicals
processing; galvanising, metal plating, soap and detergent manufacture, fish canning, and alcohol bottling &
distillation plant among others. The factories are spread over about 100 hectares.
Within this industrial zone, the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) has developed an export processing zone
consisting of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure which occupies an area of 6 to 7 hectares. The main
industrial activities are garment manufacturing (textile), printing, wood work, metal plating, chemical blending,
among others.
1.2    Coromandel Industrial Zone
The Coromandel industrial zone infrastructure was developed by DBM. It is located at the southern entrance to
Port Louis and just outside the boundaries of Port Louis District It covers about 30 hectares and groups about 70
industries; the main activity being textile manufacturing including dyeing, and washing. Other industrial activities
that generate waste waters include soap manufacturing, corned beef processing & canning (agro-industry),
galvanising plant and some services such as warehousing, electronic repair workshops and offices among others.
J.3    La Tour Koenig Industrial Zone
La Tour Koenig industrial zone is the more recent industrial zone set up by the DBM; this zone is situated
downstream of Coromandel. The Lower Beau Bassin/Coromandel trunk sewer extends to this industrial zone
before reaching the pre-treatment works at Pointe aux Sables.
The main waste water generating industries are a dye house and a galvanising plant.
The industrial zone also includes an Informatic park which generates domestic-type effluents.
*      Demand for industrial space is on the increase since 1996 after a slump between 1990-1995. According to DBM,
at present there are about 20 industrial projects which will be implemented during the next two years; the type of
industrial activities will include: dyeing (textile), food processing and other water consuming activities. Hence it
is expected that volume of industrial effluent from within the La Tour Koenig will increase substantially in the
future.
2.     Need for Control of Waste Water Discharges
In general, industries use numerous types of raw materials and chemicals during the manufacture of fnal
products. Many of these substances are not retained in the final products and re-appear as pollutants in the waste
waters, solid wastes and gaseous emissions. In general, the severity of the impact of the discharge of these
pollutants depends on the characteristics of the pollutants and their quantities. They may be relatively harmless in
Black & Veatch International                   xlix                                    Appendices



Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                    Environmental Impact Assessment
low concentrations; they may be effectively removed in waste water treatment systems; or they may adversely
impact the natural environment (marine, terrestrial etc.) with short term or long-lasting consequences. Moreover,
the presence of some pollutants may be harmless to man-made structures such as sewers and treatment plant
process units, or they may be harmful, e.g. concrete works are affected by the corrosiveness and aggressiveness of
acidic waste waters.  It is necessary to evaluate each industry on an individual basis to determine the
characteristics of its effluent, its quantity, and its potential for pollution or harm to physical structures.
Table 2.1 illustrates the different types of industrial activities within the service areas of the Montagne Jacquot
project, and pollutants commonly found in waste waters produced by those industries. Specific pollutants in the
effluent of a particular facility, and the quantity, depend on the individual plant's industrial activities as well as
the specific processes employed in that plant.
Heavy metals are a class of pollutants which are commonly associated with industrial activity, including some of
the industries located in the Montagne Jacquots service area. Table 2.2 lists some of the industrial activities
which are found in the service area, and the heavy metals sometimes found in that type of waste waters. Heavy
metals and some of the other pollutants in industrial waste waters often accumulate in the sludge produced at a
sewage treatment plant which effectively removes that portion of them from the effluent to receiving waters.
However, their presence in the sludge must be considered in the selection of appropriate disposal methods for the
sludge.

3.       Chemical Audits of Industries in Mauritius
In an endeavour to characterise the waste waters from the industrial zones, chemical audits were carried
out by ERM-SETEGUE-SIGMA-SAMSOON on two types of industrial activities namely textile dyeing
and metal plating. The dye houses were selected because the textile industry is the dominant industry in
Mauritius, and the dye houses produce the vast majority of the waste water from the textile industry. Also,
it was believed that the main source of heavy metal pollutants would be the metal plating industry. Waste
water flows from the dye houses represent about 90 percent of the total industrial flow from service areas
in Montagne Jacquot project.
Table 3.1 identifies the main types of chemicals used by textile dye house. It was established that metallic-
based salts of copper, zinc and cobalt were used only occasionally and in low quantities. Consequently the
waste water characterization study focussed on the other pollutants. Chromium (total and hexavalent) was
included even though it was established that chromium dyes were no longer in use. This observation was
supported by both the local suppliers of chemicals as well as the specifications from overseas textile buyers
which prohibit this metal from the textile products.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmental Impact Assessment
The industrial waste water characterization survey found that the metal plating industry was using highly
toxic chemicals such as potassium cyanide and salts of lead, copper, and nickel. The effluent flow was of
the order of 10 m3/d with a measured cyanide load of 103 g per day. Source elimination was recommended
for this compound as well as metal precipitation via a full treatment unit.
For the galvanising plants, zinc amnmonium chloride and hydrochloric acid were the main chemicals used
during the galvanising process. Iron and zinc are the metals found in high concentrations that can re-appear
in waste waters. The acid bath contained iron in concentration of 1 OOgll. The high concentration of iron in
the acid bath and other solids have a tendency to reduce the etching efficiency of the acid. Iron and other
solids are precipitated from the acid solution, but the acidity remains high so that neutralisation of this bath
is necessary to protect the sewer pipes from this discharge.
From the chemical audits at the selected industries and the industrial survey carried out for industries
within the service areas of the Montagne Jacquot project, a waste water characterisation programme was
established. Both composite and grab samples were taken from various types of industrial activities as well
as combined waste waters within the sewer networks of the industrial zones.
4.       Waste Water Characteristics of the Major Wet Industries
The effluent characteristics of selected wet industries within the Montagne Jacquot project area were
established and are given in Appendix I. The industries were selected on the basis that one or more
pollutants present in their waste waters will need abatement before discharge into the sewer networks.
As shown in Appendix 1, the main characteristics of the waste waters from dyeing and washing processes
are:
-   Alkaline pH; high sulphate concentration; low inorganic and organic nitrogen content; the range of
COD concentrations is similar to reported values for dye houses with similar product range and
processes.
The absence of heavy metals such as cobalt, nickel, and chromium in the waste waters confirms
observations made during the chemical audits stated in the previous section. However, zinc was detected in
most composite samples at concentration below 0.25 mg/l whereas copper was measured in one case only
at a concentration of 0.27 mg/. These concentrations of copper and zinc are within the range of
concentrations of 0.12 to 1.6 mg/I and 0.13 to 1.22 mg/l respectively reported for a typical dye house in
South Africa.
The presence of organic halides is to be expected given that these substances are present in some of the
chemicals used such as dyes, dispersing agents or chemicals that are precursors for AOX.
As shown in Appendix I, it is seen that waste waters from printing industry, soap manufacture, paint
industry and vegetable canning plant are characterised by high concentrations of:
*     COD and BOD(S), oil & grease, total suspended solids and salinity (conductivity).
With regard to waste waters from the fish canning plant, high concentrations of COD, total suspended
solids, total Kjedahl nitrogen and oil & grease are normally observed, even though they were not found in
the grab sample taken.
As shown in Appendix L the waste waters from a galvanising plant are characterised by very high
concentrations of COD, iron, and total suspended solids. Moreover the residual acid concentration remains
and varies between 2.4 to 12.1%.
5.       Waste Water Flows from Worst Polluting Industries
Within the three industrial zones of Plaine Lauzun, Coromandel and La Tour Koenig, waste waters from
dye houses and laundry units represent approximately 90 percent of the waste water generated. The waste

water flows from the selected industries were estimated and are given in Table 5.1. It was concluded that
the waste water from these industries would require abatement before discharge to the sewer system.

Notes: 1. MTCE(tuna canning plant) will be relocated in Riche Terre by 1998 and hence will not
discharge into the Port Louis South sewerage system.
2. A stone washing plant generates high concentration of sand particles that need to be settled and
removed from the waste waters so as to avoid their settlement in the sewers and hence causing
overflows.
3. This unit manufactures denim cloth (for jeans) and generates high concentration of suspended
solids from usage of starch in the process.
6.       Permissible Limits for Discharge into a Sewer Network
The types and loads of various pollutants from a range of industrial activities have been described in the
previous sections. The extent to which these pollutants need to be decreased at source depends on the:
*  Assimilative capacity of the receiving medium,
* Loads of the pollutants,
*  Capacity of the treatment works (assuming that the sewer networks will eventually discharge to a
treatment plant) among others.
* Effect of pollutants on sewerage system.
Consequently it is necessary for the waste water discharges into the sewer networks to be monitored and
controlled so that the sewer networks as well as the treatment works operate efficiently. The control of
waste water discharges at the source implies that regulatory measures are required such as permissible
limits for some pollutants. In this regard the 1992 Gibb Sewerage Master Plan made recommendations for
discharge standards for various receiving medium including discharge into sewers. Table 6.1 shows the
parameters identified in the SMP, as well as the compliance limits.
For discharges to public sewers, the compliance limits suggested in the SMP for some parameters need
more flexibility. For example, the recommended permissible limit for COD was 1000 mg/I. This limit is
considered to be low if cognisance is taken the fact that the quantity of flow must also be a factor. That is,

a waste water with a higher COD concentration (say 2000 mg/1) but with a low flow rate mieht be
acceptable for discharge to the sewer system. This quantity of COD would not affect the operation of a
waste water treatment plant if it was designed to take that COD load. On the other hand the maximum
permissible limit for suspended solids appears too high (2000 mg/I) if deposition and resulting blockages
in the existing sewer networks are to be minimised.
Overall, the recommendations of the SMP with regard to sewer discharges set the frame work for
regulatory measures for control of waste water discharges.
7.         Pre-treatment of Industrial Waste Waters
The need for industries to pre-treat their waste waters is governed by the necessity to preventing blockages
and damage to the sewers, and controlling toxic pollutants. Appropriate pre-treatment systems to meet
these objectives are described below.
7.1        Blockages in Sewers
To minimise blockages in sewers the following processes are recommended.
* Coarse and Fine Screens
Coarse screens followed by fine screens can be effective for reducing suspended solids from most waste
waters. These screens are installed in the waste water canals within a factory. For the textile industry,
loose fibres, pumice stones and plastics are solids that need to be removed by the screens.
*   Dissolved Air Floatation
A dissolved floatation unit can be effective in reducing the floatable matter in an effluent. In the case of a
meat canning plant, the fats, oil and grease load needs to be reduced substantially (about 90 percent
reduction) in order to prevent sewer blockages.

* Degritter Tank
For a stone washing plant, most of the pumice stones used in the process are converted to particles of size
and with a granulometry similar to sand. The degritter tank allows sand particles to settle at the bottom
section of the tank from which they are removed by pump to a sand pit.
7.2      Damage to Sewers due to Corrosion
Some waste waters can be corrosive and aggressive towards the sewers. Acidic and basic waste waters can
degrade the walls of sewers and eventually dissolved the cement matrix (in the case of asbestos cement),
resulting in leakage of waste waters in the soil.
Waste waters from a dye house treating polyester generally have high pH (10 to II). pH correction of
these waste waters to 8 to9 will be necessary.
In contrast, waste waters from a galvanising plant are very acidic and complete neutralisation will be
necessary. This pH adjustment will also cause the iron to precipitate out simultaneously.
7.3      Minimising Toxic Compounds in Waste Waters
The concentration of toxic pollutants must be controlled in order to protect the aquatic environment and
the prevent of impairment to any biological processes provided at the waste water treatment plant.
Chemical blending plants, including insecticides/pesticides bottling plants, will require containment
structures around holding tanks and operating areaas so that any spills can be cotained, collected and
disposed of in acceptable ways. The containment structures should be properly sheltered against rain with
no drains.
For the metal plating industry, the all waste water discharges must be treated to completely oxidize the
cyanide and precipitate all dissolved metals to acceptable levels.
7.4      Pre-treatment Systems and Capital Costs
Industrial waste waters that need to be pre-treated prior to their disposal in a sewer network have been
identified. Pre-treatment systems are recommended for installation at specific industrial sites, and estimates
for capital costs were developed for these systems. The information is presented in Table 7.4.1.
For most of the dye houses, only coarse screening is recommended for removal of fibres. It is estimated
that the supply and installation of coarse galvanised screens inside waste water canals within the factory
and just outside the premises should not exceed Rs 50 000 per factory.
8.       Control of Industrial Discharges
8.1      General
Chemical analyses carried out by ERM-SIGMA-SAMSOON on both industrial waste waters only and
combined industrial and domestic waste waters, have shown that heavy metal concentrations (chromium,
copper, nickel etc.) are below the discharge levels as recommended in the SMP. However, due to the
variability in the quality of the industrial effluents and the evolution of the industrial activities within these
industrial zones, it is essential to carry out regular monitoring of industrial waste waters so as to ascertain
that permissible limits are not exceeded.
8.2      Determination of Appropriate Parameters to Monitor
For each type of industrial activity, a set of parameters was identified for monitoring and control of
effluents.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                  Environmental Impact Assessment
For metal plating plant, the parameters that should be monitored are COD, TSS, pH, cyanide, chromium,
nickel, and copper. These parameters should be determined on both the aqueous and solid phases of the
waste waters.
For chemical blending plants, including insecticides/pesticides bottling plants, periodic inspection visits are
recommended so as to ascertain that chemical spill control measures are being utilized. The waste water
efluents should be monitored for pesticide residues and organic halides.
8.3      Current Industrial Monitoring Program
At present, many wet-processing industries carry out chemical analyses on their waste waters every month.
In most cases, a private analytical laboratory is commissioned by the industry to collect a grab sample for
characterisation. The analytical reports are submitted to either the Waste Water Authority or Central Water
Authority or the Department of Environment.   The Waste Water Authority and Department of
Environment collect samples from specific industries on an irregular basis.
Guidelines for an organized waste water monitoring program are included in the Environmental
Management and Training section of this EIA.
9.       Monitoring Agency
The Waste Water Authority is the enforcement agency for waste water discharges into its sewerage system,
and will be responsible for the monitoring of discharges into the sewer networks. WWA has laboratory
facilities to carry out sampling and chemical tests. However some testing for some parameters such as
heavy metals, pesticides, organic halides, will have to be performed by the Central Environmental
Laboratory which operates under the Ministry of Environment. As part of the monitoring function, WWA
will increase the frequency of visit to industries, carry out a regular assessment of the results submitted by
the industries, and initiate follow-ups when abnormal results are reported.
10.     Time Frame for the Installation of Individual Pre-treatment Systems
Once it is recognised that an industry needs to pre-treat its waste waters then a programme of works should
be established by the industry in collaboration with WWA for implementation of the pre-treatment system.
The time frame for the installation of any pre-treatment system should take cognisance of:
e The existing industrial set-up as well as infrastructures;
*  Surveys that are required for waste water characterisation leading to establishing the design criteria;
*  Options that favour investments in increasing efficiency of productive equipment inside the industry
so as to minimise material losses.
During all stages, WWA should be fully involved and ascertain that progress is made and any delays can
be accounted fully.
In the case of textile industry, the installation of screens is not a time consuming exercise and the costs
involved are considered reasonable. The installation should be completed within three months after actions
are initiated by WWA.
For the metal plating and galvanising industries, ERM-SETEGUE-SIGMA-SAMSOON has provided the
design criteria as well as the sizing of the process tanks and equipment for individual industrial enterprises.
Consequently WWA together with the industries should elaborate on an implementation plan within one
year after action is initiated by WWA.
For other industries requiring pre-treatment systems, WWA must set a time frame for their installations not
later than 1999, i.e. before the coming into operation of the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant.

APPENDIX R: Sludge Disposal
1.     General
Sludge is the principle byproduct of waste water treatment plants treating both domestic and industrial waste.
waters. In general, the amount of sludge generated will depend on the type of treatment processes provided as
well as the characteristics of the waste waters. Due to the nature of these waste waters, a number of contaminants
are normally present in the sludge, as follows:
*  pathogens such as enteric, rota and hepatitis viruses, Salmonellae, Shigellae bacteria and many varieties
of helminths such as Ascaris Lumbricoides etc.;
*  heavy metals and elements such as cadmium, cobalt, lead. chromium; boron. arsenic fluoride etc. from
industrial activities, and
*  organic contaminants from industrial waste waters such as organic halides (AOX), poly-cyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, etc..
The quantity, form and concentrations of the heavy metals and other toxic pollutants will depend on the extent of
industrial activity that uses raw materials containing these metals. A summary of the industrial activity in the
Montagne Jacquots service area is presented in Appendix Q.
The sludge produced by a waste water treatment plant requires management with appropriate stabilization,
processing and disposal so as to avoid possible contamination of land, pollution of sea and underground water and
to minimise health risks to humans.
Generally the treatment of sludge involves stabilisation process as well as a de-watering process. The stabilisation
process involves the controlled degradation of the organic matter either chemically, aerobically or anaerobically.
The de-watering process is necessary so as to concentrate the sludge, resulting in a lower volume and hence
facilitating its disposal.
2.     Sludge Production from Mauritius Sewerage Projects
Four main sanitation projects will be implemented in Mauritius by 2003, at:
* Montagne Jacquot;
* Baie du Tombeau;
St Martin; and
* Grand Baie.
From the feasibility study report for each project, design loads were used (Tables 1, 3 and 5) to estimate the
quantity of sludge that will be generated per day (Tables 2, 4 and 6). Table 7 summarises the sludge production
per day (mass and volume)from the four waste water treatment plants for different time horizons.
For the Baie du Tombeau project, only preliminary treatment will be provided. Consequently no sludge will be
produced and sludge disposal will not be required.

Note: Volume of sludge is estimated at a concentration of 25%
3.     Other Sources of Sludge
At present excess sludge is also generated by the existing small treatment plants around the island (Hotels,
Industries, Housing Estates etc.). Current methods of disposal for these small facilities include reuse as soil
conditioner for landscaping after de-watering via drying beds (Hotels, industries) and tankering to existing
Governmental sewerage works (Industries, Housing estates).
4.     Disposal Options
Three disposal options for the excess sludge were considered:
* Reuse in agriculture particularly on the agricultural land close to the WWT plants;
*  Disposal at a landfill site; and
*  Incineration.
4.1    Reuse of Stabilised Sludge in Agriculture
Sludge disposal by applying it to agricultural lands is an option that is implemented in various countries and can
be an efficient disposal option. In addition to its soil conditioning properties, sewage sludge has a nutrient content
in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus and to a lesser extent, potassium, calcium, magnesium and trace metals.
During the manufacture of sugar, scum is generated. Every year an estimated amount of 245 000 tons of scum are
generated during the milling season (June to November). This material is applied to sugar cane fields that will bc
re-planted with sugar cane or on rotational land.
The characteristics of sludge from a WWT plant treating domestic waste waters only and scum from sugarcane
processing are given in Table 8. From the table it is seen that both sludge and scum are deficient in nutrients.

Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Projecl                  Environmental Impact Assessment
In Mauritius the application of sludge to agricultural land in sugar cane plantations is limited for the following
reasons:
*  sugar cane is planted in ratoons and only after every seven years (or more) are the sugar cane fields
either replanted with sugarcane or crop rotation is implemented. Hence the surface area available for
sludge reuse every year is only a fraction of the total surface area under cultivation (20 percent available
yearly).
v  Scum produced from sugar manufacturing is currently applied to the land, which makes it unavailable
for application of sludge.
4.1.1   Possible Reuse of Stabilised Sludge in Sugar Plantations around the Island
Western Coast
Medine Sugar Estate which is located on the western Coast of Mauritius, produces about 25 000 tons of scum per
harvest season. Medine operates a composting unit which converts the scum into compost with augmentation of
the potassium, organic and phosphate content with vinasse from a nearby distillery. The compost thus produced is
used in the sugar cane fields of the western coast.
The area under cane cultivation in the Westem Coast is estimated at around 7400 hectares of which only 1480
hectares (20 percent) are available every year for sludge application.
Other Regions
In the other regions of the island, which consist of the humid to super humid regions, the presence of lime in the
lime-stabilised sludge may provide a source of benefit to the planters on account of its alkalinity content.
In the humid to super humid regions on the island, the soil is acidic (pH -4.2) and pH correction is necessary for
sugar plantation (pH <5). To increase the pH by one unit, about 5 tonnes of lime is needed per hectare of land. pH
correction is normally carried out when sugar cane is re-planted only.
Land Under Cultivation in the Humid to Super-humid Zone.
The surface area of sugar cane plantations in the humid to super humid zones around the island is summarised in
Table 9 (1993 figures).
Table 9: Land Under Sugarcane Cultivation in the Humid to Super-humid Regions of Mauritius.
Regions                Area Under
Sugarcane crop (Ha)
Centre                            8000
South                            24000
East                             18000
Total                            50000
It is estimnated that there are about 50000 hectares of land in the humid to super humid zones under cane
cultivation. However only about 20 percent of these lands will be available every year for reuse of stabilised
sludge. Assuming that only 50 percent of this area requires pH correction then the amount of lime only needed is
estimated at 25 000 tonnes per year (assuming lime application rate of 5t/Ha).
S.     Chemical Contaminants in Sewage Sludge
The quantity of sewage sludge that can be applied to agricultural land depends to a large extent on the
concentrations of various contaminants present in the sludge and the maximum amount of metal(s) that can be
applied to soil.
Black & Veatch International                   lxi                                      Aprrendicev



Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                Environmental Impact Assessment
The chemical composition of sewage sludge varies widely from country to country as well as within regions of
the same country since they are generated and discharged by the activities of the serviced community. The data in
Table 10 shows the extent of variation observed. Industries and commercial establishment are almost always the
source of contaminants found in waste water. This is because the amount of these substances that might be
discharged by a residential unit would be so small that they would be undetectable when diluted with the normal
waste water flow in the system. Insecticides, cleansers, paints, automotive products and other chemical products
used by individuals are not normally available in the high concentrations used by industries nor are they disposed
of in significant quantities.
In the case of Mauritius, no comprehensive surveys have been carried out on the chemical composition of sewage
sludge, to determine the extent to which these substances may be present.

5.1    Estimated Metal Content from Montagne Jacquot Project
With regard to the Montagne Jacquot Project, a comprehensive list of industries in the service areas was reviewed
and chemical analyses carried out on waste waters from selected industries by SETEGUE, ERM-SIGMA-
SAMSOON. Chemical audits were also carried out on selected textile and metal plating industries. From these
reviews it was concluded that only a few industries (see section on Industrial Survey) might discharge some of
these contaminants in either the form or in quantities which can would result in high concentrations in the sludge.
The latest available data on the characteristics of industrial effluent are tabulated in Appendix I of the EIA. Most
of the work on industrial effluents has focused on the textile industries because they contribute about 90 percent
of the total industrial waste water flow. The effluents from five dye houses were analysed for phenol, nickel,
zinc, cobalt, copper, Total chromium, and hexavalent chromium, in addition to the other routine water quality
parameters such as BOD, COD, TSS, N, and P. From the analyses it was found that virtually no nickel, no cobalt,
no chromium, and no hexavalent chromium were present Phenols were found in several samples, ranging in
concentration from 0.05 to 0.6 mg/I. Zinc was present in concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.23 mg/I, and a
sample from one of the five textile plants showed a copper concentration of 0.27 mg/I.
It is possible to estimate the amount of zinc and copper which could end up in the primary sludge from the
Montagne Jacquot plant from these industrial effluent discharges, using reasonable assumptions concerning
average waste water effluent quantities and treatment process removal efficiencies. If one half of the textile
industries had an average concentration of copper and zinc of 0.15 mg/Q on a continuous basis, and if the primary
treatment process removed 40 percent of the total, the resulting average concentration of copper and zinc in the
sludge would be increased by 85 mg/kg. This compares to the typical sludge concentration of these metals
shown in Table lIA.3.Iof 650 to 800 mg/kg for copper, and 1500 to 2054 mg/kg for zinc. It was concluded that
these concentrations of copper and zinc in the textile industry effluent were not significant.

5.2     Maximum Permissible Contaminant Concentrations in Sewage Sludge for Application to
Agricultural Land
The presence of contaminants in sewage sludge can in some cases exceed their levels in the soils and
consequently their use for agricultural purposes needs to be assessed and permissible limits defined. Moreover it
is essential that sludge destined for agricultural purposes be monitored adequately for the presence of these
contaminants. Table II below shows the maximum permissible limits for various contaminants in sewage sludge
for application to agricultural land.
Based on the best information available for the waste water at the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant, the primary
sludge will meet all of the limits for concentration shown in Table 11. Also, since the concentration of the
pollutants will be at acceptable levels, there will not be limits placed on the application rates for sludge to land for
disposal.

5.3     Maximum Soil Metal Content and Permissible Metal Application Rates.
The National Institute of Water Research (South Africa) has defined guidelines for the maximum soil metal
content and the permissible metal application rates; these are reproduced in Table 12. The main reason why
metals and to some extent toxic organic are limited is that once they are in the sludge they tend to remain in it as
inert materials and become part of the soil matrix. Eventually these substances can be taken up by the crops and
the animals grazing on the sludge applied land.

South Africa, 1984).

5.4    Nitrogen Demand
Nitrogen is usually the nutrient governing the rate of application of fertiliser to crops. For sugarcane typical
nutrients in the form of fertilisers that are applied are as follows:
*  Nitrogen (as N): 120 kg/Ha/year
* Phosphorus (as P205): 56-60 Kg/lHalyear
The nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) content for domestic sludge is low. The percentage by
weight is around 4,3,1 percent of N, P and K respectively. A typical fertiliser used for agriculture in Mauritius
contains 17, 3.5, 20 percent by weight of N, P, K respectively.
As lime-stabilised sludge contains between 2.9 to 3.3 % nitrogen (as N), then the rate of sewage sludge that can
be applied to land is between 3.6 to 4.1 tonnes/ha/year. This assumes that the maximum metal concentrations in
the sludge do not exceed the permissible metal soil application rates as given in Table 1.4.3.3.1. In South Africa,
the application rate of sewage sludge to land under crop cultivation is 8 tonnes/ha/year (source: NIWR-South
Africa, 1984).
6.     Control and Monitoring
The maximum allowable annual loading rates established by the South Africa and U.S. EPA for sludge that is
applied to land for disposal can be used as temporary guidelines until data become available when a review of
these guidelines can be effected for local conditions. These rates can be used by the Waste Water Authority to
control the allocation of sludge applied to land for disposal, to prevent an excessive amount of the pollutants from
being deposited in one location.
The sludge produced at the Montagne Jacquot WWT plant wil be analysed on a regular basis for these pollutants,
to determine the acceptability of the processed primary sludge for disposal on land application. Initially, samples
of sludge will be collected and analysed approximately once every 3 months for the first year of operation. The
frequency of monitoring will thereafter be adjusted, according to the results of the initial monitoring. Moreover
industrial activities that can contribute to the presence of these contaminants in the sewers will need to be
controlled and monitored regularly( as described in the section Industrial Survey).
Limits have also been proposed in the U.S. for other types of regulated pollutants that can be present in sludge if
discharged in significant quantities by industries or other establishments in the service area. These regulated
pollutants include pesticides like aldrin, chlordane, DDD/DDT/DDE, dieldrin, lindane, and toxaphene; industrial
chemicals such as benzene, PCB, and trichloroethylene. Their presence in the sewerage system will be controlled
by the Waste Water Authority through its regulations and its program of monitoring and reporting of industrial
waste water discharges.
6.1    Establishing Guidelines for Sludge Reuse for Agricultural purposes
Once, data are available from the monitoring and control programme, then guidelines can be defuned for
permissible limits for contaminants, the type of crops to which sewage sludge can be applied and other methods
of utilisation or disposal.
Sewage sludge that are to be applied or disposed on land needs to be classified. The classification procedures
include the origin, type(s) of treatment and characteristics and quality standards required for particular purposes.
The origin defines the source of the sludge, whether it is sludge from septic tanks, oxidation ponds, secondary
activated sludge plant etc. The type of treatment applied to the sludge such as anaerobic digestion, pasteurisation,
lime stabilisation, compost, fumigated etc.
Characteristics and Quality standards includes:
* Odour nuisance and fly breeding potential;
*  Pathogenic content including viable Ascaris Ova per lOg of dry sludge, Salmonella per 1O0g dry sludge,
faecal coliforms per 1O0g dry sludge etc;

Metal content; among others.
6.1.1   Contractual Agreement between Producer and User of Sewage Sludge.
In view of the possible problems and risks associated with the use of sewage sludge for agricultural purposes, a
contractual agreement must be established between the producer and the user of the sludge. The essential items
forming part of the contract shall include but not limited to:
*  Characteristics of the sludge (type, quality etc.)
* Limiting metal and maximum application rate (dry weight basis) t/ha/y.
*  Recommended maximum application rate in terms of nitrogen demand of crop (t/ha/y).
* Methods of transport for the sludge.
* Site location where sludge will be stored and used.
* Area of land where sludge will be applied.
* Crops under cultivation.
* Metal content of soil.
* Name and quantity of materials (scum for example) or chemicals (e.g. lime, potassium) to be added to sludge
before use.
*  Instructions for the usage of sludge.
*  Defnition of the methods of inspection of the user's activity.
7.     Disposal of Sludge at a Landfill Site
Disposal of sewage sludge in a landfill has the economic advantage and at the same time avoiding the risks
associated with land application.
Under the Solid Waste Management Plan two landfill sites for solid waste disposal (domestic and industrial) were
identified namely: Mare Chicose and Mare D'Australia.
Mare Chicose landfill is due to be in operation towards the third quarter of 1997. No specific provisions for
disposal of sludge were made in the planning, design or construction of the landfill. However, sludge can be
safely mixed with domestic solid waste and it poses no significant handling problems if the solid content of the
sludge is about 30 percent (by mass) or more.
According to the National Solid Waste Management Report (Ministry of Economic Planning and Development,
1994), the estimated wastes from the existing transfer station amounts to 450 tonnes per day. With the shelving of
the Mare D'Australia landfill project, it is likely that all these wastes will have to be sent to Mare Chicose, this
tonnage is near the nominal design capacity of the landfill. With the implementation of the four sanitation
projects, it is estimated that about 25 tonnes per day of sludge (volume 80 m3/d) will have to be disposed, his
amount will increase to 40 tonnes per day (volume 165 m3/d) by Year 2005. These sludge masses represents about
6 and 9 percent of the nominal design capacity of Mare Chicose landfill. Thus, the landfill has the capacity to
receive and dispose of the total sludge produced by the WWT plants. Once a new landfill is placed into service,
the burden on the landfills to dispose of the sludge will be significantly reduced.
The disposal of sludge at the Mare Chicose landfill site can be retained as the disposal option for at least the first
five years of operation of the new Montagne Jacquots WWT plant, until 2006.
8.     Sludge Incineration
Incineration of sewage sludge can reduce many of the problems associated with disposal of sludge to land.
However this method requires high capital investmnents as well as operating costs.
With sludge incineration, sludge stabilisation is not necessary. However sludge de-watering will be required. For
the incineration of excess sludge only, it is estimated that about 15 percent of the total sludge incinerated re-
appears as ashes. As these ashes may contain metals, they will have to be disposed in a landfill site.
Typical incinerators operate at temperatures of 750 to 800SC, which is high enough to convert organic matter to
carbon dioxide and water.

Monragne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project                   Environmental Impact Assessment
The feasibility of sludge incineration will have to be carried out prior to its implementation. Many issues will
have to be assessed namely:
*  the economic viability of the process;
*  centralisation of sludge incineration taking due cognisance that other-waste water treatment plants will also
generate excess sludge;
*  Treatment of gaseous emissions and odour minimisation; among others.
Furthernore investigations will be needed into the viability of co-incineration of excess sludge together with
domestic wastes.
9.     Solid Waste Management Study
The Ministry of Environment has commissioned a study to define, evaluate, and review alternatives for solid
waste managment in Mauritius and Rodrigues. The study will include the sludge produced at the WWT plants as
part of the overall solid waste stream. The purpose of the study is to develop a master plan for solid waste
management, considering all sources of solid waste and all alternative disposal methods. The WWA will be one
of the agencies participating in the implementation of the long term solid waste management program.
