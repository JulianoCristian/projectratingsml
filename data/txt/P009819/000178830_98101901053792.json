The plant\n            will have a daily capacity of about 1,350 metric tons of\n            ammonia and about 2,200 tons of urea. The project also\n            includes the provision of infrastructure and auxiliary and\n            offsite facilities required for the efficient operation of\n            the plant. Possible risk facing the project include\n            implementation delays and start-up and production\n            stabilization difficulties. These risks are mitigated by the\n            use of commercially proven technologies supplied by\n            internationally recognized engineering firms who have\n            experience in executing similar projects in India. The loan\n            will also support a study to rehabilitate two coal-based\n            fertilizer plants at Talcher and Ranagundam, owned by the\n            Fertilizer Corporation of India."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
