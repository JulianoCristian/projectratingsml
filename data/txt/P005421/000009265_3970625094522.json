part of\n            a two-year phase of implementation of the Government's\n            education sector reform program.  The objectives of the\n            reform program are to make the provision of education more\n            equitable, more cost-effective, and more consistent with the\n            country's medium-term development needs.  At the same\n            time, the Government is developing and implementing a number\n            of pedagogical measures to ensure that the quality of\n            education is maintained or improved and that the coverage of\n            the system is extended, even as unit costs of education are\n            reduced.  More specifically, the project would assist the\n            Borrower in improving:  (a) equity of education; (b) the\n            efficiency of Morocco's education system; and (c)\n            containing the growth of public expenditures on education.\n            The project includes a program of construction and equipping\n            of schools, teacher training, foreign fellowships and\n            studies in support of new educational activities."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
