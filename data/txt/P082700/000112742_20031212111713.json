"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "This release of the second tranche of\n            the Social Safety Net Structural Adjustment Credit Project\n            will support the Government of Bolivia to help it respond to\n            urgent social needs and deepening fiscal pressures, both of\n            which have been worsened by the recent civil conflict.\n            Progress in implementing the credit has been impressive in\n            light of the severe civil strife of October 2003, which\n            brought most government programs to a standstill, and the\n            subsequent change of Government which resulted in new\n            leadership for all government entities and a reorganization\n            of functions among them.  The Government remains on track\n            for achievement of five of the six conditions before the\n            closing date of the credit. A fill waiver for the budget\n            execution condition is sought as the expected result will be\n            a successful adaptation to challenging circumstances, and\n            fully consistent with the intent of the target.  A partial\n            waiver is requested for the progress report on impact\n            evaluation condition as the impact evaluation is planned to\n            begin early 2004.  A full waiver is also sought for the\n            Education Sector Strategy to be presented to National\n            Education Congress on the grounds that the civil strife led\n            to a postponement of the Conference until March 2004."}, "docdt": "2003-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
