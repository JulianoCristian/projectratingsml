Bolivia 
has 
achieved 
remarkable 
progress 
in 
social 
indicators 
since 
the 
launch 
of 
its 
far 
reaching economic and 
social 
reforms 
of 
the 
early 
1990s. 
Those 
reforms, 
sustained 
and 
deepened 
in 
successive 
Governments 
up 
to 
the 
present, 
met 
with 
early 
success 
in 
stimulating  growth, 
but 
the 
economy’s  performance stalled after 
1998, 
due 
to 
several 
causes, 
and 
poverty 
increased 
over 
the 
last 
5 
years. 
This 
eroded 
popular 
support 
for 
the 
reforms, 
and 
recently 
led 
to 
a 
serious episode 
of 
civil 
unrest. 
The 
proposed 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural  Adjustment 
Credit, 
a 
two 
tranche 
credit 
intended 
to 
be completed 
by 
March 
2004, 
is 
a 
part 
of 
IDA’S 
immediate 
response 
package 
to 
the  current 
social 
and 
economic 
crisis 
in 
Bolivia. 
The 
credit 
supports the 
Govemment’s 
near 
term 
program 
of 
fiscal 
adjustment 
and 
provision 
of 
vital 
social 
safety 
net 
services. 
The 
credit 
thus 
will 
help 
the 
Government 
to 
close 
a 
financing 
gap 
in 
2003, 
expand 
the 
provision 
of 
social 
services 
during 
this 
period 
of 
fiscal 
adjustment, 
contain 
erosion 
in 
social outcomes 
for 
the 
poor, 
to 
address 
the  economic 
underpinnings 
of 
rising 
social 
tensions. 
Specifically, 
the 
program 
would: 
(i) 
protect 
the 
budgets 
of 
nine 
key 
programs 
(National 
Emergency 
Employment 
Program, 
Health 
Reform, 
Epidemiological 
Shield 
for 
1 
Page  8
Benefits: 
Chagas, 
Malaria, 
and 
Tuberculosis, 
Universal 
Health 
Insurance 
for 
Mother 
and 
Child 
Care, 
Expanded 
Immunization 
Program, 
Education 
Reform 
and 
Education 
Quality), 
that 
are 
subject 
to 
high 
volatility 
in 
investment 
budgets 
and 
expenditure 
execution 
and 
are 
key 
to 
the 
containment 
of 
further 
erosion 
of 
social 
outcomes 
and 
achievement 
of 
counter-cyclical 
goals 
of 
the 
2003 budget; 
(ii) 
sustain 
and, 
in 
some 
areas, 
strengthen 
key 
social sector 
reforms 
of 
this 
Government  and 
its 
predecessors; 
(iii) 
provide 
technical  support over 
the 
bridging 
period 
(June 
2003 
to 
March 
2004) 
to 
protected 
social 
safety 
net 
programs. 
The 
time 
horizon 
is 
a 
bridging 
period 
of 
9-10 
months, 
during 
which 
stability, 
both 
social  and  fiscal, 
can 
be 
restored, 
and 
the 
foundations 
for 
medium term reform 
put 
in 
place. 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
proposed 
credit 
flow 
from 
its 
core 
objective 
to 
provide 
bridging 
support 
to 
the  Government 
through 
the 
difficult 
months 
ahead, 
while 
sustaining 
the 
momentum 
of 
social 
sector 
reforms 
during 
this 
period 
and 
protecting 
the 
substantial 
social 
gains  that 
Bolivia 
has 
achieved 
since the 
early 
1990s. 
The 
expected benefits 
by 
component 
are: 
Budget 
protection: 
41 
percent 
of 
the Government’s 
public 
social 
investment budget 
will 
be 
protected 
from 
reductions 
during 
the 
year, 
and 
execution 
of 
those  budgets 
will 
achieve a 
minimum 
level 
(85 
percent 
on 
average) 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year; 
Public 
Employment: 
The Government’s  targeted 
workfare 
program, 
PLANE, 
will 
provide 
employment 
to 
unskilled, 
poor 
workers, 
mostly 
women, 
in 
projects 
that 
will 
maintain 
existing 
economic 
and 
social infrastructure; 
Health: 
Budget 
protection 
will 
be 
assured 
to 
public 
health 
programs 
benefiting 
poor families, 
while 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
health 
service 
delivery 
will 
be 
improved 
through 
performance 
agreements 
with 
regional 
health 
offices; 
Education: 
1.2 
million 
children 
will 
benefit 
from 
improved 
instruction, 
teacher 
training,  and 
school 
management 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ongoing 
Educational 
Reform 
Program 
protected 
under 
the 
credit;  options 
will 
be 
explored 
to 
address 
the 
declining 
enrollment 
rates; 
and  a 
final 
version 
of 
the 
Ministry’s 
sectoral 
strategy 
will 
be 
distributed 
for public 
..

Risks: 
Schedule 
o 
consultation, 
so 
as 
to 
strengthen donor  support 
for  key 
initiatives. 
Country 
strategy 
risks 
are 
substantial. 
The 
current 
Government enjoys 
limited 
support, 
and 
the 
coalition 
is 
fragile. 
Current social unrest 
and 
tensions 
could 
persist 
or 
intensify, 
further 
undermining 
the 
political 
environment 
for 
new 
medium 
term reforms 
in 
economic and social 
sectors, 
as 
well 
as 
economic 
growth. Balancing 
those 
country 
risks 
are 
the 
Government's 
efforts 
to 
deepen 
national 
dialogue, 
and 
hopeful 
signs 
of 
a 
regional 
economic 
revival 
that 
could 
help 
lift 
Bolivia's 
economy. 
Donors 
remain committed 
to 
support 
the 
Government, 
and 
there 
is 
a legacy 
of 
pro-poor 
reform  on  which 
to 
build 
an 
equitable 
development 
strategy. 
The 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
credit 
and 
its 
implementation 
are 
manageable 
in 
regard 
to 
disbursement 
of 
the 
two 
tranches. 
Conditions 
for 
the 
disbursement 
of 
the 
first 
tranche were 
met 
prior 
to distribution

Bolivia 
has

progress 
in

indicators 
since the

and 
social 
reforms 
of 
the

Those 
reforms,

in

but 
the 
economy’s performance stalled after 
1998, 
due 
to 
several 
causes, 
and 
poverty 
increased over 
the 
last 
5 
years. 
This 
eroded 
popular 
support 
for 
the 
reforms, 
and 
recently 
helped precipitate a 
serious episode 
of 
civil 
unrest. 
1.2 
Bolivia’s 
major 
structural 
reforms 
since the 
late 
1980s 
are 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
8. 
There 
are 
many 
notable 
achievements, 
beginning 
with 
a 
bold 
and 
effective stabilization 
of 
the 
economy 
which 
brought hyper 
inflation 
under 
control 
in 
the 
late 
1980s. 
In 
the 
social 
sphere, 
1987 
marked 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
first 
social investment 
fund 
in 
the 
developing 
world, 
which 
created 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
man 
months 
of 
employment 
while building 
and 
reconstructing 
local 
transport 
and 
social 
infrastructure  nationwide. 
This 
was 
followed 
by 
a 
series 
of 
reforms 
that  opened 
the 
economy 
to 
foreign 
investment, 
improved 
education 
and 
health 
services, 
and modernized 
the 
customs  service, 
the 
judiciary, 
and 
the 
civil 
service. 
A 
major 
decentralization 
reform 
placed 
program 
administration 
and 
more 
revenues 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
municipal 
Governments. 
Bolivia 
introduced 
an 
ambitious 
reform 
of 
its 
formal 
pension 
system, 
and began 
the 
process 
of 
banking 
sector 
reform. 
Later, 
Bolivia 
would 
qualify 
for 
HIPC 
resources, 
and 
it 
pioneered 
the 
application 
of 
the 
Comprehensive 
Development Framework. 
Bolivia 
was 
one 
of 
the 
first 
generation 
of 
IDA 
countries 
to 
prepare 
a 
PRSP. 
1.3 
These 
and 
other 
achievements 
led 
to 
strong  performance 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
which 
continued 
up 
to 
last 
year. 
Education 
enrollments 
and 
attendance 
increased steadily. 
Transition 
rates 
from 
primary 
to 
secondary 
school 
advanced 
(see 
Annex 
7). 
In 
the 
health 
sector, 
the 
child 
mortality 
rate declined, 
as 
the 
delivery 
of 
primary 
health 
services 
was 
extended 
to 
more 
and 
more 
of 
Bolivia’s 
poor 
families 
(see 
Annex 
6). 
Even 
in 
the 
more recent 
period 
of 
economic 
slow 
down 
and 
increasing poverty 
incidence, 
most 
social 
indicators continued 
to 
improve. 
Only 
education 
enrollment 
rates 
of 
the 
very 
poorest 
children 
showed 
a 
change 
in 
direction, 
declining 
in 
2001 
and 
2002 
(see 
Annex 
3). 
Protecting 
these 
substantial 
gains 
in 
social 
attainments and 
preventing 
any 
further 
erosion 
in 
school 
attendance 
are 
high 
priorities 
of 
the 
Government 
during 
the 
current 
economic 
and 
social crisis. 
1.4 
A 
central 
theme 
in 
the 
poor growth 
performance 
in 
recent 
years 
is 
Bolivia’s 
vulnerability 
to 
shocks-with 
attendant increases 
in 
poverty 
levels, 
deterioration 
of 
fiscal 
accounts 
and 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
financial 
sector. 
The 
slow 
progress 
in 
the pace 
of 
poverty 
reduction,  the 
continuing 
social 
exclusion 
of 
indigenous 
people, 
and 
the 
limited 
advances 
in 
reforms 
such 
as 
land 
tenure 
have 
resulted 
in 
rising 
social 
tensions. 
Land 
issues 
have 
increased 
in 
importance 
for 
rural 
indigenous 
groups 
as 
access 
to 
some 
of 
the 
traditional 
escape 
valves 
for 
dealing 
with 
rural 
poverty-work 
and 
1

remittances 
from 
Argentina, 
coca trade  and 
work 
in 
the 
cities 
has 
been 
curtailed 
due 
to 
the 
economic 
difficulties 
in 
Bolivia 
and 
Argentina. 
Armed conflict 
between 
the 
police 
and 
the 
army 
and 
civil 
groups 
in 
February 
marked 
a 
turning 
point 
in 
the 
deepening social 
and 
economic crisis, 
and 
convinced 
the Government 
to 
take 
urgent 
steps 
to 
address 
social 
issues 
more 
directly.’ 
1.5 
Bolivia 
and 
its 
Government 
are 
not without 
assets 
to 
bring 
to 
bear 
on 
its 
problems. 
Bolivia 
has 
long 
embraced 
pro-poor 
reform 
and 
modernization, 
and 
in 
the current 
crisis 
the 
Government 
is 
sustaining 
its 
reform 
focus. 
The 
country 
has 
promising medium-term 
prospects. 
Multilateral 
and 
bilateral 
agencies 
provide 
ample external 
resources 
(10 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002) 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
continue 
the 
ongoing 
social 
sector  and 
national reforms 
and 
to 
address 
more 
forcefully 
the 
obstacles 
to 
growth. 
It 
is 
not 
only 
the absolute 
amount 
of 
donor 
assistance 
that 
is 
important, 
but 
also the 
willingness 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to work 
together 
and 
make 
necessary changes 
to 
achieve 
results 
in 
the 
short-term. 
Moreover, 
the 
recent 
agreement 
reached 
with 
the 
IMF 
to 
increase 
the 
2003 
fiscal 
deficit 
target 
to 
6.5 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
provides 
an 
opportunity 
to 
make 
the 
type 
of 
gradual adjustment that 
could 
be 
politically 
and 
socially 
viable. 
These 
assets 
are 
now 
being 
engaged 
to 
defuse 
some 
of 
the 
growing 
impatience 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
public 
through 
national 
participatory dialogue 
on 
policy 
choices, 
a counter-cyclical 
budget, 
and 
a more 
vigorous safety 
net 
program. 
B. 
Causes 
of 
Bolivia’s 
Current 
Crisis 
1.6 
After 
nine 
years 
of 
rapid 
growth 
in 
the 
1990s, 
Bolivia 
has 
experienced 
a drop 
in 
real 
incomes and 
a 
decline 
in 
employment 
opportunities that have 
left 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
feeling 
that 
17 
years 
of 
market-oriented reforms 
have 
not 
yielded 
the 
outcomes 
promised. 
Many 
Bolivians, according 
to 
opinion 
polls, 
also 
feel 
that, 
despite the sacrifices 
made 
to 
help 
stabilize 
the  economy, 
corruption 
and 
inequality 
have 
increased and there 
is 
the 
perception  that 
their 
demands 
for 
more 
Government 
activity 
to 
get 
the 
economy 
back 
on 
track have 
not 
been 
heard. 
1.7 
Uneven 
growth 
performance 
in 
Bolivia 
has 
fed 
those 
perceptions. 
During 
1962-1977, 
when 
the 
public 
sector  and 
the 
state 
mining 
enterprises  were  the 
engine 
for  growth 
and 
central 
to 
Bolivia’s 
development 
strategy, 
the 
Bolivian 
economy reached 
5 
percent 
to 
7 
percent 
in 
annual 
real 
GDP growth 
rates. 
Despite 
deep 
reforms 
since 
the 
mid-1980s 
that 
addressed 
a 
bankrupt 
state 
by 
placing 
the 
private 
sector 
at 
the 
center 
of 
Bolivia’s 
new 
development 
strategy, 
significant 
growth 
resumed 
only 
in 
the 
early 
1990s 
and 
then dropped again 
in 
1999 
and 
has 
been 
stalled 
up 
to 
the 
present 
. 
1.8 
As 
in 
previous 
decades, 
Bolivia’s growth 
of 
recent 
years 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
external 
factors, 
in 
particular 
large 
private 
and 
public capital 
inflows. 
Only 
a 
few 
sectors 
benefited 
from 
the

The 
preparation 
of

the

has 
benefitted 
directly from prior

aspects 
of 
Bolivia’s 
social 
and 
economic development, 
including 
the 
Government’s

large 
FDI 
inflows 
of 
the 
1990s, 
notably 
hydrocarbons and telecommunications.  The 
soy 
sector, 
which 
prospered 
during 
this 
period, 
benefited 
from 
favorable 
trade 
agreements 
with 
the 
Andean 
pact countries. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
economy, 
however, remained vulnerable 
with 
a 
small productive 
base 
and a 
weak 
private 
sector. 
Bolivia’s 
vulnerability 
became 
evident 
in 
the 
late 
1990s 
when 
a 
series 
of 
shocks 
(including 
the 
crises 
in 
Russia and 
Brazil 
and 
in 
2001 
Argentina) 
hit 
Bolivia, 
and 
the 
real 
GDP growth 
rate dropped 
from 
5.0 
percent 
in 
1998 
to 
less 
than 2 percent 
in 
2000 
and 
2.8 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Unfortunately, 
these 
external 
shocks 
coincided 
with 
a 
major 
push 
in 
coca 
eradication, 
an 
effort 
to 
reduce 
smuggling 
through 
a customs reform, 
and, 
later, 
pre-election 
uncertainties 
in 
2002. 
The 
net 
result 
of 
these 
external 
and 
internal 
shocks 
was 
an 
increase 
in 
poverty 
rates 
from 
62.6 
percent 
to 
64.3 
percent between 1999 
and 
2002. 
1.9 
The 
unfavorable 
situation 
in 
which Bolivia’s 
private 
sector 
finds 
itself 
can be 
attributed 
to 
several 
factors 
including: 
(i) 
stubborn 
vulnerabilities 
in 
the 
fiscal 
stance 
and 
financial 
sector 
reflected 
in 
high 
real lending 
interest 
rates; 
(ii) 
weak 
institutions; 
(iii) 
poor 
transport 
infrastructure; 
and 
(iv) 
lack 
of 
policy 
emphasis 
on 
export 
promotion. 
Indeed, 
recent 
growth 
studies 
on 
Bolivia 
point 
to 
external 
factors-such 
as 
external 
financing 
and terms 
of 
trade-and 
macroeconomic 
stability 
as 
key 
sources 
of 
growth, 
but 
they 
also 
highlight 
institutional 
factors 
such 
as 
the 
rule 
of 
law, property 
and 
creditors 
rights 
and 
widespread 
informality. 
By 
all 
measures, 
Bolivia 
ranks very 
poorly  on 
these 
institutional 
factors  that 
are 
direct 
hindrances 
to  private 
sector 
development. 
Private 
domestic investment 
had 
been 
low 
throughout most 
of 
the 
period 
prior to 
and 
after 
1998 
and 
was 
no 
more 
than 
US$54 
million 
(less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
in 
2002. 
Furthermore, 
between 
1985 
and 
1998 
exports grew 
by 
only 
70 
percent, 
while 
other countries 
in 
Latin 
America 
increased 
their 
exports 
by 
2.5 
times, 
and 
other 
developing 
countries 
more 
than 
trebled their 
exports. 
1.10 
Thus, 
it 
is 
Bolivia’s 
high 
vulnerability 
to 
external 
shocks and the 
absence 
of 
incentives 
for 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
develop 
in 
areas 
other than 
primary 
sectors 
that 
is 
the 
root 
cause 
of 
the current 
economic  crisis. 
Moreover, 
increasing 
informality 
of 
the  economy 
has 
reduced 
revenues  and 
weakened the 
fiscal 
stance. 
1.11 
Despite 
the 
deterioration 
of 
Bolivia’s 
economic  situation,  social 
indicators  continue 
to 
improve. International 
donor support 
has 
helped 
Bolivia 
face development challenges since 
the 
mid-1980s 
(see 
Box 
1 
for 
a summary 
of 
Bank 
assistance 
since 1986). 
Support 
has 
remained 
strong, 
as 
successive 
Governments 
have 
adopted 
multisectoral 
approaches 
to poverty 
reduction, increased 
the 
sectoral 
emphasis 
on 
performance  and 
results,  and 
have  elevated transparency 
and 
civic 
dialogue 
to high 
levels 
of 
priority.

1. 
World 
Bank Assistance 
since 
1986 
After 
a 
six-year 
interruption, 
the 
World 
Bank re-started 
its 
assistance 
to 
Bolivia 
in 
1986 
with 
support 
for 
the 
Government’s 
New 
Economic 
Policy. 
Over 
the 
next 
17 
years, 
Bank 
assistance 
increased 
with 
total 
disbursements 
reaching 
US$1.2 
billion 
over 
this 
period. 
The 
Bank’s 
early  (mid-1980s) 
strategy focused on 
restoring 
macroeconomic 
stability while 
helping 
to re-establish 
public 
and 
private productive activities 
(in 
mining, 
gas, 
and agro-based 
industries). 
During 
1986-1991, 
the 
Bank supported 
social 
protection 
programs--employment, income 
generation, 
and 
social 
assistance--aimed 
at 
attenuating 
the 
adverse 
effects 
of 
economic 
reforms. Bank 
assistance 
mobilized 
other external 
financing 
and 
supported 
Bolivia’s 
debt 
rescheduling. 
During 
the 
early 
1990s, 
IDA 
supported 
improvements 
in 
public 
sector 
financial 
management, tax 
reform 
implementation, 
restructuring public 
development 
banks,  and 
built 
the 
institutional 
structure 
for 
proper 
regulation 
(and 
supervision) 
of 
the 
financial 
system. 
Bank 
assistance 
during this period 
also 
focused 
on 
supporting social 
sector 
reforms. 
The 
transport 
sector also 
received 
important Bank 
assistance. 
During 
the 
mid-I990s, 
IDA 
organized 
a 
broad technical 
assistance 
program to 
support 
the 
capitalization 
of 
state-owned enterprises 
and 
to 
set 
up 
a 
proper regulatory 
framework. 
Support 
aimed 
at 
private 
sector 
development then started 
in 
1998 
due 
to 
recommendations 
made 
by 
OED. 
During 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
the 
Bank 
has 
helped 
the 
Government remove 
institutional 
weaknesses 
by 
supporting 
an 
institutional 
reform 
program 
and 
a 
decentralization 
process--while 
continuing 
to 
support 
health 
and 
education reforms, 
land administration 
and 
indigenous 
people development. 
The 
introduction 
of 
the 
CDF 
and the 
PRSP 
had 
important 
impacts 
on Bank 
assistance 
allowing 
for 
greater 
coordination 
of 
efforts 
among 
donors. 
Finally, 
throughout 
the 
current 
crisis, 
the 
Bank 
has 
supported 
the 
Government. 
Last 
year, the 
Bank disbursed 
almost 
twice 
as 
much 
as 
total private 
domestic 
investment. 
C. 
The 
Government’s Strategy 
1.12 
The 
Government 
aims 
to 
produce  rapid, 
visible 
economic  results 
to 
restore 
public 
confidence 
and 
to 
generate 
employment, 
while 
taking 
other 
steps 
to 
reduce 
social 
tensions. 
Their 
strategy 
has the 
following 
priorities: 
1.13 
Mitigating 
social tensions. 
To 
reduce 
social 
tensions, 
and 
with 
support 
from 
the 
Catholic 
Church 
and 
the 
Human 
Rights 
Assembly, 
the 
Government 
will 
work 
towards 
a 
National 
Agreement 
with 
political 
parties  and 
civil 
society 
organizations 
on 
sensitive 
issues  (coca 
production, 
salaries, 
land 
tenure, 
free 
trade 
agreements, 
natural 
gas 
policy, 
and 
the 
ruling 
economic 
model). 
A 
third 
National 
Dialogue 
is 
also 
planned 
for 
mid-2003 
in 
order 
to 
adjust 
Bolivia’s 
PRSP 
to 
give 
emphasis 
to 
the 
productive 
sector 
and 
the need 
for 
more efficiency 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
health 
and education 
services. 
The 
results 
of 
these 
two 
processes 
will 
be 
inputs 
for 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
development 
strategy 
for 
the 
next 
few 
years. 
The 
Government intends 
to 
present 
this 
strategy 
to 
the 
donor 
community 
in 
September 
2003 
during 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
Consultative 
Group. 
It 
will 
also 
introduce 
a results-based 
multi-year 
budget 
for 
the 
2004-2007 
period. 
1.14 
Strengthening 
the 
crisis 
response. 
An 
IMF 
stand-by 
agreement 
was agreed 
in 
April 
2003, 
and 
the 
National 
Congress 
approved 
the 2003 
budget 
soon 
thereafter. 
Favorable conditions 
under 
the  stand-by 
agreement 
allow 
for 
gradual 
fiscal 
adjustment. 
The 
budget  includes 
a 
10 
percent 
reduction 
in 
total 
current 
(and 
other non-prioritized) 
expenditures 
and 
a 
10 
percent 
increase 
in 
public 
investment 
to 
be 
re-allocated 
to 
the 
Obras 
con 
Empleo 
plan 
(short-term 
public 
sector 
programs 
in 
activities 
such 
as 
road 
construction, 
irrigation, 
rural 
electrification, 
public 
housing, 
and 
basic 
sanitation). 
Tax-raising 
measures 
such 
as 
restructuring 
the 
petroleum 
sector 
tax 
base 
and 
adjusting 
the 
tax 
law 
are 
included. Immediate productive 
sector 
actions 
are 
being 
identified to 
promote 
textile 
and 
wood 
exports. 
To 
mitigate 
the 
social 
impacts 
of 
the economic  slowdown, 
social 
safety 
net 
mechanisms 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place 
by 
continuing 
the  temporary 
emergency

employment 
program 
(PLANE) 
and 
reinstating bonosol 
retirement 
payments 
for 
those 
over 
age 
65. 
The  Government 
is 
actively 
considering  demand-side 
financing 
to 
reverse recent  declines 
in 
primary 
school 
enrollment 
and attendance 
among 
the 
poorest families,  and 
will 
introduce 
special 
travel 
allowances 
for 
the 
poor 
to visit 
remote 
health facilities, 
among 
other 
initiatives 
(see 
Section 
111). 
1.15 
Maintaining 
and 
enhancing confidence 
in 
the 
banking 
sector 
is 
a 
priority. 
Favorable 
conditions 
have 
been 
set 
for 
loan 
portfolio 
rescheduling, the 
loan prevision 
requirements 
have 
been 
reduced, 
and  the 
groundwork 
for 
increased 
banking 
sector 
efficiency 
has 
been 
prepared. 
A 
corporate  restructuring 
regime 
will 
be 
put 
in 
place and proper 
insolvency 
procedures 
will 
be 
established. 
Other 
initiatives 
are 
expected 
in 
the near 
future to 
re-program uncollected 
taxes 
and 
social security payments 
(for 
companies 
that 
defaulted before 
September 
2003), 
protect 
minority 
shareholder 
rights, and 
allow 
for 
the 
use 
of

Also, 
the 
Central 
Bank 
is 
clarifying 
the basis 
for 
its 
liquidity 
support 
for 
and 
regulation 
of 
insolvent 
banks. 
1.16 
Foundations 
for 
medium-term, pro-poor 
growth. 
The 
Government‘s 
medium-term 
strategy 
aims 
at 
generating  pro-poor, 
sustained 
growth  while 
restoring 
a 
sustainable 
path 
for 
fiscal 
accounts. 
A 
performance 
agreement 
approach 
is 
being 
designed 
within 
the PRSP 
framework 
to 
reach 
measurable 
indicators 
in 
14 
productive 
chains. 
This 
approach 
will 
also 
be 
used 
to 
improve 
the 
delivery 
of 
social 
services 
mainly 
in 
areas 
related 
to 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs), 
such 
as 
maternal 
and 
infant 
mortality 
and 
primary 
education. 
Financing 
mechanisms 
to 
carry out 
this 
results-based approach 
are 
also 
being 
developed. The Government 
has 
announced a 
second 
stage 
of 
the 
Popular 
Participation 
program to 
enhance 
participation 
in 
the 
policy-making 
process 
while 
providing 
municipalities 
with 
greater 
fiscal 
autonomy 
and 
enhanced 
accountability 
mechanisms. 
New 
initiatives 
to 
deal 
with 
corruption 
are 
also 
expected 
including police 
reform. 
However, 
the 
Government’s 
weak 
political 
position 
poses 
an obstacle 
to 
carrying 
out 
a 
new 
gas 
export 
project, 
which would 
generate 
substantial 
revenues 
for 
the 
state. 
D. 
World 
Bank 
Strategy 
1.17 
The 
World 
Bank 
strategy 
to 
help 
Bolivia 
has 
two 
components: 
(i) 
provide 
a “bridge” 
to 
recovery 
in 
2003 
by 
helping 
the 
Government 
maintain 
economic 
and 
social 
stability 
until 
it 
can 
propose a 
viable 
medium-term 
development 
strategy; 
and 
(ii) 
pursue 
medium 
term development 
objectives 
including 
preparation 
of 
the 
Country 
Assistance  Strategy  (CAS) 
based 
on 
the 
Government’s 
revisions 
to 
the 
PRSP.

will 
aim 
to 
disburse 
at

Help 
the

of 
bilateral

There 
are 
approximately 
US$1.6

in 
un-disbursed 
project 
funds 
with 
a 
yearly 
flow 
of 
US$700

expected over 
the 
next 
four

These 
resources can 
be 
better 
aligned 
to

for 
more 
rapid 
disbursement, 
through  restructuring 
of 
donor  support, 
which 
will 
be 
discussed 
at 
the 
next 
CG 
meeting. 
To 
continue with 
medium-term 
development 
objectives 
the 
Bank 
and 
IDA 
propose to: 
Present 
the 
second phase 
of 
a 
Decentralization 
PSAC 
(US$25 
million 
IDA 
credit; 
June 
2003) 
to 
deepen 
reforms 
and 
address 
muncipal  fiscal 
problems. 
Municipalities 
have 
become 
important 
actors 
in 
the 
PRSP-implementation 
process. 
Present 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
an 
Investment 
APL 
(US$20 
million 
IDA 
credit; 
June 
20031 
to 
increase 
electrification 
and 
telecommunication 
in 
rural 
areas. 
It 
will 
develop 
policies to 
accelerate coverage. 
Prepare 
a 
PER 
to 
discuss 
with 
the 
Government 
by 
August 
2003. 
It 
will 
include 
an analysis 
of 
fiscal 
sustainability 
of 
existing 
reforms 
and 
of 
debt, 
as 
well 
as 
efficiency 
analysis 
of 
sector 
expenditures. 
Update 
the 
2001 
Poverty 
Report 
to 
include 
an 
expanded treatment 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
generating 
pro-poor 
growth 
and 
an 
analysis 
of 
crisis 
impacts. 
Prepare the 
CAS 
based 
on 
the 
Government’s  PRSP 
revisions 
(with 
input 
from 
the 
third 
National 
Dialogue), 
and 
present 
it 
with 
a PRSC 
as 
early 
as 
October 
2003. 
The 
PRSC 
will 
focus 
on: 
(i) 
measures 
to 
promote 
pro-poor 
growth; 
(ii) 
achievement 
of 
MDGs; 
and 
(iii) 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
PRSP 
with 
a heavy focus 
on 
tracking 
results. 
1.20 
Other 
multilateral 
donors 
intend to 
align 
resources 
around 
the 
revised 
PRSP 
and 
will 
plan 
the 
mobilization 
of 
fast-disbursing 
money over 
the 
coming 
months. 
But 
disbursements 
are 
unlikely 
to 
increase 
significantly 
in 
the 
short-term. 
Bilateral 
donors 
will 
also 
move 
to 
support 
the 
third 
National 
Dialogue. 
The 
Bank 
will 
support 
these processes 
through 
the 
dissemination 
of 
relevant 
material 
(based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the

Country 
Risks 
1.21 
The 
political, 
economic, and 
social 
situation 
is 
volatile, 
and 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that an 
unexpected event 
could 
send 
Bolivia 
into 
a 
downward 
spiral. 
Also, 
factions 
within 
the 
opposition 
could 
try 
to 
force 
a Government 
change 
before 
elections. There 
is 
also 
a 
risk 
that 
the 
time 
needed 
to 
address 
problems 
will 
be 
absorbed 
by 
disagreements 
within 
the 
governing 
coalition 
and 
by 
responses 
to 
further 
rounds 
of 
protest 
or 
unrest. 
The 
risks 
increase 
if 
the 
economic situation 
deteriorates and 
no 
adequate 
social safety net 
is 
in 
place. 
The 
strategy 
thus 
assumes 
that 
the 
costs 
of 
helping 
to 
avert a 
deeper 
crisis 
by 
taking 
actions 
now, 
within 
a concerted 
donor effort, 
will 
be 
substantially 
lower 
than 
the cost 
of 
helping 
Bolivia 
recover 
from 
a 
steep 
decline.

responsiveness 
over 
the 
bridging 
period. 
While 
country 
risks 
are 
elevated, 
Bolivia’s 
assets, 
as 
noted 
earlier, 
are 
substantial. 
A 
rebound 
in 
Argentina 
and 
Brazil, 
an 
increasingly 
hopeful 
scenario, 
will 
generate 
jobs 
and

Section 
V. 
11. 
RATIONALE 
AND 
FRAMEWORK FOR 
THE 
PROPOSED 
CREDIT 
A. 
Rationale 
2.1 
The 
most 
telling 
measures 
of 
Bolivia’s 
current 
crisis 
are 
in 
the 
persistence 
of 
negative 
per 
capita 
income 
growth, especially 
in 
urban 
areas, 
high 
and increasing 
levels 
of 
unemployment 
and 
underemployment, 
and 
increases 
in 
poverty 
incidence 
(see 
Annex 
3). 
2.2 
Given 
the 
accumulation 
of 
effects over 
several 
years, 
the 
social impacts 
of 
the 
crisis 
in 
Bolivia 
can be 
expected 
to 
move 
beyond 
short 
term coping 
and 
into 
more 
structural 
responses at 
the 
household level, 
such 
as 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
use 
of 
more 
costly social 
services 
or 
engaging 
the 
whole family, 
including 
children, 
in 
the 
search 
for 
income. 
2.3 
To 
date, 
preliminary 
evidence 
is 
showing 
that there 
is 
modest 
deterioration 
in 
primary 
school 
enrollment 
and 
attendance 
among 
the 
poorest 
families, 
within 
an 
overall 
pattern 
of 
improving 
enrollment  and 
attendance 
performance, 
between 
2000  and 
2002. 
The 
poorest 
20 
percent 
of 
Bolivian 
families 
are 
apparently 
losing 
hard 
won 
gains 
in 
enrollment 
achieved 
during 
the 
1990s. 
About 
4,200 
did 
not 
enroll 
in 
2001 
and 
as 
many 
as 
9,400 
may 
have 
left 
school 
during 
the 
year. 
If 
current 
trends 
continue, 
more poor 
children 
will 
drop out 
of 
school 
each year. 
This 
may 
be 
linked 
to 
sharp 
declines 
in 
average 
incomes among the 
lowest 
deciles 
in 
rural 
areas 
over 
the 
same 
period. 
Similarly, 
there 
is 
some 
limited, 
recent 
evidence 
of 
poor 
families 
cashing 
in 
their 
assets 
compared 
to 
earlier 
years 
(see 
Annex 
3). 
However, 
due 
to 
the 
substantial 
reform 
and 
public 
expenditure 
efforts  over 
the 
past 
10 
years, 
most  social  indicators, 
such 
as 
child 
mortality, 
communicable 
disease 
incidence, 
and 
primary 
completion 
rates, 
have 
improved 
through 
2001. 
2.4 
Equally 
important 
are 
the 
potential 
effects 
of 
the 
social crisis 
on 
the 
momentum 
for 
reform 
and 
on 
the 
social 
consensus 
regarding 
its 
benefits. 
Sustaining the 
reform 
momentum 
under 
such 
conditions 
and 
maintaining 
expenditure 
levels 
for 
key 
social 
safety 
net 
programs 
are 
challenges the 
Government 
has  embraced, 
and 
for 
which 
it 
is 
seeking 
financial 
support. 
2.5 
Budget 
management 
under 
present circumstances 
will 
be 
an 
important 
determinant 
of 
the 
Government’s 
success 
in 
managing 
the 
crisis 
and 
in 
communicating 
its 
priorities 
to 
social 
constituencies 
in 
distress. 
Key 
social  investment 
programs, 
more 
volatile 
in 
their 
budgeted 
amounts 
historically, 
must 
be 
protected. 
End 
of 
budget year 
pressures 
to 
reallocate social 
program 
budgets 
to 
other urgent programs 
must 
be 
contained. 
Counter-cyclical 
social budget 
allocations,  a 
prominent 
feature 
of 
the 
revised 
2003 
public 
investment 
budget, 
need 
to 
be 
protected, 
and 
their 
effective 
expenditure 
though 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fiscal 
year guaranteed. 
In 
this 
way, 
the Government 
intends 
to 
demonstrate 
its 
continuing commitment 
to 
pro-poor 
budgets 
and 
expenditure, 
while 
sustaining 
key 
social reforms, 
such 
as 
the 
temporary  emergency 
workfare program 
PLANE, 
the 
Mother 
and 
Child 
Insurance 
Program 
(SUMI), 
and 
investments 
in 
educational 
reform 
and 
infrastructure.

2.6 
The efficiency 
and effectiveness 
of 
Bolivia’s 
social 
sector 
programs have been 
improving 
since the  1990s, 
by 
virtue 
of 
sustained 
reform 
efforts 
in 
health 
and education, 
the 
increasing 
local 
accountability 
for 
services, 
and 
the 
growing 
voice  and 
empowerment 
of 
the 
poor. 
These 
improvements 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
outcome 
and 
impact 
indicators 
that 
have 
shown 
such 
sustained 
improvement  over 
the 
last 
10 
years. 
These 
improvements 
have  been  supported 
by 
substantial 
increases 
in 
public 
expenditure 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
both 
in 
real 
terms 
and 
in 
terms 
of 
proportion 
of 
the 
overall 
budget. 
To 
better 
measure 
and 
assess 
these 
gains, the 
Government 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Bank 
and 
IDB 
is 
preparing 
a 
public 
expenditure 
review 
that 
will 
address 
in 
greater 
depth 
questions 
regarding 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
2.7 
There 
is 
little 
doubt 
on 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
advance 
in 
social indicators. 
Child 
mortality 
has 
been 
halved 
since 1989. 
The 
health 
reform 
in 
the 
last 
years 
has 
produced significant 
increases 
in 
coverage 
of 
priority 
health 
services 
such 
as 
attended 
deliveries 
(from 
25 percent 
in 
1994 
to 
54 
percent 
in 
2002) 
and immunizations (DPT3 
going 
up 
from 
78 
percent 
in 
1994 
to 
100 
percent 
in 
2002), 
thanks 
to 
new 
policies 
such 
as 
the 
public 
insurance 
schemes, 
performance 
agreements 
between 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
its  local 
health 
service 
offices, 
and 
the 
distribution 
of 
additional 
human 
resources 
mainly 
in 
rural 
areas 
(see 
Annex 
6). 
2.8 
Educational 
reform 
has 
improved 
the 
quality 
of 
primary 
education  and 
increased 
pre- 
primary 
attendance, 
by 
changing 
primary 
curricula, 
restructuring 
of 
the 
national 
educational 
system, 
strengthening 
of 
central 
administration 
and 
decentralization 
of 
management 
to 
municipalities, 
and 
by 
expanding 
community participation 
in 
the 
educational 
process. 
The 
gross 
coverage 
of 
public 
primary 
education, 
that 
in 
the 
early 
90s 
ranged 
from 
60 
percent 
in 
rural 
areas 
to 
87 
percent 
in 
urban 
areas, 
has 
reached 
100 
percent 
nationally. 
The 
internal 
efficiency 
of 
the 
public 
school system 
has 
also 
improved 
considerably; between 
1997 
to 
2000, the average 
number 
of 
years 
required 
to 
complete 
grade 5 
has 
been reduced 
from 
11 
years 
to 
7 
years 
(see 
Annex 
7). 
2.9 
These 
achievements 
attest 
to 
the 
underlying 
effectiveness 
of 
reforms 
and expenditures 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
Certainly, 
there 
is 
substantial 
scope 
for 
improvement over 
the 
medium 
term, 
but 
the 
proposed 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural 
Adjustment  Credit 
is 
motivated 
in 
part 
by 
Bolivia’s 
strong outcome  performance 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
the 
improvements 
in 
efficiency  and 
program 
effectiveness 
already attained 
in 
these sectors, 
and 
the 
opportunity 
to 
support 
key 
reform 
programs, 
and 
in 
some 
areas 
strengthen 
them,  at  a 
time 
of 
heightened 
risk 
to 
their  performance 
and 
financing. 
2.10 
The 
international 
cooperation 
community 
has 
been 
active 
in 
putting 
together 
elements 
of 
the 
fiscal 
and 
social 
packages 
in 
support 
of 
the 
Government. 
An 
IMF 
stand-by 
agreement 
is 
in 
place, 
and 
bilateral 
donors have 
committed 
resources 
to 
budget support 
and 
safety 
net 
activities. 
The 
proposed 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
is 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
this 
broader 
effort. 
2.11 
The 
proposed 
credit 
therefore helps 
the 
Government 
establish 
a 
bridge 
through 
the 
current 
crisis. 
The 
Government 
will 
be 
supported 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
stabilize 
its 
fiscal 
situation,  strengthen 
safety 
net 
and 
pro-poor  social 
programs, 
and  signal 
the 
continuation 
of 
its 
existing 
reforms. 
Through 
these 
efforts 
the 
Government 
hopes 
to 
defuse 
social 
tensions, 
and 
to 
contain 
any 
further 
erosion 
in 
social indicators. 
The time horizon 
is 
near 
term, 
over 
a 
transition 
period 
of 
9-10 
months, 
during 
which 
stability, 
both 
social and 
fiscal, 
can 
be 
restored, 
and 
the 
foundation 
for 
a 
resumption 
8 
Page  19
of 
medium 
term 
reform 
efforts put 
in 
place. 
The 
Bank 
will 
be 
engaged 
over 
the 
period 
through 
intensive 
supervision 
activities 
of 
social safety net programs 
and 
of 
budget 
management. 
B. 
Social 
Risk 
Management 
Framework 
2.12 
As 
a 
low-income 
country 
with 
high 
poverty 
incidence, 
Bolivia 
faces 
fiscal 
constraints 
in 
its 
management 
of 
social 
risk 
and 
its 
specific 
safety 
net programs. 
Within 
the range 
of 
risks 
that 
poor 
Bolivian 
families 
face, 
this 
Government and 
its 
predecessors 
have focused 
their 
efforts 
on four 
areas. 
The discussion 
below 
summarizes  the 
evidence 
on 
social 
risks 
in 
each and 
the 
arguments 
for 
inclusion 
of 
different 
programs 
within 
the 
budget 
protection 
component 
of 
the 
proposed credit. 
2.13 
Health 
care 
risks 
for 
mothers  and 
children 
have  received 
increasing  attention 
within 
Bolivia’s 
health policies. 
Risks 
of 
premature 
mortality 
due 
to 
preventable 
childhood 
diseases 
and 
complications 
from 
childbirth 
are 
the 
focal point 
of 
both 
the 
maternal 
and 
infant 
health 
insurance 
program 
(SUMI), 
the 
Epidemiologic  Shield 
Program, 
the 
Health 
Reform 
Program, 
and the 
Expanded Zmmunization 
Program 
(PAI). 
These 
programs 
have 
helped 
improve 
both 
child 
and 
maternal 
mortality 
rates 
in 
Bolivia. 
2.14 
The 
risk 
of 
non 
attendance  at 
primary 
school 
level 
is 
a 
core 
consideration 
in 
social 
protection 
policies. 
Primary 
school 
enrollment 
and 
attendance 
risks 
in 
Bolivia 
have been 
the 
focal 
point 
of 
education 
policy 
since the 
launch 
of 
the 
reform 
era 
in 
the 
early 
1990s, 
with 
impressive 
results. 
Net primary 
enrollment 
and attendance 
levels 
have shown improvements, even 
during 
the 
crisis 
period, 
rising 
to 
88 
percent overall. 
(see 
Annex 
3). 
However, 
families 
in 
the 
poorest 
quintile 
are 
experiencing a 
modest 
decline 
in 
both 
indicators, 
pointing 
to 
the 
accumulating 
effects 
of 
the 
prolonged 
economic downturn. 
2.15 
Higher 
risk 
of 
unemployment 
or 
severe 
underemployment 
for 
working-age 
poor 
has 
been 
the 
most 
pronounced 
impact 
of 
the 
prolonged 
slump 
in 
per 
capita 
incomes, 
primarily 
in 
the 
cities 
where most 
Bolivians 
live. 
As 
recent performance 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
its 
social impacts show 
(Annex 
3), 
unemployment 
has 
increased steadily 
since 
1999 
from 
6.1 percent and reached 
9.4 
percent 
in 
major 
urban 
areas 
in 
2001. 
Preliminary indications 
from 
the 
2002 
national 
household 
survey show a 
slight 
decrease 
in 
unemployment 
rate 
due 
to 
lower labor 
force 
participation 
and 
possibly 
last 
year’s 
emergency 
employment 
program (PLANE). 
2.16 
The 
risk 
of 
inadequate 
income 
in 
old 
age 
has 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
important  program 
reforms 
in 
the 
pension 
system, 
and 
elderly 
Bolivians 
also 
benefit 
from 
a 
parallel program 
of 
cash 
transfers, 
known 
as 
BONOSOL. 
Both 
the 
reformed contributory 
pension 
scheme 
(individual 
retirement 
accounts)  and  the 
cash 
transfer 
scheme, 
BONOSOL, 
are 
financed 
outside 
of 
the 
Government 
budget, and 
are 
thus 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
specific budget 
protection 
interventions. 
The combined 
pension 
system, 
including BONOSOL, 
the 
new funded 
scheme 
and the 
former pay- 
as-you-go 
scheme 
are 
being 
analyzed 
intensively 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
IDB, 
to 
prepare 
for 
medium 
term 
reform 
discussions.

THE 
PROPOSED 
CREDIT 
A. 
Objectives 
of 
the 
Credit 
3.1 
a 
two 
tranche 
credit 
intended 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
March 
2004, 
is 
a 
critical 
part 
of 
IDA’S 
immediate 
response package 
to 
the 
current social 
and 
economic  crisis 
in 
Bolivia. 
The 
credit 
supports 
the Government’s 
near 
term 
program 
of 
fiscal 
adjustment and 
provision 
of 
vital 
social 
safety 
net 
services. 
The credit 
thus 
will 
help 
the 
Government 
to 
close 
a 
financing 
gap 
in 
2003, 
to 
expand 
the 
provision 
of 
key 
social 
services 
during 
this 
period 
of 
fiscal 
adjustment, 
to 
contain erosion 
in 
social 
outcomes 
for 
the 
poor, 
and 
to 
address 
the 
economic underpinnings 
of 
rising 
social 
tensions. 
The 
proposed 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit, 
3.2 
The 
credit 
is 
structured 
to 
sustain 
and, 
where 
appropriate,  advance 
the 
major 
reform 
initiatives 
of 
this 
Government 
and 
its 
predecessors 
in 
the 
specific 
areas 
of 
emerging 
employment 
(workfare), 
decentralization 
and 
municipal 
development; 
mother 
and 
child 
insurance, 
and 
health 
program 
decentralization;  education 
reform 
and 
the 
expansion 
of 
primary 
education; 
and 
national 
budget 
management 
for 
increasing 
social 
sector 
expenditures 
and 
their counter-cyclical 
content. 
Specifically, 
the 
credit 
will: 
a) 
Protect 
the 
budgets 
of 
nine key 
programs 
in 
social 
protection 
(workfare),  health, 
and 
education, 
that 
are 
subject 
to 
high 
volatility 
in 
budgets 
and 
expenditure 
execution 
and 
are 
key to 
the 
containment 
of 
further 
erosion 
of 
social outcomes 
and 
achievement 
of 
counter-cyclical 
goals 
of 
the 
2003 
budget. 
The 
protected programs 
include 
the 
PLANE 
program 
of 
workfare; 
the 
Epidemiological 
Shield, 
Expanded Immunization, 
the 
Health 
Reform 
Program, 
and Maternal 
and 
Child 
Insurance 
in 
the 
health 
sector; 
and 
the 
Education 
Nucleus 
Subprojects 
and 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
in 
the education 
sector. 
b) 
Sustain 
and, 
in 
some 
areas, 
strengthen 
key 
social sector 
reforms 
that 
are 
pro-poor 
and 
provide 
safety 
net 
services. 
These 
include: 
actions 
to 
enhance the 
performance 
of 
PLANE 
11; 
a 
new 
initiative 
at 
the 
Fondo Nacional 
de 
Inversi6n 
Productiva 
y 
Social 
(FPS) 
to 
develop 
a 
more 
agile 
and responsive 
employment  orientation 
in 
crisis 
periods 
in 
the 
social 
protection 
sector; 
the 
improvement 
of 
health 
service 
delivery 
performance 
at 
the 
departmental 
(regional) 
level; 
provision 
of 
travel 
reimbursements 
to 
the 
poor 
for 
visits 
to 
distant 
health facilities; 
a 
new 
legal framework 
to 
empower 
women 
and indigenous 
people; 
a 
new 
education 
sector  strategy  that 
will 
coalesce 
donor 
and 
country 
support 
for 
educational 
reform;  and 
an urgent 
analysis 
and options 
paper 
on 
the 
recent evidence that 
enrollment 
and 
attendance 
of 
children 
from 
the 
poorest 
20 
percent have 
been 
in 
decline 
over 
the 
last 
two 
years. 
c) 
Provide 
technical 
support over the 
bridging 
period 
(June 
2003 to 
March 
2004) 
in 
key 
social safety 
net 
areas 
so 
that such 
programs 
as 
PLANE 
and 
SUM1 
and 
new 
interventions 
in 
health 
and 
education 
(travel 
reimbursements 
and  school 
attendance 
interventions) 
benefit 
from 
international 
perspectives 
and 
advice, 
and 
that 
the budget 
protection 
purposes 
of 
the 
credit, 
through 
end-of-year 
execution, 
are 
well 
supported.

B. 
Credit 
Issues 
and 
Actions 
3.3 
The 
proposed 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
SAC 
contains 
a 
set 
of 
actions  that 
are 
summarized 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
(Annex 
1) 
and the 
Matrix 
of 
Agreed 
Actions 
(Annex 
2). 
The 
agreed 
actions 
are 
separated 
into 
four 
component 
areas: 
Budget 
Process; 
Social Protection 
(Employment); 
Health; and 
Education. 
The 
first 
section 
on 
budget 
process 
contains general 
and specific 
budget 
protection 
actions. 
For 
each 
of 
the three 
sectoral 
areas, 
there 
are 
steps 
to 
sustain 
and 
in 
some 
cases 
strengthen 
key 
social 
sector 
reforms.  Annexes 
4, 
5, 
6 
and 
7 
contain more detailed 
discussion 
of 
each 
area. 
The 
component 
areas 
are 
briefly 
discussed 
in 
the subsections 
that 
follow. 
1. 
Budget 
Protection 
3.4 
The 
credit 
provides 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
2003 
budget levels 
for 
specific social 
programs, 
selected 
according 
to 
explicit 
criteria, 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
release 
of 
a 
first 
tranche 
of 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Credit. 
These 
criteria allowed 
for 
the 
inclusion 
of 
nine 
separate 
programs, 
and 
the 
exclusion 
of 
several 
other 
candidate 
programs. The 
credit 
also 
sets 
minimum 
budget 
execution 
amounts 
for 
each 
program 
as 
a 
condition 
for 
release 
of 
a 
second 
tranche 
of 
the 
credit. 
Annex 
4 
sets 
out 
the 
full 
discussion 
and 
analysis 
of 
Bolivia’s 
budget 
processes 
and 
outcomes, 
and 
the 
criteria 
for 
selecting programs 
within 
the 
SAC, 
here 
summarized 
as 
follows: 
Existing 
programs 
with 
counter-cyclical 
performance potential; 
Programs 
with 
financial 
or 
in-kind 
benefits 
that protect incomes 
or 
develop 
human 
capital; 
Programs that 
demonstrate 
good targeting 
performance 
to 
the 
poor 
and 
vulnerable; 
Programs 
of 
sufficient 
scale 
within 
the 
national 
budget 
to 
reach 
significant 
numbers 
of 
beneficiaries; 
and 
Programs 
within 
the 
national 
budget, 
the 
execution 
of 
which 
can 
be 
readily 
verified. 
3.5 
The 
justification for 
protecting 
the 
nine 
programs 
is 
based 
on 
several 
considerations. 
An 
analysis 
of 
Bolivia’s 
budgeting 
and 
budget 
execution 
performance 
since 
1995 
(Annex 
4) 
shows 
that social 
sector budgets 
and 
execution 
are 
volatile, 
tend 
to 
be 
cut 
in 
periods 
of 
low 
revenues, 
and 
thus 
tend 
to 
vary positively 
(pro-cyclical 
pattern) 
with 
changes 
in 
per 
capita 
GNP. 
Moreover, 
in 
times 
of 
a 
fixed 
budget 
ceiling, 
such 
tendencies 
are 
accentuated. These 
patterns 
are 
in 
part 
due 
to 
rigidity within 
the 
overall public 
expenditure framework, 
which 
focuses 
the adjustment 
process 
on 
a 
few 
items 
of 
the budget 
containing 
local 
resources. 
These 
fall 
into 
the 
public 
investment 
category 
where  social  expenditures  occupy 
a 
prominent 
position. 
The 
nine 
selected 
programs  show 
historically 
higher 
than 
average 
levels 
of 
budget 
volatility.  Given 
these 
patterns, 
the 
risk 
of 
disruptions 
in 
social 
spending, even 
within 
an 
overall 
increase 
in 
public 
investment 
in 
the 
2003 
budget 
compared 
to 
last 
year, 
is 
a 
serious 
concern and 
has 
guided 
the 
design 
of 
the 
credit’s 
provisions 
for 
budget 
protection 
and 
minimum 
floors 
of 
budget execution. 
3.6 
The 
agreed 
budget 
protection 
amounts 
for 
each 
program 
(Table 
1 
below) 
constitute 
prior 
actions 
for 
the 
release 
of 
the 
first 
tranche 
of 
US$25.0 
million. 
Budget execution 
floors 
for 
each 
program 
also 
appear 
in 
the 
same 
table, 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
the 
protected 
US 
dollar 
amount 
in 
column 
one. 
Arrangements 
for 
release 
of 
the 
second 
tranche 
in 
regard 
to 
budget 
execution contain 
some 
flexibility 
to 
allow for 
unexpected 
program 
contingencies. Therefore, 
aggregate 
execution 
for 
all 
nine 
programs 
must 
reach 
85 
percent 
of 
the 
aggregate 
protected amount 
(2 
percent 
less 
than the 
sum 
of 
each 
program 
floor), 
and 
seven 
of 
the 
nine 
protected programs 
must 
reach 
their 
individual 
11 
Page  22
execution 
floors. 
This 
design 
still 
provides 
incentives 
for  individual 
programs 
to 
reach 
their 
execution 
floors, 
while 
allowing, 
realistically, 
for 
minor 
shortfalls 
in 
two 
of 
the 
nine 
programs.

Employment 
and 
Workfare 
Programs 
3.7 
The 
National 
Plan 
for 
Emergency 
Einployment 
(PLANE) 
was 
established 
late 
in 
2001. 
In 
its 
iirst 
phase 
over 
the 
course 
of 
2002, 
this 
workfare  program 
disbursed 
US$26.0 
million 
while 
creating  over 
3 
70,OO 
person-months 
of 
employment 
that 
helped 
implement  over 
4,400 
basic 
maintenance 
projects, 
mostly 
with 
tertiary 
roads 
and 
streets. 
Over 
half 
the 
beneficiaries 
were 
~vomen, 
all 
unskilled 
workers received 
the 
same 
wage 
of 
approximately 
480 
Bolivianos 
per 
month 
12 
Page  23
(about 
US$60) 
which 
is 
just 
above 
the 
minimum 
wage 
but 
below 
average 
wages 
paid to 
the 
poorest 
two 
quintiles 
of 
unskilled 
workers, 
and 
which 
under 
PLANE 
I 
assured 
a strong 
pro-poor 
targeting 
performance. 
The targeting 
performance 
was 
analyzed 
as 
part 
of 
a recent 
evaluation 
of 
PLANE 
I. 
3.8 
The 
administrative 
structure 
of 
PLANE 
I 
in 
2002 
included 
an 
innovative 
system 
for 
contracting: 
(i) 
the 
overall 
administration 
of 
the 
program 
to 
a 
lead 
contractor 
(GTZ); 
(ii) 
the 
labor 
registration 
and  assignment 
activities, 
to 
local 
micro 
credit 
organizations; 
and 
(iii) 
works 
supervision 
to local 
firms. 
The Government had 
initially 
decided 
to 
shelve 
the 
program 
for 
2003, 
and 
the 
entire 
PLANE 
I 
team 
was 
disbanded. 
Renewal 
of 
PLANE 
I1 
was 
accomplished 
quickly, 
following 
the 
same 
contracting 
process, 
and 
using 
most 
of 
the 
first 
year’s 
implementation 
arrangements. 
This 
experience 
thus 
established 
the 
agility 
and 
temporary nature 
of 
the 
program 
and 
qualified 
it 
as 
an 
innovative 
counter-cyclical 
instrument. 
3.9 
Preparation 
of 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
and agreement 
on 
an 
envelope 
of 
guaranteed resources 
for 
PLANE 
has 
played 
an 
important 
role, 
in 
concert 
with 
the 
deepening 
crisis, 
of 
reviving 
PLANE 
for 
a 
second 
year 
of 
implementation 
(See 
Annex 
5 
for 
details).  The design 
of PLANE 
I1 
has 
followed 
the 
successful 
arrangements 
of 
PLANE 
I 
in 
most 
respects. 
A 
new lead 
contractor 
has 
been 
selected 
(UNDP) 
as 
well 
as 
the 
organizations 
to 
register 
and 
assign 
labor 
and 
to 
supervise 
projects. 
PLANE 
I1 
will 
finance 
only 
labor 
costs 
at 
the 
PLANE 
wage rate, 
and 
municipalities 
and 
local 
community 
groups 
will 
provide 
the 
necessary 
material 
and 
equipment 
to 
carry  out 
the 
maintenance activities. 
PLANE 
I1 
will 
place 
more 
emphasis 
on 
municipal responsibility 
for 
coordinating 
execution and 
making 
available 
counterpart 
for 
projects 
proposed 
by 
community 
groups. 
Encouraged 
by 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
proposed 
credit 
and 
with 
new 
assurances 
from 
the 
Government 
of 
adequate 
financial 
resources 
to 
complement  donor 
contributions, 
the 
parent  organization, 
el 
Directorio 
Unico 
de 
Fondos 
(DUF), 
and  the 
lead 
contractor 
(UNDP) 
launched 
the 
first 
registration 
of 
workers, 
the 
first 
call 
for 
projects, 
and the 
approval and 
implementation 
of 
the 
first 
round 
of 
activities 
in 
late 
March 
2003. 
In 
addition, 
the 
efforts 
of 
PLANE 
I 
to 
link 
its 
road 
maintenance 
activities 
to 
longer 
term 
road 
maintenance 
reform 
will 
be 
on 
the 
agenda 
for 
PLANE 
I1 
and any 
successor 
program. 
3.10 
Other actions 
agreed 
with 
the 
Government 
are 
that 
the 
implementation 
arrangements 
for 
PLANE 
I1 
be 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank, 
with 
specific 
attention 
to 
project 
eligibility, 
project 
approval, 
the 
wage rate, 
and 
transparency arrangements. 
Also 
agreed 
is 
that a second 
evaluation 
of 
PLANE, 
building on 
the 
well 
designed 
evaluation 
of 
PLANE 
I, 
will 
be 
launched 
with 
agreed 
terms 
of 
reference and 
a progress 
report submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
second 
tranche 
release. 
Similarly 
a 
signed 
contract 
for 
a 
financial 
audit 
of 
PLANE 
I1 
are 
among 
second 
tranche conditions. 
3.11 
Within 
the 
DUF, 
both 
PLANE 
and 
the FPS 
(National Social 
and 
Public 
Investment 
Fund) 
are 
assigned 
distinctive 
and 
complementary  roles 
in 
regard 
to 
support 
for 
municipal 
and 
local 
development. 
FPS 
provides 
grants 
for 
municipal 
investment 
projects, 
within 
an 
overall 
municipal 
financing 
and 
decentralization framework, 
while 
PLANE 
is 
designed 
as 
a temporary  program, 
focused 
narrowly on 
labor 
intensive 
maintenance and 
repair 
of 
existing 
assets 
and investments. 
The 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
SAC 
includes 
some 
changes 
in 
FPS procedures and 
planning 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
a 
faster 
flow 
of 
investment 
resources 
to municipalities, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
implementation 
of 
already 
agreed 
lower 
cash 
counterpart 
requirements 
from 
municipal 
Governments 
within 
FPS 
supported projects. 
In 
addition, 
FPS 
will 
investigate the 
viability 
of 
a temporary 
crisis 
window 
of 
13 
Page  24
financing 
for 
more 
labor 
intensive investment 
projects, 
so 
as 
to 
encourage 
municipal 
preparation 
of 
such 
projects 
within 
the FPS 
domain 
of 
local 
public 
investment 
in 
times 
of 
crisis.

Health 
Services 
3.12 
Providing 
services 
for 
the 
health and 
well-being 
of 
the 
population 
is 
a 
high 
priority 
for 
the 
Government, 
especially 
services 
targeted 
at 
the 
poorest 
population 
living 
in 
remote 
areas. 
The 
Government 
has  selected 
for 
protection 
by 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net  SAC 
only 
those 
programs 
considered 
crucial 
for 
attaining 
the 
following  policy 
goals: 
health 
sector 
reform 
(including 
Extensa), 
epidemiological 
shield, 
expanded 
immunization 
(PAI), 
and 
universal 
mother-child 
insurance 
(SUMI). 
These 
programs 
are 
aimed 
at 
poor 
beneficiaries 
and 
have been 
associated 
with 
consistent 
improvements 
in 
overall 
health 
sector 
outcomes. 
Attended 
deliveries, 
for 
example, 
have 
risen 
from 
25 
percent 
of 
total 
births 
in 
1994 
to 
54 
percent 
in 
2001. 
For 
a 
more detailed 
discussion 
of 
the 
sector 
and 
the 
content 
of 
the 
Health 
component 
within 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
SAC, 
see 
Annex 
6. 
Table 
1 
above shows the 
budget 
protection and 
budget execution floors. 
3.13 
The 
protected programs 
in 
health display 
a 
strong 
reform 
and 
pro-poor 
orientation. 
Within 
the Healthcare 
Reform 
program, 
protected under 
the 
Credit, 
the 
Extensa 
project 
supports 
mobile 
brigades 
and 
community 
workers 
to 
deliver 
basic healthcare 
services 
to 
the 
poorest 
populations. 
Other activities 
supported 
under 
the 
Healthcare 
Reform 
Program 
are 
immunizations, 
information 
system 
improvements,  and 
support 
to 
the 
national 
public 
health 
programs. 
The Epidemiological 
Shield 
(escudo 
epidemio16gico7 
EE) 
will 
keep endemic 
diseases 
under 
control 
and 
strengthen 
the 
disease 
surveillance 
system 
especially 
for 
chagas, 
malaria, 
tuberculosis, 
dengue 
fever, 
leishmaniasis, 
and 
hemorrhagic 
fever. 
These  are 
the 
most 
important 
communicable 
disease 
problems 
in 
the 
country, and 
sustaining 
prevention 
and 
control 
measures 
within 
such 
programs 
are 
a 
fundamental 
policy 
choice 
during 
times 
of 
fiscal 
stress. 
Universal mother-child 
health 
insurance 
(SUMI), 
created 
by 
Law 
No. 
2426 
in 
November 
2002, 
is 
national 
in 
coverage, 
non-contributory, 
and 
consistent 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
National 
Short 
Term 
Social 
Security 
System. 
SUMI 
protects 
women 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
pregnancy 
until 
six 
months after 
delivery, and 
children 
from 
birth 
until 
their 
fifth 
birthday. 
Integral 
with 
the 
country’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
(EBRP) 
and 
crisis 
response 
(Plan 
Bolivia), 
SUMI 
will 
be 
protected under 
the 
proposed credit. 
The 
Extended 
Immunization 
Program 
(PAI) 
will 
reduce the 
incidence 
and 
mortality 
rates 
of 
diphtheria, 
whooping 
cough, 
tetanus, 
measles, 
tuberculosis 
and 
poliomyelitis, 
through 
immunization 
services 
targeted 
at 
children. 
3.14 
Several 
important 
reforms 
are 
also 
included 
in 
the 
matrix 
of 
agreed actions. 
These  are 
designed 
in 
the 
first 
case 
to 
sustain 
existing 
reform 
momentum 
and 
in 
two 
others, 
to amplify 
those 
reforms: 
0 
Since 
1999, the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
has 
signed 
health 
care management 
agreements 
with 
the 
decentralized 
health 
directorates 
at  the 
departmental 
(prefectura) 
level. 
Nine 
such 
agreements 
will 
be signed 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
the 
first 
tranche 
disbursement, 
so 
as 
to align 
departmental and 
national 
priorities, 
sustain 
the performance 
orientation 
of 
departmental 
health 
services, 
and 
improve 
the 
transparency 
of 
local 
health 
planning.

* 
A 
significant  barrier 
to 
health 
service 
utilization 
among 
poor 
mothers  and 
children 
is 
access 
and 
the 
cost 
of 
traiisportation. 
Bolivia’s 
difiicult 
topography 
and 
high 
traiisportation 
costs,  the 
thin 
coverage 
of 
health 
facilities, 
particularly 
secondary 
and 
tertiary 
clinics 
and hospitals 
in 
some 
rural 
areas. 
and 
the 
convergence 
of 
remoteness 
and 
poverty 
make health 
utilization 
highly 
dependent 
in 
some areas 
on 
transport 
costs 
to and 
from 
facilities. 
,4n 
agreed 
action 
prior 
to 
the second tranche 
release 
is 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
Ministerial 
regulation 
that 
will 
establish 
the 
procedures 
and 
criteria 
for 
such 
reimbursements 
for 
access 
to 
second 
and 
third tier 
health 
facilities. 
* 
A 
third  reform 
area 
is 
the 
empowerment 
of 
indigenous  women 
and 
their 
rights  to 
appropriate 
and 
culturally 
sensi 
tive 
health 
services. 
particularly 
for 
childbirth. 
A 
draft 
Bill 
of 
Rights 
for 
Pregnant Women, 
focusing 
on 
the 
rights 
of 
iadigeiious women 
to appropriate 
delivery 
services, 
will 
be approved 
by 
a 
ministerial 
resolution, 
an 
agreed 
action 
under 
the 
Credit.

Education 
Reform 
3.1

The Social Safety 
Net 
Stnictural 
Adjustment 
Credit would 
protect 
budgets 
to 
ensure 
that 
two 
key 
programs 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
(the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
and 
the 
Education 
Quality 
Improvement Project 
component 
implemented 
through  FPS) 
deliver 
essential services 
without 
interruption. 
Consistent 
with 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Bolivia 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(EBRP), 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program (PRE) 
has 
as 
its 
general 
objective 
the 
expansion 
of 
coverage 
of 
public 
education 
aiid 
the 
enhancement 
of 
education 
quality 
through 
the 
consolidation 
aiid  introduction 
of 
a 
school 
curriculum 
which 
strengthens 
community 
participation 
and 
improvements 
in 
education 
management. 
Interruption 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
program 
would 
seriously 
impact 
the 
development 
of 
the 
nation’s human capital over 
the 
medium 
term, especially 
among 
the 
poor 
who 
live 
in 
periurban 
and 
remote 
locations 
where  education 
access

A 
component 
of 
the 
ERP 
but 
with 
a 
separate 
program 
and 
budget, 
the 
Education 
Nucleus 
Submoiects 
was 
selected 
for 
budget 
protection 
because 
of 
its 
reform 
impact 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
program 
is 
to 
provide, through 
the 
National 
Fund 
for 
Social and 
Public Investment 
(FPS), 
the 
iiatiotial 
counterpart corresponding 
to 
the 
municipal 
contribution 
for 
educational 
nucleus 
subprojects 
which 
includes 
integral 
school improvements 
(infrastnicture 
and 
pedagogical support). 
Education 
financing 
through 
FPS 
constitutes about 
30 
percent 
of 
all 
FPS 
disbursements. 
3.17 
The 
development 
of 
the 
Strategic  Sector 
Plan 
(PES) 
for 
the 
longer 
term 
is 
critical 
for 
sustaining 
the 
educational and 
institutional 
gains 
achieved 
by 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
(PRE) 
in 
primary 
education 
aiid for 
expanding 
reform 
to 
all 
other 
subsectors 
of 
the 
education 
system. 
The 
strategic 
plan 
will 
place 
national 
education 
policy within 
the 
larger coiltexts 
of 
Plan 
Bolivia 
(which 
addresses 
the 
immediate 
needs 
of 
the 
country 
in 
crisis), 
Bolivia’s  Povero- 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(EBRP), 
aiid 
the 
World 
Declaration 
of 
Education 
for 
All 
(EFA). 
The 
strategic 
plan 
will: 
Page  26
Set 
the  targets 
for 
expansion 
in 
education 
coverage 
in 
secondary 
education, 
the 
next 
priority 
development, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
tertiary, 
technical, 
and 
nonformal 
education; 
and 
identify 
at-risk 
secondary education-age groups. 
e 
Provide 
guidance 
for 
development 
of 
capacity 
in 
the 
education 
sector, 
in 
professional 
training, literacy, 
and 
education 
management. 
3.18 
Including 
the 
development 
of 
this 
strategic 
plan 
in 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Credit 
will 
ensure 
that 
the 
activity 
would 
proceed uninterrupted  and 
on 
schedule 
in 
2003. 
This 
will 
signal 
that the 
unified 
and 
coordinated 
sector 
framework 
is 
forthcoming 
and 
will 
be 
available 
for 
international 
donors 
who 
finance 
a substantial 
portion 
of 
the 
education 
budget. 
For 
the 
release 
of 
the 
first 
tranche 
of 
the 
credit, 
a 
timetable 
must 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Bank 
for 
consultation 
with 
members 
of 
the 
National 
Congress 
for 
Education 
(which 
includes 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society) 
on 
the 
technical proposal 
for 
developing 
the PES. 
For 
the 
release 
of 
the second tranche 
of 
the credit, the 
draft 
PES 
must 
have 
been 
submitted 
for 
consideration 
of 
the 
National 
Congress 
for 
Education. 
3.19 
A 
second  area 
of 
reform 
is 
the 
Government’s 
response 
to 
very 
recent  evidence 
that 
enrollment 
and 
attendance rates 
for 
the 
very 
poorest 
children 
have 
declined 
during 
the crisis, thus 
undermining 
a 
fundamental and 
hard 
won 
achievement 
of 
the 
many 
years 
of 
education 
reform. 
So 
far 
the 
declines 
are 
modest 
(3-4 
percent 
in 
net 
enrollments  and 
attendance 
between 2000 
and 
2002), 
but 
more 
striking 
is 
the 
concentration 
of 
this 
impact 
on 
the 
poorest 
only. 
The remaining 
80 
percent 
of 
families 
have 
managed 
to 
sustain the 
trend 
of 
increasing enrollments  and 
attendance 
over 
the 
same 
period, 
thus 
magnifying 
the 
gap 
between 
the poorest 
and 
the 
better 
off. 
3.20 
Given 
the 
preliminary 
nature 
of 
the 
data, 
and 
its 
highly 
concentrated 
pattern, 
the 
Government 
wishes 
to 
analyze 
the 
data 
further 
so 
as 
to 
understand 
better 
the 
regional, 
age, 
gender, 
and  school 
grade 
level 
distribution 
of 
the 
problem. 
Causes 
of 
the 
declining 
enrollment 
and 
attendance 
will 
be 
sought 
in 
econometric 
analysis 
and more  qualitative 
methods. 
Based 
on 
findings, 
an 
analytical report 
will 
explore 
different 
policy 
options 
to 
address 
the 
problem, 
and 
the 
findings 
and appropriate 
actions 
incorporated 
in 
the Strategic 
Sector 
Plan. 
C. 
Credit 
Amount and 
Tranching 
3.21 
The 
total 
amount 
of 
the 
credit 
is 
US$35.0 
million. 
The credit 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
disbursed 
in 
two 
tranches 
over 
the 
near 
term. 
The 
first 
tranche (US$25.0 
million 
equivalent) 
is 
scheduled 
for 
disbursement 
after 
Board 
approval and 
credit 
signing, 
and 
the second 
tranche 
at 
US$lO.O 
million 
equivalent 
would 
follow 
evidence 
of 
successful 
budget 
execution and 
other 
actions 
in 
early 
2004. 
A 
matrix 
of 
agreed 
actions 
(Annex 
2) 
identifies 
the 
following: 
(i) 
the 
Government’s 
social 
programs 
which 
require 
budget  protection; 
and 
(ii) 
other 
policy-related  activities 
which 
the 
Government 
would 
carry 
out 
during 
FY 
2003 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 
momentum 
of 
reform 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
3.22 
The 
two 
tranche 
structure 
will 
permit 
a 
sustained engagement 
with 
the 
protected 
programs 
and 
target 
reforms over 
the 
bridging 
period. 
This 
would 
yield 
benefits 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
supervision 
quality 
and 
monitoring 
of 
results, 
while 
helping 
to 
build 
the 
foundation 
for 
more 
medium term 
policy 
dialogue 
within 
the 
PRSC 
and other 
operations. 
Moreover, 
the 
second 
tranche 
contains 
16 
Page  27
budget 
execution 
thresholds 
individually 
specified 
for 
each 
protected program. 
The 
second 
tranche 
provides 
an 
incentive 
to 
implement 
the 
programs 
at 
historically 
realistic 
levels 
of 
execution, 
while 
protecting 
the 
programs 
from 
late 
in 
the 
cycle 
budget reallocations. 
3.23 
The 
weighting 
of 
disbursements 
between 
the 
two 
tranches 
is 
front 
loaded 
both to 
match 
the 
relative  weighting 
of 
conditions 
and 
to provide 
substantial 
resources 
at 
the 
outset, 
so 
as 
to 
help 
the 
Government 
finance program implementation 
on  a 
timely 
basis. 
The  conditions 
in 
the 
first 
tranche (eleven 
in 
number) 
contain 
the 
more 
significant 
steps 
in 
support 
of 
the 
safety 
net. 
These 
include 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
budget, 
protection 
of 
social 
safety 
net programs 
within 
the 
budget, 
the 
allocation 
of 
additional 
funds 
(at 
high 
financial 
cost, 
pending 
new donor grant 
flows) 
to 
PLANE 
11, 
the 
start 
up 
of 
PLANE 
I1 
with 
improved 
procedures, 
criteria 
and 
transparency, 
the 
significant 
reform 
of 
health 
insurance 
SUMI, 
and 
the 
signing 
of 
nine 
health 
performance 
management 
agreements. 
Second tranche 
actions 
(six 
in 
number) 
aim 
to 
assure 
the 
completion 
of 
safety 
net 
activities 
protected 
in 
the 
budget 
and 
to 
ensure 
follow 
up 
on 
issues 
and 
reforms 
within 
education, 
health 
and 
workfare 
that were 
initiated 
as 
part 
of 
first 
tranche 
activities. 
3.24 
As 
regards 
budget 
resources, 
the 
Government 
has  agreed 
with 
the 
IMF 
on 
a budget 
financing 
framework 
for 
2003, 
which 
includes  substantial 
increases 
in 
the 
public 
investment 
budget. 
To 
finance 
the 
budget, 
the Government 
has 
identified 
resources 
from 
various domestic 
and 
foreign 
sources, 
including 
IDA. 
The 
timing 
of 
this 
support 
is 
particularly 
important, 
given 
the 
need 
to 
finance Government expenditures 
in 
the second 
half 
of 
the 
Bolivian 
fiscal 
year, 
as 
the 
momentum 
of 
commitments 
and 
disbursements 
accelerates 
into 
the 
last quarter. 
Any 
reduction 
in 
the 
expected 
pool 
of 
foreign financing 
would 
require 
cuts 
in 
the 2003 
budgeted expenditure, 
which 
given historical 
and 
structural 
factors, 
might 
likely 
occur 
in 
roads, 
health, 
or 
education. 
The 
second 
tranche 
of 
US$10 
million 
is 
considered the 
minimal 
and 
sufficient incentive 
to 
achieve 
the second 
tranche conditions. 
The 
Government 
has 
agreed separately 
with 
IDA 
that 
any request 
for 
extension 
of 
the 
closing 
date 
would 
involve 
substantial 
revision 
and 
updating 
to 
the 
second 
tranche 
conditions, 
thus 
establishing 
further 
incentives 
for 
timely 
compliance. 
D. 
Implementation 
Arrangements 
3.25 
The 
lead 
counterpart 
for 
the 
credit 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
safety 
net 
program 
is 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
with 
day 
to 
day 
responsibility 
assigned 
to 
the 
Vice Minister for 
Public 
Investment 
and 
External 
Finance.  Sectoral counterparts 
in 
education, 
health 
and 
social 
protection 
have 
participated 
in 
preparation 
and 
constitute 
an 
informal 
steering group 
for 
the 
credit. 
With 
technical support 
from 
IDA, 
the 
Vice-Minister 
will 
coordinate the achievement 
of 
first 
and 
second 
tranche actions. 
A 
combined 
IDA 
transport 
and 
social 
protection 
team 
will 
supervise 
PLANE 
I1 
during 
its 
implementation 
and 
provide 
technical 
support 
to 
UNDP 
and 
DUF 
in 
the attainment 
of 
100 percent 
execution 
of 
its 
protected budget and 
in 
the 
design 
of 
future 
links 
with 
longer term 
transport 
reform 
objectives. 
Technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
UDAPE 
to 
help 
analyze 
the 
need 
for 
interventions 
to 
address 
enrollment/attendance declines and 
related 
program 
initiatives. 
A 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
will 
be 
prepared 
in 
coming 
months, 
including 
a 
thorough 
analysis 
of 
BONOSOL 
and 
pension 
reform 
issues, 
as 
they 
relate 
to 
coverage 
and 
fiscal 
sustainability 
of 
the 
pension programs. 
These 
findings 
would 
be 
incorporated 
in 
the 
medium term 
reform 
agenda 
that 
would 
be 
considered 
by 
the Government 
later this 
year 
and 
early next.

E. 
Bank 
and 
other 
donor 
coordination 
3.26 
In 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit, 
donor 
consultations 
have 
helped 
to 
shape 
the 
design 
of 
the 
credit 
and 
to 
convince 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
social 
safety 
net strengthening. 
This 
process 
has 
been 
most intense 
in 
regard 
to 
PLANE 
11, 
for which 
donor 
financial 
support 
is 
crucial.  The consultations, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
meetings 
and a 
half 
day 
workshop convened 
by 
PLANE 
and 
DUF, 
inspired 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
formal 
donor 
coordination 
mechanism 
for 
PLANE 
11, 
improved 
the 
writing 
of 
the 
technical 
implementation 
document, 
and 
led 
a 
to 
a broader evaluation 
of 
the 
program 
for 
2003 
and a 
second 
financial 
audit. 
IV. 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
AND 
SOCIAL 
IMPACT 
AND 
FIDUCIARY 
REQUIREMENTS 
A. 
Environmental 
Impact 
4.1 
This  Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural  Adjustment 
Credit 
has 
no 
direct 
impact 
on 
the 
environment. 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
Operational 
Directive 
4.01, 
it 
does 
not 
have 
an 
environmental 
category 
rating 
(unrated) 
and 
is 
not 
subject 
to 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
Environmental 
Assessment 
or 
other 
Safeguard 
Policies. 
To 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
environmental 
and 
social 
safeguards, 
an 
environmental 
screening 
process 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
for 
sub-projects 
financed 
through 
FPS and 
PLANE 
programs protected 
by 
the 
proposed credit. 
4.2 
For 
the 
FPS 
funded 
sub-projects, 
a revised 
operational 
manual that incorporates screening 
criteria 
and procedures 
has 
already been submitted 
by 
the 
Government and 
has 
been 
reviewed 
and 
found 
satisfactory 
by 
the 
Bank. 
These 
procedures 
are 
also 
apply 
to 
education 
sector 
school 
construction 
protected 
by 
the 
proposed 
credit. 
Health 
programs 
protected 
by 
the 
credit 
adhere 
to 
IDA 
and 
other donor 
standards 
of 
environmental 
safety. 
4.3 
For 
the 
PLANE 
program, 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
projects financed 
are 
maintenance 
in 
nature 
and 
are 
considered 
low 
in 
complexity 
and 
not 
expected 
to 
pose 
significant 
risks 
for 
environment. 
However, 
to 
avoid 
any 
negative 
impact 
on 
environment 
(especially 
for 
rural 
projects 
on 
water, 
irrigation 
and 
roads) 
and 
to 
ensure 
full 
compliance 
with 
environmental 
safeguards, 
appropriate 
screening, 
preventiodmitigation 
measures 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
PLANE 
Operational 
Manual. 
The 
manual 
will 
offer 
guidance 
and 
basic technical 
information 
on 
different 
variables that 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration 
for 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
different 
types 
of 
sub-projects. 
It 
will 
also 
include 
a screening mechanism 
to 
identify 
sub-projects that 
would 
need special 
attention 
in 
terms 
of 
safeguards 
requirements.  Submission 
of 
such a 
manual, 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank, 
is 
a 
condition 
for 
first 
tranche 
release 
under 
the 
proposed 
credit. 
B. 
Social 
Impact 
4.4 
Bolivia 
has an 
enlightened 
approach 
to 
social 
protection 
matters 
in 
its 
interaction 
with 
the 
indigenous 
people. 
There 
are 
35 
ethnic  groups 
in 
Bolivia, 
comprising 
an 
estimated 
4.6 
million 
people 
(58 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
population). 
GOB 
policies 
on 
indigenous 
issues 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
Development 
with 
Identity 
document prepared 
by 
VAZPO 
(Vice 
Ministry 
of 
Indigenous 
Affairs). 
It 
18 
Page  29
states 
that 
the 
GOB 
will 
aim 
at 
improving 
living 
conditions 
of 
indigenous communities through 
economic 
progress, 
political 
participation 
and 
cultural 
assertion. 
The Government 
will 
ensure 
legal 
security 
of 
indigenous 
lands, 
further 
economically 
sustainable 
initiatives, 
sustain 
cultural 
values 
and 
provide 
for 
basic 
services. 
Main 
strategy thrusts 
include: 
(i) 
development 
of 
infrastructure 
and 
economic  opportunities; 
(ii) 
development 
of 
social 
services 
with 
equity 
considerations; 
(iii) 
political 
development 
and 
(iv) cultural 
development 
with 
dignity 
and 
inclusion. 
4.5 
Government strategy 
has 
been 
evolving 
since 
then, 
in 
many 
instances 
under 
pressure 
from 
indigenous 
groups. 
There 
has 
been 
significant 
IDA 
and 
donor 
support 
in 
institutional 
strengthening 
of 
indigenous 
groups, 
which 
is 
being 
undertaken 
within 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Law 
of 
Popular 
Participation 
(LPP)~. 
4.6 
The proposed 
credit 
supports 
two 
main 
programs 
through 
which 
it 
intends 
to improve 
the 
well 
being 
of 
the 
indigenous 
population. 
In 
the 
health 
sector, 
the 
credit 
supports 
the 
empowerment 
of 
indigenous 
women 
and 
their 
rights to 
appropriate 
and 
culturally 
sensitive 
health 
services. 
A 
draft 
Bill 
of 
Rights 
for 
Pregnant 
Women 
(with 
focus 
on 
indigenous 
women) 
will 
be 
approved 
by 
a 
ministerial resolution 
and a 
dissemination campaign 
will 
be 
carried 
out. 
In 
the 
social 
protection 
and 
employment 
creation 
area, 
the 
PLANE 
program, 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
which 
will 
be 
launched 
in 
2003, 
is 
expected 
to 
reach indigenous 
poor 
through 
its 
poverty 
targeting 
mechanism 
(PLANE 
I 
reached 
at 
least 
60,000 
different 
workers, 
half 
of 
whom 
were 
women, 
and  about  a 
third 
indigenous). 
In 
the 
education 
sector, 
the 
sector strategy 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
includes the 
Bilingual 
Education 
Program, 
which 
recognizes 
four major 
indigenous 
groups 
and 
offers 
bilingual 
instruction 
on 
native 
languages. 
C. 
Financial 
Management 
4.7 
Bolivia 
has 
demonstrated 
significant 
improvements 
in 
the 
financial 
management 
area 
since 
1999. 
SIGMA 
(the 
integrated 
financial 
management 
systems) 
have become operational 
in 
all 
central 
Government 
ministries 
and 
now 
facilitates 
reliable reporting 
of 
budget execution. 
Data 
on 
Government expenditures have 
been 
made available 
to 
the 
public, 
though 
the 
internet. 
During 
2002, 
SIGMA 
has 
also 
begun 
operating 
in 
some 
decentralized  entities, 
including 
FPS 
and 
the 
National 
Customs 
Service. 
4.8 
All 
these 
were 
achieved 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
financial 
improvement 
action 
plan 
agreed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and the 
Government, 
following 
the 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
conducted 
in 
1999. 
Main 
items 
of 
this 
action 
plan 
were 
incorporated 
under 
the 
Benchmarks 
of 
the 
First 
Programmatic 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit (PSAC-I.) 
and 
included 
i) 
the 
unambiguous 
application 
of 
the Supreme 
Decree that 
related 
to 
SIGMA 
and 
ii) 
a 
commitment 
to 
achieve 
agreed 
minimum 
benchmarks 
in 
financial 
management 
in 
all 
Central 
Government 
ministries 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
SIGMA. 
4.9 
A 
review 
of 
the 
advances 
against 
benchmarks 
set 
in 
the 
PSAC-I, 
conducted 
in 
December 
2001 
indicated 
that most 
of 
the 
actions 
have 
been 
satisfactorily 
implemented 
and started 
producing 
results 
on 
the 
ground. 
However 
the 
scope 
and 
operations 
of 
SIGMA 
still 
needs 
to 
be 
expanded 
to 
LPP 
was 
launched 
in 
1994 
and 
provided 
the 
mechanism 
for 
indigenous 
organizations 
to 
exercise 
their legal 
representation 
and equipped 
them 
with 
legal rights 
over 
public 
investment.

the 
rest 
of 
the decentralized entities, 
regional 
(prefectures) 
and 
municipal 
level 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
full 
completion 
of 
one 
of 
the 
major 
recommendations 
of 
the 
CFAA. 
4.10 
The 
GOB 
has 
demonstrated 
its 
commitment 
to 
decentralization 
and 
popular 
participation 
in 
local 
governance, 
as 
guiding 
principles 
for 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
country’s 
public 
administration. 
An 
anti-corruption 
strategy 
and 
institutional 
reform 
(fundamentally 
linked 
to 
the 
anti-corruption 
battle) 
Efforts 
are 
being 
made  at 
clarifying 
roles, 
responsibilities 
and 
fiscal 
and 
financial 
relations between 
different 
levels 
of 
public 
administration 
(national, 
pre-fectural, 
and 
municipal). 
are 
high 
on 
the 
Government’s 
agenda. 
4.1 
1 
Notwithstanding 
significant 
progress 
to 
date, 
there 
is 
still 
need 
for 
improvement 
in 
the 
area 
of 
transparency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
public 
funds. 
A 
Country Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
is 
planned 
for 
FY 
04, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
Bolivia’s 
economic 
development 
by 
(1) 
identifying 
weaknesses 
in 
Public Financial 
Management 
Systems 
and 
Practices 
(2) 
making 
recommendations 
for 
improving 
efficiency, 
transparency  and 
accountability. 
Upon 
completion 
if 
the 
diagnostic work, specific relevant actions 
may 
be 
considered 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
Policy 
Matrices 
of 
future 
operations, 
as 
appropriate. 
D. 
Procurement 
4.12 
Bolivia 
has 
initiated 
a 
number 
of 
reforms 
in 
the 
procurement 
area 
to 
strengthen 
current 
legal 
and 
institutional 
procurement 
framework 
in 
a  manner 
consistent 
with 
international 
procurement 
standards 
and  practices. 
These 
reforms 
are 
intended 
to  improve 
transparency, 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
public 
procurement, 
reduce 
corruption 
in 
the system and 
provide 
sustainability 
to 
the 
implemented 
reforms. 
4.13 
The 
CAS 
Progress 
Report 
of 
May 
2001 
highlighted 
the 
improvements  achieved 
in 
the 
procurement 
area 
within 
the 
CDF 
framework 
(expedited 
project implementation through 
the 
use 
of 
new 
procurement tools 
such 
as 
procurement 
plans; 
simplified 
procurement 
schedules; 
customized 
local 
standard 
bidding 
documents, agency 
capacity 
assessment 
(ACAs) 
exercises), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
remaining 
weaknesses 
in 
the system 
(the 
limited 
institutional 
capacity-particularly 
at 
the 
local 
level 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
qualified 
procurement staff, 
integrated 
information 
systems 
and 
procurement 
mechanisms that 
would 
ensure adequate 
monitoring 
and 
supervision). 
4.14 
The 
reforms 
initiated 
since 
then have 
included 
“Harmonization 
of 
policies 
and 
procedures” 
as 
one 
of 
the 
key 
elements 
for 
enhanced 
procurement 
management. 
Within 
the 
action 
plan 
of 
the 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR) 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank, 
the 
Government intends 
to 
pursue 
this 
objective 
through: 
(i) 
the 
preparation 
and enactment 
by 
Congress 
of 
a 
modern 
Procurement 
Law 
compatible 
with 
international 
standards 
and 
practices, 
including 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
regulatory 
agency 
and 
a 
Code 
of 
Ethics 
for public 
procurement staff3; 
(ii) 
the 
gradual 
implementation 
of 
an 
E-Government 
procurement 
system; 
and 
(iii) 
adoption 
of 
standardized 
procedures 
and 
local 
bidding 
documentation 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
Government. 
The 
government recently issued 
a Supreme 
Decree 
in 
the area 
of 
public 
procurement 
that 
improves 
upon 
the 
existing 
legal framework 
for 
procurement 
by 
the 
public 
sector 
and 
represents 
an 
important improvement 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
public 
sector 
contracting. 
20 
Page  31
4.15 
The 
harmonization 
process 
(and 
the 
anticipated  improvements 
on 
local 
procurement 
procedures 
and  performance) 
is 
expected to 
help 
the 
Government 
reduce 
overall 
transaction 
costs 
and encourage 
donors 
to 
harmonize 
their 
procedures 
around 
the 
Bolivian 
system. 
This 
may 
also 
introduce 
greater 
incentives 
to 
reduce 
corruption 
in 
the 
public 
procurement 
area 
and 
in 
public 
sector 
in 
general. 
E. 
Disbursement Arrangements 
4.16 
Disbursement 
arrangements 
would 
follow 
the 
simplified 
procedures 
for 
SALS/ 
SECALs 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
February 
1, 
1996. 
The 
Borrower 
will 
open 
an 
account 
in 
Bolivia's 
Central 
Bank 
(Banco 
Central 
de 
Bolivia). 
Once the 
Bank 
formally 
notifies 
the 
borrower 
that 
a 
tranche 
is 
available 
for 
withdrawal, 
the 
borrower may 
submit 
a 
simplified 
withdrawal 
application 
so 
that the proceeds 
of 
the 
tranche 
are 
deposited 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
this 
account, 
for 
use 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. Disbursements 
will 
not 
be 
linked 
to 
specific 
purchases, 
and 
supporting 
evidence 
for 
disbursements 
is 
therefore 
not 
required. 
The 
proceeds 
of 
the 
loan 
may not 
be 
used 
to 
finance expenditures 
typically 
excluded 
under 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
Although 
a 
routine 
audit 
of 
the 
deposit 
account 
would 
not be 
required, 
the 
Bank 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
request 
that 
an 
audit 
be 
conducted 
in 
accordance 
with 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing, 
by 
an  independent 
firm 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
If 
requested, 
the 
audit 
will 
be 
performed 
in 
accordance 
with 
terms 
of 
reference 
(TORS) 
approved 
by 
the 
Bank. 
V. 
BENEFITS 
AND 
RISKS 
5.1 
Bolivia 
and 
its 
people 
are 
struggling 
to 
emerge 
from 
a 
sustained 
Economic downturn 
that 
has 
left 
the 
poor 
and 
vulnerable 
segments 
of 
the 
economy worse 
off 
in 
a 
context 
of 
slow  or 
negative 
per 
capita 
growth 
since 
1998 
(see 
Annex 
3 
for 
changes 
in 
per 
capita 
income 
by 
decile 
and 
region). 
This 
persistent 
social crisis 
came 
to 
a head 
in 
February 
of 
this 
year 
with 
violent 
civil 
unrest, 
which 
in 
turn 
further 
depressed 
tax 
revenues 
and 
sparked 
continuing 
rounds 
of 
protest 
and 
social 
tensions. 
The benefits 
of 
the proposed 
credit 
flow from 
its 
core 
objective 
to 
provide 
a 
financial  bridge 
for 
the 
Government  through 
the 
difficult 
months 
ahead, 
while 
sustaining  the 
momentum 
of 
social 
sector 
reforms 
during 
this 
period 
and 
ensuring 
the 
counter-cyclical impact 
of 
key 
safety 
net programs 
for 
2003. 
This 
should 
help 
the Government 
to 
restore 
stability 
and 
address 
social 
tensions, 
key 
antecedents 
for 
a 
restoration 
of 
a 
stronger 
growth 
path 
and resumption 
of 
medium 
term 
reform 
efforts. 
Credit 
resources 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
revised 
2003 
budget, 
within 
an 
overall fiscal framework 
agreed 
with 
the 
IMF 
and 
as 
part 
of 
a 
larger 
package 
of 
IDA 
and 
other donor support. 
5.2 
The 
social 
safety 
net 
in 
Bolivia 
is 
constrained 
by 
fiscal 
resources 
and 
the 
large 
size 
of 
the 
potential 
target 
group, the 
poor. 
The credit 
is 
designed, 
within 
these 
limitations, 
to 
strengthen and 
protect 
key 
programs and thereby 
to 
ensure 
an 
affordable 
flow 
of 
compensatory 
resources 
to 
the 
poorer 
segments 
of 
Bolivian 
society 
during 
this 
period.  Through 
the budget 
protection 
provision 
of 
the 
proposed 
credit 
and 
the agreed 
sustaining reforms, 
the 
proposed 
credit 
therefore 
seeks 
to 
support 
the 
Government 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
address 
the 
intensifying 
social 
tensions, 
contain 
the 
worsening 
social 
indicators, 
including 
unemployment 
and the 
preliminary 
evidence 
of

1 
percent 
of 
the 
Government’s 
public 
social  investment  budget 
(focusing 
on 
health,  education, 
and 
social 
protection) 
will 
be 
protected 
from 
reductions 
during 
the 
year, 
and 
execution 
of 
those 
budgets 
will 
achieve a 
minimum 
level 
(85 
percent 
on 
average) 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year; 
Public 
employment: 
The  Government’s 
public 
employment 
program, 
PLANE, 
will 
provide 
300,000 
man 
months 
of 
public 
works 
employment 
to 
unskilled,  poor 
workers, 
about 
half 
of 
whom 
are 
women, 
in 
projects  that 
will 
maintain 
and  upgrade 
existing 
economic 
and 
social 
infrastructure 
through  budget 
protection 
and 
improvements 
in 
the 
management and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
program; 
Public 
employment: 
The Government’s 
municipal 
financing 
mechanism, 
FPS, 
will 
apply 
lower municipal 
counterpart 
financing 
requirements, 
as 
part 
of 
an 
overall  program 
to 
accelerate 
municipal 
sub 
project 
proposals 
and 
execution, 
and 
will 
assess 
the 
viability 
of 
a 
new, 
temporary 
window 
for 
donor 
financing 
of 
labor  intensive 
municipal 
investment 
projects 
during 
crisis 
periods; 
Health: 
budget 
protection 
will 
be 
assured 
to 
four key public 
health programs 
benefiting 
poor 
families, 
with 
direct preventive 
benefits 
for 
people 
at 
risk 
of 
malaria, 
TB, 
and 
chagas; 
the 
provision 
of 
immunizations 
189,000 
children; 
at 
least 
58 
percent 
of 
births 
attended 
within 
an 
institutional 
setting; 
and 
59

brigades  established 
to 
reach 
1,400 
communities; 
Health 
reform: 
sustaining 
the 
performance 
based 
management 
reforms 
at 
the 
nine 
regional  health 
directorates;  approval 
of 
the 
Bill 
of 
Rights 
of 
the  Pregnant 
Woman 
including 
the 
right 
to 
access 
to culturally 
appropriate 
services 
for 
Indigenous 
women; and

procedures 
to

the 
Maternal 
and 
Child 
Health 
Program 
to 
reimburse 
travel 
costs 
to facilities 
for 
poor 
and 
remote 
families; 
Education: 
1.2 
million 
children 
will 
benefit 
from 
improved 
instruction, 
teacher 
training, 
and 
school 
management 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ongoing 
Educational 
Reform 
Program 
protected 
under 
the 
credit; 
Education 
strategy: 
a 
final 
version 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education’s sectoral 
strategy 
will 
be 
distributed 
for public 
consultation, 
so 
as 
to 
strengthen 
donor 
support 
for 
key 
initiatives, 
including 
secondary 
education 
reform 
and 
incentives 
for 
families to 
prevent school 
drop 
outs; 
Options 
for 
addressing 
declining 
enrollments: 
an 
urgent 
study 
will 
be 
undertaken 
to 
provide 
input 
into 
the 
Government’s 
Strategic 
Sector 
Plan 
for 
education 
and 
its 
proposals 
for 
addressing 
school 
drop 
outs among 
the 
poorest 
families. 
5.3 
As 
noted 
in 
Section 
I, 
country 
strategy 
risks 
are 
substantial. 
The current  Government 
enjoys 
limited 
support and 
the 
coalition 
is 
fragile. 
Opposition 
factions 
could 
develop 
sufficient 
strength 
to 
compel 
the 
Government 
to 
step 
down 
before 
its 
constitutional 
term 
expires. 
Current 
social 
unrest 
and tensions 
could 
persist 
or 
intensify, further 
undermining 
the 
political 
environment 
for 
new 
medium 
term 
reforms 
in 
economic 
and 
social 
sectors, 
as 
well 
as 
economic growth.. 
A 
further 
worsening 
of 
the 
social 
stability, 
a 
higher 
risk 
if 
IDA 
withholds 
support, 
could 
take 
Bolivia 
into 
an  accelerated  descent 
economically 
and 
socially. 
Balancing 
those 
country 
risks 
are 
encouraging 
signs 
of 
a 
regional 
economic 
revival 
that 
could 
help 
lift 
Bolivia’s 
economy. 
22 
Page  33
Abundant 
gas 
resources, once 
exploited, 
will lift 
Govemment 
revenues 
and 
GDP. 
Donors remain 
committed 
to 
support 
the 
Govemment, 
and there 
is 
a legacy 
of 
pro-poor 
reform on which 
to 
build 
an 
equitable development 
strategy. 
5.4 
The 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
credit 
and 
its 
implementation 
are 
manageable 
in 
regard 
to 
disbursement 
of 
the 
two 
tranches. 
Budget protection 
and 
other 
conditions 
were  accomplished 
before 
distribution 
of 
the 
Board 
documents. 
Budget 
execution 
floors 
have 
been 
carefully 
estimated 
in 
light 
of 
historical 
performance 
and 
current 
year 
considerations, 
so 
as 
to 
achieve 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
confidence that they can be achieved 
for 
second 
tranche disbursement. Other actions 
in 
the 
Matrix 
of 
Agreed 
Actions 
for 
the 
first 
and 
second 
tranches 
are 
within 
reach 
due 
to prior 
work 
that 
has 
prepared 
the 
way 
forward 
and 
strong, 
evident 
commitment 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
implementing 
entity. 
For 
example, 
implementation 
of 
PLANE 
II, 
using 
already available 
resources, 
began 
in 
March 
2003. 
Disbursement 
risks, 
assuming that 
Bolivia 
remains 
relatively 
stable 
and 
secure, 
can 
be 
described, therefore, 
as 
low 
for 
the 
first 
tranche and 
moderate 
for 
the 
second.

ANNEX 
I: 
LETTER 
OF 
DEVELOPMENT 
POLICY 
(TRANSLATED 
FROM 
THE 
ORIGINAL 
SPANISH 
VERSION) 
La 
Paz, 
May 
14,2003 
Mr. 
James 
D. 
Wolfensohn 
President 
The 
World 
Bank 
Washington 
DC 
- 
USA 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn, 
1. 
This 
document 
describes 
the 
groundwork 
of 
the 
Social Protection 
Network 
Support 
Program 
(Programa 
de 
Apoyo 
a 
la 
Red 
de 
Proteccih 
Social,  PARPS). 
It 
starts 
by 
presenting 
the 
macroeconomic and 
fiscal 
situation 
resulting 
from 
the crisis, characterized 
by 
a reduction 
in 
economic growth, increased 
unemployment 
and 
high 
poverty 
rates. 
It 
goes 
on 
to 
describe the 
content 
of 
the 
Social Protection 
Spending Program, support 
for 
counter-cyclical 
programs 
and 
the 
consolidation 
of 
social 
reforms 
to 
ensure the 
poor’s 
human  capital. 
These 
measures 
fall 
within 
the 
policies 
the 
Government 
has 
been 
implementing 
to 
ward 
off 
the 
crisis. 
Macroeconomic 
and 
fiscal 
situation 
2. 
At 
the 
close 
of 
2002, 
the 
Bolivian 
economy recorded 
a 
growth 
rate 
of 
2.75 
percent, 
cumulative 
inflation 
of 
2.45 
percent, 
a 
fiscal 
deficit 
of 
8.7 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
a 
net 
international 
reserves 
(NIR) 
loss 
by 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Bolivia 
(BCB) 
of 
US$274.2 
million, 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
money supply 
of 
Bs. 
337 
million. 
The 
year 
2002 
was 
the 
fourth 
consecutive 
year 
in 
which 
annual 
growth 
rates 
were 
less 
than 
three 
percent, 
a 
sign 
of 
severe 
contraction 
in 
economic 
activity. 
3. 
Consistent 
with 
the 
lethargy 
in 
the 
economy, 
significant 
increases 
have been observed 
in 
the 
rates 
of 
open unemployment, 
which 
reached 
9.5 
percent 
in 
2001 and 
8.5 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Similarly, 
the 
quality 
of 
employment 
deteriorated, 
with 
informal 
employment 
accounting 
for 
64 percent 
of 
the 
working 
population. 
The 
reduction 
in 
per capita 
income, 
in 
turn, 
was 
reflected 
in 
the 
poverty 
rate, 
which 
rested between 
63 
percent 
and 
65 
percent. 
4. 
The 
key 
elements 
in 
the 
crisis 
revolve 
around 
external 
effects-the 
international 
financial 
crisis,  and 
its 
effect 
on 
Brazil 
(1998) 
and 
later 
Argentina 
(late 
2001)-and 
internal 
ones-the 
reduction 
in 
the  coca 
trade  and 
its 
impact 
on 
the 
informal 
sector, 
24 
Page  35
among 
others. 
Both 
shocks 
led 
to 
real 
stagnation 
in 
the sector, weakened revenues 
and 
financial 
instability. 
5. 
The 
external 
shocks 
were 
primarily 
evidenced 
through 
the 
drop 
in 
external 
demand 
for 
Bolivia's  main 
exports, 
net 
capital outflows 
and 
the 
drop 
in 
Foreign 
Direct 
Investment 
(FDI); 
in 
addition, 
there has 
been 
an 
appreciation 
in 
the 
real multilateral 
exchange 
rate, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
periods 
of 
crisis 
in 
Brazil 
and 
Argentina. 
6. 
Among 
internal 
factors 
of 
note 
that 
restricted 
growth,  the 
policies 
for 
fighting 
drug 
trafficking 
generated 
a 
decline 
in 
the 
coca economy, 
which 
dropped 
from 
2.8 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1997 
to 
1 
percent 
in 
2000. 
In 
real 
terms, 
during 
the 
decade 
of 
the 
 OS, 
some 
US$200 
million 
in 
earnings 
were 
lost 
per 
year, 
on 
average, 
which 
had 
served 
to 
hold 
up 
the 
informal 
sector's 
activity, 
and 
internal 
demand 
dropped 
due 
to 
the 
decreased 
surpluses 
from 
the 
economy 
of 
coca 
in 
the 
informal 
market. 
7. 
Among 
the 
major 
consequences 
of 
the 
contraction 
in 
the 
sector, 
we 
find 
the 
decline 
in 
financial 
intermediation 
activity 
due 
to 
the  sustained 
contraction 
in 
deposits, 
and 
a 
decline 
in 
portfolios 
reported 
by 
some 
private 
banks, 
leading 
to 
increased 
arrearage 
and 
causing other 
banks 
to 
adopt 
more 
prudent 
policies 
for 
granting 
credit. 
8. 
Also, 
starting 
in 
1999, 
the 
drop 
in 
economic 
activity 
and 
the 
cost 
of 
pension 
reform 
became 
largely 
responsible 
for 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
(8.7 
percent 
of 
GDP). 
The 
increase 
in 
the 
fiscal  deficit 
in 
2002 
was  aggravated 
by 
decreased 
earnings 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
hydrocarbons 
resulting 
from 
the 
privatization 
of 
the 
Bolivian 
State 
Oil 
Company 
(Yacimientos 
Petroliferos 
Fiscales 
Bolivianos, 
YPFB). 
Expenditures under 
the 
heading 
of 
salaries 
also rose due 
to 
the 
recategorization and payment 
of 
performance 
bonuses 
to 
the 
teaching 
profession. 
Lastly, more 
resources 
were allocated 
to public 
investment 
(0.3 
percent 
of 
GDP). 
9. 
Furthermore, 
while 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
is 
funded 
primarily 
with 
net external 
credit 
that 
by 
nature 
is 
concessional' 
so 
as 
not 
to 
overly 
place 
pressure 
on 
the 
domestic 
capital 
market, the 
proportion 
of 
internal 
funding 
has 
taken 
on 
greater 
importance. 
Through 
the 
issue 
of 
nonconcessional 
bonds 
to 
benefit 
the Pension 
Fund 
Managers 
(Administradovus 
de 
Fondos 
de 
Pensiones, 
AFPs), 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
pension 
system 
reform, 
the 
stock 
from 
long-term 
internal 
debt 
in 
this 
sector 
increased 
from 
US$217 
million 
in 
1998 
to 
US$786 
million 
in 
2002, 
which 
gave 
rise 
to 
increased  spending 
to 
cover 
interest 
payments 
on 
the 
internal 
debt. 
Support to 
the 
social 
protection 
network 
10. 
The 
policies 
the 
Government 
has 
designed 
to 
exit 
the 
crisis 
include 
an 
aggressive 
program 
to 
create 
jobs 
through 
public 
investment,  actions 
to 
make 
the 
most 
out 
of 
export 
opportunities 
in 
areas 
of 
manufacturing 
where 
there 
is 
installed 
capacity, 
and 
in 
general, 
actions 
aimed 
at 
facilitating 
productive 
and 
financial 
restructuring 
of 
businesses. 
This 
' 
Grace 
periods, 
extended terms 
and 
low 
interest 
rates 
25 
Page  36
program 
will 
be 
backed 
by 
social 
protection  policies 
designed 
to 
protect 
at-risk 
population 
groups. 
11. 
These 
policies 
will, 
furthermore, 
help 
to 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
inclusive 
growth 
built 
on 
sustainable 
foundations. 
Within 
this 
framework, 
we 
see 
productive transformation 
in 
agriculture 
and 
industry, 
the 
strengthening 
and 
adjustment 
of 
the 
Social Reforms 
for 
reaching 
the 
Millennium 
Goals 
in 
health 
and 
education, 
and the 
institutionalization 
that 
will 
help 
to 
ensure 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
12. 
The social 
protection policies 
have 
arisen 
from 
the 
need 
to 
look 
after 
those 
people 
living 
in 
a crisis 
situation. 
These 
policies 
are 
aimed 
at 
protecting 
vulnerable groups and 
temporarily 
protecting 
people 
affected 
by 
the 
reduction 
in 
their 
earnings 
and 
consumption. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
social 
protection 
policy 
focuses 
on 
temporarily 
aiding 
people 
in 
at-risk 
conditions, 
providing 
them 
with 
resources 
in 
times 
of 
crisis. 
13. 
The 
policies 
are 
designed 
to 
aid 
in 
implementing 
other 
policies 
for 
meeting 
the 
needs 
of 
poor 
families 
affected 
by 
the 
crisis  and 
to 
ensure 
the  sustainability 
of 
the 
social 
reforms 
that 
are 
under 
way. 
The 
Program relies 
on 
the 
following 
tools: 
i) 
maintenance 
and execution 
of 
social 
protection 
expenditures, 
ii) 
implementation 
of 
counter-cyclical 
programs, 
and 
iii) 
measures 
for 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
social 
reforms. 
Protection 
of 
Expenditures 
14. 
The 
introduction 
of 
actions 
intended 
for 
training 
and 
protecting  human 
capital 
constituted 
the 
fundamental 
pillar 
of 
social 
policy 
over 
the 
last 
10 
years. 
The 
priority 
given 
by 
public 
policies 
to 
education, 
health 
and 
basic  sanitation 
was 
reflected 
in 
spending 
on 
social welfare 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
GDP, 
which 
increased 
from 
12.41 
percent 
in 
1995 
to 
18.99 
percent 
in 
2002.2 
15. 
Nonetheless, the 
country's 
current 
fiscal 
situation 
has 
imposed significant 
limits 
on 
the 
national 
budget 
and 
spending levels.  Faced 
with 
this 
situation, 
the 
Government 
has 
decided 
to 
prioritize 
the 
allocation 
and 
execution 
of 
resources 
for 
counter-cyclical 
programs 
and 
those 
having 
a 
greater 
impact 
on 
long-term poverty 
reduction. 
16. 
The  Government 
will 
prioritize 
budget 
protection 
for 
strategic  programs 
in 
employment, 
health 
and 
education 
for 
a 
total 
amount 
of 
US$106.8 
million 
for 
fiscal 
year 
2003. 
A 
minimum 
overall  execution 
of 
85 
percent 
is 
planned through 
December 
31, 
2003. 
Of 
the 
total 
amount 
(US$106.8 
million), 
23.4 
percent  (US$25.0 
million) 
is 
earmarked 
for 
short-term  social 
protection 
(employment),  and 76.6  percent  (US$8 
1.8 
million) 
will 
go 
to 
programs 
in 
reforms 
that 
are 
currently 
underway 
(education 
and 
health).

Staying 
Power 
of 
Social 
Reforms 
a) 
Health 
Reform 
27. 
Health Reforms 
have 
resulted 
in 
increased spending 
on 
health, 
which 
rose 
from 
3.1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1995 
to 
3.8 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002. 
This 
increase 
takes 
into 
account 
both 
investment 
spending 
and 
current 
expenditures. 
Despite 
this 
increase, 
the 
results 
(coverage 
of 
childbirths 
and 
treatment 
of 
acute 
respiratory 
infections 
(ARI) 
and 
acute 
diarrheal 
disease 
(ADD), 
for 
example) 
remain limited. 
28. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
Health 
Reform 
will 
continue 
to 
improve 
through renewed 
management 
commitments 
with 
Departmental 
Health 
Services 
(Sewicios 
Departamentales 
de 
Salud, 
SEDES), 
promotion 
of 
access 
to 
Universal 
Maternal 
and 
Child 
Health 
Insurance 
(SUMI) 
for 
the neediest, 
and 
entitlement 
to 
this 
insurance 
within 
the 
indigenous 
population 
in 
a 
context 
of 
cultural 
adaptation. 
29. 
In 
the 
aim 
of 
ensuring results 
in 
health reform, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Sports 
will 
sign 
agreements 
with 
the 
SEDES 
in 
three 
areas 
of 
intervention: 
i) 
SUMI; 
ii) 
the 
28 
Page  39
Coverage 
Extension 
Program 
(Programa 
de Extensidn 
de 
Coberturas, 
EXTENSA); 
and 
iii) 
the 
national 
programs 
on 
endemic 
transmittable 
disease  (Chagas, 
Malaria 
and 
Tuberculosis).  The 
management 
commitments 
will 
include 
indicators 
associated 
with 
the 
three 
defined 
areas 
of 
intervention 
to allow monitoring 
and 
follow 
up 
of 
health 
actions 
on 
a 
regional level. 
30. 
In 
addition, 
to 
lessen 
potential 
problems 
of 
inequities 
in 
access 
to 
SUMI, 
a 
transportation 
subsidy 
will 
be 
introduced 
for 
individuals 
from 
remote 
areas 
who require 
more complex 
treatments 
in 
urban 
areas. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Sports 
has 
agreed 
to 
approve 
the 
regulations for 
implementing 
this 
subsidy. 
31. 
Lastly, 
one 
of 
SUMI’s 
priority 
actions 
will 
be 
to publicize 
pregnant women’s rights, 
within 
a context 
of 
cultural 
adaptation. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Sports 
will 
issue 
a 
Letter 
on 
Pregnant 
Women’s Rights, 
which 
will 
include 
measures 
needed 
to 
protect 
those 
rights. 
The 
Letter 
will 
be 
published 
as 
part 
of 
a  campaign  aimed 
particularly 
at 
indigenous 
women. 
b) 
Education 
Reform 
32. 
The 
implementation 
of 
Education 
Reform 
has 
resulted 
in 
increased 
spending 
on 
education, 
which 
rose 
from 
5.29 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1995 
to 
7.34 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Current 
expenditures 
rose 
from 
Bs. 
1.128 
billion 
to 
Bs. 
2.316 
billion 
over 
those 
same 
years. 
33. 
The goal 
of 
the 
2003 
- 
2010 
Education 
Strategy 
is 
to 
consolidate 
this 
process 
and 
include 
the 
education 
sector 
as 
part 
of 
a 
long-term 
competitiveness 
and 
productivity 
strategy. 
The 
strategic 
plan 
will 
be presented 
to 
the 
national 
education conference 
for 
consideration. 
This 
plan 
will 
help 
to 
integrate, 
consolidate 
and 
make 
advancements 
in 
actions 
at 
different 
sector 
levels 
(primary, 
secondary, 
higher 
and 
alternative education), 
identifying 
goals 
and 
concentrating 
on 
actions 
aimed 
at 
improving 
the 
coverage  and 
quality 
of 
education 
at 
all 
levels. 
34. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
Education 
Strategy, 
proposals 
will 
be 
incorporated 
to 
diminish 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
crisis 
on 
the 
lack 
of 
school 
attendance. 
A 
study 
will 
be conducted 
to 
identify 
the 
school-aged 
population 
that 
runs 
the 
risk 
of 
leaving 
school 
because 
of 
the 
need 
to 
work. 
This 
study 
will 
help 
to 
come 
up 
with 
educational 
policy 
options. 
The 
results  obtained 
will 
be 
widely 
published 
and 
discussed, 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
educational 
conference.

BOLIVIA 
SOCIAL 
SAFETY 
NET 
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT 
CREDIT 
POVERTY 
AND 
SOCIAL 
IMPACTS 
OF 
THE 
BOLIVIAN 
CRISIS3 
1. 
The 
crisis 
in 
Bolivia 
has 
developed 
within 
a 
context 
of 
persistently 
high 
poverty 
and 
social 
inequality. 
Bolivia 
continues 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the poorest countries 
in 
the 
region 
despite 
important 
improvements 
in 
non-monetary 
poverty 
measures 
during 
the  1990s 
linked 
to 
increasing social expenditure 
and 
better 
delivery 
of 
social 
services. 
While 
the 
crisis 
has 
affected 
the 
population 
overall, 
there 
is 
suggestive evidence  that 
it 
has 
increased 
the 
vulnerability 
of 
the 
poor 
in 
particular, 
drawing down 
the 
little 
assets 
they 
accumulate and 
compromising 
their 
human 
capital 
development. 
TRENDS 
IN 
POVERTY INDICATORS 
2. 
Bolivia 
registered 
limited 
progress 
in 
reducing 
income poverty 
during 
the 1990s. 
Although 
nationally 
representative household 
surveys 
are 
lacking for 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
1990s, 
the 
available 
data 
indicates a notable 
reduction 
in 
poverty 
rates 
for 
large 
cities 
from 
52% 
in 
1993 
to 
47% 
in 
1999. 
There 
was 
a 
likely 
smaller 
decline 
in 
poverty 
in 
smaller  cities 
and 
rural 
areas 
during 
this 
period. 
This 
trend 
was 
reversed 
with 
the 
economic  stagnation that 
set 
in 
after 
1999. 
Although 
the  analysis 
of 
the 
most 
recent 
household survey 
data 
for 
2002 
is 
not 
yet 
finalized, 
preliminary 
evidence 
conforms 
to 
some 
worrisome 
trends 
observed 
during 
1999-2001. 
3. 
Poverty levels 
in 
Bolivia 
are 
higher 
today than 
at onset 
of 
the current 
crisis 
(see 
Table 
1). 
The 
short-lived 
decline 
in 
poverty 
rates 
in 
2001, 
that 
followed 
a 
significant 
increase 
from 
1999 
to 
2000, 
had 
lost 
momentum 
by 
2002. 
The 
percentage 
of 
the 
population 
living 
in 
poverty 
increased 
slightly 
from 
62.6% 
in 
1999 
to 
an 
estimated 64.3% 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2002 
while 
the 
percentage 
in 
extreme poverty, 
defined 
as 
an 
insufficient 
income 
to 
consume 
a 
minimum 
food 
basket, 
went 
from 
36% 
to 
around 
37% 
during 
this 
period. 
Although 
poverty 
continues 
to 
be 
higher 
in 
the 
rural 
areas, 
with 
about 82% 
of 
the 
population currently 
living 
in 
poverty, 
it 
deteriorated 
mostly 
in 
urban 
areas, 
from 
51.5% 
in 
1999 
to 
about 
53.6% 
in 
2002. 
Poverty 
continues 
to 
affect more 
the 
indigenous 
people 
and 
rural 
women, 
over 
80% 
are 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
and 
nearly 
half 
are 
extremely 
poor.

Inequality 
remains among 
the 
highest 
in 
the 
region, 
with 
the 
poorest 
quintile 
holding 
only 
3% 
of 
total 
income 
compared 
to 
more 
than 
60% 
of 
the 
richest 
quintile. 
This 
high 
level 
of 
inequality 
has 
been 
a 
key 
reason 
why 
economic 
growth 
has 
made 
far 
less 
of 
a 
dent 
in 
poverty 
in 
Bolivia. 
Employment and 
labor 
incomes 
4. 
There 
is 
evidence that 
the 
crisis 
has 
taken a 
toll 
on 
the 
in 
the 
level 
and 
quality 
of 
employment 
of 
the 
poorest 
families. 
The 
open 
unemployment  rate 
in 
main 
cities 
increased 
steadily 
from 
6.1% 
in 
1999 
to 
9.4% 
in 
2001, 
especially among 
women, 
and 
came 
down 
slightly 
in 
2002 (Figure 
1). 
The 
latter probably 
results 
from 
discouraged 
workers 
leaving 
the 
labor force according 
to 
preliminary 
evidence (the 
participation 
rate 
declined 
from 
61% 
to 
57.4%). 
The 
rise 
in 
unemployment affects 
more 
workers 
from 
the 
poorest 
families 
whom 
are 
twice 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
unemployed than 
the 
average 
worker. 
It 
also 
takes 
longer 
for 
the 
low-income 
unemployed 
to 
find 
a 
job. 
In 
2002, 
60% 
of 
workers 
from 
the 
poorest 20% 
of 
families 
took 
at 
least 
two 
months 
to 
find 
a 
job, 
compared 
to 
40% 
in 
2000. 
An 
increasing 
fraction 
of 
workers 
cite 
factors related 
to 
the 
economic 
downturn 
(e.g., 
being 
fired, 
lack 
of 
sales 
or 
providers) 
as 
the 
main 
reasons 
for 
being 
unemployed 
during 
this 
period. 
Underemployment 
has 
also  become 
more 
prevalent. 
With 
informality 
still 
comprising 
over 
80% 
of 
jobs 
in 
the 
poorest 
quintiles, 
over 
one 
third 
of 
those 
employed 
in 
2002 
were 
willing

Real income per 
capita 
fell 
between 
2% 
and 
4% 
for 
urban 
households 
throughout 
the 
income 
distribution 
(Figure

Meanwhile rural 
households 
in

saw 
their real 
percapita incomes 
decline 
while 
those 
in

registered 
positive 
gains. 
The 
evidence  also 
suggests 
that 
the 
increase 
in

has 
led 
to 
an increasing 
number 
of

to draw 
down

There 
are 
increasing 
concerns that the 
strain 
imposed 
by 
the 
crisis 
may 
seriously 
compromise 
the  achievements 
in 
social indicators  and 
therefore 
the 
sustainability 
of 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
millennium 
development 
targets. 
Bolivia 
has 
achieved 
considerable 
improvements 
in 
living 
conditions 
during 
the 
1990s, 
as 
measured 
by 
the 
level 
of 
unsatisfied 
basic 
needs 
(see 
Table 
2). 
Both 
the 
urban 
and 
rural 
population 
with 
unsatisfied 
basic 
needs 
declined 
steadily 
from 
70.9% 
in 
1992 
to 
58.6% 
in 
2001, 
reflecting 
improved 
access 
to 
education, 
healthcare, 
housing 
and 
basic 
infrastructure 
in 
both 
urban 
and 
rural 
areas, 
although  significant 
disparities  persist 
between  municipalities. 
This 
results 
in 
part 
from 
a steady 
increase 
in 
social 
expenditure 
over 
the 
decade 
(in 
the 
last 
five 
years 
only 
from 
12.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1995 
to 
18.5 
percent 
in 
2001), 
and 
has 
led to 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
education, 
health and 
other social indicators, although 
as 
shown 
above 
it 
has 
not 
translated 
in 
improvements 
in 
income 
poverty.

There 
is 
suggestive 
evidence  that 
as 
the 
incomes 
of 
the 
poor 
Bolivians 
have 
declined, 
they 
may 
have 
coped 
by 
withdrawing children 
from 
school. 
While 
both 
school 
enrollment 
and 
absenteeism 
figures 
continued 
to improve 
overall, 
they 
show 
a steady 
deterioration 
for 
children 
of 
the 
poorest 
families 
(see 
Table 
3). 
About 
80% 
of 
children 
aged 
5 
to 
12 
from 
the 
poorest 
20% 
of 
families 
enrolled 
in 
2002 
down 
from 
84% 
in 
2000. 
Moreover, 
of 
those 
enrolled 
in 
this 
group 
20% 
did 
not 
attend 
school regularly, 
up 
from 
16.5% 
in 
2000. 
In 
contrast, 
enrollment 
and 
attendance 
of 
children 
in 
the 
richest 
quintiles 
show 
a 
moderate 
increase. 
8. 
As 
for 
health 
service 
utilization, 
the  evidence 
does 
not 
indicate 
a 
systematic 
deterioration 
of 
the 
demand 
for 
maternal 
and 
infant 
medical 
attention. 
The 
usage 
of 
skilled 
medical 
personnel and 
health facilities, very 
low 
compared 
to 
other 
poor 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
had 
increased 
during 
the 
1990s 
but 
has 
slowed 
down 
in 
recent 
years. 
About 
54% 
of 
the 
episodes 
of 
diarrhea 
of 
children 
in 
the 
poorest 
families 
in 
2002 
did 
not 
receive 
consultation 
from 
skilled 
personnel, 
similar 
to 
2000. 
For 
the 
case 
of 
IRAs 
this 
percentage 
declined 
slightly 
from 
65% 
in 
2000 
to 
62% 
in 
2002 
for 
the 
poorest 
quintile, 
but 
increased 
from 
44% 
to 
60% 
among families 
in 
the 
second 
quintile. 
Given 
free 
access 
to 
medical 
attention 
for 
infants 
and 
young children 
through 
the 
basic 
health 
insurance program, 
poor 
families 
are less pressed 
to 
defer 
these 
services 
as 
a 
discretionary 
expense. 
Over 
one 
fourth 
of 
households 
in 
the 
bottom 
quintiles 
said 
to 
have benefited 
from 
the 
basic 
health 
insurance, 
compared 
to 
16% 
in 
the 
richest 
quintile.

PROTECTION 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
The 
recent 
economic  decline resulted 
in 
strong 
negative 
impacts,  especially 
for 
the 
poor, 
given 
the 
lack 
of 
an 
effective 
public 
social 
protection 
scheme. 
As 
a result, 
social 
cohesion 
has 
weakened 
and 
civil 
conflicts 
have 
increased 
in 
Bolivia. 
While 
public 
income 
decreases 
and 
pressures 
to 
reduce 
public 
spending 
increase, 
there 
are  also 
amplified 
demands 
for 
more 
social  benefits 
for 
the 
poor 
and 
vulnerable. 
Therefore, 
additional efforts 
are 
needed 
to 
prevent 
deeper 
impacts 
from 
the 
crisis through 
a 
more 
effective and 
self-operating 
safety 
net 
that 
ensures 
not 
only 
appropriate 
targeting, 
but 
also 
improves 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
social spending 
to 
protect 
the 
poor without 
distorting 
the 
macroeconomic  stability. 
Social Protection 
refers 
to 
a 
set 
of 
programs 
designed 
to 
help 
people 
or 
households 
to 
mitigate 
and 
cope 
with 
poverty 
or 
temporary 
income 
reductions  and 
consists 
of 
two 
components: 
(i) 
social 
assistance 
programs 
(transfers, 
subsidies 
and 
workfare 
programs)  designed 
to 
help 
people 
to 
moderate 
risks 
related 
to 
income reduction 
and 
poverty; 
and 
(ii) 
social 
safety 
net 
programs 
(old-age, 
health, 
and 
unemployment 
insurance designed 
to 
mitigate 
the 
risks 
of 
eventual 
income 
reductions). 
2. 
Based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
public 
investment 
programs, 
effective 
budget 
protection 
programs 
must 
not only 
consider 
the 
priorities 
regarding 
social 
programs, 
but 
also 
their effective 
implementation 
throughout 
the 
entire 
management 
process, 
notably: 
(i) 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
different 
components 
of 
the 
social 
public 
per 
capita spending 
(total, 
health, 
and 
education) 
is 
subject 
to 
greater 
fluctuation 
than 
the 
per 
capita 
GDP; 
and 
(ii) 
overall,  they show 
a 
pro-cyclical 
behavior. 
This 
Annex 
deals 
with 
the 
need 
to 
protect 
key 
items 
in 
the 
social spending 
budget 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
Government’s 
ability 
to 
promote 
an 
effective 
safety 
net 
and 
implement 
anti-cyclical 
policies. 
The 
proper 
operation 
of 
this 
network 
depends 
on 
appropriate 
funding 
(external 
and law-mandated 
internal 
resources) 
and 
permanent 
institutions 
(such 
as 
Investment 
and 
Development 
Funds) 
to 
accomplish 
quick 
disbursements 
when 
needed. 
Section 
2 
discusses the 
impact 
of 
structural 
reforms 
on 
public 
investment. 
Section 
3 
analyzes 
the 
Basic Social 
Spending, 
showing 
that 
social 
spending 
is 
volatile  and 
pro-cyclical, 
while 
total 
spending 
is 
more 
constant. 
Section 
4 
shows 
budget 
protection 
in 
relation 
to 
safety 
nets 
and 
identifies 
the selection 
criteria 
for 
the 
protected  and 
eligible 
programs. 
Finally, 
Section 
5 
addresses 
the 
expected results 
from 
budget 
protection. 
STRUCTURAL REFORMS 
AND 
THEIR IMPACT ON 
PUBLIC INVESTMENT 
3. 
During 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
Bolivia 
has 
been 
implementing 
structural reforms 
to 
set 
the  basis 
for 
a  sustained 
economic 
growth 
and 
social  development 
in 
a 
situation 
of 
economic  stability. 
As 
a result, 
public 
investment 
schemes 
have 
changed 
dramatically 
39 
Page  50
since  the 
1990s, 
with 
increases 
in 
public 
social  spending 
(Le., 
investment 
in 
health 
doubled 
during 
this 
period, 
and 
investment 
in 
education  almost 
tripled 
in 
the 
same 
period) and 
decreases 
in 
productive investments. 
Overall, 
investments 
in 
infrastructure 
remained 
relatively 
stable, 
but 
with 
increases 
in 
transport 
infrastructure 
(roads) 
which 
has 
become the 
main 
public 
investment 
item 
(refer 
to

The 
2003 
budget 
forecasts 
an 
increase 
in 
public 
investment 
to 
US$637 
million 
(similar 
to 
the 
level 
executed 
in 
2001). 
The 
aim 
is 
to 
implement 
an 
anti-cyclical fiscal 
policy 
in 
order 
to 
recover 
the 
aggregate  demand, 
while 
following 
the 
criteria 
of 
prioritizing 
social 
and 
road 
building 
sectors. 
Current 
public 
investment 
schemes 
are 
consistent 
with 
the need 
to 
target 
social 
spending towards 
the 
poor 
and 
follow 
the 
Bolivia 
Plan 
(Plan 
Obrus 
con 
Empleos). 
The 
main 
programs 
of 
this 
Plan 
are: 
(i) 
road 
infrastructure, 
(ii) 
housing 
construction, 
(iii) 
residential 
gas 
connections, 
(iv)  rural 
electrification, 
(v) 
irrigation 
systems, 
(vi) 
education, 
(vii) 
health, 
(viii) 
basic sanitation, 
(ix) 
productive 
transformation 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
- 
productive municipality, 
and 
(x) 
emergency 
work 
programs 
such 
as 
anti-cyclical 
measures 
to 
create 
jobs 
and 
income 
during 
economic contractions. 
5. 
Under 
the 
decentralization 
process 
launched 
in 
1994, 
the 
Bolivian 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(EBRP) 
and 
the 
National Dialogue 
Law 
(Ley 
del 
Didlogo 
Nacional 
2000) 
transferred 
responsibilities 
and 
competencies 
to 
regions 
and 
municipalities 
and 
thus, 
decentralized levels gained relevance 
as 
implementers 
and 
financial 
suppoters 
of

Basic

is 
allocated 
to 
services 
that cover 
the 
basic 
needs 
of 
the 
population, 
such 
as 
primary 
education, 
primary 
health 
care 
(immunization,  women 
and 
child 
health 
care, 
micronutrients) 
and 
basic water and sanitation  services. 
Basic social 
spending increased 
from 
US$605 
million 
in 
1995 
to 
US$970 
million 
in 
2002, 
which 
reflects 
an 
increase 
of 
3.3% 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP 
in 
the 
same 
period 
(refer 
to 
Table

The 
most 
significant improvement 
took 
place 
in 
capital 
expenditures: 
which 
increased 
to 
2% 
of 
GDP 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
current  expenditures 
in 
education  and 
rural 
development. Recurrent social expenditures increased 
to 
1.3% 
of 
the 
GDP 
during 
the 
same 
period, 
featuring 
outstanding  expenditure  increments 
in 
education 
and  health. 
Social 
spending 
levels 
also 
increased 
as 
a 
share 
of 
total public 
spending, 
from 
26.7% 
in 
1995 
to 
33.3% 
in 
2002. 
For 
2003, 
total

at 
US$976

Social 
public 
spending 
should 
show 
an 
anti-cyclical 
behavior. 
This 
means 
that 
it 
should 
increase 
during 
recessions 
to 
offset  decline 
in 
incomes 
and 
decrease 
during 
economic 
expansions. 
However, 
past 
performance 
shows that 
social 
spending 
is 
cut 
in 
the 
face 
of 
lower 
fiscal 
income. 
In 
per 
capita 
terms, 
social 
spending 
increased 
from 
US$81 
per capita 
in 
1995 
to 
US$130 
per capita 
in 
2002, 
which 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
2003 
projections 
(refer 
to 
Table 
5). 
Education 
features 
the highest spending 
level, 
reaching 
almost 
US$60 
per capita 
in 
2002, 
followed 
by 
health 
with 
US$36 
per 
capita. 
After 
the 
1999 crisis, 
per 
capita 
output 
decreased 
and 
although 
the 
social 
per 
capita spending increased 
up 
until 
2001, 
this 
trend 
could 
not 
be maintained 
in 
2002, 
showing 
a 
cyclical 
trend 
in 
social 
spending 
with

The 
failure  to 
prioritize 
and 
plan 
social  spending results 
in 
instability 
and 
in 
reduced 
efficiency 
in 
program 
implementation. 
The 
variability 
ratio7 
used 
reveals that 
both 
between 
1995 
and 
1998 and between  1999 and 
2002, 
social 
spending 
was 
less 
variable  than 
total 
spending  (refer 
to 
Table 
6). 
Broken 
down 
into  its 
components, 
volatility 
of 
the 
different 
items 
of 
social capital 
expenditures 
exceeds 
that 
of 
recurrent 
expenditures 
-which 
consist 
mainly 
of 
salaries 
and  feature 
rigidities 
regarding 
the 
variations 
of 
fiscal 
revenues. 
Social 
sectors 
show 
sharp 
year 
to 
year 
variations, due 
to 
the 
following 
main 
reasons: 
(i) 
the 
execution 
profiles 
of 
investment projects, 
which 
have 
specific 
life 
cycles 
(for 
example, 
Education 
Sector 
Reform), 
(ii) 
management 
implementation 
capacity, 
(iii) 
unstable  basic 
bidding 
and 
hiring 
standards, 
and 
(iv) 
discretional 
political prioritization 
in 
resource 
allocation. 
The 
struggle 
for 
resources 
based 
on 
the 
above 
mentioned 
features 
is 
intensified 
due 
to fixed 
budget 
ceilings 
that 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
macroeconomic  balance. 
These 
findings 
suggest 
that 
program 
protection must 
be 
carried 
out 
not only 
on 
an 
aggregate 
amount 
basis, 
but 
also 
on

Public 
investments 
also 
show 
little 
flexibility, 
since 
their 
funding 
sources 
are 
mainly 
external 
(62%) 
with  rigid 
standards, 
resource 
allocation 
procedures, 
and 
disbursement 
criteria.

33% 
of 
resources 
come 
from 
internal

that 
are

funds 
to 
externally 
funded

Only 
5%

Given 
the 
rigidity 
of

SOCIAL 
SAFETY 
NETS 
AND 
BUDGET 
PROTECTION 
12. 
Budget 
protection 
is 
required 
during 
fiscal 
stringency and 
contraction periods 
in 
order 
to 
minimize 
social 
costs 
involved 
in 
the 
adjustment 
and 
to 
protect social 
spending 
levels 
-in 
areas 
with 
high 
impact 
on 
human 
capital 
and 
on 
poverty 
reduction- 
from 
becoming 
fiscal 
adjustment variables 
to 
guarantee 
fiscal 
sustainability. 
During 
recent 
years, 
for 
instance, 
only 
levels 
executed 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
reforms 
were 
above 
those 
initially 
budgeted. 
During 
2002, 
however, 
the 
execution 
of 
this 
program 
amounted 
to 
only 
69% 
of 
the 
budgeted 
amount. 
For 
the 
Health 
Reform, execution 
comes 
close 
to 
the 
budgeted 
level only 
in 
2001, 
while 
year 
2000 
features 
a 
remarkably 
low 
execution level, 
even 
below 
50%. 
The 
Epidemiological 
Shield 
immunization 
program 
(escudo 
epidemioldgico, 
EE) 
shows 
relatively 
low 
execution 
levels, except 
for 
the 
Tuberculosis 
program 
(refer

The 
portfolio 
of 
Social Protection 
programs 
discussed 
initially 
was 
composed 
as 
14. 
The 
following 
program 
selection 
criteria 
were 
used: 
existing 
programs 
with 
effective implementation 
and 
budget execution 
with 
counter-cyclical performance potential; 
targeted 
programs 
with 
the 
potential 
of 
providing 
direct 
benefits 
to 
poor 
and 
vulnerable 
individuals 
and households; 
programs 
of 
sufficient 
scale 
and 
scope 
to 
reach 
significant 
numbers 
of 
beneficiaries; 
programs 
of 
clearly 
verifiable 
implementation 
and 
included 
in 
the 
national 
budget 
(financial 
information 
of 
investment 
projects 
implemented 
by 
municipalities 
is 
incomplete 
and available 
irregularly 
with 
a 
3 
to 
7 
month 
delay); 
(v) programs that 
promote income protection 
for 
the 
poor 
and protect 
them 
from 
losses 
of 
social 
gains 
in 
health 
and 
education; 
(vi) 
programs  that 
provide 
basic 
social 
services, 
which 
cannot 
be 
subject 
to 
reductions 
or interruptions 
during 
crisis 
given 
the 
resulting 
mid-term 
losses 
in 
human 
capital 
(primary 
education, 
immunizations, 
pre 
and 
post 
natal 
healthcare, 
communicable 
disease 
control 
programs, 
among 
others); 
(vii) 
programs 
related 
with 
EBRP 
and 
the 
Bolivia 
Plan (for 
instance, 
SUMI); 
and 
(viii) 
programs 
with 
a 
relative 
relevance 
regarding 
the 
public 
investment 
budget. 
Funding 
priorities 
for 
selected  programs 
in 
education,  health, 
and  social 
protection 
are 
based 
on 
fiscal 
sustainability 
criteria 
for 
the 
year 
2003 
47 
Page  58
consistent 
with 
the 
Financing 
Program 
agreed 
with 
the 
IMF. 
Such 
selected 
programs 
are 
priorities 
within 
the 
EBRP 
and 
the 
Bolivia 
Plan 
and 
their 
resources 
come 
from 
external 
sources 
(multilateral 
organizations,  such 
as 
the 
World 
Bank, 
IDB, 
and 
bilateral 
donors), 
domestic 
funds 
from 
the 
Central 
Government 
(TGN), 
and 
municipal 
and 
departmental 
resources. 
15. 
Based 
on 
these 
criteria, 
selected 
programs 
are: 
(i) 
Education: 
Educational 
Reform 
and 
the 
Social 
and 
Productive 
Investment 
Fund 
(FPS) 
Component 
in 
education. 
(ii) 
Healthcare: 
the 
Health 
Reform 
(includes 
the 
EXTENSA 
program), 
the 
Epidemiological 
Shield 
(Chagas 
Control 
and 
Epidemiological 
Surveillance, 
Tuberculosis  and 
Malaria 
Control), 
the 
Universal 
Mother-Child 
Health 
Insurance 
(SUMI) 
and 
the 
Expanded 
Immunization 
Program 
(PAI). 
(iii) 
Social 
Protection: 
The 
National 
Emergency 
Employment Plan 
(PLANE, 
Plan Nacional 
de 
Empleo de Emergencia). 
The 
selected 
programs 
account 
for 
41 
% 
of 
social 
public 
investment 
included 
in 
the 2003 
budget 
and 
thus 
protection involves 
a 
major 
share 
of 
social investment. Expenditures related 
to 
the 
selected 
programs 
include 
capital 
expenditures and 
non-wage recurrent 
expenditures, 
for 
instance, 
inputs 
and 
non-personnel 
goods 
and 
services. 
16. 
The 
following 
programs 
were 
not 
included: 
PROSIN: 
the 
Program 
is 
implemented 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and provides 
maternal and 
child 
care 
to 
reduce 
their 
morbidity 
and 
mortality. The 
Program 
is 
funded 
with 
external 
resources 
from 
the 
USAID 
and 
internal 
funds 
from 
the 
monetization 
of 
wheat 
donations 
(PL 
480), 
so 
its 
funding 
is 
completely 
covered 
for 
the 
year 
2003. 
In 
addition, 
this 
program 
is 
in 
its 
last 
implementation 
phase 
and 
its 
completion 
is 
expected 
in 
2004. 
PAN: 
The 
Small 
Child 
Care 
Program 
(up 
to 
five 
years) 
in 
the 
Health, 
Education, 
Nutrition 
and 
Protection 
areas 
is 
based 
on 
direct 
care 
provided 
in 
public 
child 
development 
centers 
and 
indirect 
care 
through 
family 
education 
promotion. 
It 
is 
run 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
the 
Presidency 
and 
its 
funding 
comes 
from 
external 
sources, 
such 
as 
the 
IDB, 
the 
World 
Food 
Programme, 
and 
the 
Italian 
Government. 
It 
was 
not 
considered 
in 
the 
programs 
to 
be 
protected, 
since 
the 
Government 
has requested 
the 
World 
Bank 
to 
redirect 
resources 
of 
this 
program 
to 
others 
with 
higher 
priority 
within 
the 
Health 
Sector. 
FPS 
/ 
Health 
Component: 
This 
program’s  budget 
accounts 
for 
a 
very 
low 
share 
of 
FPS 
(2%) 
and the Government 
decided 
not 
to 
include 
it. 
The 
Solidarity Bonus (BONOSOL) 
provides (non contributory) 
cash transfers 
to 
the 
elderly 
(65 years 
and 
up), 
thus 
becoming 
a 
protection 
for 
approximately 
360,000 
beneficiaries 
of 
this 
vulnerable 
segment. 
BONOSOL 
was 
established 
in 
1997 at 
annual 
Bs 
1,800 
(US$240) 
for all Bolivian 
residents 
who 
reached 
legal 
majority 
age 
(21 
years 
old) 
as 
of 
12/31/1995. 
This 
is 
a 
universal 
program,  since 
it 
covers 
the 
entire 
population,  even 
those 
covered 
by 
the 
pension 
scheme. 
In 
1998, 
this 
benefit 
was 
replaced 
by 
the 
BOLIVIDA, 
a 
program 
consisting 
of 
a 
benefit 
of 
approximately 
US$60 
that 
remained 
in 
force 
until 
2002, 
when 
the 
initial 
BONOSOL 
was 
reinstated 
for 
an 
amount 
of 
Bs 
1800 that 
will 
be 
kept unmodified 
until 
2008. 
In 
1997, 
funds 
allocated 
to 
BONOSOL 
amounted 
to 
US$90 
million, being 
reduced 
with 
the 
BOLIVIDA

Page  59
program to 
an 
annual 
average 
below US$30 
million 
between 1998 
and 
2002. 
For 
year 
2003, 
estimates 
amount 
to US$90 
million 
and sustain 
an 
anti-cyclical 
policy. 
Funding 
is 
extra-budgetary, since 
resources 
come 
from 
the 
return 
on 
shares 
of 
state-owned 
firms 
transferred 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
under  the 
capitalization 
process 
(Collective  Capitalization 
Fund), 
which 
are 
being 
privately 
managed 
by 
Pension 
Fund 
Administrators 
(AFPs, 
Administradorus 
de 
Fondos 
de 
Pensiones). 
This 
program 
was 
not 
included, 
because 
it 
is 
funded 
with 
private 
resources 
from 
the 
Collective 
Capitalization 
Fund 
(and 
accordingly 
is 
not 
registered 
in 
the 
national 
budget) 
and 
benefits the 
entire 
population, not 
only 
the 
poor. 
Clearing 
of 
Land 
Titles: 
The  Government  proposed the 
inclusion 
of 
this 
program, 
but 
finally 
it 
was 
agreed 
to 
protect 
it 
by 
restructuring 
the 
World 
Bank's 
portfolio 
and 
thus 
it 
was 
not included 
in 
the 
protected programs.

followed 
by 
an 
explanation 
of 
each 
program. 
Table 12 
shows 
the 
evolution 
of 
each 
protected 
program 
since 1999 
to 
date, 
with 
Educational 
Reform: 
This 
program 
was 
selected due 
to 
the 
strong 
impact 
that either a 
definite interruption 
or 
slowing down 
of 
its 
implementation 
pace 
would 
have 
on 
mid 
and 
long-term 
human 
capital 
development,  especially  among 
the 
poorest 
population. 
The 
amount protected 
to 
continue 
with 
the 
educational 
reform 
during 
2003 
is 
US$25.4 
million 
and 
covers 
all 
subprograms. 
This 
allocation 
means 
a strong 
effort 
for 
the Government and 
is 
included 
among 
its 
strategic 
priorities 
consistent 
with 
the 
EBRP. 
The 
amount 
protected 
exceeds 
the 
2002 amount 
by 
12% 
and a 
quarter 
of 
it 
has 
been 
funded 
with 
domestic 
resources. 
It 
is 
expected that 
three 
quarters 
of 
the 
program 
should 
have been executed 
by 
December 
31, 
2003, 
taking 
into 
account that the 
2003  management 
budget 
was 
only 
approved 
in 
April 
and that 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
bidding 
and 
hiring 
procedures 
requires 
at 
least 
three 
to 
five 
months. Expenditures 
related 
to  Instruction 
Consultants 
included 
in 
the 
Reform 
is 
reduced 
from 
US$10 
million 
-equivalent  to 
44 
% 
of 
expenditures executed 
in 
2002- 
to 
US$2 
million 
in 
2003, 
since 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Educational 
Reform 
funded 
with 
external 
resources 
has 
been 
completed. 
Social 
and 
Productive 
Znvestment 
Fund 
(FPS): 
This 
program 
was 
selected 
due 
to 
its 
complementary nature 
with 
the 
Educational 
Reform. 
Its 
purpose 
is 
to 
fund 
the 
national 
counterpart 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
schools, 
nuclear 
schools, 
and 
the 
support 
to 
education 
processes 
in 
coordination 
with 
municipal 
governments. 
FPS resources 
allocated 
to 
the 
Educational 
Reform 
comprise 
30% 
of 
the 
total 
budget 
executed 
by 
said 
Fund. 
The 
amount protected 
during 
2003 
is 
US$l8.8 
million. 
External 
credits account 
for 
78% 
of 
its 
funding. 
It 
is 
expected  that  100% 
of 
the 
program 
should 
have 
been 
executed 
by 
December 3 1,2003, 
taking 
into 
account that the amount 
foreseen 
for 
this 
year 
is 
less 
than 
the  amount  executed 
during 
the 
former 
year 
(US$22.7 
million) 
and 
that 
parts 
of 
the 
programs 
are 
already 
being 
carried 
out.

Healthcare 
Reform 
(includes 
Extensa): 
This 
program 
seeks 
to 
reduce 
maternal 
and 
child 
mortality 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
the 
poor. 
Services 
are 
targeted 
to 
rural 
areas 
through 
mobile 
brigades and equipment 
for 
facilities. 
This 
year, 
the new 
Extensa 
sub-program begins 
its 
operation. 
Total 
budget 
for 
the 
Healthcare 
Reform for 
2003 
is 
US$14.8 
million. 
If 
80% 
were executed, 
it 
would 
represent 
an 
almost 
threefold 
increase 
above 
the 
budget 
executed 
in 
2002. 
Mainly, 
said 
increase 
would 
be 
the 
result 
of 
the 
US$7 
million 
of 
the 
recently 
implemented 
Extensa. 
Epidemiological 
Shield: 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
program 
is 
to 
control 
certain 
main 
endemic 
diseases 
and 
to 
strengthen the 
epidemiological 
surveillance 
system. Diseases 
are: 
malaria, 
chagas, 
tuberculosis, 
dengue 
fever, 
leishmaniasis,  hemorrhagic  fever,  and 
others. 
In 
former 
years, 
these 
programs 
have 
featured 
low 
budgetary executions. 
For 
instance, 
only 
34% 
was 
executed 
in 
2000, 
72% 
in 
2001, 
and 
66% 
in 
2002. 
The 
current 
credit 
considers 
the 
protection 
of 
this 
program 
at 
a 
minimum 
execution 
level 
of 
80%, 
based 
on 
the 
components 
introduced  below: 
1) 
Chagas 
/ 
Surveillance. 
Chagas 
control 
and 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
the 
epidemiological 
surveillance 
is 
the 
major 
subprogram 
within 
the 
Epidemiological 
Shield 
and 
accounts 
for 
80% 
of 
the 
Program 
investments. 
For 
2003, 
the 
protected budget 
is 
US$5.86 
million, 
out 
of 
which 
80% 
comes 
from 
external 
resources. 
The 
minimum 
execution 
foreseen 
is 
80% 
for 
2003. 
The 
Chagas 
program 
however, 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
a 
100% 
execution, 
while 
the 
execution 
performance 
for 
the 
Epidemiological 
Surveillance 
will 
be 
lower 
due 
to 
delays 
resulting 
from 
the 
General 
National 
Budget 
(PGN) approval 
only 
in 
April 
and 
the 
bidding 
and 
hiring 
procedures that 
take three 
to 
five 
months. 
2) 
Malaria. 
The 
protected budget amounts 
to 
US$743,000 
for 
2003, 
totally 
funded 
with 
domestic 
resources. 
The 
minimum 
execution projected 
is 
75%, 
considerably 
higher 
than 
the 
2001 
and 
2002 
performance, 
which 
amounted 
to 
only 
33% 
and 
45%, 
respectively. 
In 
addition, 
the 
protected amount 
means 
a 
36% 
increase 
relative 
to 
the 
amount executed 
during 
2002.3) 
Tuberculosis. 
The 
protected 
budget 
for 
year 
2003 
is 
US$645,000 
with 
funding 
almost 
in 
equal 
parts 
by 
domestic and 
external 
resources. 
Minimum 
expected performance 
is 
85%, 
based 
on 
the analysis 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
former 
years. 
The 
performance 
of 
this 
program 
has 
been better 
in 
terms 
of 
execution, 
a 
level 
that 
this credit 
wishes 
to 
maintain. 
Universal 
Mother-Child 
Health 
Insurance 
(SUMI): 
Law 
2426 
created 
the 
SUMI, 
a 
national, universal, integral, 
and

program 
that 
provides 
healthcare 
benefits 
at 
the 
National 
Healthcare System and 
the 
National 
Short 
Term 
Social Security 
System 
level. 
It 
protects 
women 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
pregnancy 
until 
six 
months after 
delivery 
and 
children 
from 
birth 
until 
their 
fifth 
birthday. 
SUMI 
is 
a 
top 
priority  for 
the 
Government and 
is 
included 
in 
the 
Bolivia 
Plan 
and 
the 
EBRP. 
Funding 
is 
provided 
from 
TGN 
sources 
to 
support 
all 
human 
resource outlays, 
10% 
of 
joint 
tax 
resources 
for 
the 
funding 
of 
inputs, non-personnel 
services, 
and 
basic medications, 
and 
up 
to 
10% 
of 
the 
resources 
from 
the 
Special 
Dialogue 
2000 
account 
for 
the 
same 
purpose, 
when 
joint 
tax 
resources 
run 
short 
(Municipal 
Solidarity 
Fund). 
Article 
10 
of 
Supreme 
Decree 
No. 
26,874 
provides 
that 
7% 
of 
the 
joint 
tax 
resources 
will 
be 
allocated 
to 
fund 
the 
SUMI, 
and the 
remaining 
3% 
will 
be 
allocated 
to 
fund 
sanitary 
and 
basic sanitation 
infrastructure 
investments 
and 
other 
health 
programs. 
The 
protected 
resources 
amount 
to 
US$11.6 
52 
Page  63
million 
and 
the  execution 
foreseen 
for 
2003 
is 
75%. 
Since 
this 
is 
a  new  program, 
regulations 
to 
achieve 
total 
execution 
need 
to 
be 
completed. 
However, 
protected 
execution 
exceeds 
the 
amount executed 
in 
the 
2002 
Basic 
Health 
Insurance 
by 
3%. 
Expanded 
Immunization  Program 
(PAZ). 
This  program 
is 
aimed 
at 
reducing 
the 
incidence 
and 
mortality 
rates 
of 
diphtheria, 
whooping 
cough, 
tetanus, 
measles, 
tuberculosis, and 
poliomyelitis 
by 
means 
of 
immunization 
services 
targeted 
to 
children. 
PA1 
has 
two 
basic 
components: 
immunization 
voucher 
and 
provision 
of 
inputs 
(vaccines). 
Article 
27 
of 
the 
Budget 
Administration 
Law 
(Law 
2042) 
issued 
on 
December 
of 
1999 
provides 
that 
Social 
Safety 
Funds 
(Cajas 
de 
Seguridad 
Social) 
will 
allocate 
5% 
of 
their 
receipts 
to 
fund 
the 
purchase 
of 
vaccines. 
The 
protected budget 
amounts 
to 
US$4 
million 
for 
year 
2003*, 
which 
means 
a 
38 
% 
increase 
regarding 
the 
amount executed 
in 
2002, 
with 
no 
external 
funding. 
PLANE 
IZ 
is 
a temporary emergency employment 
strategy. 
Major 
components 
are 
the 
Service 
Employment 
Program 
(PES, 
Programa 
de 
Empleo 
en 
Servicios) 
for 
urban 
areas, 
and 
the 
Rural 
Employment Program 
(PER, 
Programa 
de 
Empleo 
Rural), 
which 
later 
on 
has 
become  the 
Works 
with 
Employment  Program 
(POE, 
Programa 
de 
Obras 
con 
Empleo). 
The 
PLANE 
I1 
Program provides 
funding 
for 
unskilled 
labor 
for 
projects or 
activities 
of 
public 
use. 
The 
second phase 
of 
the 
program 
started 
in 
2003, 
promoting 
better 
targeting 
and 
introducing 
transparency 
criteria 
in 
the 
selection 
of 
projects 
and 
beneficiaries. The 
minimum 
protected budget 
amounts 
to 
US$25 
million, 
a 
similar 
level 
to 
what 
was 
executed 
during 
the 
previous 
year. 
A 
performance 
of 
approximately 
100% 
is 
expected and 
funding 
is 
provided 
mainly 
through grants 
and 
external 
credit. 
EXPECTED 
OUTCOMES 
20. 
Program protection 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
the 
following 
outcomes: 
i) 
mitigate 
negative impacts 
resulting 
from 
the crisis; 
ii) 
continue 
increasing 
enrollment 
rates; 
iii) 
continue 
reducing 
maternal 
and 
child 
mortality 
rates; 
iv) 
mitigate 
the 
incidence 
of 
communicable 
diseases 
and 
malnutrition; 
and 
v) 
mitigate 
unemployment 
and 
poverty. 
21. 
In 
Education, 
keeping 
the 
reform 
during 
year 
2003 
will 
benefit 
at 
least 
1.2 
million 
pre-school and 
school-age 
children, 
through 
the 
execution 
of 
300 
PENs; 
training 
of 
5,000 
primary level 
teachers 
in 
bilingual 
education, and 
training 
of 
3,000 
principals 
in 
school 
management. 
The 
FPS 
- 
Education should implement 
128 
new 
PENs 
and also 
reach 
more 
than 
248 
municipalities 
with 
9 
17 
training,  equipment, infrastructure, 
and 
pre-investment 
projects 
to 
benefit 
662,000 
recipients. 
In 
Health, 
the 
consolidation 
of 
the 
reform 
shall 
expand  actions 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
30  mobile  medical 
units 
under 
the 
EXTENSA 
program; 3 
buses 
equipped 
for blood 
donations; 
59 
BRISAS; 
and 
the 
hiring 
of 
1,400 
local 
health 
promoters 
to 
assist 
1,400 
communities, 
with 
an 
average 
of 
200 
people 
in 
areas 
with 
high 
poverty 
concentration. 
The 
most 
important activities 
under 
the 
Epidemiological Shield 
will 
be 
the 
spraying 
of 
3 
16,000 
houses 
in 
chagas-infected 
areas; 
Protected spending 
excludes 
the 
vaccination

there 
is 
uncertainty 
whether 
it 
will 
be 
exclusively applied 
to 
the

BACKGROUND 
1. 
The 
economic 
decline, 
which 
began 
by 
the 
end 
of 
1998 
in 
Bolivia, 
had 
adverse 
impacts 
on 
employment. 
Open 
unemployment 
rates 
overall 
increased 
from 
4.33% 
in 
1999 
to 
5.24% 
in 
2001, 
while 
in 
the 
country’s 
major 
urban 
centers 
during 
the 
same 
period, 
these 
rates 
increased 
from 
6.1 
% 
to 
9.4% 
for 
the 
entire 
population 
and 
from 
6.9% 
to 
10.6% 
for 
women. 
2. 
The 
main 
factors 
that 
explain 
poverty 
increases 
in 
Bolivia 
between 1999 
and 
2001 
have 
been 
income 
drops 
in 
urban 
areas 
and 
increasing 
costs 
in 
rural 
areas. 
In 
constant 
terms, 
incomes 
fell 
by 
3.1% 
in 
urban 
areas 
and 
costs 
increased 
by 
0.6% 
in 
rural 
areas 
(refer 
to 
Bolivia 
poverty 
note, 
2002). 
3. 
These 
high 
unemployment 
rates 
were 
coupled 
by 
an  increase 
in 
informal 
employment. 
During 
2000, 
the 
informal 
sector 
accounted 
for 
69% 
of 
all 
urban 
and 
rural 
employment, 
including 
small agricultural 
and 
livestock 
producers 
on 
own 
lands. 
This 
percentage 
has 
increased 
relative 
to 
1997, 
with 
people 
formally 
employed 
(employees 
or 
employers) 
turning 
to 
the 
informal 
sector 
or 
to open unemployment. 
4. 
This 
employment  crisis 
and 
increasing 
unemployment 
rates 
have 
resulted 
in 
a 
drop 
in 
real 
income 
for 
the population, 
with 
severe 
consequences 
especially 
for 
poorer 
urban 
residents, 
who 
have 
minimum 
non-employment income 
options 
or 
none 
at 
all. 
5. 
The social 
crisis 
in 
Bolivia 
has 
led 
to conflicts 
that demonstrate 
the 
dissatisfaction 
of 
the 
population, 
who 
demands 
salary 
increases, 
higher 
investments 
in 
economic 
and 
social infrastructure, and 
opportunities 
for 
the 
poor. 
Mitigation 
of 
the 
Impact 
of 
Unemployment 
6. 
Given 
the 
current  economic  setting 
in 
Bolivia 
and 
considering 
that 
the 
efforts 
made 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
address 
this 
crisis 
will 
not 
have 
an 
impact 
perceivable 
as 
such 
by 
the 
population 
in 
the 
immediate 
or 
short-term, 
the 
emergency 
workfare 
strategy 
(PLANE) 
must 
continue. 
This 
strategy 
was 
implemented 
during 
2002  and 
had 
some 
satisfactory 
outcomes 
in 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
its 
main 
objective; 
the 
massive 
and 
timely 
coverage 
of 
poorer 
groups. 
7. 
This 
National 
Plan  for 
Emergency 
Employment 
(PLANE, 
Plan 
Nacional 
de 
Empleo de 
Emergencia) 
is 
an 
anti-cyclical 
mechanism 
that 
can be 
expanded 
or 
contracted 
in 
accord 
with 
economic developments. The 
flexibility 
of 
this 
workfare program 
is 
based 
on 
the  amount 
of 
PLANE’S 
monthly 
payment 
to 
the 
beneficiaries, 
such 
that 
if 
the 
economy 
recovers, 
they 
can 
shift 
to 
better options 
offered 
by 
the 
formal 
labor 
market 
or 
55 
Page  66
to 
other better 
paying 
alternatives. 
Consequently, 
the 
monthly 
pay 
offered 
to 
PLANE 
workers 
is 
the 
main 
self-targeting  variable 
and 
its 
major 
feature 
is 
an 
anti-cyclical 
program.

Bolivia 
Plan: 
In 
response 
to 
the 
national 
emergency, 
the 
political 
parties 
of 
the 
Government have 
agreed 
on 
the 
development 
of 
the 
so-called “Government 
of 
National 
Responsibility” 
based 
on 
a practical 
synthesis 
of 
the 
“Emergency 
Plan” 
and 
the 
“Working 
Plan 
- 
Bolivia 
for 
Bolivians.” 
This 
is 
called 
the 
BOLIVIA 
PLAN 
and 
its 
main 
purpose 
is 
to 
generate 
employment 
and 
promote 
growth 
and  development 
with 
social 
equity, 
acknowledging 
the 
right 
to 
participation 
and 
decision-making 
of 
all 
Bolivians 
citizens. 
The 
main 
aspects 
of 
this 
PLAN 
are 
as 
follows: 
Address 
unemployment 
-the 
major 
problem 
identified 
by 
Bolivian 
citizens- 
both 
in 
urban 
and 
rural 
areas, 
by 
means 
of 
three 
strategies: 
(i) 
investment 
policy 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
infrastructure 
works 
and 
basic 
services, 
residential 
gas, 
irrigation 
systems 
and 
rural 
electrification 
(workfare 
programs); 
(ii) 
promotion 
of 
private activities 
and 
investments 
through 
public 
and 
private 
funding 
mechanisms 
for productive 
and 
technological 
adjustment, 
market 
search, 
and accessible 
productive 
credits; and 
(iii) 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
development 
of 
tourism, 
eco-tourism 
and 
environment-related activities. 
Define 
a 
Governmental 
policy 
regarding 
gas 
and  hydrocarbons, 
their 
industrialization 
and massive 
consumption, 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
Bolivians. 
Revisit, 
improve 
and 
modify 
the 
capitalization 
process 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
nation.  Payment 
of 
“Bonosol” 
and 
studying 
the 
future 
channeling 
of 
the 
Collective 
Capitalization 
Fund 
as 
a 
funding 
mechanism 
for 
the 
investment 
in 
infrastructure  works 
and 
basic 
services. 
Additionally, 
reestablish 
railway 
services, 
with 
a 
rational 
focus 
on 
addressing 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
population. 
Develop 
a 
productive agricultural 
transformation 
policy 
to improve 
the 
living 
conditions 
of 
rural 
inhabitants 
and 
to 
strengthen 
agricultural 
firms, 
providing 
them 
with 
credit, marketing, 
and 
development 
opportunities. 
Implement 
a Governmental 
policy 
to 
improve 
education through 
the 
Futuro 
scholarship, education credits 
and 
conditions 
that 
allow 
universal 
and 
quality 
access 
for 
girls 
and 
youth 
of 
Bolivia, 
with 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
introduction 
of 
technology  and computer 
science 
services 
into 
the education 
process. 
Develop 
policies 
oriented 
towards 
implementing 
Universal 
Healthcare 
Insurance. 
Implement  a 
massive social 
housing construction 
program 
with 
subsidized 
credits 
and 
long-term 
funding. 
Decisively 
fight 
corruption 
through 
actions  that  strengthen the  Judiciary, 
enforce 
the 
law, 
and 
put 
an 
end 
to 
impunity. 
Immediately 
and deeply 
reform 
the 
Political 
Constitution 
in 
response 
to 
the 
legitimate 
demands 
and 
aspirations 
of 
all  Bolivian 
citizens, 
with 
the 
57 
Page  68
introduction 
of 
the 
Constitutional 
Referendum 
and 
other 
policies 
that 
secure 
effective citizen 
participation 
and 
decision-making 
powers. 
Develop 
actions 
for 
social, 
economic 
and 
cultural  inclusion 
of 
Quechuas, 
Aymaras 
and 
indigenous populations 
of 
the 
Amazon, 
Chiquitania 
and 
Chaco 
given 
our 
original 
indigenous 
roots, 
seeking 
unity 
in 
diversity 
and 
strengthening 
the 
city-countryside 
links. 
Secure 
the 
effective 
enforcement 
of 
women’s rights, equal 
opportunities 
for 
youth 
and 
fair 
treatment 
for 
the 
elderly. 
Acknowledge 
cultural 
power 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
our human 
development 
and 
a 
lever 
for 
political, 
economic 
and 
social development, 
with 
an 
emphasis 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
local 
cultures. 
11. 
Most 
of 
the 
options 
to 
overcome 
the 
Bolivian 
economic and social 
crisis 
require 
huge 
amounts 
of 
resources. 
Under 
Bolivia’s 
current 
scenario, these 
resources 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
obtain 
in 
the 
short 
term. Therefore,  other options  have been considered 
- 
which 
can 
be 
implemented 
with 
available 
resources- 
to 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
income 
drops 
on 
the 
poorest 
segments. 
The 
mechanisms that have been considered 
are 
to: 
(i) 
continue 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
national 
plan for 
emergency employment, 
plane, 
(ii) 
implement 
adjustments 
in 
the 
operational 
processes 
of 
municipal 
projects that have 
already been allocated 
resources, 
so 
as 
to 
hasten 
their 
implementation, 
or 
to 
modify 
the 
technical 
conditions 
to 
make 
them more 
labor-intensive;  and 
to 
(iii) 
make adjustments 
to 
the 
co-funding 
conditions 
of 
municipal 
investments. 
Resources 
to 
fund 
infrastructure 
projects 
intensive 
in 
unskilled 
labor 
will 
be 
sought 
in 
the 
medium-term.

These 
immediate 
and 
short-term 
options 
have 
been selected 
as 
components 
of 
the 
PROGRAMS 
TO 
BE 
SUPPORTED 
NATIONAL PLAN 
FOR 
EMERGENCY

- 
PLANE 
General 
13. 
PLANE 
is 
an 
anti-cyclical 
strategy 
to 
reduce 
the 
impact 
of 
income 
drops 
from 
employment 
losses 
on 
the 
country’s  most vulnerable population. 
Hence, 
PLANE 
funds 
the 
use 
of 
unskilled 
labor 
in 
the 
construction and 
development 
of 
community 
projects 
and 
activities, 
both 
in 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas. 
These 
projects 
arise 
from 
the 
need 
to 
improve 
the 
conditions 
of 
public 
infrastructure, 
especially 
those 
that 
have 
an 
impact 
on 
poorer 
communities. 
Some 
of 
the 
conditions 
and features that 
allow 
for 
the 
compliance 
of 
this 
purpose 
are 
the 
following: 
58 
Page  69
(a) 
PLANE 
offers 
a 
monthly 
pav 
of 
B$480 
per 
worker. 
This 
amount 
ensures 
self- 
targeting, 
so 
that 
beneficiaries 
are 
effectively 
the 
poorest 
segment 
of 
the 
population. 
This 
is 
not 
only 
related 
to 
the 
minimum 
wage  established 
in 
the 
country, 
but 
also 
to 
the 
distribution 
of 
wages 
for 
working 
age 
population, 
by 
income level. 
The 
Bolivian 
Government 
considers 
that 
this 
payment variable 
has 
been 
correctly 
estimated 
as 
a 
control 
of 
PLANE 
targeting  towards 
the  poorest 
population, 
since 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
those 
who 
access 
the 
program 
have 
no 
immediate 
or 
better 
income 
alternatives.  Furthermore, 
this 
feature  makes  the 
program 
anti-cyclical, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
if 
the 
economy 
recovers, 
better 
income 
opportunities 
will 
appear 
and 
PLANE 
beneficiaries 
will 
be 
able 
to 
access 
them. 
(b) 
PLANE 
benefits 
from 
unskilled 
labor 
for 
small communitv 
projects. 
Given 
their 
features, 
the 
projects 
funded 
by 
PLANE 
have 
very 
high 
efficiency 
levels 
regarding their 
implementation. 
These 
projects 
are 
prepared 
with 
simple 
profiles, 
assessed 
and 
approved 
under 
minimum 
compliance criteria, 
and 
easy 
in 
terms 
of 
beneficiary 
allocation, 
among 
other 
features. 
In 
addition, 
the 
different 
projects 
are 
selected, 
not 
only 
based 
on 
their simplicity, 
but 
also 
under 
community 
well-being 
criteria, 
so 
as 
to 
benefit 
the 
entire 
community 
involved. 
(c) 
PLANE 
is 
implemented under 
an 
external  operating  and 
institutional 
scheme. 
PLANE 
is 
controlled 
by 
a 
Funding 
Board 
(Directorio 
hico 
de 
Fondos 
-DUF), 
but 
its 
direct 
management 
and 
operations 
are 
outsourced 
to 
private 
institutions. 
This 
has 
facilitated 
its 
implementation, 
especially 
due 
to 
the 
considerable 
flexibility 
of 
the 
operation 
standards 
that regulate 
these 
institutions 
compared 
to 
those 
of 
public 
agencies. 
PLANE 
management 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
UNDP 
and 
the 
operation 
and 
intermediation 
is 
undertaken 
by 
three 
microcredit 
organizations 
called 
“wholesalers”, 
who 
have 
a 
direct relationship 
with 
program 
beneficiaries. 
(d) 
Implementation 
procedures 
have  been 
designed 
under  celerity-related  criteria. 
Project 
profiles 
are 
prepared 
by 
municipalities 
or 
prefectures 
according 
to 
their 
needs 
and 
possibilities 
and 
based 
on 
program 
conditions. 
These 
profiles 
are 
submitted 
to 
the 
offices 
of 
the 
wholesalers, 
who 
send 
them 
to 
management 
for 
their 
approval.  Once 
approved,  the 
beneficiaries 
are 
allocated 
to 
each 
project 
selected 
from 
a 
beneficiary 
database 
held 
by 
the wholesalers. 
Works 
must 
begin 
3 
days 
after  the 
notice 
to 
the  proponent 
(municipality 
or 
prefecture) 
has 
been 
delivered. Payments 
are 
made 
every 
two 
weeks based 
on 
the 
report 
issued 
by 
the 
supervisors. 
To 
authorize 
payment,  supervisors 
monitor 
beneficiary 
attendance 
and project 
progresses. 
The municipality 
is 
the 
implementing 
agency responsible 
for 
the 
project.

14. 
Based 
on 
the 
resources 
allocated 
by 
the 
ministry 
of 
finances 
through 
the 
VIPFE 
for 
each 
plane 
bidding 
procedure, the 
program’s 
managing 
agency 
(UNDP) 
estimates 
the 
budget 
ceilings 
for 
each  department 
and 
municipality’. 
Allocation 
criteria 
for 
these 
resources 
defined 
by 
the 
DUF 
will 
be: 
population, 
poverty 
map 
and 
project 
demand. 
However, 
the 
DUF 
accepts 
additional 
analysis 
and criteria 
from 
the 
manager 
to 
set 
the 
ceilings. 
15. 
Once  the 
ceilings 
have 
been established,  the 
manager 
can 
inform 
them 
to 
the 
municipalities 
and 
the 
population 
at 
large, 
in 
order 
to 
guide 
municipalities 
for 
optimum 
resource 
use. 
Dissemination 
will 
be 
supplemented 
with 
guidance 
material and 
events. 
Role 
of 
municipalities 
16. 
Implementing 
agencies 
pursue the 
main 
objective 
of 
channeling 
priority 
proposals 
submitted 
by 
the 
OTB 
(neighborhood 
boards, 
communities, 
joint 
communities), 
and 
guaranteeing 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
works. 
The 
implementing 
agencies 
may 
be: 
prefectures, 
underprefectures, 
office 
of 
the 
mayor, 
assistant 
office 
of 
the 
mayor, and other 
institutions 
of 
the 
executive 
branch. 
However, 
given 
the 
features 
of 
the 
plane projects 
and 
based 
on 
the 
lessons 
learned 
in 
plane 
i, 
the 
main 
implementing 
agencies  are 
the 
municipalities through 
the 
offices 
of 
the 
mayor. 
17. 
Keeping 
the 
principles, objectives 
and 
criteria 
of 
the 
plane 
in 
mind, 
municipalities 
must 
promote 
the 
participation 
of 
communities 
in 
project 
proposals 
or 
ideas, 
in 
accordance 
with 
eligible 
profiles. Municipalities, 
jointly 
with 
the 
organizations 
involved, 
will 
define 
the 
work 
priorities 
based 
on 
pre-established 
criteria. 
These 
criteria 
could 
be: 
location 
based 
on 
local 
poverty 
levels; 
urgent need 
for 
the 
works; 
type 
of 
issues 
to 
be 
solved 
with 
the works; 
types 
of 
project 
benefits; 
etc. 
18. 
Municipalities 
will 
receive 
technical 
support 
for 
the 
plane through 
the 
PAGM, 
to 
carry out  project 
preparation  and 
prioritization. 
Projects 
funded 
by 
the 
plane 
are 
not 
included 
in 
the 
municipality’s 
POA, 
and 
therefore  consist 
on 
a 
set 
of 
small 
and 
non- 
complex 
works 
highly 
beneficial 
for 
the 
municipality 
given their 
low 
requirement 
of 
counterpart 
funds. 
Projects 
can 
be 
implemented 
with 
inputs 
from 
the 
community 
and 
the 
support 
of 
the 
municipality 
in 
tools, 
equipment, 
etc. 
This  implies 
low 
costs 
for 
the 
municipality, 
no 
modifications 
to 
its 
budget, 
and 
little 
time 
for 
the 
request, 
among 
others. 
However, 
these 
projects 
can 
solve 
multiple 
local 
problems 
and 
thus 
be 
highly 
beneficial 
for 
the 
local 
development.

register 
with 
basic 
information 
(name, 
age,

etc.) 
And 
are assigned a 
code 
related 
to 
their location. 
This 
information 
is

them 
to 
the 
regional 
offices 
or 
the managing 
agency 
(UNDP) 
for 
their 
review, 
assessment, 
and 
approval. 
The 
UNDP

and 
submits 
the

Beneficiaries 
who 
will

are 
selected pursuant 
to

codes 
of 
the 
qualified 
project, 
so 
as 
to 
guarantee 
that 
they 
live 
in 
the project’s 
area. 
Beneficiary 
selection 
is 
carried out 
pursuant 
to 
the register’s 
chronological 
order. 
Beneficiaries 
sign 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
wholesalers, 
who 
pay 
them 
on 
a 
bi-monthly 
basis. 
24. 
Upon 
the

the 
compliance 
of

follow-up 
Environmental 
aspects 
26. 
Since the 
plane 
focuses 
on 
simple 
and 
small-scale projects, 
overall 
they 
show 
no 
environmentally related 
hazards. 
However, 
some 
projects, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas 
-such 
as 
irrigation, 
road 
openings 
and water 
dams- 
may 
have 
an 
impact 
on 
natural 
resources. 
27. 
To 
prevent,  anticipate, 
or 
mitigate  potential 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts, 
technical 
information 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
regarding 
the 
variables 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
different 
project profiles. 
This 
basic 
information 
will 
be 
part 
of 
the 
aspects 
reviewed 
by 
the 
supervisor. 
Protective 
measures 
to 
prevent the 
project 
from 
modifying 
favorable 
conditions 
previously found 
in 
the 
area 
of 
influence 
are 
mainly 
related 
to 
the 
preservation 
of 
natural 
resources. 
This 
means 
for 
instance, 
preventing 
water 
stagnation, 
protecting 
vegetable cover, 
and 
properly 
disposing 
of 
debris.

NATIONAL 
SOCIAL AND 
PRODUCTIVE 
INVESTMENT 
FUND 
- 
FPS 
29. 
The social 
emergency 
fund, 
FSE, 
began 
its 
operations 
in 
1987 
as 
a 
compensation 
mechanism 
for 
structural 
reform 
measures. 
Its 
main 
purposes 
were 
to 
reduce 
unemployment 
and 
increase 
household income. Starting 
in 
1991, 
this 
fund 
became 
the 
social investment 
fund 
-FIS-  that 
operates 
under 
three 
stages. 
The 
objectives and focus 
of 
the 
FIS 
are 
adjusted based 
on 
the 
priorities 
of 
social investment, 
such 
as: 
greater coverage 
for 
poverty  alleviation 
and 
the 
improvement 
of 
living 
conditions 
based 
on 
human 
development. 
30. 
The 
National  Dialogue  Law, 
issued 
in 
July 
of 
2001, 
was 
passed 
under 
the 
Bolivian 
Strategy 
for 
Poverty  Reduction 
(Estrategia 
Boliviana 
de  Reduccidn 
de 
la 
Pobreza 
- 
EBRP), 
as 
a 
basic 
guideline 
for 
EBRP 
management. 
This 
law 
improves 
the 
competencies  and 
capacities 
of 
each 
governmental 
organization 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
principles 
and  goals 
of 
the 
EBRP. 
Additionally, 
criteria 
applicable 
to 
resource 
reallocation 
among 
priority 
sectors 
have  been 
set; 
greater 
responsibilities  regarding 
resource 
use 
are 
devolved 
to 
the 
Municipal 
Governments; and 
a 
mandate 
is 
established 
for 
the 
investment 
in 
social 
and productive 
municipal 
programs  and projects,  thereby 
closing 
the 
gap 
proposed 
in 
the 
same 
EBRP 
between 
the 
economic 
and 
social 
agendas. 
3 
1. 
The 
Dialogue 
Law 
further 
defines 
the 
“National 
Compensation Policy”(Po1itica 
Nacional 
de 
Compensacidn 
PNC) 
that  “supports 
the 
Bolivian 
Strategy 
for 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
the 
Decentralization 
process, 
in 
order 
to 
arrange the 
transfers that 
under 
different 
schemes 
are 
provided 
by 
the 
National 
Government  and  Prefectures 
to 
the 
Municipalities, 
thereby 
promoting 
accountability 
and 
equity 
in 
transfers  allocated 
for 
public 
investment 
purposes 
...” 
32. 
This 
policy 
(PNC) 
modified 
the 
role 
of 
the 
National 
Fund 
for 
Regional 
Development 
(Fondo 
Nacional 
de 
Desarrollo 
Regional 
- 
FNDR), 
creating 
the 
National 
Productive 
and 
Social  Investment 
Fund 
(Fondo Nacional 
de 
Znversidn 
Productiva 
y 
Social 
- 
FPS) 
as 
“a 
not-for-profit, 
development 
and 
decentralized 
public 
law 
agency, 
structured 
as 
a 
former 
Social Investment 
Fund, 
under 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
President’s 
Office, 
with 
national 
competencies and deconcentrated operations. 
33. 
Basic 
FPS 
responsibilities 
are 
assigned 
under 
the 
legal  framework 
provided, 
mainly 
referred 
to 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources 
to 
all 
the 
municipalities. 
The 
formula 
developed 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Dialogue 
Law 
has 
been 
used 
as 
reference. 
Resources 
have been 
mainly 
directed 
to 
the poorest groups 
of 
the 
population, considering 
efliciency, 
transparency 
and 
equity 
criteria, 
and 
promoting 
decentralization improvement  through 
Institutional 
Development 
Programs 
for 
Municipalities.

34. 
Additionally, 
and 
under 
the 
law, 
the 
FPS 
is 
empowered 
to 
create each 
Country 
Department 
and 
Project 
Approval 
Departments, 
under 
legally 
defined 
basic mechanisms. 
Articles 
23 
and 
24 
define 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
DUF 
and 
its 
competencies 
related 
to 
the 
FPS 
and 
the 
FNDR. 
35. 
The 
role 
of 
the  FPS  focuses 
exclusively 
on 
the 
co-funding 
and decentralized 
implementation 
of 
programs 
and 
projects 
submitted 
by 
the 
Municipal 
Governments, 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
education, 
health, 
basic 
sanitation, 
rural 
energy, 
rural 
development, 
natural 
resources 
and 
the 
environment, 
as 
well 
as 
others 
considered  relevant 
by 
the 
EBRP. 
Likewise, 
the 
FPS 
facilitates 
the 
access 
and 
compliance 
of 
conditions 
for 
project 
funding 
through 
technical 
assistance  resources, 
based 
on 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
Municipal 
Governments. 
36. 
The 
FPS 
has 
a 
leading 
role 
and 
is 
therefore the 
main 
governmental 
funding 
tool 
for 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
municipal public 
investment 
projects, 
providing 
conditional 
resource transfers 
under efficiency, 
equity 
and 
transparency 
criteria. 
37. 
In 
August 
of 
2001, 
when 
the 
FPS 
began 
the 
application 
of 
the 
PNC, 
Municipalities 
submitted 
approximately 
6,000 
projects 
for 
which 
they 
requested 
funding, 
with 
a 
demand 
of 
more 
than 
US$ 
317 
million. 
The 
education 
sector 
accounts 
for 
55% 
of 
this 
investment 
demand, 
while 
25% 
is 
used 
in 
basic 
sanitation, 
15% 
in 
health, and 
5% 
in 
other 
projects. 
Cofunding Conditions 
38. 
Taking 
into 
account the 
difficulties 
that 
have 
been faced 
by 
municipalities 
in 
the 
compliance 
of 
the  counterpart 
funds 
required 
to 
access 
fps 
resources, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
adapt 
the 
pnc and 
improve 
funding 
and 
investment 
processes, 
a 
resolution 
of 
the 
national 
council 
of 
economic 
and 
social 
policy 
(consejo

social 
- 
conapes) 
modified 
the 
local 
counterpart 
fund 
rates 
for 
the  support 
of 
municipal 
level 
projects. 
The new 
counterpart 
rates 
are 
of 
20%,  15% 
and 
lo%, 
based 
on 
the 
sector 
and 
the 
5 
poverty 
ranks 
of 
the 
municipalities. 
Former 
rates 
ranged 
between 
50% 
and 
lo%, 
with 
most 
significant 
reductions 
being 
made 
in 
ranks

EMPLOYMENT 
PROGRAMS 
WITHIN 
THE 
SAFETY 
NET 
SUPPORT 
PROGRAM 
39. 
In 
order 
to 
support  the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
of 
Bolivia, 
certain conditions 
were 
agreed 
both to 
ensure  the 
implementation 
and 
compliance 
of 
the  goals 
of 
selected 
programs and 
to 
achieve 
appropriate 
coverage 
of 
target populations. 
The 
actions 
to 
be 
protected 
are 
directed 
towards 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups, 
to 
help 
them 
access 
a 
minimum 
income 
to 
cover 
basic 
needs. 
such 
as 
food 
intake.

Background 
for 
the 
Conditions 
of 
the 
PLANE 
I1 
40. 
According 
to 
the 
current administration, 
PLANE 
is 
the 
program 
with 
the largest 
immediate 
impact. 
It 
has 
also 
been 
assessed 
as 
an 
efficient 
response 
to 
the 
country’s 
social and economic crisis, 
which 
has 
had 
a 
major 
impact 
on 
the 
poorer 
segments 
of 
the 
population. 
During 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
the 
program, a 
mid-term 
assessment 
was 
initiated 
- 
concluded 
in 
August 
10, 
2002- 
which 
involved 
an 
operational  audit. 
Some 
of 
the 
conclusions 
of 
this 
assessment are 
as 
follows: 
General 
sense 
of 
transparency 
5 
1 
% 
of 
beneficiaries 
are 
women 
50% 
of 
beneficiaries have 
less 
than 
primary 
education 
37% 
of 
beneficiaries have more than 4 
children 
59% 
of 
beneficiaries 
are 
unskilled 
workers 
80% 
of 
beneficiaries have a 
monthly 
household 
income 
below 
what 
is 
provided 
by 
the 
PLANE. 
41. 
A 
preliminary 
impact 
assessment 
of 
PLANE 
I, 
made 
by 
the 
UDAPE, 
showed a 
positive impact 
on 
net 
income 
increases 
for 
beneficiaries. 
Also 
proven 
was 
the 
program’s 
self-targeting 
feature towards poorest 
groups, 
as 
beneficiaries 
used 
76% 
of 
the 
income 
to 
purchase 
food. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
limited 
information 
is 
available 
for 
the 
impact 
assessment, 
it 
can be concluded that the 
program 
has 
met 
the 
expectations 
both 
of 
the 
government 
and 
the 
population. 
42. 
The 
PLANE 
has 
been 
designed  under  special 
conditions 
(supported 
by 
an 
emergency 
decree), 
which allow 
for 
its 
quick 
and 
timely 
implementation. 
The 
operation 
scheme 
under 
private 
entities, 
under 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
DUF, 
has 
supported 
administrative 
management 
as 
well 
as 
implementation, 
beneficiary 
and 
project 
registration 
processes 
and 
payment. 
Background 
for 
FPS 
Conditions 
43. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
need 
to 
expand the 
income 
potential 
of 
the poorest groups 
and 
to 
provide 
additional  short-term 
alternatives 
besides  the 
PLANE 
(not  enough 
capacity 
to 
cover 
all 
the 
poor 
population),  the FPS 
should 
take 
some 
actions 
to 
support 
income protection 
for 
these 
groups. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
FPS 
should 
rely 
on 
an 
anti- 
cyclical 
mechanism 
to 
efficiently 
respond under 
crisis 
situations. 
44. 
For 
this 
purpose,  the 
FPS 
shall 
prepare  a 
proposal 
based 
on 
the 
“self- 
construction” 
experience 
implemented 
in 
the 
FIS 
I. 
This  program 
consists 
of 
work 
implementation 
by 
the 
community 
with 
the 
support 
of 
a 
local NGO. 
This 
method had 
the 
following 
successes 
(i) 
reducing  works’ 
costs, 
(ii) 
favoring 
the 
participation 
of 
beneficiaries 
in 
the 
service, and 
(iii) 
promoting 
the 
use 
of 
local 
labor. 
45. 
The 
feasibility 
of 
implementing 
these 
options 
will 
be 
analyzed, based 
on 
the 
size 
and  features 
of 
the

(maximum

and

specifications 
of 
the

as 
per 
type 
of 
project 
and 
applicable 
requirements 
and 
conditions. 
The 
proposal

Page  75
shall 
be 
prepared 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
looking for 
potential 
funding 
sources 
and 
their 
submission 
will 
be 
conditioned 
for 
the 
second 
credit 
disbursement. 
46. 
Additionally, 
the 
FPS 
will 
prepare 
a proposal 
to 
apply 
special labor-intensive 
interventions. 
For 
such purposes, 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
potential 
FPS 
database 
modifications 
will 
be 
made, 
-regarding 
labor 
performance 
and 
machinery restrictions- 
to 
replace 
them 
with 
unskilled 
labor. 
Background 
of 
the 
Conditions 
to 
Reduce 
Co-funding 
47. 
The 
National 
Compensation 
Policy 
(PNC) 
had 
set 
municipal 
investment 
ceilings 
to 
the 
charge 
of 
the 
external cooperation 
funds, 
through 
the 
application 
of 
a 
formula 
that 
combines 
population 
with 
poverty 
levels. 
Additionally, 
it 
had 
established 
municipal 
counterpart 
fund 
percentages, 
based 
on 
a 
municipality ranking 
and types 
of 
project, 
i.e. 
its 
applicability to 
a 
sector. 
48. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
FY 
2002, 
the 
municipalities 
expressed 
their 
concern regarding 
their 
lack 
of 
liquidity, 
due 
to 
which 
they 
were 
unable 
to 
meet 
their 
commitments 
with 
the 
FPS, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
additional 
load involved 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
new 
health 
insurance, 
the 
Universal Maternal-Child 
Healthcare Insurance 
(SUMI), 
which 
required 
extra 
municipal 
resources. 
49. 
This 
lack 
of 
liquidity 
also affected 
the 
FPS, 
since 
payments 
to 
contractor 
firms 
who 
implement 
the 
projects 
came 
both 
from 
external 
sources 
as 
from 
municipal 
counterpart 
funds. 
Payment 
arrears 
also 
impaired 
the 
normal 
flow 
of 
programmed 
disbursements. 
The  governmental 
response was 
the 
CONAPES 
Resolution 
of 
November 
7 
of 
2002, 
which 
set 
forth 
a 
reduction 
of 
municipal 
counterpart 
funds. 
50. 
The 
FPS 
decided 
to 
implement 
this 
measure 
as 
of 
FY 
2003, 
based 
on 
agreements 
with 
the 
municipalities 
and 
for 
those 
projects 
in 
stages 
prior 
to 
approval 
by 
the 
Departmental 
Committee 
of 
Project 
Approval 
(Comite' 
Departamentul 
de 
Aprobucidn 
de 
Proyectos 
- 
CDAP). 
5 
1. 
Potential 
benefits 
of 
counterpart 
fund 
reduction 
are: 
freeing 
municipal 
resources 
for 
other 
investments; 
reduction 
of 
arrears 
in 
counterpart 
fund 
payments 
to 
the 
FPS, 
allowing 
their payment 
to 
contractor 
firms; 
and 
faster 
work 
completion, 
which 
has 
an 
immediate impact 
in 
the 
hiring 
of 
unskilled 
labor. 
52. 
A 
potential 
risk 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
action 
is 
related 
to 
the 
conditions 
of 
certain 
credits 
regarding 
minimum 
local 
contribution, 
which could 
not 
be 
totally 
covered 
after 
the 
reduction 
of 
municipal 
counterpart 
funds. 
An 
assessment 
is 
being 
carried 
out 
to 
evaluate 
the 
incidence 
of 
this 
action 
per 
each 
effective 
credit.

Background 
1. 
Bolivia 
has 
achieved 
significant 
advances 
in 
health 
in 
the 
last 
few 
years 
following 
the 
implementation 
of 
an 
innovative 
package 
of 
reforms. 
From 
1996 
until 
2002, 
the 
coverage 
for 
attended 
deliveries 
and 
pre- -natal 
consultations 
for 
mothers 
has 
increased 
substantially. 
During 
the 
same 
period,  coverage 
for 
pneumonia 
and 
acute 
diarrheic 
diseases, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
coverage 
for 
vaccinations have also 
continued 
to 
increase.

These 
results have 
been 
possible 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
combination 
of 
policies, 
of 
which 
decentralization, 
management 
agreements 
and 
public 
health 
insurance 
stand 
out 
as 
particularly 
important, 
with 
minor 
advances 
in 
issues 
related 
to 
human 
resources 
and 
indigenous people 
participation. 
The 
Epidemiological Shield 
project 
has 
also 
been 
carried 
out and 
the 
programs 
of 
contagious 
diseases 
control 
have 
been reinforced. 
The 
current 
government 
has 
expanded several 
of 
these 
reforms 
and developed 
new initiatives, 
of 
which 
the 
Universal 
Mother 
Child 
Insurance 
- 
SUMI 
particularly 
stands 
out. 
Other 
reforms 
that 
are 
in 
early 
phases 
of 
implementation 
are 
the  Extensa 
program 
and the 
expansion 
of 
dialog 
and 
consensus 
with 
indigenous 
people. 
3. 
However, 
the 
economic 
crisis 
and 
the 
worsening 
of 
social 
conflicts 
are 
generating 
increased 
tensions 
surrounding 
some 
of 
these 
government 
initiatives. 
While 
SUMI 
has 
the 
opportunity 
to 
deliver additional 
direct 
benefits 
to 
the 
population, 
thus 
reducing 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
crisis, 
it 
implies 
a 
major effort 
of 
the 
municipalities, 
and doctors and 
health 
workers, 
some 
of 
whom 
are 
expressing 
objections. 
These  tensions 
demand 
new 
government 
responses 
that: 
(i) 
support 
the 
initiated 
reforms; 
(ii) 
maintain 
the 
goal 
of 
66 
Page  77
providing 
better 
services 
to 
the 
poor; 
and 
(iii) 
support the 
government 
in 
its 
effort 
to 
reduce 
social 
tensions. 
Assuring the budget 
for 
priority 
programs 
4 
The  economic 
and 
social 
crisis 
has 
generated 
an 
enormous 
tension  over 
the 
budget. 
In 
this 
context, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
guarantee 
that 
resources 
are 
available 
for priority 
programs 
in 
health; 
those 
interventions 
that reach 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population, 
that 
seek 
to 
protect 
the 
public 
from 
contagious and preventable 
diseases, 
that especially defend 
the 
poor 
and vulnerable 
groups, such 
as 
children 
and pregnant 
women. 
5. 
Additionally, 
with 
the 
change 
in 
the 
public 
insurance system 
from 
the  Basic 
Health 
Insurance 
(SBS) 
to 
the 
SUMI, 
some 
interventions 
that were 
previously 
partially 
funded 
by 
municipal public 
insurance 
funds 
now 
have 
to 
get 
funding 
from 
the respective 
national 
health 
programs; 
this 
is 
the 
case 
of 
tuberculosis 
and 
malaria 
treatment 
in 
adults, 
which 
are 
not 
covered 
by 
the 
SUMI. 
In 
this 
sense, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
assure 
financing 
for 
these 
national 
programs. 
6. 
A 
first 
group 
of 
activities 
that 
the 
government 
is 
determined 
to 
protect 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
SAC 
falls 
under 
the 
Extended  Program 
of 
Immunizations 
(EPI). 
Bolivia 
has 
achieved  great  improvements 
in 
its 
immunization 
coverage, 
which 
has 
increased 
among 
the 
poor 
in 
good 
proportion 
and 
has 
been 
effective 
in 
controlling 
some 
health 
risks, 
although 
in 
1999 
there 
was 
an 
outbreak 
of 
measles. 
The 
EPI 
has 
continually 
suffered 
from 
irregular 
and 
insecure financing, 
although 
up 
to 
now 
it 
has 
been 
able 
to maintain 
the 
supply 
of 
materials 
(vaccines 
and 
syringes) 
as 
well 
as 
develop 
the 
cold 
chain, 
which 
sustains 
the 
achieved 
coverage. 
The 
financing 
of 
the 
EPI 
has 
depended 
mainly  on 
donations 
and 
a 
contribution 
from 
Social 
Security, 
which 
currently 
comprises 
5% 
of 
its 
income, 
and 
unfortunately neither 
of 
these sources 
is 
a 
regular 
donor. 
7. 
Data 
indicates that 
the 
actual stock 
of 
vaccines 
(as 
of 
April 
2003) 
will 
cover 
needs 
up 
until 
the 
middle 
of 
this 
year 
and 
that new 
requests 
are 
being 
made 
to 
PAHO’s 
Rotating 
Fund, 
which 
need 
to 
be 
paid 
for. 
In 
this 
sense, 
guaranteeing the budget 
for 
this 
year 
is 
fundamental, 
and the 
government 
is 
acting 
positively 
in 
this 
sense 
by 
increasing 
the 
treasury budget 
for 
this 
activity 
from 
US 
$ 
3 
million 
in 
2002 
to 
US 
$4 
million 
in 
200310. 
8. 
The 
second 
important 
increase 
in 
budgetary 
protection 
within 
the 
Safety 
Net 
SAC 
are 
the programs 
oriented 
towards 
the 
control 
of 
contagious 
diseases: 
Chagas 
disease, 
tuberculosis 
and 
malaria. 
Chagas disease 
is 
financed through 
the 
Epidemiology 
Shield, 
which 
includes  other 
activities 
such 
as 
the 
reinforcement 
of 
epidemiologic  vigilance. 
These 
contagious 
diseases 
pose 
a 
danger 
on 
public 
health 
that 
principally 
affects 
the 
poor 
and 
unfortunately, 
control 
programs  have 
had 
an 
irregular 
operation 
in 
the 
past. 
Therefore, 
the 
government 
is 
also 
considering 
in 
the 2003 
budget 
exercise 
what 
resources 
are 
needed 
for 
these 
programs 
to 
sustain 
and 
increase 
their 
activities. 
lo 
We 
do 
not 
include 
the amount 
destined 
to 
the 
Vaccines 
Bond, 
that 
do 
not 
have effects 
on 
coverage. 
67 
Page  78
9. 
described 
below. 
A 
third 
program 
whose 
budget 
is 
proposed 
to 
be 
protected 
is 
the 
SUMI, 
which 
is 
10. 
Finally, 
the 
Health 
Reform 
program 
is 
proposed 
to 
be protected. 
This 
program, 
supported 
by 
a 
World 
Bank 
credit, 
is 
now 
in 
its 
second phase 
(APL 
2). 
It 
is 
designed 
to 
reduce 
mother 
and 
child 
mortality, 
and 
is 
specifically targeting 
the 
poor. 
At 
present, 
its 
principal 
component 
is 
the 
Extensa 
program 
(see 
next 
subheading), 
but 
it 
also 
includes 
additionally 
financing 
for 
EPI, 
strengthening 
of 
the 
information 
system, 
support 
to 
national 
programs,  and 
activities 
to 
support 
the 
cultural 
adaptation 
of 
health 
services, 
among 
others. 
The 
Extensa 
Program 
and 
the 
effort 
to extend 
services 
to 
rural 
areas 
11. 
The  Extensa 
Program,  whose 
budget 
is 
protected 
by 
the 
Health 
Reform, 
is 
a 
program 
designed 
to 
provide 
health 
services 
to 
rural 
and 
dispersed 
areas, 
where  the 
poorest 
and 
indigenous 
population 
is 
concentrated, 
and 
in 
which 
geographic 
distances 
pose 
a 
significant 
barrier 
to 
access. 
This 
program 
is 
key 
for 
the 
country 
to 
continue 
to 
increase coverage 
and 
reduce 
mother 
and 
child 
mortality, 
thereby 
effectively 
dealing 
with 
health 
problems that 
cause 
grave economic effects 
on 
families, especially 
during 
a crisis. 
12. 
Extensa  consists 
of 
the 
conformation 
of 
mobile 
health 
brigades 
(Brisas), 
composed 
of 
doctors, 
nurses 
and 
dentists 
who 
are 
based 
in 
health 
centers 
or 
local 
hospitals 
and 
attend 
the 
surrounding  communities. 
These 
brigades 
will 
connect 
with 
Asistes, 
local 
health promoters 
who 
carry out 
basic 
health 
promotion 
and organization 
activities 
in 
each 
community.  The program 
would 
also 
consider 
teams 
to 
reinforce 
the 
capacities 
of 
local 
hospital 
and 
health 
centers 
in 
the 
intervention 
areas. 
13. 
Extensa began 
its 
activities 
with 
the 
present 
government  and 
is 
currently 
in 
a 
phase 
of 
implementation 
and 
expansion 
of 
its 
coverage. 
Guaranteeing 
its 
budget 
will 
allow 
that 
the 
brigades 
and Asistes, 
(currently 
almost 
all 
of 
them 
are 
already 
hired) 
are 
maintained 
and 
equipped appropriately, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
health 
facilities 
in 
which 
they 
are 
based. 
14. 
Given 
that 
the 
program 
is 
geared 
towards 
providing 
health 
services 
to 
rural 
and 
indigenous communities, 
it 
is 
vital 
that 
the 
program 
develops 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
is 
flexible 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
community. 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
program 
has 
been selecting 
the 
Brisas 
and 
Asistes 
with 
participation 
of 
local 
communities 
and 
indigenous 
people 
organizations. 
In 
the 
framework 
of 
this 
program, 
this 
participation 
is 
going  to 
be 
formalized 
through 
the approval 
of 
a 
Manual 
stating that 
the 
Asistes 
will 
be 
chosen 
from 
the postulants presented 
by 
their 
communities 
and 
selected 
with 
its 
participation. 
The 
communities 
will 
also 
participate 
in 
an 
annual 
evaluation 
of 
their 
performance 
that 
will 
support 
the 
recognition 
of 
non 
pecuniary 
incentives. 
68

Management 
Agreements 
and 
Decentralization 
15. 
The 
Bolivian 
government 
began 
a 
significant 
and 
innovative 
decentralization 
process 
in 
1994. 
The 
decentralization, however, 
created 
certain 
challenges 
with 
respect 
to 
accountability 
and 
definition 
of 
responsibilities 
for 
health, 
between 
the 
different 
government levels. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
introduced 
the 
Management 
Agreements 
(or 
Performance 
Agreements) 
as 
a 
measure 
to 
keep 
and 
improve 
its 
relationship 
with 
the 
other 
levels 
of 
government. 
Thus, 
according 
to 
the 
commitments 
that 
the 
government 
assumed 
with 
the 
international 
cooperation 
related 
to national 
health 
goals, 
the 
Health 
Ministry 
has 
been 
signing 
Management  Agreements 
with 
the 
prefectures and Departmental 
Health 
Services 
(SEDES) 
since 
1999. 
This 
policy 
has 
helped 
to 
more clearly 
focus 
the 
government 
priorities 
in 
terms 
of 
health 
outputs 
and 
outcomes, 
align 
the departmental 
governments 
with 
these 
priorities, 
give 
transparency 
to 
the 
government plans 
and 
facilitate accountability. 
16. 
Although 
these 
Management 
Agreements, 
signed between 1999 and 
2002, 
have 
been 
the 
beginning 
of 
an 
important 
reform, 
they 
have 
also 
suffered 
of 
some 
deficiencies. 
The 
principal 
changes 
that 
must 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Management Agreements 
are: 
i) 
simplifying 
and 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
goals 
considered 
in 
them, 
particularly 
the 
process 
indicators, 
making 
the 
priorities 
and 
accountability  more 
clear; 
ii) 
establishing  clear 
criteria 
to 
set 
the 
goals; 
and 
iii) 
implementing 
a 
system 
of 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
the 
Agreements. 
The 
government 
has 
manifested 
its 
will 
to 
sign 
the 
Management 
Agreements 
and 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
mentioned 
changes. 
17. 
Additionally, 
the present 
government 
has 
made 
some 
modifications 
that 
could 
potentially 
make 
the 
decentralization 
process 
more  effective. 
The 
new 
management 
model 
establishes the 
Local 
Health Directory 
- 
DILOS 
as 
the 
local 
entity 
in 
charge 
of 
setting 
the 
political 
direction 
and 
strategic 
planning 
of 
health 
service networks, 
while 
a 
network 
manager 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
permanent 
operational 
management 
of 
the 
health service 
network. 
The 
DILOS 
consists 
of 
a representative 
from 
the SEDES, another 
one 
of 
the 
municipality 
and one 
of 
grassroots 
organizations (Comite's 
de 
Vigilancia). 
Its 
role 
is 
to 
approve 
the 
annual operative 
plans 
and 
the

The 
public 
health 
insurance 
has 
been 
the 
key 
strategy 
of 
the 
central 
government 
to 
affirm 
the 
national 
priorities 
through 
the 
decentralized 
system. 
This 
public 
insurance 
- 
in 
its 
various 
forms 
- 
is 
a 
policy 
that 
guarantees 
that 
all 
the 
population 
will 
have 
free 
access 
to 
a 
package 
of 
health 
care 
with 
public 
financing.. 
The 
financing 
comes 
from 
municipal 
funds 
earmarked 
for 
this 
purpose, 
placing 
municipalities 
in 
the 
role 
of 
payers, 
and 
using 
a 
fee-for-service payment mechanism 
. 
Next, 
we present a table that 
describes the

an 
important  opportunity 
to

necessities

is 
easier 
to 
understand 
and 
defend 
than 
one 
that 
only 
covers part 
of 
the 
risks. 
It 
is 
fundamental 
that 
adequate 
funding 
be 
made 
available 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
successful 
implementation 
of 
this 
component. 
20. 
The 
Universal Mother 
Child 
Insurance 
has 
introduced 
substantial 
changes 
in 
the 
financing 
system 
of 
the 
public 
health 
insurance. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
it 
has 
included 
in 
its 
financing 
not only 
part 
of 
the 
co 
participation 
resources, 
but 
also 
10% 
of 
the 
National 
Dialogue 
Account, 
released 
through 
the 
HIPC 
debt-relief 
initiative 
ll. 
This 
constitute 
the 
National 
Solidarity 
Fund 
and 
are 
not 
distributed 
per 
capita, 
but 
are 
given  to 
municipalities 
for 
which 
the resources 
of 
the 
10% 
of 
the 
co 
participation 
are 
not 
enough 
to 
cover 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
SUMI. 
21. 
This 
change 
brings 
some 
significant 
challenges 
for 
equity 
of 
access 
to 
the 
additional 
benefits 
and 
financing 
offered 
by 
the 
SUMI. 
First, 
it 
is 
probable 
that, 
because 
in 
the 
poorest 
and 
most 
rural 
municipalities 
there 
are 
more 
cultural 
and 
geographic 
barriers 
to 
access, 
these 
municipalities 
will 
never 
use 
up 
their 
coparticipation 
funds 
for 
the 
SUMI, 
and 
therefore, 
under 
the 
current 
rules, 
will 
never 
have 
access 
to 
the 
additional 
funds 
provided 
by 
the 
central 
National 
Solidarity 
Fund. 
Second, 
because 
the 
supply 
is 
more 
limited 
in 
rural 
areas, 
particularly 
for 
more 
complex 
care, 
which 
are 
the 
main 
interventions 
added 
to 
the 
public 
insurance, 
the 
rural 
population 
will 
have 
limited 
access 
to 
the 
additional 
benefits 
provided 
by 
the 
SUMI. 
22. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
take 
measures 
to avoid 
that  the 
National 
Solidarity 
Fund 
, 
financed 
by 
resources 
that 
were 
going to 
be 
distributed 
in 
a progressive 
way 
to 
the 
poorest, 
are 
now 
concentrated 
in 
the 
richer 
urban municipalities 
to 
cover 
more complex 
care 
that 
will 
not 
be 
utilized 
by 
the 
rural 
poor. 
23. 
Against 
this, 
there 
is 
the 
possibility 
to 
cover 
the 
transportation 
costs 
for 
hospitalizations, 
which 
would 
facilitate 
the 
access 
of 
rural 
population 
to 
second 
and 
third  level 
interventions 
in 
referral 
hospitals.  The  previous  experiences 
of 
public 
insurances, such 
as 
SBS, 
though they 
allowed 
the 
payment 
of 
those 
transport 
costs, 
they 
did 
not 
establish mechanisms that made 
it 
operative. 
In 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
program 
SAC, 
the 
government 
will 
design 
and 
approve a mechanism 
that 
would 
allow 
the 
payment 
of 
the 
transport 
of 
women 
and 
children, 
only 
from 
rural 
areas, 
to 
access 
second 
and 
third 
level 
services. 
In 
addition, 
the 
possibility 
that 
this 
mechanism 
works 
also 
as 
an 
incentive 
to 
good  health 
behaviors, 
for 
example  establishing 
that 
having 
4 
pre 
natal check-ups 
or 
all 
the 
vaccines 
is 
a 
requirement 
to 
obtain this 
subsidy, 
will 
be 
evaluated. 
The 
Dialog 
Account 
rises 
approximately 
US$ 
60 
millions 
per 
year, 
and according 
to 
law, 
it 
should 
be 
shared 
among 
the 
municipalities 
under 
a 
redistributive 
criteria 
(more 
resources 
for 
the poorest). 
With 
the 
SUMI 
law, before 
this 
repartition, 
it 
must 
be 
separated 
10% 
for 
the 
Solidarity National 
Fund 
of 
SUMI, 
but 
if 
they 
are 
not 
used 
they 
must 
be 
returned 
to 
the Treasury.

The 
strategy 
of 
native 
empowerment 
and 
cultural 
adequacy 
of 
the 
services 
24. 
The 
Bolivian 
government 
has 
been 
responding, 
in 
its 
health  policies, 
to 
the 
necessity 
of 
a larger 
participation 
of 
indigenous populations, 
whose 
organization 
and 
voice 
has 
increased 
in 
the 
last 
years. 
Among 
the  progress 
until 
now, 
there 
is 
the 
conformation 
and 
functioning 
of 
two 
permanent organisms 
of 
dialogue  between 
the 
Health 
Ministry 
and the 
indigenous 
and 
native organizations 
(CIBOD 
and 
CSUTCB), 
the 
acknowledgement 
of 
the 
need 
for 
the 
cultural 
adequacy 
of 
the services 
in 
the 
SUMI 
law, 
the 
participation 
of 
native 
organizations 
in 
the 
selection 
of 
Asistes 
in 
the 
Extensa 
program 
and the 
agreements 
with 
native 
organizations 
for 
the accreditation 
of 
traditional 
doctors 
12. 
25. 
Several 
of 
these 
initiatives 
will 
have 
to 
be 
developed 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
Innovative 
reforms 
being 
worked 
on 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
native 
organizations, 
include: 
the 
accreditation 
of 
traditional 
doctors, 
the 
introduction 
of 
inter-cultural 
and 
traditional 
medicine 
in 
the 
education 
curriculums 
of 
health 
professionals 
and 
the 
development 
of 
a vademkcum 
of 
traditional 
medicines, that 
are. 
26. 
In 
the 
short 
term, 
a 
theme 
that 
has 
been 
considered fundamental 
is 
the 
cultural 
adequacy 
of 
the 
health 
sector’s 
childbirth 
services. 
Many 
native 
women 
do 
not 
seek 
pregnancy 
controls 
and 
do not 
give 
birth 
with 
help 
of 
public health 
services, 
because 
they 
have 
demands 
related 
to delivery 
that 
are 
not 
respected. 
These 
include 
the 
position 
they 
wish to 
be 
in 
for 
childbirth,, 
the 
company 
of 
relatives 
or 
the 
devolution 
of 
the placenta. 
The 
government 
has 
elaborated a 
Pregnant 
Woman’s 
Rights 
Charter, 
which 
includes their 
rights 
to 
attention 
with 
no 
charge, 
a good treatment 
and 
the 
respect 
for 
their 
cultural 
practices. 
In 
the 
framework 
of 
this 
program, 
the 
government 
has 
committed 
itself to 
sign 
a 
ministerial 
resolution approving 
this 
Pregnant 
Woman’s 
Rights 
Charter and 
to 
develop 
a 
culturally 
appropriate dissemination program, 
through 
radial 
spots 
and videos 
that 
will 
be 
transmitted 
in 
the 
health 
centers 
in 
Spanish, 
quechua, 
aymara 
and 
other 
native 
languages. 
The campaign 
will 
also 
include 
an 
awareness 
initiative 
for 
health 
personnel, 
including 
posters 
in 
the 
health 
centers, 
and 
printed 
material 
directed 
to 
the 
health 
personnel. 
This 
measure 
will 
make 
it 
easier 
for 
poor 
and 
native 
women 
to 
access 
the 
SUMI, 
reducing  their 
health 
risks 
and 
their 
expenditures 
in 
giving 
birth, 
which 
are 
currently more 
expensive 
due 
to 
the 
crisis.

AND 
REFORMS 
BACKGROUND 
1. 
In 
the 
early 
1990s, 
about 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
was 
illiterate 
and 
55 
percent 
was 
functionally 
illiterate. 
Most 
lived 
in 
rural 
areas 
where 
female 
illiteracy 
was 
nearly 
50 
percent. 
The 
gross 
coverage 
of 
public primary 
education 
ranged 
from 
60 
percent 
in 
rural 
areas 
to 
87 
percent 
in 
urban 
areas. 
On 
average, 
the 
adult 
population had 
4 
years 
of 
schooling, 
only 
37 
percent 
finished 
primary 
school, 
and 
9 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
in 
rural 
areas 
attended  one 
year 
of 
school 
beyond 
the 
primary 
level. 
While  not 
many 
children 
entered 
school, 
even 
fewer 
continued. 
Of 
children 
enrolled 
in 
primary 
school, 
only 
43 
percent 
of 
urban children 
and 
11 
percent 
of 
rural 
children 
continued 
beyond 
the 
fifth 
grade. These 
indicators 
revealed 
a 
system 
plagued 
by 
gross 
inefficiencies, 
difficult 
access, 
and 
poor 
quality. 
In 
addition, 
the 
share 
of 
government expenditure 
on 
education 
was 
low 
and generally 
skewed 
toward 
higher levels 
of 
the 
system. 
In 
1991, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
started 
considering 
and 
discussing 
reform 
in 
the sector. 
The 
reform 
effort 
began 
in 
1994 
and 
has 
since 
been 
supported 
by 
successive 
administrations 
as 
state 
policy. 
EDUCATION 
REFORMS 
OF 
THE 
PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT 
2. 
The 
Educational 
Reform 
Program 
(PRE) 
was 
established 
by 
the 
National 
Law 
No. 
1565 
of 
July 
7, 
1994. 
The 
conceptual 
framework 
and 
actions 
of 
the 
Program coincide 
somewhat 
with 
the proposals 
formulated 
by 
various 
social organizations 
that 
participated 
in 
the 
National 
Congress 
on 
Education 
which 
preceded 
the enactment 
of 
the 
law. 
3. 
During 
the  decade 
of 
its 
implementation, 
PRE 
has 
profoundly 
transformed 
the 
education 
system 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
(i) 
curricula 
for 
primary 
education, 
which 
have 
undergone  three 
cycles 
of 
development, 
to 
respond 
to 
basic 
learning 
needs; 
(ii) 
restructuring 
of 
the 
national 
educational 
system; 
(iii) 
strengthening 
of 
central 
administration 
and decentralization 
of 
management 
to 
municipalities; 
and 
(iv) 
community 
participation 
in 
the 
educational 
process. 
4. 
Initially 
in 
the 
mid-1990s, 
the 
reform 
focused 
on 
the 
transformation 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
educational 
system, 
improvement 
of 
the 
pedagogical 
quality,  and 
development 
of 
human 
resources 
in 
education. 
The 
next 
steps 
in 
education 
reform 
aimed 
at: 
(i) 
enhancing 
community 
participation 
in 
the 
educational 
process 
through 
the 
participation 
of 
parents, 
teachers, 
nucleus 
and 
district 
principals 
in 
education 
development 
programming 
at 
the 
level 
of 
municipalities  (PROME) 
and 
in 
education 
projects 
implemented 
at  the 
level 
of 
nuclear 
schools 
(PEN); 
and 
(ii) 
strengthening 
management capacities 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
The 
latter 
institutional 
development 
of 
district 
managers 
at 
the 
municipal level 
as 
the 
local 
operators 
of 
the 
education 
sector has 
helped 
to 
increase 
access 
to 
schooling and 
to 
decrease 
the 
attrition 
rates 
of 
female 
students 
in 
73 
Page  84
rural 
areas. 
Toward 
the 
late 
1990s, 
preliminary 
analysis 
on 
the 
situation 
of 
secondary 
and 
higher 
education 
was 
undertaken. 
5. 
Achievements 
of 
the 
reform 
program. 
By 
2001, 
after 
eight 
years 
of 
implementation, 
the 
illiteracy 
rate 
had 
decreased 
to 
13 
percent. 
In 
rural 
areas, 
only 
26 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
were 
illiterate 
(nearly 
11 
percentage 
points 
lower); 
in 
urban 
areas 
only 
7 
percent 
were 
illiterate. 
The 
youth literacy 
rate stood 
at 
94 
percent, 
or 
three 
percentage 
points 
above 
the 
average 
of 
the 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean region. 
(However, 
overall 
illiteracy 
remained 
higher than 
the 
average 
of 
the region.) 
In 
terms 
of 
enrollment, 
the 
gross 
coverage 
of 
primary 
education 
rose 
to 
108 
percent, 
and 
the 
net 
coverage 
rose 
to 
97 percent 
for both 
girls 
and 
boys, suggesting that 
Bolivia 
was 
very 
close 
to 
providing 
equal educational 
opportunity. 
Further, 
the 
completion 
rate 
and the 
graduation  rate 
increased 
while 
dropout 
rates 
decreased. 
The 
above  achievements 
reflected 
the 
effects 
of 
increases 
in 
public 
resources 
allocated 
to 
the 
sector 
over 
the 
period 
1990-99. 
The 
allocation 
increased 
to 
US$192 
million 
in 
1999, 
from 
US$78 
million 
in 
1990. 
It 
also 
reflected 
another 
effect 
of 
the 
reform, 
the 
growing 
interest 
of 
parents 
in 
the 
education 
of 
their 
children. 
6. 
Curriculum 
transformation 
is 
under 
implementation 
in 
primary 
education. 
Currently, 
instruction 
in 
the 
first 
and 
second 
cycles 
(grades

follows 
the 
new 
core 
curriculum, 
while 
curricular transformation 
is 
beginning 
in 
the 
third 
cycle 
(grades 
6-8). 
The 
internal efficiency 
of 
the 
public 
school system 
has 
also 
improved 
considerably. 
From 
1997 
to 
2000, 
the 
average 
number 
of 
years 
required 
to 
complete 
grade 
5 
has 
been reduced 
from 
11 
years 
to 
7 
years, 
while 
the 
proportion 
of 
students 
completing 
grade 
8 
in 
rural 
areas 
has 
increased 
from 
8 
percent 
to 
29 
percent. 
In 
urban 
areas, 
the increase 
in 
grade 
8 
completion 
has 
been 
from 
29 
percent 
to 
64 
percent. 
In 
school management improvement, 
the 
implementation 
of 
1,194 
Educational  Improvement 
Projects 
has 
involved 
all 
3 
14 
municipal 
governments, 
which 
supported 
participatory planning 
and 
the 
municipal level 
and 
mobilized 
and 
organized 
district 
and 
school 
principals, 
teachers, 
parents and 
students. 
There  have 
also  been 
achievements 
in 
specific 
areas 
such 
as 
the 
introduction 
and 
expansion 
of 
bilingual 
education, 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
an

REFORMS 
OF 
THE

GOVERNMENT 
7. 
Strategic Sectoral 
Plan. 
To 
reach the 
international 
goals 
of 
the 
Fast 
Track-EFA 
initiative,  which 
seeks 
to 
reach 
a 
90 
percent 
completion 
rate 
in 
grade 
8 
by 
2015, 
the 
government 
has 
been 
formulating 
a 
long-term 
sector 
plan 
(2003-2010) 
which 
incorporates 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
Education 
for 
All 
@FA) initiative 
and the 
needs 
of 
the 
productive 
sector and 
the 
labor market 
within 
socio-cultural context 
of 
the 
country. 
To 
reach 
consensus 
on 
the 
plan, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
will 
undertake consultations 
with 
stakeholders, 
who 
are 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
educational 
process 
and 
can 
make 
more 
viable 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
plan 
proposals. 
Financing 
for 
the  programs

8. 
EFA 
Fast 
Track 
Initiative. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
the strategic sectoral 
plan 
and the 
financing 
proposal 
to 
access 
resources 
from 
the 
EFA 
Fast 
Track Initiative, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
includes 
Beca 
Futuro, 
as 
an 
alternative 
incentive 
for 
families to 
increase 
the 
attendance 
level 
and permanence 
for 
their 
children 
at 
the 
primary 
level, 
which 
is 
also 
consistent 
with 
the 
national 
and 
international 
goals. 
To 
date, 
this envisioned 
conditional 
cash 
transfer 
program 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
scholarships targeted 
to 
the 
very 
poor 
is 
in 
active 
debate 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
VIPFE, 
and 
UDAPE, 
and 
consensus 
on 
the 
design 
of 
targeting 
mechanisms, 
financial 
sustainability, 
ownership 
at 
the 
municipal 
level,  and 
counter-cyclical 
character 
will 
be  achieved 
through  further 
consultation 
and 
discussion over 
the 
coming 
months. 
(Owing 
to 
this 
time 
constraint, 
the 
program 
was 
not 
incorporated 
in 
the 
matrix 
as 
a specific 
activity 
of 
the credit.) The 
Bank 
will 
be 
actively 
engaged 
in 
the 
conceptualization 
process, 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
policy 
advice  and technical 
assistance 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
which 
is 
preparing 
the 
Government’s 
proposal 
for 
the 
EFA 
Fast 
Track 
initiative 
in 
which 
this 
scholarship 
program 
will 
be 
a 
significant 
component. 
9. 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy. 
Consistent 
with 
the 
Strategic 
Sector  Plan,  the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
is 
preparing 
a proposal 
to 
adjust 
the 
Bolivian 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
(BPRS), 
to 
harmonize  the 
goals 
and 
targets 
outlined 
in 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Summit 
- 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs) 
- 
into 
the 
updated 
BPRS. 
With 
the 
possibility 
of 
participating 
the 
Education 
For 
All 
Fast 
Track Initiative, 
the sector 
is 
well 
advanced 
in 
terms 
of 
prioritizing 
the 
actions 
needed 
to 
attain universal 
primary 
completion. 
10. 
Of 
grave concern 
is 
emerging 
evidence that 
to 
cope 
with 
the 
pressures 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
crisis, 
the 
poor 
are 
withdrawing 
children 
from 
school 
(Annex 
3). 
Government 
data 
for 
the 
three 
years 
of 
2000, 
2001,  and 
2002 
show that 
enrollment 
of 
children 
from 
the 
poorest 
income 
quintile 
has 
declined 
from 
84 
percent 
to 
80 
percent; 
regular 
attendance 
in 
school 
by 
children 
from 
the 
poorest 
families 
has 
also 
shown  a 
similar 
decline. Unless 
addressed 
in 
time 
by 
adequately targeted 
measures, 
the 
decline 
may lead 
to 
irreversible decline 
in 
the 
human 
capital 
of 
the 
poor. 
EDUCATION 
REFORM 
ACTIVITIES 
IN 
THE 
SAC 
11. 
Budget 
for 
education 
reform 
program. 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
this 
reform 
is 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
school  education  and 
to 
increase the  coverage 
of 
public 
education, 
which 
is 
developed 
through 
the 
upgrading 
of 
the 
management capacity 
of 
the 
National 
Education 
System 
(SEN), 
and 
through 
the 
composition 
and 
generalization 
of 
a 
curriculum, 
that 
will 
strengthen 
citizen 
participation. 
This 
program 
has 
a strong 
impact 
on 
the 
development 
of 
human 
capital 
over 
the 
medium 
and 
long 
term. 
The 
poorest 
populations 
in 
the 
urban 
and 
peri-urban 
areas 
is 
the 
most 
impacted 
since 
they 
do not 
have 
as 
much 
access 
to 
private 
education 
(i.e., 
provided 
by 
mission 
church-subsidized 
schools) 
as 
the 
rural 
poor.

The 
final 
implementation 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program 
(ERP) 
will 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
current 
fiscal 
year (2003). 
During 
the 
year, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
will 
focus 
on 
specific actions 
to 
consolidate and 
complete 
the 
first-phase. 
The 
subsector 
budget 
programmed 
for 
FY 
2003 
is 
aimed 
at 
complying 
with 
the 
following 
objectives

13. 
To 
ensure 
the 
continuation 
of 
programmed 
education 
reform 
activities 
in 
2003, 
the 
budget 
of 
US$25.4 
million, which 
covers 
all 
sub-programs, 
must 
be 
protected. 
This 
protected amount 
is 
12 percent 
more 
than 
the 
budget 
amount 
of 
2002. 
It 
is 
expected that 
by 
December 31,2003, 
the 
program 
will 
have been executed 
at 
a 
minimum 
of 
75 
percent. 
This 
level 
of 
performance 
is 
based 
on 
the 
fact that 
the 
budget 
for 
the 
2003 
is 
already 
delayed 
by 
one 
quarter 
(the 
national 
budget 
was 
approved 
only 
in 
April) 
and an estimate 
that 
the 
bidding 
and 
contracting activities 
of 
the 
year 
will 
require 
at 
least 
three 
to 
five 
months 
to 
complete. 
14. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year, 
the expected results 
are 
the 
following: 
at 
least 
1.2 
million 
school 
children 
benefited, 
5,000 
primary 
teachers 
trained 
in 
bilingual 
education, 
and 
3,000 
school 
principals 
trained 
in 
school administration.

15. 
Budget 
for 
education 
quality 
improvement 
program. 
This 
program 
complements 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Education 
Reform 
Program. 
It 
will 
finance 
the 
national 
counterpart 
for 
school construction 
and 
for 
selected 
pedagogic 
training 
and other 
activities 
supported 
by 
municipal 
governments. 
The operation 
of 
this 
program,  US$18.8 
million 
for 
2003, 
constitutes 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
budget 
executed 
by 
the 
national 
social 
productivity 
fund 
(FPS) 
and 
is 
financed 78 
percent 
from 
external 
sources. 
By 
December 
31, 
2003, the 
program 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
executed 
in 
100 
percent, 
as 
this 
year’s 
budget 
is 
substantially 
less 
than last 
year’s 
execution 
(US$22.7 
million) 
and 
many 
of 
this 
year’s 
subprojects 
are 
already  under 
implementation. 
The 
expected 
results 
are 
917 
projects 
at 
the 
level 
of 
nuclear 
schools, 
consisting 
of 
563 subprojects 
for 
school infrastructure, 
299 
for 
training, 
37 
for 
equipment and 
18 
for 
pre-investment 
studies. 
16. 
Strategic 
sectoral 
planning. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
is 
preparing 
the 
Strategic 
Sectoral Plan. 
Some 
actions 
identified 
in 
the 
preliminary 
proposal 
to 
accelerate 
progress 
in 
reaching 
the 
goal 
of 
universal 
primary 
education 
include 
increasing 
the 
hours 
dedicated 
to 
learning, the 
substitution 
of 
non-trained 
teachers 
with 
professional 
teachers, 
and 
demand-side 
grants 
focused 
on 
poor  families 
in 
urban 
areas 
to 
avoid 
children 
dropping-out 
of 
school. 
Implementing 
the 
plan 
implies 
not 
only 
increased 
public 
investment 
but, 
especially, 
an increase 
in 
current 
expenditure. 
Financial 
sustainability 
is 
a 
concern 
that 
is 
currently 
being 
addressed 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
UDAPE, 
the 
social 
policy 
research agency 
of 
the government. 
17. 
For 
the 
release 
of 
the 
first 
tranche 
of 
the 
credit, 
a 
timetable 
must 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Bank 
for 
consultation 
with 
members 
of 
the 
National 
Congress 
for 
Education (which 
includes 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society) 
on 
the 
technical 
proposal 
for 
developing 
the 
PES. 
For 
the 
release 
of 
the 
second 
tranche 
of 
the 
credit,  the 
draft 
PES 
must 
have 
been 
submitted 
for 
consideration 
of 
the 
National 
Congress 
for 
Education. 
18. 
Options 
for 
school-age 
children at 
risk. 
To 
begin 
to 
address 
the 
deterioration 
in 
school 
attendance 
of 
children 
from 
the 
poorest 
families, 
the 
Social 
Safety 
Net 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
requires 
that 
further 
steps 
be taken 
to 
analyze 
the emergent trends and 
to 
plan 
appropriate 
responses. 
This 
will 
involve 
the 
identification 
of 
high-risk 
populations,  especially 
the 
poorest 
children 
at 
the 
primary 
level 
and 
the 
working 
teenagers 
at 
the secondary 
level. 
For 
the release 
of 
the 
first 
tranche 
of 
the credit, terms 
of 
reference 
of 
an 
empirical 
study 
on 
school 
attendance 
must 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Bank. 
For 
the release 
of 
the 
second 
tranche,  a 
report 
on 
the 
findings 
and 
policy 
recommendations 
for 
targeted 
interventions 
identified 
for 
reversing 
the 
downward 
trend 
must be 
presented 
to 
the 
Bank.
