The lessons\n            learned indicate that it is generally agreed that volatility\n            (and periodic intra-year cuts) in funding for social\n            protection programs should be avoided since it leads to\n            inefficiency and ultimately substantial costs in terms of\n            lost human capital development in the medium term. The use\n            of well-defined indicators associated with the expected\n            results helps not only the implementation of the credit, but\n            the targeting of actions by the Government. The Social\n            Safety Net Structural Adjusment Credit (SSNSAC) focused\n            attention on a few well-selected programs that were closely\n            aligned to the overall goal of the program-social protection\n            in a time of fiscal constraints. A structural adjustment\n            operation that involves a process of relatively complex\n            change, such as the establishment of an effective social\n            safety net, will be difficult to implement on an operational\n            level. To improve the results of education and health\n            services and of social protection programs and expand access\n            to the most vulnerable populations (often indigenous\n            peoples), awareness and training activities should be\n            expanded through dialogue and focus groups mechanisms\n            promoting the reduction of cultural impediments to accessing\n            services. Technical assistance should be provided for the\n            development of information systems, within the Information\n            and Administrative Modernization System (SIGMA), so that\n            better decisions can be adopted on the use of public\n            resources and their follow-up at all levels of Government."}, "docdt": "2004-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
