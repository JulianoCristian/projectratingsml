        irrigation water supplies on the numerous small rivers\n            located throughout Madhya Pradesh to supplement limited and\n            erratic rainfall. The project would also provide the basis\n            for better water management in the State. It would\n            furthermore improve the data base for planning future\n            irrigation projects in Madhya Pradesh. The project would\n            consist of: construction, over a five-year period, of medium\n            irrigation projects throughout the State; flow monitoring\n            and evaluation studies; water management areas; training of\n            management staff; technical services for the planning and\n            design of the distribution system; and demonstration farms\n            for irrigated agriculture. The project would increase\n            agricultural production and the standard of living of the\n            farmers in Madhya Pradesh. The risks under the proposed\n            project are those normally associated with irrigation\n            projects in India."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
