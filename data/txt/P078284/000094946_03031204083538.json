environmental impacts of\n            Kabul-Salang-Doshi and Pole-e Khomri-Kunduz Roads. The\n            impacts on land resources and land use may result in\n            unstable mountain slopes, avalanche, and falling rocks; as\n            well as land degradation and erosion due to improper\n            disposal of cut and borrow material. Roads built on mountain\n            slopes accumulate rainwater runoffs, causing potential\n            erosion problems. Irrigation channels within the road's\n            right of way may damage the pavements. There may be\n            groundwater and surface water pollution during construction\n            and maintenance. Spillage and leakage from motor vehicles\n            could have negative effects. Additional dust and noise\n            levels are expected during construction. To mitigate these\n            impacts, specific measures will be taken to reduce the\n            potential impacts of physical works, including devising\n            acceptable safety measures, designs to limit erosion\n            problems in flat plain zones and mountain roads, and\n            incorporating traffic safety designs and improved access\n            points for villagers living along the roads. In the civil\n            aviation component, clearance of landmines is the most\n            important safety issue facing the Kabul Airport."}, "docdt": "2003-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
