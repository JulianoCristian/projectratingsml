   SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OFAFGHANISTAN
       FOR THE EMERGENCY TRANSPORT REHABILITATIONPROJECT


A. Introduction
1.      The following is a proposed supplemental grant o f SDR 29.9 million (US$45.0
million equivalent) to Development Credit 3735-AF ( Emergency Transport Rehabilitation
Project, ETRP), to permit financing the completion o f all project components as originally
intendedand documented inthe Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the ETRP. A major
civil works component not yet awarded i s the rehabilitation o f the Taloqan - Faizabad
secondary road, which serves the country's northeastern region and i s the main access from
Takhar andBadakhshan Provinces to Kabul.

B. Background
2.     Project Obiectives and Description. The ETRP was prepared during FY2003 and
Credit 3735-AF for SDR 80.0 million was approved on March 11, 2003. The Credit became
effective on July 14, 2003. The closing date o f the Credit i s June 30, 2007. The project's
main development objective i s to facilitate the country's economic and social recovery
through improved physical access to goods, markets, and administrative and social services.
The project encompasses the following main activities: (i)removing key transport
bottlenecks that seriously hamper economic recovery; (ii)   building capacity inmanagement,
implementation, and maintenance o f transport services and works through the provisions of
equipment and technical assistance related to planning, maintenance and supervision o f
works; and (iii) assisting in the establishment o f an institutional and policy framework for
the sector for sustainable service delivery.

3.     Alinnment with TSS. The Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS, March 2003)
puts forward priorities for the IDA financial and non-financial assistance based on the areas
of comparative advantage o f IDA. Under this strategy, IDA i s focusing on four strategic
areas: (i)Improving livelihoods; (ii)Fiscal strategy, institutions, management; (iii)
Governance and public administration reform; and (iv) Enabling private sector development.
The project contributes to reconstruction objectives in the above items (i) (iv) directly,
                                                                             and
andwill facilitate economic growth, through improved access and efficient transport.

4.     ImpZementation and Disbursement. Implementation o f the ETRP i s well underway
and actual disbursements have generally been above appraisal projections. All major
contracts except one (Taloqan - Faizabad road rehabilitation) have been awarded, and
physical progress i s generally as per implementation plan. The total project disbursements as
of March 15, 2005 were SDR 48.5 million (60.6%), against a projected disbursement o f
SDR44.5 million.

5.     Institutional Framework. The Ministry o f Public Works (MPW) i s responsible for
implementation o f the roads components and the Ministry o f Transport (MOT) for the civil
aviation components. The two ministries have been supported by international consulting
firms in the preparation of studies, design o f rehabilitation projects, preparation o f bidding

                                             - 4 -

documents, biddingand contract award, and for construction supervision. The Government's
central procurement unit assisted by international procurement consultants has provided
valuable support to both ministries in facilitating the adoption o f a transparent bidding
process for the civil works, goods and consulting contracts. With some minor exceptions, the
two ministries have been able to satisfactorily manage project implementation in a very
difficult environment. Relations betweenMOTIMPW and the IDA have been good and have
been focused on the practical resolution o f the institutional, financial, operational, security
and technical problems that the two agencies have faced duringproject implementation.

6.      De-mining Activities.     There is additional de-mining necessity to make Kabul
International Airport (KAIA) a safe airport for civilian air traffic and related ground
activities.  The UN Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (UNMACA), the responsible
agency for the mine clearance activities in ETRP, reported a much higher density o f mines
than expected and higher costs for clearance at appraisal. It i s necessary to remove the
remaining mines within the new perimeter fence and make all areas o f the airport available
for civilian development.

7.      Securitv Situation. In June 2004 one o f the ETRP contractor's camps was attacked,
and 11 employees o f the contractor lost their lives.       Immediately after the attack, the
Government agreed to provide additional security for all ETRP road works to avoid a
recurrence o f similar incidents. The security situation has not only entailed security related
expenses but also diminished the interests o f international contractors to participate in
bidding for reconstruction works in Afghanistan. Inadequate competition is the primary
reason for higher costs o f civil works and some implementation delays.

C. ProposedSupplementalGrant
8.      Project Fundinn Gap. Largely due to higher costs o fworks contracts inAfghanistan,
and high de-mining and security-related expenses, the project i s facing a considerable
funding shortfall. The proceeds of Cr 3735-AF are already fully committed. The higher than
expected civil works costs together with necessary variation orders have already fully
exhausted the project's contingency fund. Without additional funding, rehabilitation work of
one important secondary road (Taloqan - Faizabad road) which provides access to the
Takhar and Badakhshan Provinces cannot go ahead. The increased scope o f de-mining for
KAIAmustbe coveredfor safety reasons. Also, the requirements for the activities originally
envisaged inthe scope of ETRP, such as capacity building, transport sector review and other
studies, andmaintenance support, have increased beyond what the credit contingency i s able
to provide, thus there is a need for additional funding o f these activities. At the time o f the
TSS preparation, it was assumedthat sufficient resources from other donors would fully fund
the transport sector needs. However, notwithstanding the funding provided by USAID,
Japan, Sweden andNorway, a financing gap still exists.

9.      For over a year, the Government and IDA have tried to mobilize additional funding
for the ETRP from a number o f regional development banks and other development partners.
Recently, USAID agreed to finance one section o f the Taloqan - Faizabad road with the
understanding that IDA would provide the balance of funds needed to complete the Project
works. The USAID hnding, together with the proposed supplemental grant, would allow the
full scope ofthe ETRPto be completedas originally foreseen, including therehabilitation of

                                              - 5 -

the critical Kunduz - Taloqan - Faizabad road. The co-financing arrangements have been
discussed and agreed with USAID. The section from Taloqan to Kishem (68 km) would be
funded by IDA. USAID would provide parallel co-financing for the section from Kishem to
Faizabad(105 km).

10.     Amount of Suvplemental Grant.        The proposed supplemental grant o f SDR 29.9
million (US$ 45 million equivalent) would fund: (i) rehabilitation of the Taloqan -
                                                         the
Kishem section o f the road from Kunduz to Faizabad, including construction supervision and
associated mine clearance and security measures related to that road; (ii)additional
rehabilitatiodmaintenance o f the Kunduz - Taloqan road, that has deteriorated since the
appraisal o f ETRP; (iii)  additional de-mining requirements inthe civilian areas o f the Kabul
International Airport and other project areas where clearance o f mines and Unexploded
Ordinance (UXO) has proven to be much more expensive than expected; (iv) capacity
building, transport sector review and other related studies, andmaintenance support; and (v)
contingency for unforeseen costs.

11.     The following tzble shows a summary of the estimated revised project cost. IDA
allocation for Afghanistan for FY 2005 i s US$ 285 million equivalent, o f which US$ 175
million are in IDA grant. The lending operations approved so far in FY 2005 have fully
absorbed the allocation o f IDA credit. Therefore, the proposed supplemental funding would
be on IDA grant terms.

12.     Implementation Arrangements.         Present implementation arrangements, including
those for procurement, disbursement, financial reporting and auditing, will continue for the
project works to be funded by the proposed supplemental grant. The closing date o f Credit
3735-AF has been extended to June 30, 2007, to enable completion o f the entire project.

                                               - 6 -

The civil works procurement for the road contract (Taloqan - Kishem) i s currently
underway, and the bidding result i s expected in May.         The civil works component is
expected to start inJuly 2005.

13.     Environmental and Social Aspects. None o f the civil works financed by the ETW
will entail major environmental impacts and require special mitigation measures. This is
because the civil works cover mainly the rehabilitation of existing roads within the existing
right-of-way. All investment projects implementedby M P W under the credit are subject to
an environmental impact review and an Environmental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP) for impact monitoring during implementation. The ETRP's PAD and D C A define
the guidelines for the implementation o f such a review and management plans which,
whenever required, are carried out by external consultants in the context o f the preparation
studies and design o f each individual project. The ESMP for Taloqan - Kishem Road
Rehabilitation has been prepared following the agreed framework as laid out inAnnex 13 o f
the PAD for the ETRP, and are made available. This is inline with the requirements o f the
ETRP to mitigate potential impacts during construction and operation, and to address road
safety issues.

14.     Sustainabilitv. IDA i s presently supporting the Government in the context o f the
ongoing civil service reform, and has provided analytical support (funded by SIDA) for
adoption o f a transport sector strategy that will address institutional restructuring, policy
reforms and capacity building. Key in this respect will be the acceptance o f sustainable
arrangements for future maintenance of the key road network sections which have
exceptionally high annual operating and maintenance costs. The Kabul - Salang - Doshi
road and the Taloqan - Faizabad road are included inthis category due to tunnel operations
and winter maintenance costs. A toll financed road operation and maintenance (O&M)
concession framework has in principle been accepted by MPW as the way forward where
traffic volumes are highenough.

15.     Risks. The proposed supplemental grant faces the same implementation risks as the
ongoing project. These include: (i) and unexploded ordnance are not effectively
                                       mines
cleared from the project area; (ii) low institutional capacity in MPW and MOT; (iii)       the
Government's ability to disburse project funds in a timely fashion; and (iv) project funds for
maintenance could be misused or not managed effectively and transparently. These risks
have been and will be mitigated by: (i)  application o f mine clearance policy following the
framework presented in the ETRP PAD; (ii)      provision o f training, TA and contracting out
maintenance works; (iii) proactive supervision by the Kabul based IDA Disbursement Team
through weekly work-out sessions with the Special Disbursement Unit o f the Treasury and
the DAB; and (iv) the Government's strong commitment to accountable and transparent
financial management arrangements.

16.     Benefits. The benefits o f the proposed supplemental grant will mainly go to the
population of Takhan and Badakhshan Provinces in lower costs o f goods and services and
better access to social and economic services. In addition, the road slated for rehabilitation
is expected to enhance the future regional trade dimension since the Governments o f
Afghanistan and China has recently signed an agreement to develop a transit route through
Afghanistan (Faizabad-Taloqan road), which i s about 800 km shorter than the existing

                                             - 7 -

Pakistanroute. The Economic Rate o f Return(ERR) for the Taloqan - Kishemroad section
has been estimated at 22.6 percent, and its Net Present Value (NPV) discounted at 12percent
i s estimated at US$20.9 million.

17.       There are already considerable improvementsinthe mobility and travel time between
Kabul and Taloqan. This is due to: (i)repairs to the tunnel, snow galleries, bridges and
retaining walls which are mostly completed across the mountains; (ii)repairs and
maintenance o f severely deteriorated road sections including the initial grading works o f the
Taloqan-Kishem road section; (iii)    installation o f temporary bridges and construction o f new
ones to facilitate movements o f traffic; and (iv) improved winter road maintenance financed
by the credit. For communities along the road, traffic safety is enhanced, and accessibility
will continue to gradually improve over the coming years. Rehabilitation work is also
ongoing at Kabul Airport; by summer 2005 the runway will be fully opened for night time
flights, with a new permanent airfield ground lighting system and Instrument Landing
System (ILS). This will improve the capacity as well as safety at the airport. Based on these
achievements and the overall status o f the ETRP, it i s expected that the Development
Objectives o f the project will be achieved successfully.

18,       Justification of the Supplemental Grant. Consistent with the original development
objective, the supplemental grant will ensure the rehabilitation and extend the useful life o f
the country's main road infrastructure assets to the extent that was originally foreseen. The
proposed supplementary grant meets the requirements o f OP13.20 on supplemental
financing as follows:
(a) During the course o f project implementation, the extensive de-mining activities and
     additional security arrangements, and the higher construction cost due to higher
     perceived risks and inadequate competition have increased the project cost, and these are
     due to exceptional circumstances beyondthe borrower's control.
(b) Overall project implementation progress has been satisfactory. All implementing
     agencies have performed their responsibilities, activities ina satisfactory manner, and the
     Government i s incompliance with all the credit covenants o fthe ETRP.
(c) The Kunduz - Faizabad road provides a critical link to the Takhar and Badakhshan
     provinces. To drop this critical road link from the project scope would significantly
     affect the ETRP's ability to achieve its objectives. Also, reducing the security and de-
     miningactivities wouldjeopardize the completion ofthe ongoing contracts.
(d) The Government was unable to obtain additional financing for the remaining ETRP
     activities from other donors involved in the sector except for co-financing offered by
     USAID.
(e) The processing o f the supplemental grant will help ensure continuity, and avoid the risk
     o f disruption and loss o f momentum caused by insecurity and delay o f de-mining
     activities.
(f) The Borrower remains fully committed to the objectives o f the ETRP, and the
     implementing agencies have demonstrated competence inimplementing the project. This
     i s also demonstrated by the disbursement figures.

                  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF TALOQAN-KISHEMROAD

1.INTRODUCTIONAND SUMMARY

1.      The Taloqan-Faizabad Road Project involves improvement and upgrading o f the
entire length o f 173 km. The road is located in the North Western Region o f the country.
The proposed IDA financing will fund the Taloqan-Kishem portion (about 68 km) o f the
road. The rest, Kishem-Faizabad (105 km), will be funded by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID). The economic analysis covers the Taloqan-Kishem
(68 km), Le. for the portion financed by IDA.

2.      The economic analysis was conducted using the Highway Development and
Management (HDM-4) Model. The model simulates life cycle conditions and costs and
provides economic decision criteria for multiple road design and maintenance alternatives,
based on a survey o f road characteristics, traffic, and agency and user costs. The analysis
entails the comparison o f the incremental economic costs and benefits that the rehabilitation
of the road corridor brings to the transportation system in Afghanistan, and consequently to
the country's ability to make a speed recovery. Both costs and benefits are calculated in
economic values for the situation with and without project to generate the annual incremental
costs and benefits during the project life.

3.      The overall Economic Rate o f Return (ERR) for the project i s estimated at 22.6
percent, and the Net Present Value (NPV) discounted at 12 % i s estimated at US$20.9
million. Benefits and costs are the NPV o f the incremental benefits and costs from carrying
the improvements envisaged inthis project (with-project scenario), as compared to letting the
road deteriorate' without doing major improvement except some routine maintenance and
patching (without-project scenario). The project's economic benefits provide an indication o f
the robustness o f the project and its potential for contributing to the country's economic and
social recovery, and more broadly for establishing the foundation for the country's economic
development andpoverty reduction efforts.


2. PROJECT ANALYSIS DETAILS
 A. Introduction
4.      Inthe past two decades, road infrastructure inAfghanistan has been almost entirely
destroyed. Afghanistan had 18,000 kilometers o f road prior to the outbreak o f war. These
pre-war roads are in poor condition and require comprehensive reconstruction work. Some
6,000 kilometers o f access roads were built duringthe war, mainly from districts to villages -
these roads are technically unsound and often non-operational.                As part o f road
reconstruction, some de-mining activities will be required, especially around bridges where
mines are likely to be concentrated as a result of being washed down by rivers and winter


                                              - 12-

thaws. The importance o f roadnetworks to the reconstruction and rejuvenation o f a country's
economy are many and varied. Improvedroads will:

       0   Facilitate aid community efforts to access target areas;
       0   Facilitate communication andoverall developmento f a country;
       0   Save travel time between production and consumption centers;
       0   Facilitate access to markets (both intemally and regionally);
       0   Enhance market efficiency bybetter distribution, accelerated delivery, etc.
       0   Reduce capital investmentneeds due to reduced wear-and-tear;
       0   Facilitaterepatriation;

B. RoadConditionandTraffic
5.         Table 1 provides road condition and traffic count in the sections proposed for
financing by IDA. The existing road condition was investigated by topography, pavement
condition, and road roughness surveys. The current condition i s very poor, with many
sections requiring substantial reconstruction. The current level of International Roughness
Index on the non-asphalt sections i s about 20. The targeted level of IRIis set at 3.0.

6.         Classified traffic volumes on the Project road were determined from traffic surveys
undertaken in2003 and updatedin2004. The traffic counts were undertaken over a period o f
12 hours between 6am to 6pm on a week day. These survey results were normalized through
the applicationof seasonal factors to obtain annual average daily traffic (AADT) for thebase
year. Traffic growth rates adopted for the evaluation are 4% per annum for passenger
vehicles and 5% per annum for freight vehicles for the 20 year analysis period.

7.         Vehicle Operating Costs and value of time. Prices for representative vehicle types
and operating costs were collected via a series o f short interviews and surveys held with
truck drivers, private vehicle owners and dealers in Kabul in December 2003. The
information collected from the surveys i s inthe project files. Time cost is based on US$l50
perweek incomeprovided inthe Evaluation Report.

C. EconomicEvaluation
8.         Economic Costs and Benefits. Financial costs were converted to economic costs by a
conversion factor o f 0.9 and a discount rate o f 12% was applied throughout the analyses.

                                                    - 13 -

Unit construction costs for the improvement component were based on the analysis and
adoption o f unit rates collected from different sources for basic work items, as well as the
calculation o f quantities by the consultant based on the preliminary design. The average unit
cost for the improvement i s assumed about US$349,000 per kilometer includes wideningto 7
meter carriage way and 1.5 meter shoulders.

9.     Alternatives considered.        Four improvement alternatives were considered for the
improvement o f the road namely:

        0  Resurfacing existing road (no-improvement)
        0  Rehabilitation existing road to engineered gravel standard.
        0  Upgradingto Asphalt Standard.

10.    The analysis was done on a section-by-section basis given the four alternative
improvement standards and associated maintenance standards.

11.    Each alternative was compared on the basis o f costs, benefits, service to local
communities, and relationship to future economic development. The upgrading to asphalt
standard option was selected on the basis o f its overall economic benefit and relationship to
future economic development. While the other two options had lower unit costs, the net
benefits were (benefit minus costs) were lower than the asphalt option.

12.    Economic Returns and Sensitivity Analysis.              Total costs and benefit streams,
Economic Rate o f Return(ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV), for each road link o f selected
for upgrading were estimated. The ERR o f 22.6 percent for the project i s considered
economically viable and significantly higher than the minimum 12 percent required for
economic justification o f the project.

13.     Sensitivity Analysis.    The main risks associated with the project are the cost o f the
project can increase, and benefits may not materialize as expected. This i s accounted for by
undertaking sensitivity analysis, considering the following: (i) increase o f costs by lo%,
                                                                    an

sensitivityanalysis. The result shows that the economic benefit o f the project remains robust
under these risk scenarios.
