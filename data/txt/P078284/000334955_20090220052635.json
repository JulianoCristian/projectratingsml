Transport\n            Rehabilitation Project in Afghanistan were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Emergency\n            project in post-conflict country. One of the lessons learned\n            during the implementation of this Project, and other\n            emergency projects- has been the importance of keeping the\n            Project design simple. This required focusing on critical\n            requirements such as infrastructure required for emergency\n            response. The choice of highway and airport infrastructure\n            appropriately reflected national priorities, and the Project\n            achieved most of what it set out to achieve. Another lesson\n            for this Project, which may apply to other projects in a\n            post-conflict country as well, is that security related\n            issues should be carefully scanned and addressed. Without\n            appropriate preparation, security issues can affect the\n            project implementation process, increase project cost, and\n            even jeopardize the achievement of the project's\n            development objective. Emphasis on implementation support:\n            like any other post-conflict country, the Afghan\n            government's institutional capacity has been quite\n            limited. Strong implementation support from the Bank's\n            team and timely identification and response to project\n            issues are another important lesson learned during\n            implementation. Long-term institutional reform, and capacity\n            building support: the Afghan government needs to strengthen\n            the weak institutional capacity of its agencies and\n            ministries, which require institutional and policy reforms.\n            To make this happen, political endorsements from the highest\n            levels of the political structure are needed. International\n            consultants are needed to provide training and support to\n            local staff in implementing capacity building measures."}, "docdt": "2008-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
