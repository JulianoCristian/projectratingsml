F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To facilitate the country's economic and social recovery through improved physical
access to goods, markets, and administrative and social services.

  This will be achieved by: (i) removing key transport bottlenecks that seriously hamper
recovery, (ii) building capacity in management, implementation, and maintenance of
transport services and works through the provision of equipment and technical assistance,


                                                 ii

and (iii) assisting in the establishment of an institutional and policy framework for the
transport sector for sustainable service delivery.

  The removal of key transport bottlenecks will promote regional economic integration
and facilitate trade, delivery of humanitarian aid, and reconstruction efforts in all sectors.
Normal traffic operations on the key road arteries and in the air will be restored, also
facilitating movements on the key import/export links and main corridors.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Afghanistan is one of the poorest and longest-suffering countries among the members of
the World Bank. When the project was appraised in 2003, the country had already
experienced more than two decades of conflict and this combined with a three-year
drought had resulted in widespread human suffering and massive displacement of people.
An estimated 7 million people remained vulnerable to hunger and very large numbers
were dependent on a massive inflow of food and humanitarian aid. Afghanistan's
infrastructure had been destroyed or degraded; its human resource base severely depleted;
and its social capital eroded. State institutions were largely dysfunctional, and the
economy and society had become increasingly fragmented.

After the collapse of the Taliban regime in 2001, the Afghanistan Interim Administration
peacefully took over central administration in December 2001. After six months, an
Emergency Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) took place in June 2002. The Loya Jirga
elected a transitional administration, the Afghanistan Transitional Administration1 that
was expected to pave the way for a new constitution and an elected, fully representative
government for Afghanistan within two years. The Transitional Administration had the
power to promulgate, repeal and amend laws and regulations by decree.

Despite being hampered by limited capacity and the difficult security situation in many
parts of the country, the Transitional Administration improved the quality of governance
and decision-making and made considerable progress and gained widespread
international recognition and moral authority. It put forward a compelling vision and
strategy for national reconstruction embodied in its National Development Framework
(April 2002).

War had not only devastated Afghanistan's existing infrastructure but also prevented
maintenance and new investment from taking place. Immediate challenges in the
transport sector were the removal of major road transport bottlenecks and re-establishing
of safe air traffic services by civilian authorities to facilitate the movement of
humanitarian aid, returning refugees and trade-related traffic.

The aim of the first Transitional Support Strategy (March 12, 2002) was to lay the basis
for a prosperous, modern and peaceful country that could fulfill the expectations of its
people and contribute positively to the development of the region. The key objective of
Bank support to Afghanistan under this strategy was to assist the people and government
of Afghanistan in this transition and to help lay the foundations for it to become a
prosperous, inclusive and peaceful country in the future. Based on this, the first
Transitional Support Strategy focused on assisting the Government in responding to the

most urgent recovery needs of the population in four main areas, of which the Emergency
Transport Rehabilitation Project (ETRP) contributed directly to two:

·      Designing and activating high-priority, high-impact reconstruction programs that
       would help restore livelihoods, kick-start economic activity, restore essential
       infrastructure, communications and social services, and facilitate the development
       of the private sector.
·      Building a better knowledge base and analytical underpinning for the work of the
       international community and for future World Bank assistance.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of this Project was to facilitate the country's economic and social recovery
through improved physical access to goods, markets, and administrative and social
services. This was to be achieved by: (i) removing key transport bottlenecks that
seriously hampered recovery, (ii) building capacity in management, implementation, and
maintenance of transport services and works, through the provision of equipment and
technical assistance, and (iii) assisting in the establishment of an institutional and policy
framework for the transport sector for sustainable service delivery.

The key outcome indicators designed in the PAD were:

·      Average travel time between the cities of Kabul and Kunduz to be reduced by
       50% by November 30, 2004.
·      The ability of goods and services'providers to supply products in the northern
       provinces of the country, during daytime and at night, to be restored by March 31,
       2004.
·      The ability of international airlines to land in Kabul's international airport to be
       restored by December 31, 2003.
·      At least ten (10) rural communities to have their access to markets, social and
       administrative services improved by June 30, 2005.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

The Project Development Objective was not revised during the life of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary project beneficiaries are the residents of the 12 districts that use the Northern
Corridor and the adjacent rural roads. Improvements to these roads would facilitate the
flow of humanitarian aid passing through the North to the entire country, generated local
employment in the transport service industry through increased traffic, and benefited
agriculture and industry through improved access to inputs and markets. Secondary
beneficiaries are travelers, suppliers and consumers of goods and services. Passenger
costs would also decrease, leading to reduced transport costs and fares, lower prices of



                                               2

goods and costs of products. Improvements to Kabul Airport would facilitate the re-
establishment of Afghanistan as a destination for international investment, tourism and
assistance efforts. It would benefit all air passengers and led to the growth of employment
from related economic activities in support of air traffic.

1.5 Original Components

The project consisted of four components: (a) highways, (b) civil aviation, (c) secondary
and tertiary roads, and (d) institutional, policy and other studies.

Component 1: The Highways component included the rehabilitation of two key road
sections, the Kabul-Salang-Doshi Road and the Pol-e-Khumri-Kunduz-Sherkhan Bandar
Road of the Kabul -Sherkhan Bandar corridor. The objective of this component was to
restore an adequate road connection between Kabul and the provinces in the North and
the countries along Afghanistan's northern border: Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In addition
to linking the capital to the North, rehabilitation of the Kunduz­Sherkhan Bandar road
would also ensure a dependable link between Kunduz and the border town of Sherkhan
Bandar. The Kabul-Doshi road was part of the Afghan Ring Road System, which drew
together all the major regions. The Kunduz­Taloqan road, which was categorized as part
of the secondary road component, was included in part of contracts for the Pol-e Khumri­
Sherkhan Bandar section for maintenance works. (IDA financing $64.9 million;
implementing agency: Ministry of Public Works (MPW)).

Component 2: The Civil Aviation component comprised works at Kabul International
Airport (KAIA) including emergency repairs, rehabilitation and reconstruction of
damaged runway pavement, as well as provision and installation of airfield ground
lighting (AGL), including power generators. This component also provided
communications and air traffic control equipment identified by the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) as necessary for the airport to function at international
standards. (IDA financing $19.3 million; implementing agency: Ministry of Transport
and Civil Aviation (MOTCA)).

Component 3: The Secondary and Tertiary Roads component was designed to finance
the rehabilitation of selected secondary and tertiary roads serving rural populations in the
area of influence of the Northern Road corridor being rehabilitated under the Project.
These roads primarily linked the communities to the major road network. Two secondary
roads were identified at appraisal stage by the Afghan government and co-financing was
agreed on with two donors. These two roads were the Taloqan-Faizabad section of the
Kunduz-Faizabad road, to be co-financed with the US government, and the Charikar -
Bamiyan road, to be co-financed with the Italian government. (IDA financing $23.3
million; implementing agency: MPW)).

Component 4: The Institutional, Policy and Other Studies component aimed to lay the
foundation for sustainable management of the transport sector. It included preparation of
a Transport Sector Review to develop an Institutional and Policy Framework for the
Sector, and pre-feasibility studies for potential future investments. Consulting services

were co-financed on a parallel basis by the Swedish International Development Agency
(Sida). (IDA financing $0.5 million; implementing agencies: MPW and MOTCA).

1.6 Revised Components

Major changes in Project components

After Project appraisal, the following major changes were made:

(i)     The Kunduz-Taloqan road maintenance sub-component was scaled up to full
        rehabilitation, because the road deteriorated faster and more severely than
        expected at appraisal, and also because some sections of the road were destroyed
        by a flash flood during the project implementation period.

(ii)    The Charikar-Bamiyan road was canceled from ETRP, as it is outside the corridor
        on which the Project focused. After donor coordination and discussion with the
        Afghan government, the Italian government agreed to finance the rehabilitation of
        this road.

(iii)   Some capacity building activities were planned to fill the gap in the capacity
        needs identified during project implementation and to support the capacity
        building initiatives of MPW and MOTCA towards civil service reform.

Additional Funding Provided

Additional funding was provided to fully fund the Project activities and the above
changes. The real cost of the Project considerably overran the planned funding, due
largely to the higher cost of works contracts in Afghanistan, security-related expenses,
and de-mining to ensure safety in the mine-affected areas. Before the original closing
date of December 31, 2005, the proceeds of the Credit 3735 were already fully
committed. Without additional financing, under IDA 100% financing situation,
rehabilitation work of the Taloqan­Faizabad road, an important secondary road that
provided access to Takhar and Badakhshan provinces, could not be completed as
planned. The increased scope of de-mining for Kabul Airport must be covered for safety
reasons. Also, the requirements for the activities originally envisaged in the scope of
ETRP, such as capacity building and other studies for post-emergency sector
development, as well as maintenance support, increased beyond what the original credit
was able to provide.

A supplemental grant (H1630) of SDR29.9 million ($45 million equivalent) was
approved by the Bank on May 19, 2005 to fund: (i) the rehabilitation of the Taloqan-
Kishem section of the road from Kunduz to Faizabad, including construction, supervision
and associated mine clearing and security measures related to that road; (ii) additional
rehabilitation maintenance of the Kunduz-Taloqan road, that had deteriorated since the
appraisal of the ETRP; (iii) additional de-mining requirements in the civilian areas of the
Kabul International Airport and other Project areas where clearing of mines and

unexploded ordnance had proven to be much more expensive than expected; (iv) capacity
building for MPW and MOTCA, the transport sector review and other related studies,
and maintenance support; and (v) contingency for unforeseen costs. The arrangement
with USAID was that the section from Taloqan to Kishem (68 km) was funded by IDA,
while USAID provided parallel financing for the section from Kishem to Faizabad (105
km).

1.7 Other Significant Changes

The capacity building programs for MPW and MOTCA to support their civil service
reform were to be covered by the supplemental grant, but were not completed because
few firms submitted proposals for the consulting services and those submitted were
deemed unacceptable for their high cost. With the cancellation of the two capacity
building programs ($4 million from IDA), the Swedish International Development
Agency, who planned to provide parallel financing, canceled its support.

The Taloqan-Kishem Road component experienced a cost over-run because of design
changes required due to the road's poor physical condition. This over-run was off-set, in
the allocation of the supplemental grant, by the cancellation of the capacity building
program.

Because of delays in implementation, the closing date was extended twice from
December 31, 2005 to June 30, 2008 ­ that is, by 2.5 years. Some resettlement issues
were still outstanding (see Section 2.4 for details) when the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) was prepared.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Emergency and Security Factors in Project Preparation

The Project was designed and prepared under emergency conditions. Security factors
were carefully considered. By the time the Project was appraised, much of Afghanistan's
infrastructure had been destroyed or seriously degraded. Its human resource base was
severely depleted and its social capital eroded. State institutions had and still have severe
capacity constraints, and the economy and society had become increasingly fragmented.
Considering these conditions, one of the foremost priorities of the Project was to respond
quickly to the emergency and provide the basic infrastructure that was urgently needed.

Meanwhile, the fragile security situation not only entailed security-related expenses but
also diminished the interest of international consultants and contractors in bidding for the
reconstruction works. The insufficient competition and security premium pushed up bid
prices for the civil works and consultant services, and caused some implementation
delays. No significant improvement in the security situation was observed during the
Project implementation period, and it keeps on deteriorating.

Early Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design

The following main lessons learned from other emergency reconstruction projects were
taken into account during the ETRP's preparation:

·        The Bank needs to respond quickly in project preparation to avoid changes and
         hold up delivery of Bank assistance. It also needs to allocate more time and
         resources for implementation and supervision.
·        Emergency operations should be kept simple, avoiding major innovations.
         Implementation arrangements should be simple, focusing on the project's critical
         requirements.
·        The Bank should be prepared to support the borrower through proactive and staff-
         intensive involvement upfront during project preparation and the first stages of
         implementation. Engagement by the borrower of adequate technical assistance in
         project implementation should be ensured through financing under the IDA credit,
         or (preferably for the borrower) under timely grant financing from donors.
·        During project implementation, quick adjustments are needed to adapt to
         changing circumstances, requiring flexibility in implementation arrangements.

Risks and Mitigation

Risk factors were identified during the Project design and mitigation measures were
proposed. During implementation, these measures were carefully followed. Table 1
shows the key risks identified and mitigation measures planned, as well as the results
achieved by the time the project was completed.

2.2 Implementation

Project Changes During Implementation

As already noted, delays in implementation required the closing date to be extended twice
from December 2005 to June 2008. The reasons for the delays include, as noted in
Section 1.6, delays in the construction work, need for additional funding, and low
capacity in the implementation ministries. Security factors also delayed the project
significantly. Although security measures were planned during project preparation,
incidents still occurred. For example, 11 workers were killed during an attack on a
contractor's camp, causing a long delay.

The following table gives details of the differences at different project stages: the
appraisal stage, the supplemental grant preparation, and project completion.

Quality of Supervision Assessment

A Quality Assurance Group (QAG) panel assessed the overall quality of Project
supervision in August 2006. Their overall assessment of the Project was Satisfactory,
with all supervision dimensions also being judged as Satisfactory. Several aspects of the
supervision performance were rated Highly Satisfactory, while no significant weaknesses
were identified.

The QAG panel concluded that implementation of the physical works for the main
highway and civil aviation components had been progressing well. It also said that the
focus was then on implementation of the delayed secondary and tertiary roads
component, as well as taking up the smaller institutional and policy issues.

Strong features of the supervision effort were: (i) a stable and experienced supervision
team, ably led and well supported by the local and regional offices; (ii) good working
relations with government counterparts and other donors in the sector; (iii) careful
mission planning and attention to detail throughout; and (iv) supervision missions and
related documentation which identified the main issues that needed to be addressed.

Safeguards were also well supervised, with only minor blemishes. In terms of impact, the
panel lauded the implementation performance, keeping in view the difficult country
environment for supervision.

However, the panel expressed concern about lack of evident progress in: (i) areas relevant
to the operation's longer-term sustainability; and (ii) capacity building in the two key
ministries responsible for maintaining the country's road network.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

Given the emergency nature of the Project, the output, outcome and sector indicators
(Annex 1 of PAD) were designed to focus on the emergency response and time-bound
objectives of facilitating transport and access in the shortest possible time. This was to be
done while providing on-the-job learning opportunities and institutional capacity building
for management and maintenance of transportation assets. For each indicator specific
target dates were set.

M&E Implementation

The Bank supervision missions focused on assessing these indicators and assisting the
Government in overcoming implementation difficulties. The supervision reports assessed
the achievement of these indicators at different time intervals. The performance ratings
focused more on the degree of achievement than the time taken. The M&E effort that the
Bank team put into the supervision, as well as its timely feedback to the client on the
issues and progress evaluated, helped the Government implement the Project and achieve
the development objective.

However, for some issues identified by the M&E process, there is a lack of follow-up
from the client. For example, the lack of maintenance and required improvements to the
rehabilitated facilities, particularly the Salang Tunnel, remains a concern. The team made
several proposals to address the lack of maintenance, repairs and operational support for
the Tunnel: (i) the supervision consultant was sent back to assess the needs and prepare a
bill of quantities and cost estimate for additional works to be carried out by the
contractor; (ii) funding for the repairs was offered through the IDA credit/grant; (iii) a
proposal was made for a new follow-on project funded by an IDA grant to address
operation and maintenance in general and for completed road segments under this credit;
(iv) IDA also offered to finance an operation and maintenance contract for the ventilation
system in the tunnel to secure proper operation of the generators and fans; and (v) IDA
offered to get a second opinion (independent of the supervision consultant) or assessment
of the defects of the drainage system in the northern end of the tunnel, but this was also
rejected in the expectation that support would be provided from elsewhere. The Salang
Tunnel issue still remained when the project closed.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

Social safeguards compliance: Unsatisfactory. The safeguards compliance was rated
Unsatisfactory by the final supervision mission and ICR mission that ended on May 20,
2008. This was because the mission had identified non-compliance with the Bank's
guidelines for involuntary resettlement on the Taloqan­Kishem road. The mission



                                               10

received complaints from project affected persons (PAPs) in some of the villages along
this road about not having received appropriate compensation for their loss of land or
properties due to the road construction.

The final supervision mission documented in its aide-memoire that during field visits it
conducted interviews with villagers from Zardaloo Dara, Chinar, Asana Tepa and
Kalafghan located along the Taloqan­Kishem road. The villagers complained that the
contractor and the local police had acquired the land and property required for improved
alignment of the road by force. The PAPs were misinformed that the World Bank would
compensate them directly for their loss of land and property. The compensation had not
taken place by the closing date. The Bank sent a strong letter to the Government calling
for compliance with the Bank's guidelines on land acquisition and resettlement, and
further dispatched a social safeguards consultant to help MPW to formulate a
Resettlement Plan. MPW, the supervision consultant and the contractor agreed that MPW
and the supervision consultant would follow up with the PAPs and would arrange
appropriate compensation, but it has not yet been achieved at the time of this writing3.

The Bank team has been very responsive in identifying and following up on the
safeguards issue. The team should continue the implementation support on this issue until
it is solved to the Bank's satisfaction.

The environmental safeguards compliance is Satisfactory. The environmental
management plan has been implemented, and no significant issues have been identified.

Procurement

The procurement aspect is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Many of the procurement activities (major civil works contracts) were implemented as
planned, particularly during the first half of the project implementation period. However,
several times during the second half of the implementation period bidding for goods and
calls for proposals had to be repeated, and payments to suppliers were delayed as a result
of belated opening of letters of credit. The procurement facilitation consultant (ARDS -
PU) under the Ministry of Economy contributed to facilitating procurement activities, but
on many occasions actions required by the employer were delayed. This was due partly to
the lack of competition and a `security premium' added to the proposals and bids
submitted, but also to the deteriorated procurement capacity in the ministries after
individual consultants financed by the project had left.

Financial Management



3        In the Project Appraisal Document, the environmental and social safeguard issue was identified as
         "modest risk". To address this risk, an Environrnent and Social Development Framework was
         prepared and safeguard management focal point was designed. For the Taloqan­Kishem rural road
         section, MPW, a contractor, and the district and communities were to take the responsibility in
         safeguard implementation and monitoring.




                                                  11

The financial management aspect is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Records of the Project's funds receipts and disbursements from inception until closure
were maintained at the Ministry of Finance's Special Disbursement Unit, as well as at the
MPW and MOTCA. Due to lack of capacity and systems, these records were not
adequately maintained, and there is no record of disbursements component by component
from the early years of the Project. Records under ETRP, like other emergency projects
in Afghanistan, were maintained manually at the Special Disbursement Unit from
inception until March 2005, when the Unit started using the Afghanistan Financial
Management Information System (AFMIS) for all projects and line ministries' financial
transactions. It was expected that record keeping would improve greatly with the
transition to AFMIS, but this has not been the case yet. Under AFMIS, there were still no
disbursement records by component until recently. Supporting documents were
maintained for most payments, but these were not properly filed until towards the closure
of the Credit, when a consultant was engaged for proper recording, documentation and
reporting on the financial activities of the Project.

Monthly and quarterly financial reports, including the mandatory financial monitoring
reports that were to be submitted to the Bank each quarter, were not prepared regularly
until about credit closing, when a financial management consultant was engaged to
support the MPW and the MOTCA.

Funds flow to all implementing agencies was controlled centrally by the MOF. An
assessment of the process showed that this was managed appropriately since the Project
began.

Annual audited financial statements were submitted regularly. The audit opinions of the
Control and Audit Office of Afghanistan were qualified.

The financial management capacity was built up steadily in the MPW and the MOTCA
during the Project's implementation. No FM systems were in place when the Project
started, so this is an improvement. However, capacity remains weak and strengthening is
needed.

Governance Aspects

Weak governance was a risk for the Project. As mentioned above, the implementing
agencies' weak capacity in procurement, financial management and project management
could have increased risks of corruption. However, in this Project, there was no reported
fraud or corruption at the time when this ICR was written. The Bank's country team in
Afghanistan is taking strategic efforts to strengthen the project management environment,
and this country-wide approach is expected to improve the borrower's governance
capacity in project preparation, implementation, and management.



2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase




                                              12

While implementation of the physical infrastructure aspect of the Project is satisfactory,
institutional capacity remains weak and sustainability is in doubt.

Sustainability

The infrastructure rehabilitation part of the Project was completed successfully but there
was a lack of progress in areas relevant to the Project's long-term sustainability.
Maintenance of the country's road network so far has been minimal. Continued financing
is essential for the sustainability of the roads component. An example of the urgent need
for maintenance is the Salang Tunnel. It is located in the mountains 110 km north of
Kabul at an altitude of 3,400 m and is 2.7 km long. It is a critical link in the highway that
connects Kabul to the northern provinces, as well as to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
Rehabilitation of the tunnel has been completed, but due to snow and freezing
temperatures in winter and a lack of maintenance in the drainage system, the road surface
condition has severely deteriorated. Maintenance is urgently needed to protect the
tunnel's operating condition.

Weak Institutional Capacity

Afghanistan's two key ministries in this Project, the MPW and the MOTCA, still have
weak institutional capacity.

A capacity building program for both ministries was planned in cooperation with Sida,
and multiple procurement attempts were made to select consultants, with a repeated
discussion and consultation of the TORs. However, the intended TA for both ministries
had to be cancelled after two procurement attempts for each ministry. It was the lack of
competition and very high-cost proposals that led to the final rejection by the
Government, in spite of the repeated efforts of Sida and IDA. With the Project now
completed, capacity strengthening will be a continued task for the two ministries. Both
are still looking for support from the international community and donors.

The Transport Sector Review, completed at the early stage of the Project, recommended
sector policies and institutional reforms, but they have not yet been adopted. To sustain
such reform in the transport sector, a higher level of political commitment is needed.

Next Phase Project

After this emergency phase of development, a next project, if any, should focus more on
sector reform and capacity building, and on building up the sustainability of the sector's
development.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance: Satisfactory

The Project's key objective was to assist in the rehabilitation of Afghanistan's transport
infrastructure and remove key transport bottlenecks that seriously hampered recovery.
This objective strongly supported the country's priority when the Project was prepared
and was highly relevant to the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (2002) for
Afghanistan. More specifically, the Project contributed directly to two of the priority
areas: (1) designing and activating high-priority, high-impact reconstruction programs
that would help restore livelihoods, kick-start economic activity, restore essential
infrastructure, communications and social services, and facilitate the development of the
private sector; and (2) building a better knowledge base and analytical underpinning for
the work of the international community and for future Bank assistance.

In May 2006, IDA's Board of Directors discussed a new Interim Strategy Note for
Afghanistan, which guided the Association engagement for 2006-2008, and was aligned
with the Afghan government's Interim National Development Strategy. IDA support
under its interim strategy shifted slightly from the previous Transitional Support Strategy
to focus more on the rural economy. The ETRP remains relevant to the updated strategy
by contributing to the priority areas of (1) building the capacity of the state to provide
services; and (2) promoting growth of the rural economy and improving rural livelihoods
by providing rural roads and facilitating rural communities' access to markets.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

The achievement of the PDO has been rated Moderately Satisfactory.

The Project's development objective was to facilitate the country's economic and social
recovery through rehabilitation of its main transportation infrastructure. The PDO was
designed to be achieved by:

(i)     Removing key transport bottlenecks that seriously hampered recovery. The entire
        planned infrastructure has been completed in a way that warrants rating as
        Satisfactory. The highway from Kabul to Kunduz, a major city in the north, all
        the way to the Afghan-Tajikistan border, the aviation infrastructure at Kabul
        International Airport, and some secondary roads such as the Kunduz­Taloqan-
        Kishem road, have all been completed successfully.

(ii)    Results in building capacity in management, implementation, and maintenance of
        transport services and works through the provision of equipment and technical
        assistance were Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Project has delivered the planned
        equipment and TA to the borrower. Some capacity enhancement has been



                                              14

        achieved. However, (a) the overall capacity of the two ministries still remains low
        and the sustainability of the Project will remain in question without follow-up
        assistance; (b) the capacity building programs for MPW and MOTCA, designed
        to fill the capacity needs and support the civil service reforms in the two
        ministries, were both cancelled, due to the lack of competition in consultant
        selection because of security reasons, and the resulting high costs. Therefore, the
        overall achievement of the capacity building objective is rated Moderately
        Unsatisfactory.

(iii)   Assistance in establishing an institutional and policy framework for the transport
        sector for sustainable service delivery was Moderately Satisfactory. The Transport
        Sector Review, which suggested an institutional and policy framework for
        Afghanistan, was completed as part of the Project. However, MOF, MOTCA and
        MPW have not yet been ready to implement the institutional and policy reforms
        recommended in the Review. Continued dialog with the government and TA to
        support the reforms is still needed.

3.3 Efficiency

The Project has achieved a Satisfactory rating with the economic rate of return (ERR)
assessment indicator.

The economic assessment is focused on the highway and secondary road infrastructure
components. Relevant data for the Kabul Airport component were not available. The
major economic benefits of the three road sub-components have been quantified in terms
of the reduction in vehicle operating costs due to improvement in the road surface
condition, savings in travel time due to higher speeds, and increase in agriculture sector
output. Benefits to both normal and generated traffic have been included in the
evaluation. Improving the roads will not divert traffic from other existing routes or from
other competing transport modes, as this is the only road providing access to the region it
serves. It is also unlikely that freight will shift from road transport to the regional airline
network.

The ICR has assessed the ERR and NPV for the Kabul-Doshi, Pol-e Khumri ­ Sherkhan
Bandar, and Taloqan-Kishem roads. The results are shown in Table 3, comparing the ICR
results with the results estimated in the PAD. The ICR follows the same methodology as
the PAD in economic assessment; however, due to data limitations, the PAD only
evaluated the Kabul-Doshi road.

 1. Kabul-Doshi                        36.3             62.6          28.7           50.5
 2. Pol-e Khumri-Sherkhan              35.2             45.1            -               -
 3. Taloqan-Kishem                     21.9             14.9            -               -



                                               15

The ICR estimates the Kabul-Doshi Road component's ERR at 36%, higher than the
ERR at appraisal of 29%. The Pol-e Khomri-Shirkhan road's ERR 35 %, estimated after
3 years of operation, and that for the Taloqan-Kishem road component is 22%. All of
these results are satisfactory. They show that the Project has achieved, and surpassed in
some instances, the economic efficiency planned in the PAD.

The Kabul Airport component comprised reconstruction of the bomb-damaged runway
and provision of maintenance equipment. It has not been possible to calculate an ex post
economic rate of return on these improvements, for lack of relevant information.

However, the outcome from this component at Project completion was quite positive. At
the appraisal stage, there was a lot of uncertainty regarding the airport's future, such as
demand from consumers, the operating environment, and the feasibility of normal
operations. After the runway was rehabilitated under the Project, the airport re-started
operations in 2005. By the Project's completion date, KAIA serviced 100-200 civil
flights every week and about 13,000 passengers were arriving at and departing from this
airport weekly. Considering the lack of security on many rural highways, aviation is
deemed to be one of the most important modes of transportation for Kabul.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall outcome of the Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory, considering the
emergency nature of the Project, its high relevance to country priorities, achievement of
the PDO and efficiency considerations. The Project achieved high economic efficiency in
the major infrastructure components, and responded to the client's emergency needs
under a difficult security situation. Weak capacity, sustainability, and institutional reform
issues remain, which should be addressed in follow-up Bank operations as well as in
Afghanistan's own programs.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project's desired outcome to build key roads from Kabul to the northern cities and
the border with Tajikistan has been achieved. Economic assessment shows that the key
roads have significantly reduced vehicle travel cost and travel time; helped rural
communities along the road with easier access to the market and facilitated international
trade with the neighboring countries.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

There are two major risks that might affect the Project's development outcome.

(1)     Security Risk: During the past five years of project implementation, the security
        situation has continued to deteriorate. With the rehabilitated highways and KAIA
        being the major modes of transport connecting Kabul to the northern provinces
        and neighboring countries, there is a risk that when conflict occurs, the
        infrastructure will be destroyed or damaged. The Project has successfully
        managed to achieve its original PDO, but the security situation remains a serious
        concern.

(2)     Government Capacity Risk in Maintaining the Infrastructure and Sustaining
        Service Levels: The capacity of MPW and MOTCA is still very weak in
        managing and maintaining the existing transport services. In addition, financial
        resources are also very limited without donor support. In the short run, the
        rehabilitated roads may be in good physical condition but without continuous
        proper maintenance, the sustainability of the roads in the long run will be a
        challenge. Continued commitment by the Government is needed in financing the
        maintenance of the rehabilitated infrastructure.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Project was well prepared from the beginning as an emergency operation. The
planned outcome and key indicators in the results framework are practical and relevant to
the Project activities, and closely aligned with the Transitional Support Strategy. Right
from the start, the Project was ready for implementation. The project risks were clearly
recognized and adequate mitigation measures were proposed.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank task team, led by a proactive TTL as commented by the QAG panel, was multi-
disciplinary with a good mix of skills. The team was responsible for identifying project
issues during supervision, flagging issues in aide memoires and ISRs, and proposing,
when possible, solutions to resolve them. The soundness of the advice given to the


                                            17

government and the speed of Bank follow-up were highly commendable. Key
performance indicators used in the ISR adhered to those set up in the results framework
of the Project design and were updated at each supervision mission, tracing the Project's
consistent progress and showing how the PDO was achieved.

The team set up a good working partnership with MPW and MOTCA, and regular
reviews of Project performance with MOF. It would have been helpful if the team had
approached the Government on a higher level to make progress on the institutional and
policy reforms, and to ensure a high level of political commitment in financing of the
Project maintenance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance is Satisfactory for the above mentioned reasons. The team
successfully led the Project in achieving its designed PDO (para.3.4)

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government, MPW and MOTCA, showed a sense of ownership toward the Project
and was committed in completing the rehabilitation works and thereby achieving the
development objective.

However, the capacity of government institutions remains weak. Most Project decisions
had to go up to the deputy minister's level, causing delays. Much of the implementation
work was done by consultants, which was not sustainable due to the short-term nature of
their services. The institution and policy reform agenda still has a long way to go,
although the sector review and assessment done under the Project was of acceptable
quality.

(b) Implementing Agencies' Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

No separate implementing agency was set up for the Project. MPW and MOTCA served
as the implementing agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                             18

6. Lessons Learned

(1)     Emergency Project in a Post-Conflict Country

One of the lessons learned during the implementation of this Project ­and other
emergency projects- has been the importance of keeping the Project design simple. This
required focusing on critical requirements such as infrastructure required for emergency
response. The choice of highway and airport infrastructure appropriately reflected
national priorities, and the Project achieved most of what it set out to achieve.

During the implementation phase, the key components of highway and aviation services
were given priority in scheduling and the use of available funds. This ensured that they
were implemented first and the PDO was achieved.

Another lesson for this Project, which may apply to other projects in a post-conflict
country as well, is that security related issues should be carefully scanned and addressed.
Without appropriate preparation, security issues can affect the project implementation
process, increase project cost, and even jeopardize the achievement of the project's
development objective. Some examples from this Project are: (a) The contractors paid
inadequate attention to security issues in the early stage of project construction, and as a
result the contractors' camps were attacked resulting in loss of lives, and serious delay of
the Project; (b) There were much more mines and unexploded ordnance in the project
areas than expected, which significantly increased Project cost; (c) Due to security
concerns, there were fewer consultants in the bidding, and higher cost because of
"security premium". And as a result from that, some of the capacity building activities
designed in the Project were forced to be canceled.

(2)     Emphasis on Implementation Support

Like any other post-conflict country, the Afghan government's institutional capacity has
been quite limited. Strong implementation support from the Bank's team and timely
identification and response to project issues are another important lesson learned during
implementation. The Bank team should provide implementation support to the client on
their technical decisions, as well as compliance with safeguards, procurement and
financial management. It is hard for any agency in a post-conflict country to quickly
familiarize itself with the Bank's detailed guidelines and procedures. Some targeted
technical assistance program on procurement, disbursement, financial management, and
governance issues can be provided by the Bank team.

(3)     Long-term Institutional Reform, and Capacity Building Support

The Afghan government needs to strengthen the weak institutional capacity of its
agencies and ministries, which require institutional and policy reforms. To make this
happen, political endorsements from the highest levels of the political structure are
needed. International consultants are needed to provide training and support to local staff
in implementing capacity building measures. However, it should not be expected that


                                              19

such reform and capacity building can be achieved overnight, or even during a single
project period. Therefore, the Bank and other donors need to prepare the reform and
capacity building programs in a coordinated, sustainable, structured, and long-term way.

                            Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This project has four components: highways, civil aviation, secondary and tertiary roads,
and institutional, policy and other studies.

Component 1: Highways included two key road sections, the Kabul-Salang-Doshi Road
and the Pol-e-Khumri - Kunduz-Sherkhan Bandar Road of the Kabul -Sherkhan Bandar
corridor. The objective of this component was to restore an adequate road connection
between Kabul and the provinces in the north and the countries along Afghanistan's
northern border: Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In addition to linking the capital to the north,
rehabilitation of the Kunduz­Sherkhan Bandar road had also ensured a dependable link
between Kunduz and the border town of Sherkhan Bandar. The Kabul-Doshi road was
part of the Afghan Ring Road System, which drew together all the major regions.

The Kabul­Doshi Road was completed by September 2005. The Pol-e Khumri ­
Sherkhan Bandar Road was completed by December 2005.

Component 2: Civil Aviation was to rehabilitate the runway at Kabul International
Airport to meet ICAO requirements, and to supply equipment for basic conditions
allowing safe commercial air traffic.

KAIA runway rehabilitation was completed by November 2005. A feasibility study for
Air Traffic Management was also completed. Major equipment support, such as the
communication and maintenance equipment, was completed in 2005. Some other
equipment supply was completed by June 2008. KAIA de-mining was completed.

Component 3: Secondary and Tertiary Roads financed the rehabilitation of selected
secondary and tertiary roads serving rural populations in the area of influence of the main
road corridor being rehabilitated under the Project.

The enhanced maintenance for Kunduz­Taloqan was completed by April 2006. The
rehabilitation of the Taloqan to Kishem road was completed by June 2008, although some
land acquisition and resettlement issues still remained at the end of the Project. USAID
awarded a Construction Contract for Kishem to Faizaabad road in May 2007 with an
Estimated Completion Date of November 29, 2009.

Component 4: Institutional, Policy and Other Studies: The Transport Sector Review
to develop an institutional and policy framework for the sector, was completed in January
2004. A Kabul Ring Road Feasibility Study was completed by June 2008. TA (ICAO
specialists) to MOTCA was completed. A feasibility study for improvement of the
Afghan air traffic management system to meet international standards was also
completed.

                               Annex 3. Economic Analysis

1. Introduction

The economic analysis focused on the main road works. Data were not available for an
economic evaluation of the Kabul airport improvements. The three roads identified as
suitable for emergency rehabilitation were the two highways, Kabul-Doshi and Pol-e
Khumri - Sherkhan, and the secondary road, Taloqan-Kishem. These roads provide fast,
low-cost, reliable inter-city transport serving the provincial capitals and some towns and
villages in the northeast region. The main economic benefits from the three subprojects
are reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC) due to improvement in the road surface
condition, savings in travel time due to higher speeds, and increased agricultural output.

2. Methodology

This post-construction economic evaluation has been prepared using the World Bank's
Vehicle Operating Cost 4 model in combination with a simple spreadsheet cash flow
model used to estimate economic rates of return (ERR) for the investment option chosen.
The project benefits modeled include changes in vehicle operating costs, changes in
transit passenger and freight travel time, and the impact on agricultural GDP output. The
post-construction analysis uses actual construction costs and actual traffic volumes soon
after opening. It also relies on forecasts of traffic growth over the future 20 years - the
same growth rates as those used for the appraisal evaluation.

Traffic was counted during March 2008 at non-urban locations along each of the project
roads. Traffic was recorded hour by hour over a 14-hour period from 5 am to 7 pm.
Counts were carried out over two consecutive days, Saturday and Sunday (in Afghanistan
Friday is the weekend holiday). Night counts were collected at specified highway police
checkpoints as a safety precaution. Night traffic estimates were cross-checked with local
transport groups to ensure the accuracy of the data collected.

Four count stations were selected along each road on the basis of what could be termed
`homogeneous sections' defined according to the carriageway configuration and the
pattern of agricultural production visible along the road. The stations were located away
from town/village boundaries so as not to include short trips that generally occur in and
near towns. Traffic was recorded for both directions.

3. Data

The annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts on the Kabul-Doshi, Pol-e Khumri-
Kunduz­Sherkhan Bandar and the Taloqan-Kishem Roads are given in Tables A3.1­3.

4. Assessment Result

The evaluation shows that the road improvements have been successful in reducing the
unit costs of operating vehicles (per km VOCs and travel time) and have contributed to
an overall reduction in transport fares and rates, and thereby in the prices of goods in
local markets. The ERR for the overall project is 33% with a total net present value
(NPV) of benefits estimated at about $123 million. Individually, all projects appear to be
efficient when the benefits to the agricultural sector are taken into account. On the basis
of solely vehicle operating costs and savings in travel time, only the two national
highway projects: Kabul-Doshi and Pol-e Khumri-Sherkhan, meet the 12% hurdle rate of
return. Travel times along the northern corridor have dramatically improved since
completion of the emergency rehabilitation of the entire Kabul-Doshi, Pol-e Khumri-
Sherkhan Bandar and Kunduz-Taloqan-Kishem Roads.

The Kabul-Doshi and Pol-e Khumri-Sherkhan Bandar projects that were funded as heavy
maintenance projects have returned robust ERRs of 36% and 35% respectively. Base year
traffic volumes along these two routes averaged between 1,400 and 2,700 vehicles per
day, with the higher volumes being experienced closer to Kabul and the lower volumes
closer to Kunduz to the north.

The Taloqan-Kishem project is also considered economically viable with an ERR of
22%, because it significantly improves access to the farming areas of the northeastern
provinces and increases transport connectivity among market capitals in other regions of
the country.

The following table shows the results. (NPVs are discounted at 12%.)

5.      Comparison with the appraisal economic evaluation

The economic analysis of the Project conducted at the time of appraisal covered only the
largest physical component, the Kabul-Doshi Road, comprising about 60 percent of the
estimated cost of the highway component and 40 percent of the total project cost,
including the supplemental grant. The analysis was conducted using the Highway
Development and Management (HDM-IV) Model developed by the World Bank. As
shown in Table A3.5, the PAD conservatively estimated the Kabul-Doshi Road's


                                            25

economic return at 29 percent, and its net present value was estimated at $51 million. The
high economic returns and the sensitivity analysis conducted provided an indication of
the economic robustness of the Project and its potential contribution to the country's
economic and social recovery, and more broadly for establishing the foundation for the
country's economic development and poverty reduction efforts.

 2. Pol-e Khumri-Sherkhan         35.2             45.1            -              -
 3. Taloqan-Kishem                21.9             14.9            -              -

The ICR gives the Kabul-Doshi Road component's ERR at 36% and its NPV (also at
12%) at $63 million, both higher than the appraisal estimates. The post-construction ERR
for the Pol-e Khumri-Sherkhan road is estimated at 35% and that of the Taloqan-Kishem
road improvement at 22 %, both well above the opportunity cost of capital.

It can be concluded that, using post-completion construction costs and traffic counts, the
major project components are likely to yield a fully satisfactory economic return, and in
the case of the Kabul-Doshi road, a higher return than expected at appraisal.

                    (CR. 3735-AF) and Supplemental Grant (H-1630)

1.     Brief Description of the Project



Development Credit Agreement was signed on March 17, 2003 between Transitional
Islamic State of Afghanistan and International Development Association. The credit
became effective on July14, 2003. The original closing date of June30, 2005 was
extended to June 30, 2008. The original IDA credit of SDR 80 million was supplemented
with a grant of SDR 29.9 million, making a total IDA financing of SDR 109.9 million.



2.     MPW Component of the Project



The project consisted of the following parts:



Part A: Road Rehabilitation

A.1    Rehabilitation of the Kabul-Doshi road (175 km), the Pol-e-Khumri-Kunduz-
Sherkhan Bandar road (170 km) and the Kunduz-Taloqan road (61 km) in the northern
region of the country, including the provision of goods, training and consultants' services
required for the maintenance thereof.



Status of Implementation:

The rehabilitation of the Kabul-Doshi road and the Pol-e Khumri-Kunduz-Sherkhan
Bandar roads have been completed under three separate contracts. The details of the
contracts are attached giving the project name, contract amount, date of start and
completion, supplier/contractor and completion cost. Supervision of the works was
carried out by consultants and details are also given in the attachment. Ten temporary
bridges were constructed on the Kabul-Doshi road and part of the cost of these bridges




                                            31

was met out of the Credit. The other subproject of the Kunduz-Taloqan road has not been
carried out due to paucity of funds.



A.2    Rehabilitation of the Salang Tunnel and snow galleries, including the tunnel's
approaches, and the provision of goods and training required for the maintenance thereof.



Status of Implementation:

The repairs to the Salang Tunnel and snow galleries have been executed under a civil
works contract and details of the contract are provided in the attachment. Supervision of
the project was carried out by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. The works
have been completed. The MPW also procured goods including generator sets, front-end
loaders, graders including spare parts, fuel and maintenance services for the equipment.
Details of their cost and procurement method are given in the sheet attached.



Part C: Secondary and Tertiary Roads

Carrying out a program to rehabilitate about 250 km of secondary and tertiary roads
feeding into the roads referred to under Part A of the project, including the provision of
goods, training and consultants' services related thereto.



Status of Implementation:

Consultancy services for design of the Taloqan-Faizabad road were carried out for the
whole length of 170 km. Initially it was planned for a low-cost rehabilitation of the whole
road. However, later on it was decided to construct a 7m asphalt road with 1.5m
shoulders. It was therefore decided to fully rehabilitate only 68 km of the road between
Taloqan and Kishem based on the funds available. The rehabilitation of Kishem to
Faizabad project is being carried out under a USAID project. The rehabilitation works on
the Taloqan- Kishem road were completed in May 2008. Details of the civil works
contracts and the consultancy services are provided as an attachment. Consultancy
services for the Charikar-Bamyan road have been carried out by UNOPS.



Part D: Transport Sector Review and Miscellaneous Studies




                                            32

Carrying out pre-feasibility and other studies, as well as a review whose objective was to
develop an institutional and policy framework for the transport sector.



Status of Implementation: Consultancy services for a feasibility study of a ring road
around Kabul city have recently been completed and details are attached.



Part E: Mine Clearing

Clearance of mines, including the carrying out of requisite screening, surveys and quality
assurance tests in areas to be rehabilitated under Parts A.1, A.2 and C of the Project.



Status of Implementation: The mine clearing services were included in the civil works
contracts of the subprojects and were successfully completed along with the project
roads.



3.     Project Development Objective: To facilitate economic and social recovery
through improved physical access to goods, markets and administrative and social
services.



4.     Assessment of Achievement of Project Development Objective



The completion of this road rehabilitation project has removed major bottlenecks in the
highway network between Kabul and the northern parts of the country. The construction
of the project roads has improved mobility and reduced travel times. The key
performance indicators for the achievement of the Project development objective are
described below:

   i) Average travel time along the northern corridor is reduced by 50%- The
       travel time between Kabul and the northern parts of the country has been reduced
       by 50% with the completion of the rehabilitation projects.

   ii) Daytime humanitarian flows along the northern corridor are technically
       feasible by the end of the project: Day and night flows are now visible on the
       road.



                                              33

    iii) At least ten rural communities have improved access to markets, social
         services and administrative centers by the end of project: Yes -The rural
         communities have improved access to markets, social services and administrative
         centers.



5.       Sustainability



Road Maintenance

The Ministry of Public Works still lacks capacity to plan and execute routine and periodic
maintenance on a contract basis. In terms of funding road maintenance on a continuous
sustainable basis, progress is being made to provide funds for road maintenance in the
annual budget.



Contract and Credit Administration

The contract administration for all the project roads has been carried out through the
engagement of consultants and not much experience has been gained by the MPW `s PIU
staff from this grant.



6.       Performance



Bank's Performance: The Bank responded promptly and adequately to requests by the
Borrower throughout the duration of the project. There were minimal delays in receiving
clearances for works program.

Borrower's Performance: The Borrower does not identify any significant problems or
obstacles to the implementation of the project.

Performance of the Contractors: The contractors all ranged from good to fair and on
the whole the performance of all contractors could be termed satisfactory.

Performance of the Consultants: The performance of the supervision consultant was
generally satisfactory, but there were spots where his supervision should have been
better.




                                           34

7.    Lessons learned



Important lessons learned in administering IDA credits are:

   -  Attention needs to be given during the planning and technical design of the
      project to avoid delays during construction.

   -  Coordination between government agencies, particularly the MOF and MPW, has
      to be maintained throughout the period of the credit to expedite the approval
      process and its implementation.

   -  Commitment of local funds for acquisition of land and for payment of people
      affected by the project should be programmed as early as possible.

   -  A method of funding maintenance on a continuous basis is required before much
      progress can be made toward developing sustainable methods of implementing
      routine and periodic maintenance procedure.

                 BORROWER'S PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
                    Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project (ETRP)
                     (CR. 3735-AF) and Supplemental Grant (H-1630)

1.      Brief Description of the project

A Development Credit Agreement was signed on March 17, 2003 between the
Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan and the International Development Association.
The credit became effective on July 14, 2003. The original closing date of June 30, 2005
was extended to June 30, 2008.        The original IDA credit of SDR 80 million was
supplemented with a grant of SDR 29.9 million for a total IDA financing of SDR 109.9
million.

2.      Project Development Objective

The objective of the Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project for Afghanistan was to
facilitate the country's economic and social recovery through improved physical access to
goods, markets, and administrative and social services. The project was to encompass the
following main activities: (i) removing key transport bottlenecks that seriously hamper
economic recovery; (ii) building capacity in management, implementation, and
maintenance of transport services and works through the provision of equipment and
technical assistance related to planning, maintenance and supervision of works; and (iii)
assisting in the establishment of an institutional and policy framework for the sector for
sustainable service delivery.

3.      MOTCA Component of the Project

The component consisted of the following parts:

A.      Emergency Rehabilitation of Kabul International Airport Runway 11-29 and
                 Other Ancillary Works

This project included re-pavement of the runway at Kabul International Airport, the
installation of aeronautical ground lighting, drainage and airport fencing, as well as de-
mining.

Status of Implementation
Mine clearance was conducted and completed by the UNDP. Design and supervision of
the runway rehabilitation was contracted to Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick (UK) with
construction carried out by Yenigun-Maktas-Aydeniz (Turkey). All work was completed
in August 2005. Since that time, the number of national and international flights has
increased considerably resulting in increased revenue, the re-establishment of
communication with other countries, and a marked increase in air transport services to
Afghanistan. However, since March 2008, Kabul International Airport has been plagued



                                             36

by increasing sporadic failures to the ground lighting system and is in the process of
determining what actions are necessary to ensure reliability of the system. In addition,
there remains $461,699 due in payment to the Yenigun-Maktas-Aydeniz Pvt. There is a
problem with the payment and MoTCA is doing its best to contact the company and
resolve the issue. (Ref. The contract states that "the price bid by the contractor shall
include all customs, duties, imposed duties, business taxes, income and other taxes. Sub-
clause 73.2)

B. Procurement and Installation of Navigation Aids at Kabul International Airport

This project included the procurement and installation of Instrument Landing
System/Distance Measuring Equipment (ILS/DME) and Doppler VHF Omni-directional
Ranging airplane guidance systems for Kabul International Airport.

Status of Implementation
Both systems were installed by Thales ATM GMBH (Germany), with work completed in
December 2004. Installation of these navigational aids has significantly improved the
safety of air transport to Kabul. They have also enabled operations to continue during
marginal weather conditions, thereby increasing the number of national and international
flights in and out of Kabul.

C:      Procurement and Installation of Communication Systems/Equipment Lot 1
& Lot 7

This subproject included the procurement and installation of communications equipment
and generator sets for Kabul International Airport and 15 other local airports.

Status of Implementation
The contract was awarded to Motkoh Pvt Ltd (Afghanistan). The subproject is
incomplete due to difficulties encountered in the payment process between the Ministry
of Transport and Civil Aviation (MOTCA), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the World
Bank. Completion of this project will enhance flight safety through the provision of
reliable means of air-ground communications at local airports throughout Afghanistan.
The amount of 70,464 Euro, 339,397 Australian dollars, and 2,328,802 Norwegian krone
is remaining to be paid to the contractor in order to complete this subproject.

D.    Procurement and Installation of Communication Systems/Equipment Lots
2,3,4,5 & 6

This project included the procurement and installation of communications equipment and
generator sets for Kabul International Airport and 15 other local airports.

Status of Implementation
The contract for this subproject was given to Telecommunication Consultants India, Ltd,
and the work is complete. Airports at which the equipment has been installed are now




                                             37

supplied with sufficient electric power and communications equipment. However, there
remains $194,892 in payment due to the contractor, which is under process.

E.   Procurement of Civil Aviation Equipment for Kabul International Airport

This subproject included the procurement of airfield maintenance equipment for Kabul
International Airport, including runway/taxiway sweepers, snow clearing equipment and
front-end loaders.

Status of Implementation
The subproject had two contracts, one with Allied Machinery Ltd (Afghanistan) and one
with Floatdene International Ltd (UK). Both contracts are complete in that all equipment
has been delivered to Kabul International Airport. Provision of the equipment has greatly
enhanced the capability to maintain airport operating surfaces at Kabul International
Airport during all expected weather conditions.

F.   Procurement of Fire Vehicles and Equipment for Kabul International Airport

This subproject included the procurement of crash/fire/rescue trucks for Kabul
International Airport.

Status of Implementation
The contract for this subproject was given to RM Asia HK (India). The trucks and
associated equipment have been delivered to Kabul International Airport, and training on
the vehicles and equipment was successfully carried out in March 2008. As a result, the
airport now has adequate fire-fighting vehicles necessary to support current civil
operations.

G.     Appointment of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
Specialists

This subproject involved a single-source contract with ICAO to provide specialists to
enhance the flight safety oversight capacity within the Ministry of Transport & Civil
Aviation. It included the provision of an operations inspector, an airworthiness inspector,
a communications-navigation-surveillance expert and an air traffic management expert.

Status of Implementation
The contract was completed in June 2007. The work of the ICAO specialists provided
MoTCA with the required expertise necessary to begin carrying out its safety oversight
responsibilities during a period in which a number of new airlines began operations in
Afghanistan.




                                           38

H.      Consultancy Services for Design of Approach Procedures for Airports in
Afghanistan

This project was contracted to GTZ (Germany) to provide GPS approaches for the
airports of Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Jalalabad.

Status of Implementation
The procedures have been designed and completed as of January 2008. Final approval to
publish the procedures for Afghanistan remains pending due to the requirement for flight
checks, not part of the consultancy services. The Ministry is planning to conduct the
flight inspection with cooperation from the United States Air Force. The amount of
452,800 Euro remains due to be paid to GTZ for this contract (ref. Contract Amendment
issue).

I.      Design & Construction of Power System for Kabul International Airport

The design and construction of this project was contracted to ICT Ltd (India) to provide
sufficient and reliable electric power to Kabul International Airport.

Status of Implementation
Construction is expected to be completed by September 2008. The amount of $46,103 for
construction, and $25,060 for the design remains due to be paid to ICT. Completion of
the project will provide Kabul International Airport with sufficient and reliable electric
power necessary to operate the airport.

J.      Technical Assistance to MoTCA's Reform Implementation Management
Unit

This technical assistance was intended to contract a consultant company for provision of
lead assistance to the MoTCA for developing, managing and implementing a program for
reform, restructuring and capacity building in line with the Public Administration Reform
strategy of the Government of Afghanistan. The TA was to be financed by the
Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project and co-financed by the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).

Status of Implementation
A contract with the highest-ranked bidder, Adam Smith International, was negotiated and
agreed to by the MoTCA. However it was ultimately rejected by the Special Procurement
Commission of the Government, due to the high cost of the consultancy services.

K.      Improving Air Traffic Management System of Afghanistan Airspace

This subproject was contracted to Sofreavia (France) to conduct a feasibility study for the
improvement of the Afghanistan air traffic management system to meet international
standards for the next 15 years using the latest proven concepts and technologies.




                                             39

Status of Implementation
The contract is complete. The feasibility study is under consideration by MOTCA to
determine implementation of the recommended projects.

4.      Assessment of Achievement of Project Development Objective

In general, the project was highly successful in terms of removing civil aviation
infrastructure bottlenecks. For example, the rehabilitation works at Kabul International
Airport (de-mining, runway, ground lighting, fencing, power, etc.) and procurement of
airfield equipment (communications, fire vehicles, sweepers, snow removal equipment,
etc.) have helped open Afghanistan's main international air gateway to the world. As an
example, between 2004 and 2008 the number of civil aircraft movements at Kabul
International Airport has substantially increased. However, the Ministry has seen only a
marginal increase in its capacity to manage, implement and maintain transport services.
Generally speaking, while projects such as the air traffic management feasibility study for
Afghanistan have provided the Ministry with a plan for the future, there remains very
little capacity in the Ministry to implement such a project or program. In addition, the
failure to conclude a contract for technical assistance to the Reform Implementation
Management Unit was a significant setback in terms of assisting MoTCA to implement
required institutional reforms.

5.      Sustainability

Aviation Infrastructure (Airport) Maintenance

The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation still lacks the capability to plan and execute
routine and periodic maintenance throughout all airports in Afghanistan. However,
MoTCA is currently in the process of engaging the private sector to provide this service
at Kabul International Airport starting this year, and possibly at other airports in the
future. In terms of funding airport maintenance on a continuous sustainable basis, it is
expected that funds will be provided in due course from the annual budget. However, no
dedicated fund yet exists for this activity.

Contract and Credit Administration

The Ministry has experienced numerous problems as a result of its lack of capacity in
contract and credit administration.

6.      Performance

Bank's Performance: The Bank responded promptly and adequately to requests by the
Borrower throughout the duration of the project. There were minimal delays in receiving
clearances for works programs.

Borrower's Performance: As previously noted, the Borrower has experienced
significant difficulties in administration of contracts and credits.



                                              40

Performance of the Contractors: The Contractors ranged from good to poor. In
particular, the current sporadic failures of the ground lighting system at Kabul
International Airport are largely suspected to be caused by poor construction.

Performance of the Consultants: Performance of supervision consultants ranged from
adequate to poor. In particular, the current sporadic failures of the ground lighting system
at Kabul International Airport are largely suspected to be the result of poor supervision of
the construction contractor.

7.     Lessons Learned

Important lessons learned in administering IDA credits are:

·      Institutional reforms and capacity building must be given greater emphasis and
       begin before the commencement of infrastructure works. This is necessary to
       allow successful implementation as well as ensure the sustainability of
       infrastructure rehabilitation.
·      The development of airport infrastructure requires a coherent plan and
       coordinated effort. As such, before significant funds are expended on new
       infrastructure, airport master planning activity must first be carried out.
·      A means of ensuring sustainable funding for maintenance on a continuous basis
       must be developed prior to the construction or rehabilitation of infrastructure.
