Some of the important lessons highlighted are:\n            1) The APL instrument was efficient in so far as it relied\n            on a consistent policy framework and allowed adjustments to\n            fit changing needs in the project area. 2)  The strategy of\n            providing in-school technical assistance for teachers proved\n            an effective means to help teachers apply the skills\n            appropriate to the particular situation of their students.\n            3) Education innovation research is best carried out by\n            specialized research institutions rather than managed by\n            states. 4) Evaluation of student learning achievement and\n            the wide dissemination of test results is a good strategy to\n            involve civil society as partners in the education effort\n            and a valuable instrument to improve teaching/learning\n            strategies. However, continued attention needs to be given\n            to improving analytical capacity at central and state levels\n            in order to fully utilize the results of these evaluations."}, "docdt": "2004-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
