3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
This is the second phase of a three-phase Basic Education Development Project (PAREIB II) Adjustable
Program Loan (APL), the objectives of which are to: (a) consolidate and expand quality improvements in
initial and basic education (preschool, primary, and lower-secondary education), covering, inter alia,
infrastructure improvements, didactic materials provision, teacher training, school supervision, and
implementation of school-based management strategies; (b) strengthen management of the education
system through support for the Government's ongoing strategy to consolidate the organization and
management of basic education (preschool through lower secondary), and to integrate the operation of
the compensatory education program; (c) put in operation a competitive fund to support education
innovations proposed by the states; and (d) continue strengthening of states' institutional capacity to
plan, program, and evaluate the delivery of basic education services.

The triggers which would permit the Bank to consider approval of the third phase of the
program included:

(a)      Education Indicators reflecting improvement in completion rates at target primary
         schools;
(b)      Policy indicators, including increased school autonomy and maintenance of the policy
         framework for compensatory education programs; and
(c)      Technical indicators comprising the completion of an evaluation of the network for
         education quality in primary education and the completion of a study on basic
         education in marginalized schools in the Federal District.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The Project objectives were not revised

3.3 Original Components:
Phase II of the Basic Education Development Project (Programa para Abatir el Rezago en Educación
Inicial y Básica- PAREIB) consisted of two components.

Component 1- Quality Improvements in Initial and Basic Education, aimed to continue and expand
quality enhancing activities carried out in Phase I, covering initial, preschool, primary and
lower-secondary education. This goal would be achieved through five subcomponents: 1.1 Investments
to expand and rehabilitate school infrastructure in targeted communities; 1.2 Educational materials and
equipment for students, teachers and schools; 1.3 Training for teachers, supervisors, and administrative
staff and initial education promoters, including technical assistance at the school level provided by the
Network for Education Quality in Primary School (a program initiated by PAREIB), and performance
incentives for primary teachers; 1.4 Support and technical assistance to community or parents
associations for school-based management activities; and 1.5 improvements to school supervision.

Component 2: Strengthening Institutional Capacity at Federal and State Levels with the objective
of further enhancing management capacity of key federal and state sector entities to plan, program,
budget, monitor and evaluate the delivery of basic education services, and provide support for project
administration. Specific activities under this component included:        2.1 Consolidation of national
education evaluation system and evaluation of education outcomes at state level; 2.2 Consolidation of
the national school mapping system and use in regional planning at state level; 2.3 Research studies; 2.4
Capacity building at State Secretariats of Education (SEPEs) to plan, program, budget, monitor and
evaluate the delivery of basic education services; 2.5 Support for education innovation at state level
through the Basic Education Innovation Fund; and 2.6 Project administration at central and state level.
3.4 Revised Components:
The Project components were not revised but adjustments were made as indicated in Section 4.2.
These adjustments were the product of systematic evaluations leading to re-orientation of some project
interventions, which will also be implemented during Phase III, that pertain to the technical assistance

provided to teachers at the primary schools and to the targeting of the initial education program. In the
case of technical assistance, the network which provides the assistance is being strengthened, more
attention is given to multi-grade schools (especially schools with only one or two teachers), and the work
of technical assistants has improved with the introduction of new didactic materials and better profiles of
the teachers. Improvements along those lines will continue during Phase III. In the case of initial
education, three important changes were made. First, the selection of localities where the program is
developed now combines poverty criteria with the existence of a preschool to foster continuity between
initial and preschool education. Secondly, the program no longer moves to different localities once the
one-year cycle is completed, so as to be able to consolidate the knowledge gained by parents while
incorporating new parents. Third, the program now acknowledges the presence of children in the parent's
meetings, and has development activities specific for the children.

Loan documents were amended twice: first, on December 18, 2002 increasing the amount eligible for
retroactive financing from US$ 30.0 million to US$ 80.0 million, and second, on January 26, 2004
changing the periodicity for the presentation of Financial Management Reports (FMRs) from quarterly to
bi-annually to better match the accounting systems installed in the National Council for Education
Development -Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo (CONAFE), and reallocating the proceeds of the
loan among disbursement categories. On May 18, 2004, the loan proceeds were again reallocated
shortly before loan closing.      Compliance with legal covenants was satisfactory throughout project
implementation.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
A formal quality at entry assessment was not carried out for this project. The ICR rates project design as
satisfactory based on the following main reasons: (a) its consistency with the national education policy of
expanding basic education coverage and quality with equity nationwide; (b) its consistency with the
development objectives of the CAS to reduce poverty and promote equity; (c) its focus on the classroom
and on the school; (d) its correct targeting of the poorest and Indigenous children aiming at improving
their learning achievements; (e) the strong emphasis placed on community participation at school level;
and (f) its support for a well a tested government compensatory education program and the integration of
the program nationwide.         Project design builds upon 10-years of experience by CONAFE in
compensatory education programs and allows for implementation flexibility, promoting continuous
improvements and fostering the active participation of the states in project planning and implementation.
Notwithstanding these very positive characteristics, project design could have been better with respect to
the instrument developed to foster innovation in the education system through Component 2.4. The fault
does not lie only on the institutional arrangements for implementation of the Basic Education Innovation
Fund-which proved unworkable, but refers primarily to the lack of clarity with respect to what innovation
means and the decision to offer a new research instrument to the 31 states. During project preparation it
could have been anticipated that this strategy would promote fragmentation of effort and pose risks with
respect to research quality and scope. The research actors chosen were State Level Secretariats of
Public Education (Secretarías Estatales de Educación PúblicaSEPEs) whose primary mandate is to
deliver education services, not research.     This strategy ignored the basic conditions for successful
research and did not take into account the prior experience of education research in Mexico. Given the
objective of fostering education innovation, a better alternative might have been to finance
university-based education research through fewer and longer term contracts with established
specialized institutions selected on a competitive basis.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
ICR Rating Satisfactory. The project achieved its development objectives and surpassed, in many
cases, its original physical targets. Taking into account that the project target-population is the poorest
and most deficient in terms of the supply of educational services, this positive result particularly
commendable. Specific project outcomes with respect to each objective are described below. Annex 1
presents project performance and output indicators as of December 31, 2003.

Objective 1: To consolidate and expand quality improvements in initial and basic education.
This objective was achieved in so far as improvements were made to program coverage, quality,
efficiency and equity at initial and basic education levels nationwide.

Coverage of compensatory educational services: The coverage of CONAFE's program was
significantly expanded with respect to preschool and lower-secondary education compared with the
scope of previous PAREB (LN. 3722-ME), PIARE (Interamerican Development Bank Loan) and
PAREIB-I projects. During Phase II, project activities reached 47,479 localities and benefited more than
60,000 schools. Table 4.1 summarizes service coverage by level of education.

These figures represent 20% of the national enrollment in rural preschools, approximately one third of
the national primary school enrollment including all Indigenous schools, and 91% of the national
enrollment in rural telesecundarias.

The achievements reported for Phase II surpass the original targets for primary and lower
secondary education as shown in the following table. Coverage of initial education fell short of
the target by 17 percent due to adjustments to the targeting criteria made during Phase II
thereby initial education services would only be provided in localities that had a preschool.
Coverage of preschool also fell short of the original target, reflecting the priority to expand
coverage of lower secondary education.

1/ Initial education coverage figures are cumulative; coverage per year averaged slightly more than 400,000 families for 2002 and 2003.
2/ Primary education during Phase I was covered by PAREB (World Bank Loan 3722-ME) and PIARE (IDB Loan) projects.
3/ Targets for telesecundaria are cumulative since in each phase different schools are targeted.
4/ The Postprimaria program did not exist in 1997-1998. At the end of Phase I, this program was transferred to CONAFE's community education
   program.
5/ In accordance with the Mexican fiscal year, targets for Phase II are recorded up to 12/31/2003. The January to June 2004 period is considered, for
   statistical purposes, part of Phase III.
6/ Some of the targets for Phase III are likely to be revised in view of the results of Phase II.

Quality Improvements: As originally intended PAREIB II was able to consolidate improvements in initial
and basic education countrywide reaching 96% of Mexico's municipalities. A systematic evaluation of
CONAFE's effectiveness in improving the quality of primary and telesecundaria education was carried
out by the Bank using propensity score matching techniques.                                          This evaluation shows significant
improvements in student's test scores including indigenous students compared to those of non-project
students.         CONAFE appears to be most effective in improving primary school math learning and
secondary school Spanish learning. Secondary education delivered by way of television to remote
communities and bilingual education for indigenous students improved student achievements (see
Shapiro and Moreno Trevino, 2004) compared to the control group.

Efficiency and equity grains: An analysis of basic education indicators shows that PAREIB II
succeeded in improving the efficiency in basic education by shortening the time students take to
complete preschool, primary and lower-secondary cycles and by increasing completion rates. These
efficiency gains have an important equity dimension, as the gap in the performance between
disadvantaged and non-poor students is now smaller.                                           The evaluation shows that CONAFE's
compensatory program decreased repetition rates by about 0.13% per year during 1998-2002. While this
effect may appear to be small, it suggests that CONAFE annually eliminates 6% of inequality in
repetition rates compared to rates of non-beneficiary students. Table 4.3 below summarizes the main
project outcomes with respect to efficiency in the delivery of basic education services in project schools.

Objective 2: To strengthen management of the education system. This objective was achieved
through significant institutional improvements at federal and state levels prompted by the project. In
particular, PAREIB II was able to strengthen the capacity of the education system at state level to plan
and evaluate the outcomes of basic education services. Details regarding the project achievements in
these areas are provided in Section 4.2. One important and unexpected institutional gain during project
implementation was the increased collaboration between CONAFE and the states, and between groups
of states. This was achieved through systematic efforts by CONAFE to promote dialogue and organize
national meetings involving state education authorities and researchers, particularly education planning
directors. Among the benefits derived from this effort, one finds today much more intense horizontal
collaboration and sharing of experiences among states, and a more proactive attitude on the part of the
states to take on responsibility for their share in compensatory education programs. The project was less
successful in providing specialized technical assistance to strengthen the administration of state
education secretariats, basically due to difficulties encountered at state level to hire consultants in
accordance with national and Bank guidelines. This shortcoming has largely been corrected by the time
of project completion and a much more robust technical assistance program is planned for Phase III. As
indicated in section 4.5 below, the institutional capacity of CONAFE to carryout project activities has
been markedly strengthened as a result of effective leadership, improved staffing and better information
systems and administrative procedures.

Objective 3: To put in operation a competitive fund to support education innovation at state
level. The experience with putting in operation a competitive fund to support education innovations at
state level met with unsuccessful results and the strategy has been dropped from Phase III. One of the
important lessons derived from this experience is that research is better done in specialized research
institutions that can dedicate expert staff and time to the task rather than by operatives whose chief

mandate is to deliver services.

Objective 4: To continue strengthening the states institutional capacity to deliver basic
education services. This objective has been achieved as states have substantially improved their
institutional capacity to perform education planning and evaluation functions, as described in detail in
Section 4.2.

Triggers for Phase III: The project met all the triggers agreed upon, surpassing the quantitative targets
originally established, as shown below:

(a)      Education Indicators: Improvement in completion rates at targeted primary schools
including:

l        A 23 percent improvement in completion rates of indigenous primary schools,
         from 64.2 percent in 1995-1996 to 79.0 percent in 20092-2003. Actual achievement:
         81.6%.

l        A 4 percent improvement in completion rates of non-indigenous primary schools,
         from 81.6 percent in 1995-1996 to 85.2 percent in 2002-2003. Actual achievement:
         85.6%.

l        Increase by 15.9 percent the enrollment in telesecundaria, from 562,637 students
         in 1998-1999 to 652,105 students in 2002-2003. Actual achievement: enrollment
         increased by 21 percent to 678,912 students.

     (b) Policy Indicators:

l    Increased school autonomy through improved mechanisms for participation of directors, teachers,
and parents' associations in the management of the schools (AGEs). Specifically, an increase of 20
percent in the number of primary schools targeted by the program that have operative parent's
associations. Actual achievement: school autonomy increased by 24 percent; the number of primary
schools with AGEs increased from 37,278 schools in 1995-1996 to 46,254 schools in 2003-2004.

l    The policy framework for compensatory programs is maintained.

(b)      Technical Indicators:

l    The study that evaluates the implementation of the Network for Education Quality in Primary
     Education was completed and the final report delivered.

l    The study on basic education in marginalized schools in the Federal District was completed and the
     final report delivered.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Component 1- Quality Improvements in Initial and Basic Education

The outputs of project investments under this component mostly surpassed estimated physical targets,
as shown in Annex 1. The few cases in which achievements were below estimated targets reflect
reorientation of project interventions or higher efficiency in the use of resources compared to Phase II
estimates:

l    Improvements to school infrastructure reached 17 percent more schools, 88 percent of the schools
     were equipped and furnished, and 9 percent more rural teacher training centers were built or
     refurbished.




                                                    - 7 -

l    More didactic materials were distributed. Packages of didactic materials for parents participating in
     the initial education program reached 88 percent and for primary students surpassed the original
     target by 42 percent.

l    A total of 30,674 initial education staff were trained (compared to 50,042 estimated at Appraisal), but
     the 40 percent difference reflects improvements in staff allocation and redefinition of staff functions
     which led to wider program coverage with less staff.         Technical assistance for primary school
     teachers delivered at the schools through the Network for Quality Education (Red para la Calidad
     Educativa Race), reached 42,688 teachers (compared to the estimated 37,278) or 15 percent more
     than expected. The provision of such assistance emphasized multi-grade schools where the need for
     technical support to teachers is the greatest.

l    School supervision was strengthened through stipends given to supervisors and sector chiefs
     enabling them to visit schools more often; this action surpassed the original target by 7.3 percent.

l    The experiment with an Education Innovation Fund proved less than satisfactory, even though the
     number of subprojects financed matched Appraisal estimates.          Difficulties encountered were of
     conceptual as well as practical nature.       Conceptually, the Fund intended to support state-level
     innovative research on basic education and stimulate states to experiment with new ways of
     delivering services. This approach failed to take into account the fact that the mandate of state
     secretariats of education is to deliver services not to do research for which they do not have the
     required capabilities. Further, the fragmentation resulting from funding a relatively large number of
     subprojects caused individual research projects to be very narrow in scope and of indifferent quality.
     A better strategy would have been to support innovative research by established research
     institutions. In practical terms, the funding calendar did not coincide with the school-year, causing
     problems as the research projects required observation or interventions in the classrooms during the
     school year. This specific difficulty was resolved by the approval on exception basis of an extension
     of the implementation period for the research projects, leading to the completion of 87 percent of the
     projects approved and the cancellation of five. In sum, the specific strategy designed to support
     research leading to education innovation did not prove successful and will not be continued in Phase
     III.

Component 2: Strengthening Institutional Capacity at Federal and State Levels

The main goals of this component were to consolidate educational planning and evaluation activities
started in Phase I, and in addition, support project implementation at central and state level. These
goals were basically achieved.

In education planning, Phase II aimed to provide all states with modern planning tools, including
geographic-reference equipment (Global Positioning Systems GPS), computer equipment and software
appropriate for GPS applications in order to raise the technical capacity for education planning. This was
accomplished with the participation of the General Directorate for Planning, Programming and Budgeting
(Dirección General de Planeación, Programación y Presupuesto DGPPP) of the Secretariat of Public
Education (Secretaria de Educacion Publica SEP), which provided the technological instruments as well
as technical assistance and training to the states for the use of the new planning tools. A large effort was
carried out to update cartographic information using a strategy of sharing data available in various
institutions. Today, all states count on a full catalog of localities that is compatible with that of the
National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografia e
Informatica INEGI) and the means to maintain the catalog updated. States are now able to establish the
exact location of 27,000 school facilities and integrate different databases pertaining to the
characteristics of these facilities into a single system. During Phase III the school mapping exercise will
be extended to all schools. Mapping is now enhanced with topographic characteristics. All states count
on specialized trained staff in education planning. One important achievement was the integration of
geographic, educational, economic and demographic data in a single planning system, allowing states to
adjust the supply of educational services to shifts in the demand. The fact that the project supported
improved education planning countrywide afforded significant economies of scale which would not have



                                                      - 8 -

accrued in a state-by-state approach. Also noteworthy is the increased interchange that took place
between states, through the collaboration between planning directors at central and state level. The
sustainability of these organizational and technological gains will depend on the continuous training of
new staff as state teams change.

In education evaluation, project activities aimed to consolidate the institutional capacity of the states to
evaluate student achievement, through organizational improvements and staff training; expand the
national education evaluation system with data on initial education, preschool and secondary education,
while continuing to apply achievement tests at primary education level; and provide more information on
the learning achievements of students at the schools benefiting from PAREIB, to better inform the
planning of education services supported by the project. In addition, activities were expanded to include
design and implementation of a system to evaluate the basic competencies of students, and an
assessment of the impact of the "school project" on student learning achievement. Activities were carried
through the General Directorate for Evaluation (Dirección General de Evaluación DGE) of SEP in
collaboration with the states (except in the case of the initial education program where CONAFE was
responsible for the evaluation with support from the DGE). The DGE provided training and technical
assistance to the states; designed, coordinated and supervised data collection, and processed and
analyzed the data at national and state level. Training was provided through eleven national courses
and workshops and through five regional training seminars. The organizational structure of evaluation
units in the SEPEs was more clearly defined. New evaluation instruments were developed, including: (i)
achievement tests for grades 3 through 6 of primary school and a context questionnaire; and (ii) a test to
measure psychological and, motor development and readiness for literacy and math among preschool
children, complemented by context questionnaire. The tests applied are specified in Table 4.4. The
evaluation experience during Phase II shows the importance of comparing the performance of each
school over time, taking into account contextual factors, in order to put in place appropriate
learning/teaching strategies. This approach will be explored during Phase III. The straightening of the
evaluation units at the SEPEs resulted in several evaluation studies and in the full disclosure by all
states of the results of student achievement tests through WebPages and other means.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The cost-effectiveness analysis presented in Annex 3 shows that project investments resulted in
long-term savings of the education budget. This outcome is due to the better student flow through the
basic education cycle, largely attributable to the project. The observed additional increases in terminal
efficiency (percentage of students who complete a cycle in the expected number of years) were 1.7
percent in primary education, and 3.5 percent in lower-secondary education (telesecundaria) at the
schools supported by the project. The cost-effectiveness of the project is also reflected in improved
learning achievements of students, as measured by standardized national tests.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The successful project outcome reflects the fact that it was carried out by an established, well staffed
specialized institution.       But even taking into account such a positive context, the institutional
development impact of the project is significant. CONAFE was strengthened in several areas. Specific
achievements include:

l   A stronger institutional capacity at CONAFE resulted in efficiency gains in the implementation of
    compensatory education programs countrywide, increasing program coverage and impact.

l   CONAFE was able to obtain lower prices for goods by virtue of centralizing procurement thereby
    promoting competition among supplies, and through the application of more effective procedures to
    plan and carry out procurement. The strengthening of CONAFE's capacity with respect to
    procurement was the result of hiring specialized staff and the support provided by the National
    Financing Agency (Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. - NAFIN) and the Bank.

l   The improved administrative capacity of CONAFE reflects the work of a competent team. This team
    was installed in 2001 when the project was being prepared, and its leadership, technical expertise
    and administrative ability improved during project implementation. The profile of the team members
    is well suited to the functions of the institution. In a relatively short period, the team achieved a high
    level of consolidation and was able to maintain high performance standards.

l   Among the various factors that explain the observed satisfactory performance, possibly the most
    important are good leadership, good personnel selection, and an agile decision-making process to
    reprogram funds generated by the procurement economies and demand shifts. As a result, CONAFE
    was able to execute 98 percent of its 2003 budget, compared to 78 percent in 2001.

l   The external audit procedures adopted cover all of CONAFE's operations rather than only project
    activities. This innovation constitutes a best-practice model for Bank-financed projects in Mexico, as
    it reflects the full integration of project activities in the regular operations of the executing agency.

System-wide the project was able to contribute to the consolidation of efficient education planning and
evaluation at state level. This achievement has an important and lasting impact on the delivery of basic
education services in Mexico and is an important step to promote more equitable educational
opportunities for all.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Demographic migration flows affected several communities supported by the project, introducing
changes in the demand for education services and requiring periodic adjustments to the interventions
planned. The policy environment was largely favorable and supportive of the project at central and state



                                                         - 10 -

level, although the relatively frequent changes of state officials introduced complexity in project
operations. A slight devaluation of the Mexican peso reduced project costs compared to appraisal
estimates.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The normative complexity of the federal bureaucracy to which the project is subjected coupled with the
normative requirements of the Bank, led to delays in implementation that in most cases could not be
avoided. On the other hand, the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaria de Hacienda y
Credito Publico - SHCP) and SEP have consistently allocated the necessary budgetary funds for
CONAFE to carry out the project as planned.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Although relationships between CONAFE, SEP, SHCP and NAFIN are good, there are aspects that can
be improved. In particular, CONAFE and SEP can achieve closer coordination in technical areas.
CONAFE should also continue to improve communications between the central and the state level staff.
And more emphasis should be given to incorporating the results of evaluations in the design of
interventions, including recommendations made by the main actors who participate in the project. With
respect to operations, CONAFE can improve the planning of hiring consultants and, in general, perfect
its procurement planning techniques.

5.4 Costs and financing:
Project costs total US$483.7 million, or approximately 9 percent less than the appraisal estimate of
US$531.1 million. The difference can be attributed to a devaluation of the Mexican Peso compared to
the US dollar and, to a small extent, to delays in the actual transfer of the CONAFE budget. The
distribution of costs by component is similar to appraisal estimates, except in the case of studies and
institutional strengthening for which actual expenditures were significantly lower than originally
estimated. This difference is largely due to the fact that CONAFE's State Coordinating Units (Unidades
Coordinadoras Estatales (UCEs) were not fully capable of carrying out the selection of consultants
(especially consultant firms) according to the Bank Guidelines. This shortcoming has been overcome but
must be sustained with continued training and supervision. The Bank loan of US$300.0 million was
approved in March 2002 and declared effective in December 2002. The loan was fully disbursed on
August 27, 2004, although a refund of US$105,675 is pending (see Annex 8). The Loan financed 62
percent of total project costs, compared to an estimated 56 percent at appraisal.

The financial management arrangements for the project were appropriate with respect to budgeting,
accounting, flow of funds, internal controls, reporting, external audit, written procedures, staffing and
information systems. The FMRs were submitted on schedule and were produced manually as CONAFE's
financial management system was being enhanced. The enhanced system will be used in Phase III and
is expected to include the automatic generation of FMRs. All audit reports were submitted on time and
were unqualified. The 2003 audit had an expanded scope that included all CONAFE operations, not only
those of the project. This is a welcome innovation which reflects the fact that the project is an integral
part of the regular functions of the institution and has been cited as a model for audits of other
Bank-financed projects in Mexico. (See Section 10 for additional information on financial management).

With respect to procurement, CONAFE modified its strategy for the procurement of goods early on
during implementation, shifting from decentralized procurement carried out by the state level units
(UCEs) to centralized procurement under the responsibility of CONAFE's General Director for
Administration and Finance. This strategic decision enabled CONAFE to obtain lower prices. The
strategy saved 30 percent of the budget allocation in 2003--through savings in the purchases of
information technology equipment (15 percent) and didactic materials (50 percent).              CONAFE
recognized the shortcomings of decentralized procurement during the initial phase of project
implementation.     Based on this finding, CONAFE reorganized the procurement function, hired new
specialized staff at the central level, and was able to complete project implementation with marked
increase in efficiency. In spite of the above mentioned achievements, CONAFE still faces problems of
distribution of bulk purchases. In 2002-2003, most of the physical inputs of the project purchased in bulk



                                                    - 11 -

were distributed via the operational lines of CONAFE. At times, this strategy became vulnerable when
inventories failed to leave warehouses and inputs arrived somewhat late in the school calendar year. As
a result, in Phase III delivery of goods will be made through the transportation and packing services
contracted out by CONAFE. In the case of school infrastructure, works were carried out with community
participation, but the model adopted was over-optimistic regarding the capacity of local communities and
the variety of implementation arrangements that in fact existed. For PAREIB III a lower threshold for
expenditures on works build with community participation was chosen. Annex 8 summarizes the latest
procurement assessment of the project, carried out in conjunction with the ICR mission.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The ICR considers highly likely that project benefits will be sustained over time taking into account the
following factors.   First, project interventions are consistent with national education policy and fully
supported by SEP and by the states.          Second, CONAFE has gained considerable implementation
experience, has carried out frequent consultations with stakeholders, and has institutionalized a process
thereby activities and procedures are continuously evaluated and perfected. Several interventions
introduced as part of CONAFE's compensatory education program have been generalized to the national
education system by SEP and by the states. In fact, several states are starting to take charge of their
own compensatory education program. CONAFE introduced a culture of evaluation, and has complied
systematically with the mandate of the National Congress to submit external evaluations of the program
on a yearly basis. The fact that thousand of schools formerly supported by the project have now
"graduated" from the program means that improvements have become a part of the regular operations of
the educational system. Community ownership of the program and the direct involvement of parents in
the education of their children-promoted by the project, are an important factor supporting the long-terms
gains of the project.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
From inception, project activities have been an integral part of the regular operations of CONAFE and
will continue to be so during Phase III.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
(Satisfactory). The Bank team responsible for project preparation was technically capable and overall
project design was of good quality, reflecting effective collaboration between the Borrower and the Bank
throughout the preparation phase. The shortcomings mentioned in Section 3.4 have been corrected
during the preparation of Phase III. The choice of the APL instrument continues to prove appropriate.

7.2 Supervision:
(Satisfactory). The project supervision team included the appropriate mix of skills, and supervision
missions were carried out with the necessary frequency. Specific technical support particularly in the
areas of procurement and financial management, was provided by the Bank team on a continuous basis,
not only during formal supervision missions, through staff based in Mexico. However, during the last
months of project implementation, the handling by the Bank of the misprocurement affecting one
contract was less than satisfactory; work is ongoing to resolve the issue, as explained in Annex 8.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
(Satisfactory). The overall Bank performance during project preparation and implementation was
satisfactory. The excellent relations maintained by the Bank with CONAFE, NAFIN, the SCHP and the
Secretaría de la Función Pública are an important factor in explaining the overall success of the
operation.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
(Satisfactory). In 2002, when the project was being prepared, a new management and technical team
had just been installed in CONAFE. Despite the relative lack of experience of the team, it was able to
prepare the project fully, including introducing welcome improvements in the design of project
interventions. Especially noteworthy was the collegial mode of participating instituted by CONAFE,
whereby all directors as well as the general manager and specialists took part in project preparation. This
outcome is the effect of strong leadership and a team composition with the right skill-mix.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
(Satisfactory). Throughout project implementation the government acted with transparency and
competence. The participation of the SHCP and NAFIN was consistently helpful throughout the
implementation period. There was consistency with respect to budgeting and direct collaboration in the
areas of education evaluation and planning on the part of SEP, which enriched project outcomes.
Overall, the performance of the government has been highly supportive of the project.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
(Satisfactory). CONAFE managed the project at high technical and administrative standards. Decisions
were made at the right time, reprogramming was done in an opportune manner, and a culture of dialogue
with stakeholders including civil society, state and federal education authorities, became the norm. The
specific decision to centralize the procurement of goods afforded the project lower prices; the resulting
economies were reallocated to expand coverage of project activities. The increased level of execution of
the allocated budgets is only one of the tangible results of good governance within CONAFE, as there
are many other improvements that cannot be so clearly documented. In the area of evaluation, the full
potential of the information assembled during Phase II will be systematically used to inform activities
during Phase III, with expected better education planning results at state level. The main area needing
strengthening is that of analysis of the available information, also emphasized in Phase III. CONAFE's
administrative costs increased to about 12 percent compared to approximately 8 percent in PAREIB I,
reflecting the fact that more activities were carried out, especially training and supervision activities but
also stakeholder consultations.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
(Satisfactory). Based on the above mentioned facts, the ICR rates overall Borrower performance as
satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

As indicated in the PAD for Phase III, a number of important lessons were learned from the
implementation of PAREIB II. In particular, the following are highlighted:

l   The APL instrument proved efficient in so far as it relied on a consistent policy framework and
    allowed adjustments to fit changing needs in the project area.

l   The strategy of providing in-school technical assistance for teachers, although difficult to implement,
    proved an effective means to help teachers apply the skills that are appropriate to the particular
    situation of their students. The decision by CONAFE to concentrate technical assistance in
    multi-grade schools, provide complementary materials, and link student achievement evaluations to
    the technical assistance program, although complex, is the right strategy to customize teaching
    know-how and help the most deficient schools.

l   Education innovation research is best carried out by specialized research institutions. The
    experience of the Fund for Education Innovation, managed by the states, resulted in fragmented
    efforts and less then expected impact.



                                                    - 13 -

l The successful experience in supporting parents associations in primary schools led CONAFE to
  extend the initiative to preschool education.

l Evaluation of student learning achievement and the wide dissemination of test results is a good
  strategy to involve civil society as partners in the education effort and a valuable instrument to
  improve teaching/learning strategies. However, continued attention needs to be given to improving
  analytical capacity at central and state levels in order to fully utilize the results of these evaluations.

l The exit strategy for schools from the CONAFE compensatory education program follows criteria
  based on performance in key education indicators. In this respect, it is important to follow the
  "graduated" schools to be able to ascertain to what extent the gains achieved are in fact sustained
  over time.

l Finally, with respect to procurement, Phase II shows that a decentralized strategy for the
  procurement of goods is not the most efficient approach.                 Once CONAFE centralized the
  procurement of goods, and hired specialized staff to carry it out, it obtained lower prices, and
  fostered more interest and competition among suppliers. The distribution of goods procured in bulk
  can be improved as planned for Phase III through the contracting of specialized transportation firms.

                          BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, PHASE II

                      COMMENTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT


   The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit considers that the execution of this project implemented
   by the National Council for Educational Development (CONAFE) has been successful in having
   fulfilled, within the anticipated time, its objectives in both: its sector goals as well as in administrative
   and financial matters.

   As in other successful projects, it is observed in this case that a factor that is present in the
   preparation and execution work has been the participation of staff with high sense of responsibility and
   technical capacity in the executing institution and in the case of the Bank, the participation of a team
   of experts with initiative and conviction in its proposals.

   In reference to the financial management aspects of the project, the financial authorities consider that
   it was highly efficient to have disbursed the total loan proceeds within the estimated period. As a
   result, among other advantages for the country, an economic benefit was obtained by avoiding
   excessive payments in commitment fees. It should be noted that an important support came from the
   Federal Government when assigning enough and timely resources to the CONAFE budget.

   In regard to the technical contribution of Bank personnel during the preparation stage, the
   Government considers that it was valuable.             Among other factors, the active and continuoud
   participation of the Sector Leader through the project preparation work, allowed an adequate design of
   the second phase of the project. The close participation of this staff member with the project team
   during the supervision work of Phase I of the PAREIB allowed for identification of the actions and
   components that needed to be modified for Phase II.

   Furthermore, it was apparent that the level and experience of Bank personnel that participated in the
   first stage allowed for the contribution of useful elements for the design of the new phase. It is
   believed that an element by the Bank that favored the project was, on one hand, the continuity of staff
   in this second stage, since to a large extent it was the same staff that supervised Phase I, and on the
   other hand, the level of knowledge and experience of the sector themes and the national context of
   said staff.

   During the implementation stage and specifically, in the supervision process, a positive factor was the
   regularity in mission programming. This contributed to identify aspects that the Bank could improve
   for the current loan (PAREIB III) or for any other similar project. Within the processes that could
   improve, it is suggested that follow up from the Resident Mission could be carried out on a day-to-day
   basis to solve pending issues that may arise during project implementation, so that the technical
   contribution of the Bank is not limited to the periods of supervision missions.

   Moreover, in the case of the different information given to the Bank by the executing institutions
   during project execution, the Bank could increase the value added to the project and the country if
   feedback (observations or comments) were provided more frequently to these local institutions or



                                                       - 15 -

   authorities.

   In addition, the Bank could support project execution if it would revise its policies and procedures
   regarding changes in personnel. It should be mentioned that changes of Bank personnel affect local
   institutions not only as a result of the use of different criteria and interpretations on the normative
   framework of operations, but also due to lack of knowledge of the national context in the case of new
   staff, or to lack of incentives to work effectively for staff close to retiring.

   It is considered that staff changes have major relevance when they affect functions or areas
   considered key for the effective execution of projects. The procurement process continues to be of
   great complexity and impact on projects. Specifically, in the case of PAREIB II, it was observed that
   a change in the procurement official greatly affected the project since it was an operation with a large
   amount of purchases, and being an education project, the procurement of goods is directly related to
   the timely delivery of school programs.

   In terms of the procurement norms for projects, it is obvious that the procurement procedures are
   more complex when including the international context of trade.               The globalization process, the
   constant change in international trade rules, the strategies and policies of international trade of the
   countries directly affects the procurement complexity and fulfillment of the norms of the Bank that the
   institutions of the borrowing countries must follow. Therefore, it is necessary that the World Bank
   consider the possibility of revising said norms in light of the new global context of foreign trade.

   In the case of incidents related to this matter and given that the procedures of international bidding
   are normally reviewed by the Bank, the role of the Bank should be analyzed so that it eventually
   assumes a greater co-responsibility in errors or mistakes. The application of sanctions in a unilateral
   form by the Bank, such as the cancellation of loan resources, seem drastic measures that move away
   from the spirit of collaboration and teamwork between the Bank and the borrower.

   Therefore, it would be advisable that the Bank, prior to the issuance of judgments or declarations of
   error in these procedures, establish a mechanism of joint revision that uses criteria that considers all
   the elements related. Furthermore, it would be useful to establish communication procedures that
   allow the exchange of points of view on these events in an intense and opportune manner between all
   the participating parties. In this matter, the Resident Missions of the Bank could play a more active
   role in the review and clarification of these incidents.

Financial Management Arrangements (FM): The executing agency for this project was CONAFE, the
same agency that implemented Phase I of PAREIB and is implementing Phase III. Overall, FM
arrangements for the project were appropriate, including budgeting, accounting, flow of funds, internal
control, reporting, external audit, written procedures, FM staffing and information systems.

l   Flow of funds: Bank loan funds were transferred from the loan account to a Special Account
    managed by NAFIN and established in US dollars at the Mexican central bank. CONAFE received
    funds in local currency via its standard budget from the national treasury, which was reimbursed at
    the end of the cycle from the Special Account. The loan was disbursed via a transaction-based
    disbursement procedure (SOE).

l   Budgeting: Counterpart funds were represented by the funds that CONAFE included in its standard
    budget to carry out project activities partially financed by the Bank loan. This was based on agreed
    financing percentages by disbursement categories. Both Bank funds and counterpart funds were

  registered within CONAFE's standard budget in two separated budgetary lines earmarked for the
  project.

l Staffing: The financial management of the project was the responsibility of a team, working under
  the Programas Compensatorios Unit, headed by an experienced manager (Public Accountant) and
  including staff from all administrative areas of CONAFE (accounting, treasury, budgeting,
  information systems, and others). This team was supervised by NAFIN, as the financial agency
  designated by the SHCP for the project. Staffing arrangements were satisfactory to the Bank.

l Accounting Policies and Procedures: CONAFE maintained records and accounts adequate for
  the needs of the project.      Accounting practices were compatible with International Accounting
  Standards and in compliance with local requirements. These practices ensured that financial
  transactions were made with consideration to safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry
  in the accounting and monitoring systems.

l Information Systems:       Systems were considered acceptable to the Bank, but were not fully
  integrated. These systems were complemented with spreadsheets. During Phase II, CONAFE
  intended to implement a new system but only system design was completed. For Phase III, the new
  system will be implemented and will produce FM information on the format of the Financial
  Monitoring Reports (FMR).

l Financial Reporting: CONAFE, through and with the support of NAFIN, submitted FMRs which
  sufficiently described all project operations, but these reports did not form the basis for
  disbursement.

l Internal Control and external audit: CONAFE's internal audit department was responsible for
  permanent internal audit reviews.      The external audit process and audit reports followed Bank
  policies and procedures. Annual audits were carried out in accordance with auditing standards, by
  independent auditors and under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. All audit reports were
  submitted on a timely basis to the Bank. The FM team reviewed these reports and considered all of
  them acceptable to the Bank.       The FM team provided comments and recommendations, and
  CONAFE implemented the appropriate actions accordingly. The FM team expects to receive the last
  audit report which will cover the period of January to September 2004, on timely basis.

l Supervision: The FM team carried out supervision missions as they were required. These missions
  were mostly carried out jointly with the regular project supervision mission by the Bank, but some
  independent missions were needed. All supervision missions included the participation of NAFIN
  and SHCP.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

Summary
This analysis reviews the progress made in the key educational indicators for CONAFE and on-CONAFE
schools during the 1998-2003 period. The main results reported cover completion, repetition and failure
rates. The completion rate for primary CONAFE students increased by 9.4 percent while, at the national
level, such increase was only 4.6 percent.

The analysis also examines the impact on learning achievement of CONAFE's compensatory programs,
through a review of the research work by Shapiro and Moreno Trevino (2004). Specifically, the authors
found that CONAFE is most effective in improving primary school math learning and secondary school
Spanish learning.

Finally, the analysis uses a cost-effectiveness approach to estimate the efficiency in the use of resources
for indigenous and non-indigenous CONAFE schools. In general, calculations showed that the
impact-cost elasticity was often greater than one for the indigenous schools. This supports other
evaluations findings, that is, spending on compensatory programs is particularly efficient when targeted
to indigenous schools.

Approach
The PAREIB project is an educational investment that is improving Mexican human capital. However, a
traditional cost-benefit analysis of this investment was not carried out, due to the difficulty in estimating
the future stream of benefits, in the form of future labor market earnings for students and for society as a
whole.

Instead, an exploratory analysis was carried out, based on a cost-effectiveness methodology that
compares the increases in per pupil cost with increases in the main educational indicators (such as
completion, repetition and failure rates) during the period 1998-2003. This exercise is complemented by
a reviewing of the most recent impact evaluations that have been done for the CONAFE compensatory
programs.

Educational indicators at schools supported by CONAFE compared to the national average
This analysis focuses on three educational indicators: completion, repetition and failure rates. In Figure
1, completion rates for the national average schools and CONAFE schools are shown for 1997-1998
(baseline) and 2002-2003. The data show that completion rates in CONAFE schools have improved from
77.3 to 84.6 percent, a 9.4 percent increase. The gap between national average completion rates and
that of CONAFE students is closing faster for the indigenous schools than for the non-indigenous
schools. For example, in 1997-1998 the gap was about 21.8 percentage points and in 2003 it was only
8.1 percentage points. In non-indigenous schools the improvement was 1 percentage point in the same
period (see Figure 2).

While it would be desirable to compare indigenous and non indigenous schools with similar groups of
schools, rather than with the national average, this exercise could not be done because the information
required was not available. Moreover, all indigenous schools are supported by CONAFE compensatory
programs, so there is no other group that can be totally comparable to them.

If we compare the repetition indicators, outcomes are not as favorable with respect to completion rates.
That is because the repetition rate only fell about one percentage point in each school category (all
schools, indigenous and non-indigenous schools). What is interesting here is the equal effect on all types
of CONAFE schools (see Figure 3).

Figure 5 is shows the failure rate gap in CONAFE schools compared to the national average. At first
sight it looks like the gap has not narrowed, but a closer look shows that indigenous schools reduced
failure rates faster than the national average. The difference is significant in indigenous schools because
failure rate were reduced from 14 to 11.7 percent (2.3 percentage points), while the national average
decreased by only 1.9 percentage points (from 7.3 to 5.4 percent) during the same period.

A summary of the progress made on the key indicators in the two phases of the project for primary
CONAFE schools is shown below for 1997-1998 (baseline) and 2001-2003. It is important to mention that
during the 1998-2001 CONAFE was still operating PAREB (Programa para Abatir el Rezago Educativo,
Loan 3722-ME) and PIARE (Programa Integral para Reducir el Rezago Educativo, financed by IDB)
projects. Thus, it is not possible to attribute the whole change in the educational indicators exclusively to
PAREIB.

CONAFE Impact on Student Achievement
Shapiro and Moreno Trevino (2004) used the propensity score matching technique to evaluate the
effectiveness of CONAFE in improving student test scores and lowering repetition and failure rates
during the period 1998-2002. In particular, they found that CONAFE is most effective in improving
primary school Math learning and secondary school Spanish learning. In addition, Telesecundaria and
bilingual education for indigenous students also improved student achievement.

To measure student achievement, the authors used the Estandares Nacionales database for the period
of 1998-2002. These data consist of results from Spanish and Math tests applied by SEP to a
representative sample of students each year. These exams were complemented by background surveys
responded by students, parents, teachers and principals of schools and all of them can be linked through
a school code.

In order to know how CONAFE differently affects the most and least disadvantaged students in Mexico,
the authors divided the sample of students into three groups of relative disadvantage. These are: (1) less
disadvantaged; (2) mid-range; and (3) more disadvantaged. This classification was based on the
probability that the school receives CONAFE support, given background school variables.

According to the estimations, for all the groups, CONAFE students gained annually on the control group
by 2.4 to 4.3 points as minimum in global scores (average score for Math and Spanish). In Math,
CONAFE students gained on their non-CONAFE peers by 4.8 to 5.6 points per year. The impact
decomposition by subject showed that CONAFE improved math scores in primary school, but its effect
on Spanish scores was unclear.

Also, an interesting finding is that CONAFE increases test score inequality for different types of students.
CONAFE has the greatest impact on increasing scores of the most disadvantaged students. In this case,
CONAFE decreased test score inequality in each category of exam by 30 percent per year, while the
reduction was of 9 percent per year for the less disadvantaged group.

For indigenous students, the authors conclude that CONAFE students gained in math scores by 6.5
points compared to non-CONAFE students. In general, CONAFE has no evident and consistent impact
on indigenous Spanish scores. However, these results should be taken with caution because all
indigenous schools receive CONAFE support and it was not possible for the authors to find a good
control group for comparison.

Finally, the authors observed notable improvements in the repetition and failure rates for CONAFE
students. CONAFE appeared to decrease repetition rates by an average of 0.13 percent per year, which
represents an elimination of 6 percent of inequality in repetition rates between comparable CONAFE and
non-CONAFE students. On the whole, CONAFE decreased failure rates by 0.3 percent per year, but that
effect was the largest for the less-disadvantaged group.

As the authors well remarked, there are unobserved factors that limit CONAFE results and they suggest
that the actual effect of CONAFE on student performance is likely more positive than the estimates
presented.

Costs-Effectiveness
Rural and indigenous schools lack the minimum resources to provide an adequate education, while in
many urban schools the resources are enough to maintain a satisfactory school environment. These
disparities are not well targeted by the amount of funding and supervising activities that SEP gives to
each type of school. For rural and indigenous schools located in communities with high poverty incidence
and low education indicators, the marginal change attributable to CONAFE support in the school budget
and per pupil expenditure must be substantial.

Actually, SEP does not measure the cost per pupil disaggregated by urban and rural locality, and does
not even have information by type of school. 1. Actually in Mexico there are five types of schools:
Urban-public, rural, indigenous, communitarian and urban-private. This is because of the complexity of

country. In Table 2 below the cost per pupil at the national level is shown for 1990 through 2004. During
the period of 1998-2003, the nominal cost per pupil in primary increased from MXN$5,000 to
MXN$8,500, that is a 71 percent increase, corresponding in real terms to an increase by about 15
percent (see Tables 2 and 3). However, these aggregate figures do not show the true per pupil
expenditure that indigenous and rural schools actually have.

Lopez-Acevedo (1999) used estimations of the unit cost of CONAFE students that were exclusively
obtained for the evaluation of the PARE program and from SEP. 2. Before 1998, SEP used to estimate
the cost per pupil decomposed by indigenous and non-indigenous Table 4 shows the estimations of per
pupil expenditure for all the participant states. According to these data, an indigenous student under the
PARE program cost on average MXN$2,037 in 1994. The PARE increased the average per pupil cost by
38.1 percent, 24.2 percent and 4.3 percent in indigenous, rural and urban schools.

During the PARE program, mathematics and Spanish tests were applied.                                       These tests provided
measures of the impact of the program on the students' achievements. Comparing gains in test scores
with the cost increase, it was found that the program most cost-effective for indigenous students, that is
to say, the main cost increase (38 percent) was allocated to students that yield the major gains in test
scores (42 percent). On the other hand, the cost increase was greater than the percentage change in the
tests scores for the rural and especially for urban students.




                                                                    - 30 -

Using a cost-effectiveness approach, the PAREIB program is effective in so far as the percentage
change in the cost per pupil in CONAFE schools is lower than the percentage change on the completion,
repetition and failure rates.

Since primary education is the main educational level supported by CONAFE's compensatory programs,
this analysis focuses on the cost-effectiveness of the program for primary schools. Because there are no
recent estimations of the actual amount that federal, state and municipal governments spend per pupil
on CONAFE schools (or similar, i.e. rural and indigenous schools), the national public per pupil
expenditure is used, even though these figures probably over-represent the impact-cost change ratio.

Table 5 shows the cost percentage change and the percentage changes in completion, repetition and
failure rates for CONAFE schools, showing that-most of the time-the cost increase is greater than the
impact on the educational indicators for all the schools.

Decomposing the data by indigenous and non-indigenous CONAFE schools, the analysis shows that, in
most cases, the percentage change in the completion rate was greater than the cost increase in the
indigenous schools (the absolute value of the impact-cost elasticity was greater than one). Specifically,
for the indigenous schools the impact-cost elasticity was of 2.14 in 1998, 1.7 in 2000 and 1.08 in 2002,
when the completion rate was taken as the impact indicator.

The last effect indicates an efficient allocation of resources when they are spent on indigenous students;
also this result is similar to the findings of Lopez-Acevedo (1999) for the PARE program.

    * Indicates that the impact-cost elasticity (percentage change in indicator/ percentage change in cost) is equal or greater than one.
    Note:The percentage changes in the educational indicators are calculated as the percentage change between the t+1 and t period of
    each variable.

Since per pupil cost information is less than reliable, especially for the indigenous and rural schools, the
inverse exercise is carried out in Table 6, i.e. estimates are given for the minimum per pupil cost needed
to keep indigenous schools efficiency rates (completion, repetition and failure rates). For example, if the
nominal cost per pupil in 1998 was at least MXN$2,318 the percentage change in cost would be equal or
lower than the percentage change in the completion rate. In other words, the impact-cost elasticity would
be at least one. For 2002, per pupil expenditure in indigenous schools would need to be at least
MXN$7,552 in order for the cost increase to be lower than 4.2 percent.

Table 6 also shows that the impact of CONAFE's compensatory program on the educational indicators
has been positive, but has declined over time. That is because, in order to keep efficiency rates in
indigenous schools, per pupil expenditure needs to be higher and closer to the average national per pupil
expenditure. But this result runs counter to the idea that CONAFE schools lag well behind the national
average in terms of per pupil expenditure.

                    Note: estimations only for the years where the impact-cost elasticity was greater than one.

It is important to note that these calculations have several limitations, notably because not all the change
in the educational indicators can be attributed to CONAFE's compensatory program and a rigorous
impact evaluation would require a counterfactual value that would allow identifying the genuine impact of
the project. Another source of bias is that PAREIB overlaps with other government compensatory
programs; such as OPORTUNIDADES. According to CONAFE, in 2003 the two programs overlapped by
1,696,734 students, or about 15 percent of the total students supported by CONAFE.

Another impact evaluation of CONAFE compensatory programs for the period of 1998-2002, support the
exploratory analysis presented above. This evaluation was carried out by the Benemérita Universidad
Autónoma de Puebla (2003). This evaluation uses an experimental methodology to construct a control
group to compare with CONAFE students. The analysis found that the greatest impact of the
compensatory programs is on the repetition rate of rural schools and the impact is twice as large for boys
as for girls, largely because boys had originally higher repetition rates than girls. In urban schools no
significant impact on the repetition rates was found.

Also, this 2003 analysis estimated cost-effectiveness elasticity, where cost corresponds to unit cost per
school. For the total sample of schools the elasticity was 0.087 percent and for rural schools the
estimated elasticity was 0.055 percent. That means that for one percent increase in the unit cost per
school the repetition rate falls 0.055 percent in rural primary schools supported by CONAFE.

Additional Annex 8. Procurement Assessment Report of September, 2004

Background
Phase II (Loan 7108-ME) of PAREIB was proposed to be executed in two years, with a closing date in
June 30, 2004. The Loan of US$ 300.0 million became effective on December 11, 2002 and the closing
date was not extended. Two amendments were made to the Loan Agreement.                     The first, dated
December 18, 2002 increased the amount allowed for retroactive financing from US$30.0 million to
US$80.0 million. The second, dated January 26, 2004 modified the periodicity for the presentation of
FMRs from quarterly to bi-annually. None of these amendments changed Schedule 4 (Procurement) of
the Loan Agreement. Project costs for Phase II were estimated at US$531.1 million. A cancellation of
US$105,675.51 of the loan amount was the result of a declaration of misprocurement exercised by the
Bank on May 14, 2004. At the time of the closing date, the cancellation was not effected and the loan
was fully disbursed, therefore a refund to the Bank is expected.

Execution Arrangements
The execution agency for this project was the Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo (CONAFE), an
agency of Mexico's Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP), the same institution that implemented Phase
I of the Program. CONAFE kept close coordination with SEP throughout implementation. Two main
units of SEP participated directly in the project: the General Directorate for Planning, Programming, and
Budgeting (Dirección General de Planeación, Programación y Presupuesto-DGPPP) and the General
Directorate for Evaluation (Dirección General de Evaluación-DGE). Project coordination activities within
CONAFE were carried out by the Compensatory Programs Unit (Unidad de Programas Compensatorios-
UPC). Work in the states was carried out by the State Coordinating Units (Unidades Coordinadoras
Estatales- UCEs). These operative units that UPC keeps in each state are required to maintain close
coordination with the State Secretariats of Public Education (SEPEs). As it was agreed for Phase II of
the project, Nacional Financiera, SNC (NAFIN) continued acting as the financial intermediary. NAFIN
provided desk supervision of the procurement work and handled all the communications regarding the
procurement under the Project.

Procurement of Good, Small Works (CDD) and Services
CONAFE was successful in carrying out a substantial procurement program of goods, small works (CDD)
and services (not related to consulting services), valued at approximately US$201.2 million during Phase
II. The main physical inputs included purchase of school and office equipment and furniture, didactic
materials, including library books, consumable student supplies, and small works in the form of
construction, rehabilitation and refurbishing of school infrastructure (classrooms and other school
facilities such as sanitary facilities, sports courts, fences, administrative offices and teacher's
accommodations).

Procurement Practices
During implementation, CONAFE used two organizational approaches to carry out the procurement
under the project: (a) a decentralized approach where the UCEs were the principal units in charge of
procurement;    this approach was abandoned in 2001, that is prior to loan effectiveness, affecting
expenditures financed retroactively; and (b) a centralized approach, which is now in place, whereby
CONAFE carries out most of the project purchases directly, except for small works activities that pertain
to the CDD program and the purchase of consumable office supplies by the UCEs to support their own
operation.

In spite of the results of the Bank's procurement capacity assessment in October 2001 regarding the
UCEs, the decentralized approach above mentioned was suspended after a performance evaluation
which took place in early 2002. This review revealed a series of institutional difficulties in the UCEs,
which impacted negatively on the efficiency and economy of the investment assigned to each state.
Changes in the state administration modified institutional practices and staffing of the UCEs reducing
their capacity significantly. The main difficulties were the legal status of the UCEs, the state budgeting
practices and the lack of qualified staff. As a result, there were substantial delays and deficiencies in
processing bid documentation, executing and supervising deliveries; supplies charged high prices, as



                                                    - 42 -

they viewed their contracts affected by these issues. On the basis of such an evaluation, CONAFE
sought the agreement of the Bank to centralize back the procurement function, as in PARE (Loan
3407-ME) and PAREB (Loan 3722-ME). At the end of Phase II of PAREIB, the strategy of centralized
procurement resulted in lower prices.

In 2003, the Project was subject to a misprocurement case involving the procurement of pencils under a
contract signed with a foreign bidder. The contract cost was about US$420,000 and the Bank cancelled
US$105,675.51 of the loan proceeds as explained above.              The misprocurement occurred due to
CONAFE overlooking a regulation issued by the Secretariat of Economy imposing an import fee to
pencils manufactured in China alleging dumping practices. The law requires that the importer pay the
fee, estimated at 400% of the CIF price, in order to import pencils from China. This regulation was not
specified in the bidding documents. The winning bidder shipped the pencils from China to Mexico under
a valid contract. Upon arrival of the shipment, customs did not clear the import. By the time of this
review, the pencils remain in a customs' warehouse. In the view of the Bank, the Government of Mexico
(GOM) has an outstanding debt with the winning bidder in the amount of the contract value, as the bidder
complied with the terms and conditions of the contract. The Bank declared the purchase as misprocured.
The winning bidder has raised his case to high management level in the Bank. However, any payment to
the bidder appears to be illegal in Mexico. A settlement of the matter doses not appear achievable
without a court of law decision. Unfortunately, the bidding document used in this bidding did not include
a clause on arbitration. The case led to a change in the ICB documents agreed with the Secretaría de la
Función Pública reinstating the standard clause on arbitration.

Methodologies of Procurement
Regarding goods, student supplies and related services, CONAFE reports a total program of US$91.9
million of investments in these categories. CONAFE made extensive use of ICB and NCB procurement,
reporting US$74.8 million and US$5.4 million, respectively. Aggregates for NCB were originally planned
to not exceed US$20.0 million, and were sufficiently kept under control. In contrast, the aggregate
amount for national or international shopping, originally planned at US$2.0 million equivalent, is reported
at US$11.8 million.      With respect to works, carried out with community participation under CDD
methodology, CONAFE's report indicates a total project investment of US$109.4 million, compared to
US$95.5 million originally planned at appraisal. While direct contracting was not included in Schedule 4
(Procurement) of the Loan Agreement, in October 2002 the Bank agreed exceptionally to several direct
contracts with editorial houses residing in Mexico, for approximately US$3.4 million in library books and
supplementary materials for school and classroom libraries, and for optic readers for US$276,307
justified on the basis of standardization of equipment.

Community Participation
With respect to community participation, the model used during project implementation required the
UCEs to sign participating agreements (Convenios) with communities in the 31 states of Mexico. An
annual "Programa de Obra"(PO) was submitted to the Bank for no objection, listing communites that had
joined the program. The PO showed aggregate amounts of (works) to be agreed by UCEs, without clear
reference/evidence as to the nature of civil works, nor type, size, location or related information. The
community organizations benefiting from the CDD program were of different types: Parent's Associations
(Asociación de Padres de Familia(APF), Social Participation Councils (Consejos de Participación Social--
CPS), Municipalities (Ayuntamientos Municipales), and Decentralized Agencies for School Construction (
Órganos Decentralizados de Construcción de Escuelas ODCEs), all competing for funds to finance their
subprojects. For purposes of assessing this model, it is worth noting that ODCE is not a community
organization, but a state public agency. According to information received, the ODCE would engage in
construction or rehabilitation of school infrastructure as a last resort alternative, when none of the other
community bodies would agree to undertake the works. The size of the contracts that were agreed under
Phase II (US$350,000 equivalent) appears rather large for the limited capacity of the communities to
handle the small works procurement method. Consequently, this issue was revisited in Phase III and the
allocation was changed to a maximum of US$50,000 equivalent per subproject per community the
average cost of a classroom (aula) at national level is approximately US$13,000 equivalent (already
showing an increase in steel prices in 2004).




                                                    - 43 -

Technical assistance and supervision needed to accompany the annual PO was done by state
infrastructure agencies. No private firms or individuals were engaged to supervise the works. Payments
for such technical services were charged to the civil works disbursement category. Seemingly, the
payments for the construction carried out by the communities were generally channeled through state
agencies such as the Public Works Secretariat (Secretaría de Obras Públicas(SOP) and the CAPCE
State School Construction Agency, and these entities organized the community works. CONAFE reports
that the technical and supervision services provided by the state supervisory agencies represent
approximately 7% of the construction investment. Lessons from this issue were noted at the time of the
ex-post procurement review in 2003, and were discussed again during the appraisal of Phase III of
PAREIB. Under Phase III, it was agreed that the supervision costs will be paid out of the counterpart
funds to the cost of the Project.

Procurement of Consultants' Services
Consultants' Services and training were lumped together in a single category of expenditure that
somehow obscured the monitoring of the project's procurement plan for the institutional strengthening
component. It is noted that from the original proposed project allocation of US$160.0 million to this
category of expenditure, final reports show a lower allocation of US$120.6 million; part of the funds were
used to purchase goods such as training materials.

CONAFE faced substantial limitations in completing its plans for hiring technical assistance. In the years
2001-2002 only 10% of the envisioned hiring activities were completed. This constraint was mostly
noticeable for consulting services requiring firms. CONAFE found out that their technical staff had many
difficulties understanding the Bank's procedures for hiring consultant firms under QCBS Selection Based
on Quality and Cost procedures. From 2003
until the project closing, performance in this field has improved. Seemingly, the UCEs started following
the QCBS method, reaching contracts in an amount representing about 17% of the allocated budget for
this category. The hiring of consultants' services by the Basic Education Unit represented 80% of the
expenses in this category; the Initial Education Unit spent 20%.

Hiring Methodologies
Under the Loan Agreement for Phase II, CONAFE conducted its Procurement Plan with only one
methodology: QCBS. No other methodologies were entertained, in part because the Secretaría de la
Función Pública does not authorize other methods contemplated in the Bank's Guidelines. Sole-source
selection was agreed by the Bank on exception circumstances.

Procurement Plan
An PAC Annual Procurement Plan was periodically submitted to the Bank for no-objection throughout the
project's life. However, because these plans included scarce details, the ability of CONAFE and of the
Bank to carry out a satisfactory supervision of the PACs was curtailed, as PACs did not include an actual
calendar or a mechanism to update procurement activities. The effectiveness of the PACs was hindered
by the lack of information about the actual completion and reporting of procurement activities at the state
level.

Review by the Bank
Prior review by the Bank of CONAFE's procurement activities under goods, works and services during
PAREIB II followed, to a great extent, reasonable standard procedures and used documentation for
contracting of goods and consulting services as per agreements with the Bank. Exception is taken for
contracts awarded exceptionally under direct contract (library books) and shopping purchases, where, in
the view of the Bank, the national standard contract form used left unprotected the right of the Borrower
in key commercial sections such as guarantees and insurance, although CONAFE maintains an overall
insurance policy covering all goods procured.




                                                    - 44 -

One full ex-post review was conducted for 2002 in August 6, 2003. This review included 35 contracts in
three expenditure categories (goods, student supplies and consultants). The total aggregate value of the
contracts reviewed was US$4.9 million equivalent. No ex-post review was conducted for the CDD
component. The outcome of the review was communicated to CONAFE and NAFIN authorities during a
procurement seminar conducted in October 2003.

Institutional Capacity to Conduct Procurement
CONAFE's institutional capacity to conduct procurement evolves from the experience accumulated in a
series of Bank loans (Loans 3047, 3722 and 4333-ME Phase I of PAREIB). The organization, structure
and staff composition at CONAFE have changed, as the government administration turned over.
However, the staff somehow at times easier or with greater difficulties was able to understand and
comply with the most important principles and covenants of the Bank's Guidelines and Loan Agreement.
As Phase II moved on, and in a manner consistent with other institutional staffing changes associated
with the new Administration, the procurement team of CONAFE underwent a re-engineering process for
the better. The procurement staff that completed the implementation of PAREIB II was hired in 2002.
CONAFE's authorities felt the need to upgrade the quality of procurement in the project and hired more
qualified staff. The benefits of such a management decision are reaping in the third phase of the APL.

As a result of the comprehensive review of procurement performance of 2002, and towards the end of
the project, CONAFE was able to match the procurement functions with qualified staff. It is noted that on
arrival, although new staff had experience on national procurement, they spent substantial time learning
from the Bank and from NAFIN about ICB and QCBS. The procurement was organized under the
Administrative and Finance Directorate of CONAFE (Dirección de Administración y finanza), with one
Under-Director of Material Resources and three procurement specialists in charge of ICB, NCB and
shopping contracts.

This procurement team assisted CONAFE's General Director for Administration and Finance to
centralize and supervise closer the procurement activities of the Project. This strategic decision enabled
CONAFE to obtain lower prices. The strategy saved 30% of the budget allocation in 2003 through
savings in the purchase of IT equipment by 15% and of didactic materials by 50%. The institutional
strengthening process which took place at CONAFE, fostered better and more wide advertisement of
bidding opportunities, which in turn increased competition and diversity among suppliers and contractors.

Success in competition of CONAFE's procurement became important for the bidding community, leading
to a remarkable increase in participation due to the interest of national and foreign bidders in major
contracts offered by CONAFE. Savings became evident after competition trends increased; also, quality
of deliverables showed a noticeable positive trend. CONAFE has succeeded in making a substantial
change in the outcome of its PACs.

In spite of the above mentioned achievements, CONAFE still faces problems of distribution of bulk
purchases. In 2002-2003, most of the physical inputs of the project purchased in bulk were distributed
via the operational lines of CONAFE. At times, this strategy became vulnerable when inventories failed
to leave warehouses and inputs arrived somewhat late in the school calendar year.             As a result,
purchases made in 2004 (most probably financed by Phase III) will be delivered through the
transportation and packing services contracted out by CONAFE through NCB procedures, as allowed
under a new lending policy of the Bank.

Bank Supervision
Bank supervision was in place at all required times during project implementation, since this project was
serviced by procurement staff based in Mexico. This close contact facilitated communications and
clarifications. Notwithstanding this supervision structure, at times CONAFE and NAFIN reported delays
in the issuance of no-objection letters. CONAFE also reported delays in the tasks handled by NAFIN.

Project Costs by Procurement Arrangements
Compared to Appraisal Estimates, the most important changes in the procurement arrangements are a
consequence of the shift of strategy for the procurement of students and teachers supplies. These items



                                                   - 45 -

were originally planned to be procured at the state level.    As this strategy changed during project
implementation to centralized procurement, the same items packaged in larger contracts were procured
at the central level, largely through ICB procedures. As a result, increased ICB procurement resulted in
decreasing amounts originally allocated to the categories of consultants' services and grants to schools
(see Procurement Arrangements Tables
in Annex 2).

           COMENTARIOS AL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT

 La Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público considera que la ejecución de este proyecto
 llevada a cabo por el Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo (CONAFE) ha sido exitosa al
 haber cumplido en los tiempos previstos con los objetivos que se propuso, tanto en sus metas
 sectoriales como en materia administrativa y financiera.

 Al igual que en otros proyectos exitosos en este caso se observa que un factor presente en los
 trabajos de preparación y ejecución ha sido la participación de funcionarios con alto sentido de
 responsabilidad y capacidad técnica por parte de las institución ejecutora y por el lado del
 Banco, de un equipo de expertos, con iniciativa y convicción en sus propuestas.

 En lo que ser refiere a los aspectos de administración financiera del proyecto las autoridades
 financieras consideran que fue de alta eficiencia, al haberse desembolsado la totalidad de los
 recursos del préstamo en el periodo previsto. Como resultado, entre otras ventajas para el país
 se obtuvo un beneficio económico al evitar el pago excesivo por concepto de comisión de
 compromiso. Cabe señalar que un apoyo importante provino por parte del Gobierno Federal al
 asignarse recursos en el presupuesto del CONAFE en monto suficiente y en forma oportuna

 Por lo que toca a la aportación técnica del personal del Banco durante la etapa de preparación
 el Gobierno considera que fue valioso. Entre otros factores, la participación activa y continua
 del Líder del Sector a través de los diversos trabajos de preparación permitió lograr un diseño
 apropiado de la segunda fase del proyecto. La participación estrecha de dicho funcionario y el
 equipo del proyecto durante los trabajos de supervisión de la Fase I del PAREIB permitió
 identificar para la Fase II las acciones y componentes que era pertinente modificar.

 Asimismo, pudo constatarse que el nivel y experiencia del personal del Banco que participó en
 la primera etapa permitió aportar elementos útiles al diseño de la nueva fase. Se estima que un
 elemento por parte del Banco que favoreció al proyecto fue por un lado, la continuidad del
 personal en esta segunda etapa, dado que en su mayor parte fue el mismo que supervisó la Fase
 I, y por otro, el nivel de conocimiento y experiencia que tuvo dicho personal de la temática
 sectorial y del contexto nacional.




                                              - 47 -

Durante la etapa de ejecución y específicamente en los procesos de supervisión un factor
positivo fue la regularidad en la programación de las misiones. Si bien, se podrían identificar
aspectos que el Banco podría perfeccionar para el préstamo vigente (PAREIB III) o para
cualquier proyecto similar. Dentro de los procesos para su posible mejoría, podría proponerse
la conveniencia de intensificar por parte de la Oficina de Representación las labores de
seguimiento de los proyectos y en particular de los compromisos y diversas tareas pendientes
que van surgiendo e identificándose durante la ejecución de este tipo de proyectos, con el
propósito de que el aporte técnico del Banco no esté limitado ni sujeto exclusivamente a los
periodos de las misiones de supervisión.

Igualmente y en el caso de diversa información entregada al Banco por las instituciones
ejecutoras durante la ejecución del proyecto, éste podría incrementar su valor agregado al
proyecto y al país, si se proporcionara con mayor frecuencia una retroalimentación a dichas
instituciones o autoridades locales que podría ser en forma de observaciones o comentarios.

Por otra parte, el Banco podría favorecer el avance en la ejecución de los proyectos si hiciera
una revisión a las políticas y procedimientos en materia de cambio de personal. Conviene
señalar que la sustitución de personal del Banco afecta a las instituciones locales no sólo como
resultado del uso de diferentes criterios e interpretaciones sobre el marco normativo de las
operaciones, sino como consecuencia del desconocimiento del contexto nacional que
típicamente tienen los nuevos funcionarios, así como por la falta de incentivos que pueden
presentarse para trabajar con la mejor eficacia para el personal en proceso de retiro.

Se considera que el problema de la sustitución de personal adquiere relevancia cuando se
presenta en funciones o áreas consideradas clave para la correcta ejecución de los proyectos.
Los procesos en materia de adquisiciones siguen siendo uno de los de mayor complejidad e
impacto en los proyectos. Concretamente en el caso del PAREIB II pudo observarse que el
cambio de oficial de adquisiciones afectó sensiblemente al proyecto al tratarse de una operación
con una cantidad de adquisiciones importante, así como al tratarse de un proyecto de
educación, cuyo beneficio de las obras realizadas como la adquisición de bienes está
directamente vinculado a la entrega oportuna de los programas escolares.

En materia de normatividad de adquisiciones de los proyectos es evidente que los
procedimientos de adquisiciones adquieren mayor complejidad al tener en cuenta el contexto
internacional del comercio. El proceso de globalización y cambio constante en las reglas del
comercio, las estrategias y políticas de comercio internacional de los países incide directamente
en la complejidad de las adquisiciones y el cumplimiento de las normas del Banco que deben
seguir las instituciones de los países prestatarios. En este sentido se observa necesario que
Banco Mundial considere la posibilidad de hacer una revisión de dicha normatividad a la luz del
nuevo contexto mundial del comercio exterior.

En el caso de incidentes presentados en esta materia y dado que los procedimientos de
licitaciones internacionales son normalmente revisados por el Banco, cabría analizar el rol del
Banco para que eventualmente asumiera una mayor una corresponsabilidad en los errores o



                                            - 48 -

faltas. La aplicación de sanciones en forma unilateral por parte del Banco, tales como la
cancelación de recursos del préstamo parecen medidas drásticas que se alejan del espíritu de
colaboración y trabajo conjunto entre el Banco y el prestatario.

En este sentido sería conveniente que el Banco, previo a la emisión de juicios o declaraciones
de faltas en dichos procedimientos, estableciera un mecanismo de         revisión conjunta que
utilizara criterios para la consideración de todos los elementos del contexto que la originaron.
Igualmente y ante la presentación de estas eventualidades, sería útil establecer procedimientos
de comunicación que permitan intercambiar puntos de vista sobre dichos eventos en forma
intensa y oportuna entre todas las partes que participan. En esta materia, las oficinas de
Representación del Banco podrían jugar un papel mas activo en la revisión y aclaración de
dichos incidentes.
