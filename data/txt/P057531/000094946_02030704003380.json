program, as outlined in the National\n            Education Program (PNE) of the current and former\n            administrations. There are two main project components.\n            Component 1 improves quality in initial and basic education\n            with financing for, among other activities, expanding and\n            rehabilitating education infrastructure in targeted\n            communities; providing educational materials and equipment\n            for students, teachers, and schools; training teachers,\n            supervisors, other administrative staff, and other education\n            promoters, includign technical assistance and performance\n            incentives for primacy teachers; support for community or\n            parents associations for school-based management activities;\n            and lastly, improving school supervision. Component 2\n            strengthens institutional capacity at federal and state\n            levels.
