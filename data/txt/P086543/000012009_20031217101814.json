"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objectives of the Government's\n            program, to be supported by the Economic Recovery Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project, are to improve public sector\n            management, and fiscal sustainability. These would support a\n            solid economic recovery in the medium-term, that would pave\n            the way for sustained higher growth rates, a return to\n            positive per capita economic growth, and significant poverty\n            reduction. This single-tranche loan supports the\n            presentation to Congress of a budget consistent with\n            attaining a primary surplus for 2004, and financial sector\n            reforms to reduce the fiscal liabilities associated with\n            poor banking resolution practices, and deposit guarantee\n            schemes. The operation also backs the presentation to\n            Congress of major reforms in the tax system, in the public\n            sector pension scheme, and in the customs code, and,\n            supports numerous actions in improving public sector\n            administration, including, but not limited to, the\n            implementation of the newly regulated public procurement\n            law; censuses of public sector employees, and of the\n            contributors and beneficiaries of the public pension scheme;\n            and, the adoption of a financial management action plan to\n            enhance transparency, and strengthen audit, and independent\n            review functions. Nevertheless, a key risk is the absence of\n            a track record in implementing high-quality reforms. The\n            government's reform strategy is an ambitious one, with\n            major reforms to be approved by Congress within a short\n            period of time. Efforts to tackle corruption, and increase\n            efficiency in the public sector figure prominently in this\n            strategy, and could ignite resistance and unrest, possibly\n            resulting in a retreat from, or dilution of, the reform\n            agenda. Mitigating these risks are the new\n            administration's concerted efforts to reach a\n            wide-ranging political consensus for its reform program."}, "docdt": "2003-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
