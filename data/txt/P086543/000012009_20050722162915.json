        performance is highly satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            is satisfactory. Several lessons from this project were\n            cited, including: 1) Economic crises often open windows of\n            opportunity for reform. 2) Timely assistance can help\n            reform-minded leaders capitalize on such windows of\n            opportunity. 3) Strong ownership on the part of national\n            authorities is a necessary condition. 4) Bank sector work\n            and operations can contribute substantial value-added to\n            economic reform programs. 5)  The excellence of the Bank\n            depends on the commitment, motivation and high quality of\n            its staff. 6)  Valuable synergies can arise from preparing\n            lending operations while simultaneously conducting policy\n            and sector work. 7) The ability to build and maintain\n            complex coalitions of support is key to ensuring the success\n            8) The need to maintain coalitions of support often sets\n            limits on the depth of the reforms, 9) To assert its\n            credibility, a reform-minded administration needs to\n            demonstrate a critical mass of achievements during the\n            initial stage of its mandate.  10) Strong political\n            determination on the part of government officials needs to\n            be sustained over the long haul. 11) Top-down strong\n            political support is necessary to foster leadership on the\n            various fronts of the reform efforts."}, "docdt": "2005-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
