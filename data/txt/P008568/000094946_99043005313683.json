The Bank performed satisfactorily,\n            maintaining a project team continuity, resulting in\n            consistent recommendations to the Borrower on both, physical\n            and institutional components. Although project\n            implementation was somehow delayed, the Borrower did project\n            strong ownership, resulting in a satisfactory performance.\n            Regardless of success, the key lessons show that: a) the\n            presupposed acceptance by the borrower of major policy\n            reforms, stemming from a technical assistance restructuring\n            study, whose results were unknown at appraisal, would have\n            been better acknowledged in future lending operations; b)\n            the active participation of entities, not just the\n            Government, in technical assistance issues, suggest a more\n            effective restructuring of those sector entities, when\n            supported by the entities themselves; c) approval of gas\n            price increases proved valuable in conveying the right\n            economic signals to consumers, improving in turn the\n            beneficiary's financial situation; d) the right-of-way\n            should be minimized, possibly reaching agreements prior to\n            well drilling; e) load management analysis should be a\n            prerequisite to field development programs; and, f)\n            co-financing may be beneficial, due to the cooperation and\n            information exchange among institutions."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
