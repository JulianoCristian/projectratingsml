Bank\n            assistance to develop a sound energy policy and has\n            requested Bank financing for increased production of natural\n            gas and for support of energy sector restructuring.  The\n            projects objectives are to : a) improve the energy related\n            convertible currency earnings by increasing domestic\n            production of natural gas and encouraging energy\n            conservation for all forms of energy; b) contribute to a\n            reduction of environmental pollution related to energy use;\n            c) improve the competitive, regulatory and financial\n            framework of sector entities through support of appropriate\n            restructuring programs for coal, gas, power and heat\n            sectors.  The project comprises the following major\n            components : 1) investments in equipment and materials to\n            increase natural gas production through development and\n            rehabilitation of existing gas fields, gas compression,\n            delineation of gas fields, expansion of transmission and\n            storage facilities to transport the additional gas and\n            respond to load fluctuations; and b) technical assistance\n            through consultancy services, staff training and studies to\n            enhance management and production efficiency within the sector."}, "docdt": "1990-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
