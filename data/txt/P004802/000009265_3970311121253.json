The project comprises the following components:\n            1) a deep gas oil hydrotreater (DGOHT) of 30,000 barrels\n            stream per day (bpsd) capacity to enable the production of\n            0.05 weight percent sulfur diesel oil; 2) a fluid catalytic\n            cracker (FCC) of 16,000 bpsd capacity and modifications to\n            existing naphtha reformer to produce high octane, low\n            aromatic and low benzene content gasoline, in order to\n            enable the refinery's gasoline pool to meet unleaded\n            octane requirements, and permissible aromatics and benzene\n            and other prescribed specifications; 3) the installation of\n            equipment and facilities to further enhance the\n            refinery's environmental mitigation system and safety;\n            4) the purchase of modern air quality monitoring equipment;\n            5) project engineering and management; 6) acquisition of\n            technology and procurement of catalysts and chemicals; and\n            7) training."}, "docdt": "1995-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
