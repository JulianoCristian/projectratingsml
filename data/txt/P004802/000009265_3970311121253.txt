MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANGCHAK PETROLEUM PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED,
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A CLEAN FUELS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited ("Bangchak" or 'BPPCL") with the guarantee of the
Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$90 million to help finamce a Clean Fuels and Environmental
Inprovement Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17
years, including 5 years of grace.
Country/Sector Background
2.         Thailand has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Per capita income doubled
during the past ten years. GDP registered an annual average growth rate of 10.4% over the period 1986 to
1992. In parallel, road transport increased dramatically, with traffic increasing by more than 14% per annum
since 1984. The vehicle fleet excluding motorcycles increased by an average of more than 10% per ann
over the 1984 to 1992 period. Motorcycles. comprising about 60% of the vehicle fleet. increased at 14% per
annum. Slightly over 8 million vehicles are currently estimated to be on the road. The road vehicle fleet is
expected to continue increasing and could double over the next 15 years.
3.         While the increase in vehicular traffic has been a nationwide phenomenon, it has been especially
acute in the urban centers. Traffic in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) has become notorious for its
congestion and air quality has become a major problem. The links between vehicular traffic, traffic
congestion, fuel emissions and air quality are well documented. To address the issue of poor air quality, the
Royal Thai Government (RTG) adopted some of the world's most ambitious clean fuels standards; these are
scheduled to become effective by 1998. The proposed operation has been designed to support the efforts of
Thailand's leading refiner to comply with these new standards.
4.         The Government's Clean Fuels Program. RTG enacted a comprehensive and far reaching
Environmental Law in April 1992; and improvement of the environment has become a high priority objective
under the Seventh National Development Plan (1992-1996). Air pollution in BMR is the result of many
factors, including inter alia poor vehicle maintenance, traffic congestion, inadequate road capacity and the use
of pollution facilitating fuels. RTG's action plan to combat vehicular air pollution, developed under the Bank
financed Fourth Highway Sector Project (Loan 3446-TH), includes: (i) specifying emission standards for new
vehicles; (ii) refinement of vehicle inspection procedures; (iii) an LPG/CNG pilot project; (iv) reduction of
emissions from in-use vehicles; and (v) traffic management.
5.         To reduce pollution attributable to petroleum fuels, RTG has embarked on a major fuels
reformulation program following a strategy similar to that foUlowed by the industrialized countries, notably the
United States. RTG commissioned several studies beginning in early 1990 to identify fuels reformulation
options and strategies. Based on these studies, stringent gasoline and diesel oil specifications were issued in
June 1993. The leading changes to the formulation of gasoline include: (i) an initial reduction of lead to 0.15
milligrams per liter, with a parallel grade of gasoline containing no lead; (ii) the phasing out of all lead by
1998; and (iii) the progressive reduction of sulfur in diesel oil from 1.00 weight percent to 0.05 weight
percent by 1998. The adjustmnents to the specifications of diesel oil include (i) reducing the boiling point for
90 percent of the volume of a distillation flask by 30 degrees Fahrenheit; (ii) introducing a minimum cetane



-2-
number; and (iii) eliminating cracked material that is unstable. These adjustments will have a measurable
impact in reducing suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the emissions of diesel driven vehicles.
6.         Bangehak played a highly catalytic role in the formulation of these new clean fuel standards. It
assisted the Govermnent in determining what targets could be met, and in establishing a realistic schedule for
making these changes effective. Bangchak can realize some improvement by mixing throughput from the
existing plant with higher grade imports; however, this procedure would not be adequate for compliance with
the more stringent standards slated for 1998. As a result, the Company must undertake the proposed project
and shoulder some US$400 million equivalent in new investments.
7.         Refinery Sector. Thailand is currently a large importer of petroleum products, including limited
quantities of unleaded high octane gasoline. The amount of diesel oil imported averages about 100,000
barrels per day. Thailand presently has three refineries, the Thai Oil Refinery (TORC), the Thai Esso
refinery, and the Bangchdak Oil Refinery. The combined capacity of the three refineries is 230,000 barrels per
day (bpd). Two new refineries by Shell Oil Company and Caltex Petroleum Company, which are under
construction, will add a further 250,000 bpd of refining capacity, giving a total design capacity of 480,000
bpd and a production capacity of about 430,000 bpd. The demand for petroleum products is projected to
exceed 500,000 bpd by the end of this decade. The existing refineries cannot meet the cleaner standards that
will be required as of late 1998 without major modifications to their processing configurations.
8.         Bangchak Petroleum Public ComRany Limited. Ten years ago, the Govemment sought Bank
support for a comprehensive restructuring of Bangchak. As a result, the Bank provided considerable guidance
with regard to Bangchak's reorganization, and lent US$85 million equivalent to finance the plant upgrades
under the Bangchalc Petroleum Refinery Restructuring Project (Loan 2548-TH). This strategy led to a virtual
doubling of production capacity, and the recasting of the Company as a commercially operated enterprise.
Bangchak's management emphasized good product planning and rapid responsiveness to market changes in
demand. As a result, the Company turned profitable. Today, the refinery has a production capacity of
105,000 barrels per day, is in excellent mechanical condition, and is efficiently operated. Moreover,
Bangchak's robust financial performance of the past few years has enabled (i) it to obtain loans from
commercial sources, and (ii) the Government to take the first steps toward privatizing the Company. A public
share offering of 20% of the Company's shares to private interests for some $120 million was closed in mid-
June 1994. The Government has indicated an interest in increasing the proportion of the Company to be
owned by private interests, perhaps as high as 45 percent.
Project Objectives
9.         The primary project objective is to support the reduction of air pollutants attrioutable to
petroleum fuels in Thailand, by assisting the Borrower in: (a) meeting reformulated gasoline and diesel oil
specifications established by the Government; and (b) improving its refinery operations through the installation
of appropriate facilities and equipment to reduce refinery emissions and enhance safety.
Project Description
10.        The project comprises the following components:
(a)   a Deep Gas Oil Hydrotreater (DGOHT) of 30,000 bpsd capacity to enable the production of 0.05
weight percent sulfur diesel oil (25.4% of project cost);
(b)   a Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) of 16,000 barrels stream per day (bpsd) capacity and
modifications to existing naphbta reformer to produce high octane, low aromatic and low



-3-
benzene content gasoline, in order to enable the refinery's gasoline pool to meet unleaded octane
requirements, and permissible aromatics and benzene levels and other prescribed specifications
(56.7% of project cost);
(c)  the installation of equipment and facilities to further enhance the refinery's environmental
mitigation system and safety (12.6% of project cost);
(d)  the purclhase of modern air quality monitoring equipment (0.4% of project cost);
(e)   project engineering and management (2.9% of project cost);
(f)   acquisition of technology and procurement of catalysts and chemicals (1.2% of project cost); and
(g)  training (0.8% of project cost).
11.        The total financing required for the proposed project is US$370.0 million equivalent (including
interest during construction), with a foreign component of US$225.9 million equivalent (61 % of the total) and
a local component of US$144.1 million equivalent (39% of the total). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The proposed loan would finance about 24% of the total financing
requiremnent, or 40% of the foreign component. Bangchak intends that most of the early project expenditures
would be financed from the proposed Bank loan and internal cash generation. Most of the residual finance to
be raised from external sources will be needed in 1998 and 1999. Amounts and methods of procurement, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing equivalent to about 3% of the
proposed loan would be permitted to cover expenditures for the acquisition of proprietary licenses and related
technology, incurred after April 1, 1995 but prior to the date of the Loan Agreement. A timetable of the key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13758-TH, dated April 12, 1995, is being distributed
separately.
Project hmplementation
12.        The detailed engineering, procurement, installation, construction and commissioning and start-up
of the two major refinery process units and associated facilities will be implernented over a period of four
years. The other components will be implemented in parallel and completed within the same time period. A
detailed project implementation plan was prepared by Bangchak. The project completion date is estimated to
be December 31, 1999.
13.        Bangchak staff gained valuable experience implementing the Bangchak Refinery Restructuring
Project (para. 15). The Bangchak project construction division is well staffed, and organized to coordinate the
implementation of the project. A consulting engineering firm has recently been appointed to prepare the
project specifications based on licensor packages and the associated engineering, and to integrate the new
facilities with the existing refinery.
Project Sustaiability
14.        The project design is based on proven technology and specifications, which have evolved over
the past two decades. This would ensure that the reformulation investments do not result in secondary
problems at a later time. The petroleum products' specifications are not expected to change, so that process
obsolescence is unlikely. The design strategy adopted will enable the future expansion of Bangchak's
facilities, if market conditions so dictate, assuring the project's sustainability.



Lessonh from Previous Bank Involvement
15.        This is the Bank's second project with BPPCL. In 1986, the Bank lent US$85 million equivalent
to finance the Bangclhak Petroleum Refinery Restructuring Project (Loan 2548-TH); that project was
completed in June 1992. Although the project met all its objectives, it suffered from serious initial delays as
Bangchak decided to redesign the facilities to enable greater responsiveness to changing patterns of demand.
The proposed project takes account of this lesson from the earlier project. Outputs from the proposed project
are expected to have a ready market not only in Thailand but also elsewhere in the region, which would
assure the project's financial viability. Moreover, project designs are well advanced, and most decisions
concerning the technology have already been made; the acquisition of the specific technology is expected by
June 1995. With this technology acquisition concept, redesigning of the facilities are not expected, and
project implementation is expected to proceed without delay. Further, the managerial, fmnancial and physical
restructuring that were accomplished during the Bank's first project would contribute substantially towards
timely completion and efficient operation of the proposed project.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
16.        The proposed project is justified for three main reasons. Eirst, the Bank has supported a series
of efforts by RTG to mitigate the adverse impacts of transport-related air pollution, particularly in the BMR.
Specifically, the Bank has assisted various agencies of the RTG (notably the Department of Pollution Control
[DPC] and the National Energy Policy Office [NEPO]) in formulating and implementing cost-effective
strategies for reducing vehicular emissions. BPPCL has worked closely with RTG and the Bank in developing
the clean fuel standards. It values the Bank's technical advice and necessary fmancial support in implementing
a substantial investment program that would go a long way towards improving air quality in urban areas,
especially BMR. Second, Bank's involvement in BPPCL's investment program would help catalyze funding
from commercial sources of finance to ensure full funding of the project. And, third, continued Bank support
to BPPCL would help expedite the process of privatization, which was begun in mid-1994 with the
Company's successful issue of common stock.
17.        The policies and programs pursued by the Goverunent in the Environmental sector, in general,
and the Petroleum sector, in particular, are in compliance with the Bank's policies. The project is also
consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No.13458-TH). As discussed in the
CAS, which was presented to the Board on September 22, 1994, Bank's support to Thailand aims at providing
value added in terms of helping Thailand address the most important development issues. Among the priority
areas for Bank assistance identified in the CAS arc the development of physical infrastructure and
improvement in envirownental management, to which this project would directly contribute. The proposed
project would help Thailand in implementing a cost-effective strategy for improving air quality. While the
first stage of the fuel standards could be met by increasing imports and mixing these with output from
BPPCL's existing facilities, excessively large volumes of imports would be required in meeting the more
stringent standards in 1998.
Agreed Actions
18.        During negotiations, Bangchak agreed that it would:
(a)  ensure that the project's residual funding requirements are met as and when needed, by maldng
arrangements for external financing before March 31, 1998;
(b)  maintain a current ratio of not less than 0.8;



-5-
(c)   maintain a debt:equity ratio of less than 60:40;
(d)  refrain from irncurring debt unless a reasonable forecast shows that revenues, after covering all
expenses, taxes, dividends and net working capital increases, shall be at least 1.2 times the Com-
pany's projected debt service requirements; and
(e) furnish to the Bank, not later than six months after the conclusion of each financial year, its
annual accounts, certified by an acceptable auditor, together with the report of such auditor.
Environmental Aspects
19.        The refinery's current operations were subjected to a thorough Environmental Impact
Assessment. The EA was reviewed by the Bank and additional work, which needed to be completed in
connection with the implementation of the proposed project, was identified and conducted by BPPCL. An
integrated EA study was thereafter prepared for the proposed project and reviewed by the Bank. The
recommendations of the EA have been incorporated into the project. The project will not only help reduce the
emission of pollutants from the combustion of transportation fuels but would also mitigate any adverse
environmental impacts from refinery operations. BPPCL will engage an engineering firm to review all aspects
of the refinery's operations, and bring their environmental and safety aspects up to the level of similar
refineries in industrialized countries.
Program Objective Categories
20.        The focus of the proposed project is environmentally sustainable development. In providing
cleaner fuels, the project will reduce the amount and toxicity of noxious vehicular emissions. This will
contribute to substantial health benefits in urban areas, especially the BMR, and, as a result, the proposed
project will contribute to improvements in the productivity and quality of life of residents of those urban
areas.
Participatory Approach
21.        The Government and the Company have consulted extensively with NGOs in developing the new
clean fuels standards. Also, the Company consults on an ongoing basis with area residents regarding
emissions from its plant. In developing the Environmental Impact Assessment, Bangchak actively consulted
NGOs as well as the public residing in the vicinity of its refinery with regard to the environmental impact of
the process changes being provided by the proposed project. These consultations will continue until detailed
designs are finalized.
Project Benefits
22.        The prinary benefit of the proposed project is the expected improvement in health, productivity
and quality of life for urban dwellers, especially those residing in the BMR, as a result of the substantial
reduction of pollutions (mainly SPM, NOX and SOX) that will arise from the implementation of the
government's new clean fuel standards. The proposed project effectively enables Thailand's largest refinery
to comply with those standards. Further, the proposed addition to refinery will result in an increase in the
yield of high value products, thereby improving its economic viability, and is the least cost option for BPPCL
to meet its market requirements. The net present value (NPV) computed for the proposed project is US$171
million, based on a discount rate of 12% (the estimated cost of capital for Thailand). The internal financial
rate of return (IRR) is about 21%.



Risks
23.         An inherent risk in the proposed project is the possibility of creating excess refinery capacity in
Thailand to meet the country's own need for cleani fuels. This could narrow refining margins, making the
investment uneconomic. However, the likelihood of underutilized capacity materializing at Bangchak is small,
since the refinery could export any surplus products to nearby countries that are adopting clean fuel standards
sinilar to Thailand. A second risk is that the new standards could be further modified, requiring further
changes in gasoline and diesel oil specifications. This risk is small as Thailand is following modem standards
set by industrialized countries after extensive research and testing. Major specification changes are, therefore,
unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future. The project faces no risk factors that, either singly or in
combination, are likely to reduce the net present value to US$0 or less.
Recommendation
24.         1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
