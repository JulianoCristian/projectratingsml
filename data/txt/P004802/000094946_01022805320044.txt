3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Clean Fuel and Environmental Improvement Project was the second loan to Bangchak Petroleum
Public Company Ltd. (BCP). Its objectives were to support the reduction of air pollutants attributable to
petroleum fuels by assisting the Borrower in: (a) meeting reformulated gasoline and diesel oil
specifications established by the Government; and, (b) improving its refinery operations through the
installation of appropriate facilities and equipment to further reduce refinery emissions and enhance safety.
The objectives were clear and fully consistent with the Royal Thai Government's (RTG) stated goal of
protecting natural resources and the environment. Moreover, both the Bank and the RTG considered the
reduction of urban air pollution among their high priority objectives. This is still the case as reflected in the
latest Country Assistance Strategy (Report 1 8002-TH dated June 16, 1998).
Prior to this loan, the Bank had supported the development and implementation of the RTG's Action Plan
to improve air quality and reduce air pollution in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) and other urban
areas through its lending for the road and transport sector. Such support and technical assistance helped
the RTG devise cost-effective pollution mitigation strategies such as the production of cleaner fuels before
addressing more complex cross-sectional issues. It also assisted the Department of Pollution Control
(DPC) build its ambient air monitoring network, define new ambient standards, establish vehicle emission
and fuel standards and implement vehicle emission testing.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the project were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project comprised the following components: (1) a Deep Gas Oil Hydrotreater (DGOHT) unit of
30,000 barrels per stream day (bpsd) capacity to enable the production of 0.05 per cent sulfur diesel oil;
(ii) a Fluidized Catalytic Cracker (FCC) unit of 16,000 bpsd capacity and modification to an existing
naphtha reformer to produce high octane, low aromatic, low benzene content gasoline in order to enable the
refinery's gasoline pool to meet unleaded octane requirements and permissible aromatic and benzene levels
and other prescribed specifications; (iii) the installation of equipment and facilities to improve the
environmental conditions and safety in and around the refinery; (iv) purchase of mobile air quality
monitoring equipment; (v) project engineering and management; (vi) acquisition of technology, catalysts
and chemical; and (vii) training.
3.4 Revised Components:
The construction of two new conversion refineries in Thailand as well as the East Asian financial crisis and
the resulting collapse of the demand for petroleum products (both in Thailand and the region) obviated the
company's need to construct the FCC unit as it could satisfy its FCC gasoline requirements by importing or
purchasing from other producers in Thailand. With the cancellation of the FCC unit there remained no
need for training, nor were there any requirements for investment in pollution control equipment associated
with that unit (such pollution mitigation facilities and equipments constituted an important part of what was
envisaged in the project). The company's success in obtaining the ISO 14001 certification for
environmental standards also ruled out the need for the installation of additional air pollution control
equipment or wastewater treatment facilities in the refinery except for the sulfur recovery plant which
remained essential (the DGOTH produces sulfurous gases as a process by-product). Moreover, because
the Department of Pollution Control had decided to purchase a number of stationary and mobile air quality
monitoring (AQM) equipments and the refinery could utilize the government purchased mobile AQM units,
the need for the refinery to invest in a mobile unit had been obviated.
- 2 -



3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry was not assessed by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). At appraisal, no
implementation or technical risks were envisaged. Further, inadequate attention was paid, in the project
documents, to the risks associated with the excess refining and conversion capacities (para. 5.2). While the
project design envisaged, in a general sense, the possible risk associated with excess capacity, it was
assumed that such a risk would be minimal, in that the BCP could export any surplus supply considering
the potential demand of other countries in the region. In practice, however, this "export potential "did not
materialize, and the demand for petroleum products collapsed following the onset of the East Asian
financial crisis which reduced the possibility of exports from the Thai refineries and squeezed refinery
margins.
Under these circumstances, BCP decided to cancel the construction of the FCC unit as the economic
viability of this component was completely eroded. While the financial crisis that hit Thailand could not be
foreseen at appraisal and it was beyond the control of the Government and the BCP, the construction of the
new refineries had been approved by the Government before the crisis. Thus, in retrospect, the project
analyses should have taken that into account, or at least flagged, the substantial risk associated with the
biggest component of the project, namely the FCC unit.
Finally, the project cost estimate at the time of appraisal was significantly higher than the actual costs (or
currently estimated costs for those components which were not completed), indicating an overestimation of
the project's total cost.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective.
Although the achievement of the project's physical objectives were only partial, the project, nonetheless,
substantially achieved its major objective of enabling the refinery to produce cleaner fuels thereby
supporting the RTG's plan of actions for improving air quality and reducing air pollutants. Since the types
and amount of air pollutants emitted by vehicles are closely related to the fuel quality, the efforts by all the
refiners (as directed by the government) to reformulate automotive gasoline and to reduce the sulfur content
of gas oil have already had beneficial effects on the air quality in the BMR as evidenced by the relevant
statistics (discussed below).
Environmental Indicators
The major emissions of concern from gasoline fueled vehicles are lead, Carbon Monoxide (CO), unburned
hydrocarbons (HC), aromatic and benzene emissions which have been shown to have carcinogenic effects.
Leaded gasoline was gradually phased out of the Thai market by the beginning of 1996 and it has no longer
been available since. The elimination of lead from gasoline has also permitted the use of pollution control
technologies such as the catalytic converters (in cars) which reduce both the CO and HC emissions. There
is conclusive evidence that, despite the existence of many old models in the existing vehicular pool, the use
of cleaner fuels has reduced the air pollutants such as lead, CO and Sulfur Dioxide (S02) in the Bangkok
Metropolitan Region (Annex 8, Table 1). In respect of S02, although the regulations stipulated the
introduction of 0.05 sulfur diesel oil by the beginning of 1999, that fuel has been voluntarily available in
the market since 1997 and city buses were also required to use it since January 1997.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The commissioning of the DGOHT started in February 1999 and the unit becamne fully operational by June
of 1999. The plant has been operating continually and without any interruption ever since. So has the
sulfur recovery unit which also came on stream on time. As for the production of cleaner gasoline without
- 3 -



the benefit of an FCC unit, the refinery has been able to purchase sufficient quantities of FCC gasoline
from other local refineries to enable it to produce unleaded gasoline according to specification. The RTG's
decision not to further tighten the aromatic and benzene specification of unleaded gasoline, also made the
revamping and modification of the naphtha reformer redundant.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
In the project as originally designed, the stream of benefits accrued mostly on account of the output from
the FCC unit which helped increase the ratio of distillates (gasoline and diesel oil) output to the crude oil
input. With the cancellation of the FCC unit, the stream of benefits are now only related to a quality
improvement (reduction in the sulfur content of diesel oil from 0.5% to 0.05% by weight) which can be
deduced from the historical and current pricing practices in the Pacific Region and the costs associated with
importing very low sulfur diesel oil from a refinery center such as Singapore (Annex 3). Under the
assumptions contained in this annex, the economic rate of return for the DGOHT is estimated at 20.1
percent which is somewhat lower than the appraisal estimates of 21.7 per cent (the SAR's rate of return
includes the FCC unit). It should be noted that this calculation does not include the considerable health
benefits that result from improving the air quality in the BMR, thereby reducing mortality and morbidity
from respiratory illnesses.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
The internal financial rate of return for this project is substantially the same as (though marginally lower
than) the economic rate of return as computed in Annex 3. Except for the financial capital costs of the
project which should include the interest expenses during implementation and any import duties or local
taxes on equipment and material, there would be no need for any further adjustment to the streams of
benefits and costs because; (i) Thailand's exchange rate is market determined; (ii) there are no labor market
distortions; and (iii) product prices are equivalent to imported prices from the international market.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
In the last two decades, a concerted and cooperative effort is being made by the RTG, industry, the public
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve the air quality in Thailand. A number of
measures have been adopted to mitigate air pollution problems, particularly those associated with the
transport sector. They are aimed not only at reducing vehicle emissions through improvement of fuel
quality and engine specification, but also at implementation of in-use vehicle inspection and maintenance
programs, expansion of the mass transit systems and the improvement of traffic conditions through better
traffic management. This is a comprehensive program that is being implemented step by step by the DPC
with salutary results. Through its continuing dialogue with the Bank and the implementation of this project,
the BCP has intensified its diligent efforts to control and mitigate pollution in and around the refinery, to
comply with the Bank's environmental guidelines and the country's environmental standards and to build an
amicable and trustworthy relationship with the communities surrounding the refinery. These efforts have
been handsomely rewarded when the refinery received certification that it complied with the ISO 14001
standards for environment. Nonetheless, the institutional development impact resulting directly from the
project has been modest, since most of the needs in this area either became redundant or were met by DPC
providing help to BCP.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
After the approval of the project, the pace of new conversion capacity construction picked up both in
Thailand and in the Region in anticipation of the heightened demand for distillate products. This
substantially increased the likelihood that excess refining and cracking capacities would be created. Given
this new situation and the potential for ample conversion capacities in both Thailand and the East Asian
- 4 -



Region, the BCP's management remained hesitant to proceed with the construction of an FCC unit. An
independent study in 1996 by a Bank consultant also indicated that, under the then prevailing conditions
and consumption trends, an FCC unit would only be needed if the refinery could not purchase its
requirement of FCC gasoline from other producers on a long term basis. With the onset of the East Asian
financial crisis in July 1997 and the precipitous decline in energy and petroleum products consumption
(Annex 8, Tables 2 and 3), the company's management revisited the project's economic viability and
eventually decided in 1998 to cancel the construction of the FCC unit( the official steps were, however,
taken in 1999). A shift in the consumption of premium and regular unleaded gasoline in favor of the latter
during the late 1990s (Annex 8, Table 4) and the Government's decision not to filrther tighten the
specification of unleaded gasoline obviated the need to revamp and modify the naphtha reformer unit and
this component was also canceled in 1999.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
This project was prepared and appraised at a time (1992/3) when the RTG had approved only one new
145,000 bpd cracking refinery to be constructed in Thailand. Soon after, the license for another 120,000
bpd grass roots cracking refinery was granted to the private sector. At this time, the anticipated total
conversion capacity (FCC and Hydrocracking) stood at 150,000 bspd, increasing the risk that the
construction of the FCC unit by the BCP would lead to overcapacity in conversion facilities.
5.3 Factors generallv subject to implementing agency control:
The loan became effective after a short delay due to the time needed for Bangchak refinery to receive the
legal opinion of the Judicial Council of Thailand. The implementation of the project faced more serious
delay of 4 months as the contract for the construction of the DGOHT unit was signed in December of 1996
instead of the August scheduled date. This was mainly because the Borrower did not follow the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines for the pre-qualification of prospective bidders and failed to apply appropriate
selection criteria (in fact, they had used the criteria that existed at the time of the previous project in the
mid-to late 1980s). Once issues related to pre-qualification of the bidders and those conceming the
invitation to bid were resolved, much of the scheduling flexibility had been lost so that the construction of
the DGOHT had to be placed on a fast track. In spite of all efforts to complete the construction and make
the unit operational by the beginning of 1999, difficulties with the performance of the civil works
contractor and the vibration problems experienced during commissioning delayed full capacity production
until June 1999. However, this did not create insurmountable difficulties for the refinery as it managed to
produce specification gas oil by operating the existing gas oil desulfurization unit under more severe
conditions and the DGOHT at 70 to 80 percent capacity, thereby satisfying the depressed diesel oil demand
induced by the East Asian financial crisis. The Bangchak refinery's success in obtaining ISO 14001
certification for environmental standards in 1997 proved beneficial to BCP as it attested to the refinery's
compliance with all environmental regulations and standards. The BCP was also certified to comply with
the Thai Industrial Standard 18001 with respect to occupational health and safety management standards.
The decision not to construct the FCC unit and not to modify the naphtha reformer obviated the need for
further investmnent in air pollution installations and wastewater treatment equipment, saving the company
considerable sums at a time of financial distress. While the sulfur recovery unit downstream of the
DGOHT was constructed and came on stream on time, the company did not use any of the funds
eannarked for training due to the cancellation of the FCC unit.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Since the construction of the FCC unit as well as the modification of the naphtha reformer and the
acquisition of the bulk of the environmental enhancement equipment were canceled, the project cost and the
loan disbursement were only a fraction of those anticipated in the Staff Appraisal Report (Annex 2). Even
the installed cost of the DGOHT proved to be considerably lower than the original estimate because of a
- 5 -



reduction in design capacity from 30,000 to 25,000 bpd and intense competition among the bidders. The
cancellation of other components also affected the disbursement of the funds that had been allocated to the
purchase of technology, catalysts, and chemicals as well as those earmarked for project engineering and
management assistance and training. The project was financed basically from the funds supplied by the
Bank and the BCP's own funds (Annex 8, Table 11).
An issue that arose between the Bank and the Borrower during the implementation of this project was the
slow disbursement of the funds. This was occasioned mainly because of the Borrower's hesitation to
proceed with the cancellation of the funds allocated for the construction of the FCC unit (hence, the
percentage of the undisbursed amount remained high, resulting in the percentage of the disbursement
amount lagging significantly behind the SAR forecast). Given the Borrower's financial needs during the
crisis, it wanted to use the Bank's funds (allocated for the FCC) to retroactively finance other components
of the project and other related projects. The Bank analyzed the Borrower's requests and in the majority of
cases could not approve the requests. However, some of the delay in disbursement can be attributed to the
DGOHT turn key contract. Because of the financial weakness of the civil works subcontractor (a
Thai-Japanese joint venture), many execution milestones were missed and payments were, therefore,
delayed. By the closing (June 30, 2000), total disbursement amounted to US$38.1 million, some 42.3 % of
the original and 63.5 % of the revised loan amount.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Given the proven quality of the BCP's management and workforce and the well-maintained condition of
the refnery, its operation is technically sustainable for the foreseeable future. With its existing
configuration and process facilities, the Bangchak refinery is most likely to meet the current and future
clean fuels specification without having to make any major investment. It still remains one of the less
financially vulnerable refineries in Thailand because it does not carry a huge undepreciated investment (as
is the case with other privately owned conversion refineries). Nonetheless, it needs to put its finances on a
sounder footing in order to assure its long-term stability.
The East Asian financial crisis has, however, taken a considerable toll on the profitability and financial
performance of the Bangchak refinery (Annex 8, Table 5). The company sustained a crushing foreign
exchange loss of 6.8 billion baht in 1997 which has totally debilitated its finances. Consequently, an entity
which had an operating profit of 1.4 billion baht (nearly US $28 million at the prevailing rate of exchange)
has changed to one which is essentially at break even. Two factors have conspired to bring about these
conditions: Firstly, Bangchak's sales have declined since 1997 because of the shrinkage in the Thai market
for petroleum products (Annex 8, Table 6); and, secondly, the intense competition has eroded both the
refinery and the marketing margins. A new factor this year has been the informal intervention of the
Government (through the PTT's pricing practices) to suppress the retail prices of gasoline and high speed
diesel oil, thus depriving Bangchak's marketing operations from its normal margins since August
(reportedly, this practice has been discontinued recently). As a result, despite the return of some stability to
the petroleum product market in Thailand, the company is anticipated to make an operating loss of nearly
0.5 billion baht in the 2000 (Annex 8, Table 5). In the meantime, the Banchak's share prices have plunged
from 50 baht in mid-1995 to 5 baht by October 2000 as the Thai Stock Exchange (SET) index has declined
from near 1600 to around 300 in the same period. Government still remains the majority shareholder with
the Ministry of Finance and PTT holding 80 percent. The other 20 percent is currently owned by the
public.
-6 -



6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The Bangchak refinery's response to this situation has been initially to stabilize its finances by converting
its short-term loans and overdrafts to longer term liabilities (Annex 8, Table 7) so that it can better manage
its cash flow. It is now expected that the increase in the demand for petroleum products in the Asia-Pacific
Region (already 1.3 mbd since 1998) will lead to the firming of refining margins (a phenomenon that is
already underway) in the region (Annex 8, Table 8) and eventually in Thailand. The Thai market is,
however, anticipated to remain behind the curve in view of the small projected increase in consumption
during the next few years (Annex 8, Table 3) mainly due to the availability of increasing quantities of
natural gas reducing demand for fuel oil. On this basis, it is expected that the company will become
profitable, starting in 2001, though a return to the mid-i 990s conditions may not be easily at hand.
The Company has also requested the RTG to agree with a further issuance of shares in early 2001 for Thai
private sector subscription with the aim of reducing the total government shareholding (Ministry of Finance
and the PTT) to 49 percent. While the Company reported that the Government's approval has been
obtained, it is anticipated that some 2.5 billion baht may be raised in this way, making it possible for the
company to retire some of its medium and longer-term debts which stood at 11.9 billion baht at the end of
June 2000 (Annex 8, Table 7). Through this increased privatization, the company also wishes to rid itself
from any government regulation to which it is still subjected. It specially feels frustrated by the informal
intervention of the Government in suppressing pump prices at a time when its finances have been under
such pressure. By raising capital and retiring some debts, the company anticipates an enhancement of its
profitability (this is not reflected in the projected income statement - Annex 8, Table 5).
Beyond this the company is intent on pursuing aggressively its marketing policies that have been the
backbone of its profitability. Over the years the company has consistently increased the ratio of its sales at
the retail level which has a higher profit margin by building new gasoline stations (some with a convenience
store) and marketing other products such as fuel oil to the end-users. This approach has worked well for
BCP which has successfully increased direct sales ratio from 40.6% in 1997 to 53.6% during the first 9
months of 2000. As a result more than 50 percent of BCP's sales are now effected through either the
company retail outlets or to final consumers (Annex 8, Table 9) instead of being sold at wholesale to other
marketers or traders. An area of special emphasis has been the direct marketing of fuel oil which has
historically been low compared with Bangchak's production.
The above appears to be, on the whole, a prudent and practicable plan for the future operation of the
Bangchak refinery. Technically, the company has a sound and efficient operation with all the processing
units in excellent working order. It has no intention of entering any new capital investment unless it helps
the company in its quest to directly market a higher share of its total sales. Such new investments are
expected to be only around 400-500 million baht per year, well within the capability of the company. The
BCP is not the only independent refining marketing entity in the world without upstream activities facing
the vagaries of the petroleum product market. Many have dealt with violent market fluctuations and
survived. Given these plans many of which are underway and the strong likelihood that the demand for
petroleum products will continue increasing rapidly in many countries of the region (e.g. The People's
Republic of China), resulting in improved refinery margins and a higher profitability for the BCP, the
sustainability of this project is rated as likely.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank performed satisfactory in identification and preparation of the project. However, during the
appraisal, the need for the biggest component of the project (i.e., FCC unit) was not flagged as a potentially
significant risk, and no sensitivity analyses were carried out in this regard. Further, while the SAR
anticipated a trouble-free implementation on the strength of Bangchak refinery's familiarity with the Bank's
procurement guidelines, problems were encountered because some rules such as the criteria for
pre-qualification of the bidders had changed and the Borrowers had not been adequately informed of the
import of such changes. Nonetheless, the Bank accommodated this situation by putting on the right track
the procurement procedures and approval in record time, and the contract for the construction of the
DGOHT was signed in December 1996, allowing the Bangchak to achieve full capacity operation by
mid-1999.
7.2 Supervision:
Assistance and guidance was provided by the Bank through its regular supervision of the project. Given
the uncertainty surrounding the construction of the FCC unit, the Bank even commissioned a study in order
to assess the advisability of implementing this component of the project. The study confirmed the
proposition that an FCC unit would only be needed by the Bangchak refinery if there were no possibility of
contracting to import its requirements of FCC gasoline. With regard to the cancellation of the FCC funds,
once it had become obvious that FCC would no longer be needed, in retrospect, the Bank should have been
more forceful in urging the Borrower to formally cancel the amount.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank's overall performance in the project is rated as satisfactory. Although a major risk factor had
not been adequately identified during appraisal, overall the Bank had substantial impact through this
project in helping the Borrower to: (a) keep the project implementation on track; (b) meet its obligation to
the Government with regard to production of environmentally cleaner fuels; (c) base its investment program
on a rationalized framework; and (d) be vigilant of and take remedial actions to deal with its precarious
finances during the crisis. In addition, the Bank's involvements in and dialogue through this project,
represented a "continuity" of the Bank's critical involvement in Thailand's energy and environmental
sectors. The impact of these involvements in the sector has been huge by any standard, given the critical
role the Bank has played in the formulation and implementation of major policies that have resulted in the
development of one of the most deregulated and liberalized energy sectors in the region.
The Bank has had a cooperative and fruitful relationship with the Bangchak refinery extending over one
and a half decades. The financing of the Bangchak Refinery Restructuring Project (loan 2548-TH), which
was completed in June 1992, assisted the RTG in the managerial, financial and physical restructuring of a
stagnant government owned enterprise, transforming it into a commercially-oriented and profitable entity.
Building on the success of this first project the Bank and the Borrower embarked on the Clean Fuel and
Environmental Improvement Project with the objective of addressing the environmental degradation in
Thailand, and more specifically in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, related to the quality of fuels being
utilized in the transportation sector. In this, the Bank was directing its financing towards helping Thailand
achieve its developmental objectives with improved enviromnental management
Two decades of involvement by the Bank in Thailand's energy sector has placed it in a unique advisory
position. Both the RTG and its energy producing and marketing entities have regularly sought the Bank's
advice about energy sector issues. The carrying out of several important studies such as the Fuel Option
Study (Report No. I1 948-TH) have been most helpful in guiding the sector in the right direction. All in all,
- 8 -



this close relationship and familiarity with the issues has helped the Bank to provide assistance with usually
satisfactory results.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The project was well prepared by the borrower. It was fully responsive to the specifications set by the
RTG for the production of vehicular fuels. It was also cognizant of the technological choices that were
available and selected those that responded to the requirements at the lowest cost. There remains, however,
the question that soon after the approval of the project, the Borrower became doubtful as to the advisability
of constructing the single most costly component of the project, namely, the FCC unit. While it is true that
the RTG had not approved quite so much conversion capacity at the time of project preparation, the
Borrower was also somewhat sanguine about the possibility of exporting, in case such an eventuality came
to pass.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Throughout the implementation of this project, the Borrower remained committed and cooperative. Once
the procurement problems with the DGOHT contract were resolved, the construction got underway in 1997
but the civil works subcontractor's weak management and financial capabilities resulted in completion
delays that could have proved costly to BCP. However, through judicious persuasions by the BPC's
management, the construction was finished by early 1999 and the commissioning activities started in
February of that year. The project implementation team was competent and it was ably assisted by
engineers and consultants. The unit has been operating.flawlessly since it came on full stream in June
1999.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Since the restructuring of the late 1980s, the company is being managed by a group of technically
competent and motivated professionals performing well in a highly competitive market. The company has
kept its operational work force to a minimum and its operating expenses are kept low through preventative
maintenance and total quality management (TQM). Despite the existence of many processing units in the
refinery, the energy consumption and loss in the refinery has been kept low at around 3.3 percent of the
crude oil throughout. The company is about to introduce gasohol in its gasoline stations and intends to
phase out the use of other oxygenates such as MTBE which is looked upon unfavorably worldwide. This
move may also marginally improve the company's profitability.
7.7 Overall Borrowerperformance:
The BCP's management was initially hesitant about carrying through with the construction of the FCC
unit. While the East Asian financial crisis and the resulting collapse of the demand for petroleum products
left little doubt as to the inadvisability of constructing the FCC unit, it took a long period for the company
to cancel that part of the loan that pertained to the FCC. During this period, the company proposed many
items of capital expenditure for retroactive financing which could not be accepted by the Bank. The Bank
was, however, willing to finance a power plant from the available unused funds, but the decline in electric
power consumption in the country eroded the economic viability of this unit because the project was based
on the plant selling the bulk of its output to the grid (as an Independent Power Producer - IPP).
The Borrower's overall performance is rated as satisfactory. The Bangchak refinery has been a leader in
complying with the environmental regulation. Being situated next to residential areas on the bank of the
Chao Pharya river, it has achieved a cooperative understanding with the surrounding communities through
its pollution control efforts. The company's success in obtaining the ISO 14001 certification for
environmental standards has enhanced its standing in these communities as it strives to further reduce any
-9-



emissions into the atmosphere such as those at the truck loading racks.
The company has had to weather rough times since the beginning of the East Asian financial crisis which
started in Thailand in July 1997. Through some deft financial management and short-term borrowings it
has succeeded to keep its operations and workforce unaffected. It has now converted its short-terrn
borrowings into longer term obligations, earning the much needed respite to concentrate on its future. In the
meantime it has even tried its hand at marketing imported products when such activities were financially
more beneficial for the company. Bangchak complied with all the covenants contained in the Loan
Agreements except two financial covenants, namely: the debt service coverage and long-term debt/equity
ratios (Annex 8, Table 10).
8. Lessons Learned
8.1    The implementation of this project brings out some of the generic lessons that have been learnt
repeatedly in the past namely that: (a) the skill and competence of the project implementation team and its
consultant are paramount; (b) risk management is important; (c) Borrower ownership and management is
indispensable; and, (d) regular supervision and monitoring usually pays dividends. That said, there are still
a few specific lessons that can be drawn from the implementation of this project:
8.2    At the start of implementation it was assumed by the Bank that since the Refinery had already
implemented a previous project it would be completely familiar with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
This overlooked the fact that certain parts of the Guidelines had already been changed in the interim period.
Although it is the responsibility of the Borrower to ascertain all rules, it would be only reasonable to expect
that the Bank staff explain any changes to the Borrower in the interest of better implementation.
8.3    Given the fact that there is normally little flexibility in the critical paths of fast track projects, the
contractor's familiarity with the local conditions assumes an inordinate importance. In addition to the
managerial and financial weaknesses of the civil works contractor, the project's main contractor had only
carried out another contract in Thailand previously and apparently had chosen a new project team for his
project. The Bank may wish to consider including the track record in the country as a pre-qualification
criterion especially in the case of fast track projects.

Annex 3: Economic Costs and Benefits
Underlying Assumptions for Economic Analysis
The principal benefit that may be quantified in this analysis is related to the increased production of very
low sulphur diesel oil (the construction of the FCC unit having been canceled) with a specification that
meets the revised fuel quality standards. Since the petroleum product market in Thailand is deregulated
and open to imports, the economic value of such products is the price in the international market (in this
case FOB Singapore) adjusted for quality, maritime transportation and other legitimate costs ex-refinery.
However, in the absence of the project, the refinery would have been forced to export all of its diesel oil
production (with higher sulphur content) at Singapore FOB prices because no outlet would exist for it in
the Thai domestic market.
Over the last few years as diesel oil with lower sulphur content has become increasingly the norm in the
East Asia and Pacific Region, prices have been posted in the PlatVs Oilgram Price Report. As of the first
week in October 2000 such listings include the 0.05 percent sulphur diesel oil for the first time (though this
specification had been traded for sometime). The differential in the prices of 0.5 percent and 0.05 percent
sulphur diesel oils FOB Singapore which started at nearly US$0.75 per barrel earlier in 2000, has now
settled down toward US$0.5 -0.55 per barrel (See Platt's Oilgram Price Reports dated Oct. 4, 2000; Oct.
25, 2000, Nov. 10, 2000 and Nov. 29, 2000). On this basis, the ex-refinery price of 0.05 percent gas oil
for Bangchak is estimated as follows:
Quality Differential at Singapore  US$0.5/bbl
Freight to Thai Post              US$0.71bbl
Insurance                         US$0.05/bbl
Loss                              US$0.201bbl
Island Freight                    US$0.15/bbl
Total               US$1.60/bbl
As for the incremental costs of refinery, they are derived from the actual expenses of processing, material
and maintenance that are attributable to the DGOHT and the sulphur recovery plants. DGOHT's residual
value is estimated at US$2.5 million.

Implementation Completion Report
Thailand: Clean Fuel and Environmental Improvement Project
(Loan 3889-TH)
Introductioo
In early 1990, The Nation Energy Policy Office (NEPO) commenced the
review of petroleum fuel specifications to bring these standards to the same level as
that of developed countries. The refineries were required to reduce the sulfur level of
Diesel Oil to 0.05 weight percent by the year 1999 and Aromatic Content in Gasoline
reduce from 50% to 35% Volume percent by the year 2000. The new specifications
mandated by NEPO both for gasoline and Diesel Oil were very stringent among this
region.
The proposed Environmental Improvement and Clean Fuels Project providing
the additional refinery facilities required to meet the new clean fuels standard was
developed in consultation with the World Bank in parallel with the various
regulations which NEPO was developing. The finalization was in March 1995 for
the proposed World Bank loan to the Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited
with the Guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand to assist in financing the
Environmental Improvement and Clean Fuels Project with amount of US$ 90 million
equivalent.
Project Objectives
I ) The main objectives of the project were to facilities the reduction of air pollution
attributable to petroleum fucls in meeting Diesel Oil and Gasoline specifications
established by the Government of Thailand, to improve its refinery operations
through the installation of appropriate facilities and equipment to reduce refinery
emissions and improve safety contributing to the development of the Thai
Govemment's long term strategy to abate the concentration of selected
pollutants.
2) The project comprised of 2 main components the Deep Gas Oil Hydrotreater
(DGOHIT) Unit and the Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) Unit. The project also
included several smaller components such as modification of Naphtha Reformer
Unit, Utilities Upgrading, Environmental and Safety Equipment, Catalysts and
Consultancy Service.

Implementation Experience and Results
I ) The project's objectives were substantially achieved.   The testing and
commissioning of the DGOHT Unit have been started on February 12, 1999 and
the performance test run have been completed by June 8, 1999. Although the
test run have been 3-4 months delay due to some hydraulic problem but the
DGOHT Unit could operate 70-80% capacity together with more severity
condition of existing Desulfurization Unit until the completion of the new unit.
However, BCP has been able to continuously produce sufficient quantities of
0.05% sulfur Diesel Oil without any shortages to our market.
2) Due to excess capacity in Thailand's refining industry and downtum in the
economy including the sufficient supply of FCC Gasoline from local refinery in
T hailand for blending the 35% aromatic content Gasoline, the construction of the
FCC Unit was postponed indefinitely. As the result, US$ 30 million of the loans
were cancelled in July 1999.
3) Regarding the Naphtha Reformer Unit modification, it was likely to be tighten
the standard by the Government for reducing the Benzene content, Aromatic
content and Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of the gasoline. Replacement of catalyst
of Reformer Unit and upgrading of furnace were necessary in order to reduce
sulfur further. However the Government has not yet decided on the new
standards therefore the amount of the loan allocated has been still no
disbursement up to the closing date in June 30, 2000.
4) For Catalyst and Chemicals, two of the three catalyst lots have been procured for
DGOHT. The use of third lot depended on the modification of Naphtha
Reformer Unit as mentioned above. Nevertheless, the amount of the loan
allocated for this portion has been no disbursement up to the closing date in June
30, 2000.
5) Regarding the Environmental and Safety Enhancement Equipment, the Sulfur
Recovery Unit designed to handle the by products from the DGO}IT unit has
been fully completed whereas the other amount of loan allocated for Air Quality
Monitoring (AQM) Equipment and Waste Water Treatment Plant has not been
fiurther needed due to using sweet fuel gas and very low sulfur oil as refinery
fuel, the emission from the stack has complied with emission standard of Thai
Government. In addition BCP has implemented for ISO 14001 since 1997 and to
reduce the usage water in the plant was one of environmental targets. As a result
the quantity of wasted water has been reduced. Therefore the capacity of existing
wasted water has been sufficient. BCP also improvc the safety system to
confident that the refinery could operate with safely operation is certified by
third party agent according to The Thai Industrial Standard (TIS 18001) which in
line wvith British Standard (BS8800: 1996 Guide to occupational health and
safety management system).

Annex 8
6) Consultancy Contracts and Licensor's Fee were effectively complete with the
exception of a short extension to the consultancy contract required to cover the
delay in the DGOHT unit completion.
7) Tlhe project was implemented at a cost of US$ 40.6 million which was disbursed
from the Bank in amount of US$ 38.1 million.
Achievement of Objective
The project's outcome is substantially satisfactory. Most of its major
objectives regarding DGOHT have been achieved although it was delayed in the
completion caused by lack of experiences of the local condition by main contractor
and some financial problem of the subcontractor due to the crisis. There still have
been continuously supplied of Diesel Oil sulfur 0.05 weight percent without any
shortages. Some unforeseeable external factors especially the economic crisis and the
excess of supply in the country affected to the change of some objective regarding
FCC unit including the pending project due to the unclear of Government's direction
of implemented new specification that will tentatively be more stringent.

Bank Performance
The project's objective was in line with Thailand's priority in implementing a
cost-effective Clean Fuel program, which the Bank has worked closely with the
Govemrnment agencies involved in developing this program. The Bank's policy also
supporting the Thai Government to mitigate the adverse impacts of transport-related
air pollution, particularly in Bangkok and vicinity area. This is consistent with a key
element of the Bank's country assistance strategy ( Report No. 13458-TH).
The project was implemented with close cooporation with the Bank in
carrying many projects since 1986 (The Bangchak Petroleum Refinery Restructuring
Project: Loan No2548-TH). The Bank was fully supporting in financial and
technical. The Bank's advisory to BCP was highly contributed to the success of the
project. The Bank's performance is considered highly satisfactory.
Although, BCP's project management team was familiar with the Bank's
procurement procedure of the past experience with previous project, But there was
some revise to the Bank's guideline at the beginning of prequalification has slightly
effect to the project schedule, however with regular and closely supervision by the
Bank could resolve the outstanding issues in timely
With, the Bank's effective supporting and the supervision to the project was
concluded as a key element which contributed to the project's success.
Future Operation
Due to the economic crisis BCP estimate to have some slightly loss in this year but it
is better than other competitors such as ESSO, RRC (Shell refinery), SPRC (Caltex
refinery), or TOC (Thai Oil refinery) and could be tumaround to profit 300-500
million Baht per year. To improve the company's profitability, the directions are
focusing on:-
1) Retail business
The target is shifted to the profitable market and secured refinery outlet. Although
the price war were initiated by Shell & Esso in late 1999 and government
squeezed to marketing margin to help Thai people during high price have some
effects to the marketing margin but now back to normal. BCP has been
continuously increased in market share from 0% in 1993 up to 9% in 2000 and
plan to increase 1% per year in the next 5 year.
2) Low investment
To delay FCC is the right decision due to installation of other three refineries
instead of I refinery as original plan cause gasoline. LPG surplus to the country
and BCP could procure FCC gasoline instead of installing a new FCC unit. The
company's strategy still has been kept for low investment in refinery sector.
Thc Bangchak Pctroleunm Public Company Limited  Construction Control Division

5Annex 8
considering only high profitable investment. Other investment will concentrate in
marketing sector. The country's demand of fuel oil was forecasted to reduce due
to additional Natural Gas supply. BCP has adjusted type of crude oil to reduce
fuel oil production from 35% to 25% of crde capacity and BCP could increase
the industry sale from 25 Million Liter per month to 45 Million Liter per month
and plan to increase to 60 Million Liter per month.
3) Financial restriction
BCP has converted short term loan to long term by issurance the bond. To
recapitalize 2.5 million Baht to public from 5.2 million Baht at present. Morever,
PTT will sale 1/3 of their share to public. This plan has been approved by the
cabinet. Tentative plan for privatization will decrease the share of the government
from 80% to 45% in Year 2001.
4) Diversify
Now BCP are seriously consider to diversify the related business which stand
alone and profitable. The consequence will be increasing the traffic to the
gasoline station cause increasing the sale volume of both gasoline and diesel.
5) Marketing
MTBE is a concern to environmental problem. BCP plan to launch a new
gasoline formula blended with Ethanol 10% instead of MTBE in early next year
as altermative fuel. The bio fuel will be produced from agricultural product. This
could help Thailand for more secure and stabilize to both energy and agricultural
