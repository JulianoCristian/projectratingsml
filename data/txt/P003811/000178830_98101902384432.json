indigenous coal as a substitute for oil and improve the\n            institutions involved in Indonesia's coal mining\n            sector. The project will consist of the following\n            investments related to mine development at Bukit Asam and\n            transport of coal to West Java: development of a three\n            million tons per year coal mine at Bukit Asam in South\n            Sumatra, including housing and social infrastructure for\n            mine employees; extension and upgrading/development of the\n            railway link to the port of Panjang; construction of a new\n            coal loading terminal near Panjang and upgrading of the\n            existing one near Palembang; construction of a ship to carry\n            coal across the Sunda Strait to the Suralaya power plant in\n            West Java; and provision of consulting services, including\n            project management, training and operational assistance for\n            all implementing agencies. In addition, the project will\n            provide $5 million in start-up funds for a coal exploration project."}, "docdt": "1981-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
