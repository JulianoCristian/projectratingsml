Directors noted that Brazil\n            has a wealth of natural resources yet low levels of social\n            indicators. They welcomed the focus on green growth\n            policies, social inclusion and gender issues that lay the\n            foundation for enhanced sustained growth for all, based on\n            the judicious use of the state's natural resources."}, "docdt": "2012-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
