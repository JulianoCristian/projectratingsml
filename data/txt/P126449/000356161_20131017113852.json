"Ratings for the Piaui Green Growth and\n            Inclusion Development Policy Loan Project for Brazil were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: strong client\n            ownership and leadership of the reform program were critical\n            to responsiveness during Development Policy Loan (DPL)\n            preparation and implementation. The Government took a\n            proactive role in defining the policy matrix with measures\n            that had high impact and were feasible within the time frame\n            of the operation. One of the lessons with the most impact\n            learned from planning and implementing the DPL refers to the\n            awareness developed in the Government of Piaui's\n            management team to legally institutionalize the\n            Government's policies and actions in order to ensure\n            the sustainability and transparency of the actions covered\n            by the policies. The design and implementation of complex\n            policy reforms require strong inter-institutional leadership\n            and coordination. In cases where the Borrower is relatively\n            weak in policy implementation, the Bank should consider\n            developing the investment operation in tandem with the DPL.\n            In cases where the prior actions supported by the DPL\n            include the creation of a new program, it might be necessary\n            to also request a detailed analysis of the budget for its implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
