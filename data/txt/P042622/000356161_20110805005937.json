the Capital Market\n            Development Project for Russian Federation were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory; the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial; the Bank's performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            longer than anticipated implementation period is not\n            necessarily indicative of inefficient outcomes. Even though\n            project efficiency may be adversely affected by a long\n            implementation period, the delays may reflect issues not\n            envisioned at the time of project design, and if\n            implementation is well executed and focused on the more\n            productive sub-components it may still achieve a critical\n            mass of outcomes. Knowledgeable and well-experienced\n            technical advisors can play an instrumental role in the\n            success of a technical assistance project. Bank dialogue and\n            ability to remain engaged in fast evolving Middle Income\n            Countries (MICs) will benefit from the availability of a\n            broader menu of support instruments that could be deployed\n            flexibly to address real-time country needs. In appraisal of\n            a financial sector project, it may be helpful to consider\n            the linkages between the macroeconomic environment and the\n            financial sector in determining project risks and adjusting\n            its design accordingly."}, "docdt": "2011-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
