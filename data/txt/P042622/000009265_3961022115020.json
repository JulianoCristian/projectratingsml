Development Project\n            supports the second phase of capital market development. The\n            first phase focused on facilitating voucher-based mass\n            privatization which ended in mid-1994. The second phase\n            focuses on building a capital market which is sustainable\n            and integrated with the wider financial system. In line with\n            this focus, the project has four specific objectives: 1)\n            build a comprehensive policy and legal framework; 2) build\n            core institutional capacity in regulation and self\n            regulation; 3) improve the efficiency, transparency and\n            systemic stability of market architecture; and 4) ensure the\n            efficient issuance, service and registration of Russian\n            Federation debt securities, the largest segment of\n            Russia's capital market. Derived from these objectives,\n            the project has three components: 1) the regulatory\n            infrastructure component which will establish the policy\n            framework, laws, and regulations and the institutional\n            capacity in regulation and self regulation which constitute\n            an essential underpinning of modern capital markets; 2) the\n            market architecture component which will support private\n            sector organizations in building efficient, fair and secure\n            trading, clearance, settlement and registration systems; 3)\n            the government securities tracking system which will enhance\n            the capability of the Ministry of Finance to manage its\n            treasuries program."}, "docdt": "1996-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
