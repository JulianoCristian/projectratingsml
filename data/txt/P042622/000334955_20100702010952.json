The\n            project implementation is satisfactory, and the project\n            objectives continue to be achievable. The project has\n            provided key backing to laying the foundations of\n            Russia's ambitious reform agenda (which includes as a\n            key component the development of Moscow into an\n            international financial center) by providing critical\n            support to the institutional, legal and regulatory\n            foundation underpinning the Russian capital markets\n            throughout all of its stages of development - from infancy\n            to high performing emerging market status. While all the\n            other project activities will be completed by June 30, the\n            extension is necessary mainly to finalize two ongoing core\n            system assignments for the successful completion of the\n            market infrastructure and capacity building of the Federal\n            Financial Markets Service (FFMS) under the project. This\n            will be CMDP's sixth and final extension. All ongoing\n            activities will be completed in full by the new closing date\n            while the loan proceeds will have been disbursed almost in\n            full. A time-bound action plan for deliverables has been\n            prepared to monitor the completion of these last contracts\n            by the new closing date."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
