Management\n            of Mineral Resources Project for Uganda were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: realistic\n            estimation of project costs and financing requirements to\n            avoid implementation delays. Government commitment to\n            budgeting sufficient funds to cover recurrent cost in order\n            to sustain project investments beyond the project closing\n            date; flexible and close donor coordination and\n            collaboration; the importance of supporting gender\n            mainstreaming in the mining sector, especially in Artisanal\n            and small-scale mining (ASM), which requires gaining the\n            trust of local governments as well as communities. The\n            project accomplished this through extensive, participatory\n            consultations and trainings; and the merit of 'peer\n            support,' such as brining in a former project\n            coordinator of a World Bank project from Romania; as well as\n            the necessity to approach mining sector development from\n            different interrelated angles, such as looking to reform, in\n            parallel, the mining sector's regulatory framework and\n            institutional set up; capacity building of the lead agency\n            to improve governance; increase transparency through\n            computerization of the mining cadastre; promote the mineral\n            sector through high quality data and integrated data\n            management; and to redress adverse environmental, social and\n            economic conditions typically associated with informal\n            mining by incentivizing the legalization of and giving a\n            'leg up out of poverty' to small scale miners."}, "docdt": "2012-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
