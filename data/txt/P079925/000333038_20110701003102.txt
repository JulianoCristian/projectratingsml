                                 Restructuring Paper

SUMMARY
1. The Government has requested a short extension of 6 months from June 30, 2011 to
   December 31, 2011, to allow completion of renovations and construction at the
   Department of Geological Survey and Mines (DGSM) and the installation, testing and
   training on the geological equipment, systems and infrastructure to be housed the new
   premises. Construction was delayed due to high costs requiring a redesign of the
   scope of works, and problems in the procurement process. The proposed extension is
   necessary to ensure the extensive investment of over US $30 million on geological
   information and systems by the three co financiers can be made available to investors
   and the Project Development Objective (PDO) achieved.


PROJECT STATUS
2. Project implementation is satisfactory and the project is achieving excellent results in
   terms of increased revenue, investment, environmental compliance and formalization
   and income levels of small scale miners.

3. Notable achievements include the airborne geophysical survey of 80% of Uganda; a
   150% increase in royalty and license revenues from mining to US$ 1.56 million in
   2010; increased transparency through publishing royalty payments to local
   government and landowners in the local newspaper; cumulative mineral exploration
   and development expenditure of US$293 million from 2005 - 2010 against a target of
   US$ 30 million; increased income of formalized artisanal miners by 65% for gold
   and 150% for industrial minerals and the Small Grants Program (SGP) improving
   livelihoods, health and environment in artisanal mining communities.

4. The majority of the project activities have been completed. However, the completion
   of several sub-components including the geological management information system
   (GMIS), the geological documentation center, laboratory and mining cadastre are
   pending completion of construction and rehabilitation of the buildings at the
   Department of Geological Survey and Mines (DGSM).

5. The PDO is “Strengthening the government's capacity to develop a sound minerals
   sector based on private investments and improvements in selected artisanal and small
   scale mining areas”. One of the most critical project activities to attract investment is
   Component 4: Geo-information and development, with the objective of “Modern,

                                             5
   accessible, geological data and information”. The intermediate indicator on this
   component is the “Establishment of publicly available Geological and Mineral
   Information System.” The Geological Management Information System and
   Documentation Centre cannot be completed until the completion of the rehabilitation
   and construction of buildings at the Department of Geological Survey and Mines
   (DGSM). Once the buildings are completed the equipment for the GMIS and
   Documentation Centre needs to be installed, tested, and staff trained. This process
   will take approximately 6 months to complete. Therefore an extension of the
   SMMRP of six months to December 31, 2011 is requested to allow the completion of
   the works and the two sub-components under Component 4 “Geo-information and
   Development”, particularly setting up the GMIS and Geological Documentation
   Center.

6. Construction is scheduled for completion on July 31, 2011 but may require an
   additional two months to complete all works. The buildings required to house the
   geological information will be prioritized to allow sufficient time for installation,
   testing and training.

7. The completion of the building is required for the co financiers to complete their
   remaining activities - the laboratory and mining cadastre system being funded by the
   African Development Bank (AfDB) and Nordic Development Fund (NDF)
   respectively. The extension has been discussed with the co financiers who are in full
   agreement. The co financiers have already extended their closing dates to July 31,
   2011 for AfDB and September 30, 2012 for AfDB

8. There are no major procurement, financial or safeguards issues outstanding.


PROPOSED CHANGES
9. The proposed changes are for an extension of the closing date by six months from
   June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2011
