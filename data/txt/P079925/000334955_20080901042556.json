objective of the Sustainable\n            Management of Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP) for the\n            Republic of Uganda is to strengthening the government's\n            capacity to develop a sound minerals sector based on private\n            investments and improvements in selected artisanal and small\n            scale mining areas. The additional credit will support the\n            completion of planned activities under the existing SMMRP to\n            develop Uganda's mineral sector. A cost overrun under\n            the project occurred primarily due to higher than expected\n            costs for technical assistance on geological information and\n            mapping as a consequence of the recent mineral commodities\n            boom. As such, the additional financing will support\n            existing and new contracts in order to complete fully all\n            activities originally planned under the project. In\n            addition, the project's development objective has been\n            refocused and a revised results framework prepared with\n            improved performance indicators. An extension of the\n            original project closing date by two years is being\n            requested to match the additional financing implementation\n            period and complete project activities and achieve the\n            project development objective (PDO)."}, "docdt": "2008-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
