                           Overall, the Project continues to achieve solid results in meeting its Development Objectives. Following a successful completion of airborne geophysical survey of Uganda (80% of
                         country), the Geological Information System is designed and geodata portal is constructed. Revenues from mining of US$ 1.03 million from January to September account for 150%

                         increase from baseline. Distribution of the royalty payments to local government and landowners is regularly published in a local newspaper. The cumulative mineral exploration and
                         development expenditure reached US$282 million from 2005 to March 2010 against a target of US$ 30 million. 448 licenses out of the targeted 300 by the project end have been
                         issued to artisanal and small scale miners (ASM) up from 100 licenses at the onset of project. Artisanal miners are improving production, increasing incomes, improving health and
                         safety. Income of formalized artisanal miners has gone up for 65% for gold and 150% for industrial minerals. The Small Grants Program, covering ten pilot sub-counties in five pilot
                         districts of Ntungoma, Kasese, Busia, Wakiso and Mukono, is at its final stage of implementation, bringing positive benefits and changes in livelihoods of the artisanal mining
                         communities.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          The delay in construction contract resulted in deferring of a number of activities requiring installation and testing of the equipment in the new facilities. Therefore, an extension will
                         be needed beyond the project closure on June 30, 2011 to complete these activities. The mission recommended and the MEMD supported that an extension of up to 9 months be
                         considered. It was agreed that the next mission, expected in late January to early February, would assess the construction progress and confirm the need and length of the
                         extension.

                         Furthermore, it was agreed that an effective management of construction of the new premises in DGSM is of critical importance and its completion requires close supervision by
                         MEMD to ensure the works are completed on schedule and within budget.

                         The established Social and Environmental Unit (SEU) is pending its formal mainstreaming into a new organizational structure of the MEMD after approval of a new institutional model

                         by the Government of Uganda. The mission is concerned that the restructuring process may take a longer period and hence, the fate of the unit after the project end is unclear.
                         Given the amount of investment made in building the social and environmental capacity in DGSM and the critical importance of social and environment management in the sector, the
                         mission urges MEMD to formally include SEU into its new organizational structure by end March 2011, as is currently scheduled.
