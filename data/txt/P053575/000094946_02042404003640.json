The project components will: 1) develop\n            strategies, programs, and systems needed to achieve\n            regulatory, and institutional development, resource\n            allocation objectives, financial sustainability, and health\n            service delivery. Local and foreign technical assistance\n            will be financed, as will information systems, equipment,\n            and training. Monitoring and evaluation should support\n            innovative health delivery models for the government to\n            build on, and fine tune results, and, will assess as well\n            the impact of project activities on indigenous populations.\n            In addition, assistance to strengthen HIV/AIDS/STI\n            surveillance systems, and improvements in blood banks will\n            also be provided; 2) establish the linkage between policy\n            objectives identified in the Policy Activity Schedule (PAS),\n            and implementation of investments and innovative management\n            changes. To this end, subprojects will extend coverage for\n            the Honduran Social Security Institute and the Ministry of\n            Health, focusing support on the expansion of integrated care\n            models. Evaluation of the PAS will be carried out through\n            three policy program reviews, to monitor progress, and\n            assess compliance with policy changes; and, 3) finance\n            project management and administration costs, namely\n            technical assistance and consultants, office equipment and\n            computerization, supervision and advisory services."}, "docdt": "2002-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
