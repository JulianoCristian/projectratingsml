and infant mortality was 36 per 1,000 births. The\n            project seeks to extend health care coverage and raise its\n            quality, especially among poor people, by supporting\n            system-wide reform. Access to services increased, especially\n            for women and children, the most vulnerable groups. As an\n            initial main step, the government will start to fund these\n            models directly from the ministry of health budget. Other\n            steps which will benefit from International Development\n            Association (IDA) support include: (i) involving the social\n            security institute (IHSS) in these contracts; (ii) scaling\n            up the number of decentralized clinics; and (iii) developing\n            a health insurance system for poor people."}, "docdt": "2007-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
