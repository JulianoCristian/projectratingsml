effective on July 27, 1977 atd final disbursement was made in August 1985.
The project was implemented by VOM.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East
a.nd North Africa Regional Office on the basis of a project completion mission
which visited Yugoslavia in March 1986 and a review of the Staff Appraisal and
President's Report (Report No. 1218-YU), the Loan Agreement, and supervision,
progress and other reports related to project implementation. The Loan
Agreement did not require the Borrower to prepare a PCR; however, with
encouragement from the Bank, the investor did prepare a Project Completion
Report in May 1986 and additional information requested by the Bank was
received in November 1986.

Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo (SAPK) in managing its water
resources. It was administered by the Vodoprivredna Organizacija "Metohija"
(VOM), which supervised the construction and will maintain the project works.
Obiectives
2.       The main objectives of the project were to increase and stabilize
crop production in an area of 10,250 ha (net); increase income of about 2,200
individual farm families, who aze among the poorest in Yugoslavia; and improve
domestic and industrial water supply to three towns and 12 villages to benefit
a present population of 64,700, which is expected to double by the year 2000.
The capacity of the dam and main canals is sufficient to meet the requirements
of a second phase designed to irrigate an additional 10,000 ha. The project
diverts water into an off-channel reservoir formed by a dam. Its works
include a diversion weir, supply canal, dam and reservoir, irrigation and
water supply networks, and on-farm works.
Implementation Experience
3.       Project costs amounted to Dinar 10,328 million compared with an
appraisal estimate of Dinar 2,184 million, due to delays in implementation and
unanticipated high inflation. In US dollar terms, the actual cost was
US$110.1 million, compared to US$121.3 million estimated at appraisal. The
Bank loan financed the full estimated foreign exchange component and the
estima'.ed amount of interest and other charges during construction (para 3.14).
4.       Project implementation was delayed due to a multitude of factors,
principal among which were: (i) tardy completion of final designs due to the
late appointment of foreign reviewing consultants; (ii) slow preparation of
tender documents with many requiring considerable revision; (iii) weak
capability of several local construction contractors; (iv) shortages of
critical materials and supplies; and (v) problems with boundary adjustment -
land consolidation. For the above reasons, project completion was delayed
four ye.%rs beyond the appraisal estimate. First irrigation on a portion of
the area did not begin until 1985 compared to the appraisal estimate of 1979.

Results
5.       The project's physical goals were achieved as designed (para 3.06),
a.id the infrastructure as constructed is aimed at removing a major constraint
on agricultural and industrial development in the project area. The target
areas and yields are expected to reach the leveis envisaged at appraisal. The
rate of return is expected to reach 9.5% (compared to 11% at appraisal) and,
taking into account phase II, the rate of return is expected to reach 10.5%
(compared to 13% at appraisal). The reason for the decrease is the delay in
implementation (paras 5.01-5.07).
Findings & Lessons
6.       The following points may be of particular interest:
(a) Delay in the preparation of final project designs and tender
documents slowed project implementation.  This preparation
should be done well in advance of project effectiveness (paras
3.01-3.06).
(b) Acquisition ot land went very smoothly. The 60 farmers whose
land was needed for the site of the reservo:.r were offered
irrigated land or a cash compensation, and all 60 chose the cash
compensation (para 3.01).
(c) Boundary adjustment-land consolidatior. presents difficult legal,
technical and particularly social problems and, therefore, the
Bank should be more cautious and realistic in establishing
implementation schedules when these issues are involved (paras
4.05-4.07).
(d) The issue of recovering operation and maintenance costs is
critical to the sustainability of the project (paras
4.18-4.21). Formal Ba..k supervision of the project ended two
months before the loan closing date, well before the scheme
became operational and before the issue of water tariffs becarmie
relevant. The Bank, through its ongoing relationships with
other projects in the Province, may pursue the opportunity to
provide VOM guidance in this critical area.



YUGOSLAVIA
METOHIJA I MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
(Loan 1360-YU)
Project Completion Report
I. INTRODUCTION
Background Data
1.01     Tthe Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo (SAPK), in which the
prcject is located, is the least developed region of Yugoslavia where the
average per capita income was only about one third of the national average
(1983). Iti population growth rate of 2.82 is about do-ble the national
rate. The main opportunities for economic growth and enhancement of health
standards in the Metohija region are increased agricultural output, exprnsion
of light and medium industries, and improved distribution of hygienic water:
all three of which were constrained by inadequate water supply before the
project. Therefore, the Provincial Government initiated in the early nineteen
seventies engineering studies in the Metohija region to determine the optimum
development of the available water resources. The result of these studies was
a master plan, which determined tha? it would be possible to irrigate as much
as 53,000 ha by providing for water storage facilities at different sites.
From this plan the Hydro-System Radenic was derived which, when completed,
would irrigate about 21,000 ha of the potential 93,000 ha and provide
industrial and domestic water supply for three towns and 47 villages. The
system was based on the construction of water storage facilities for lack of
other reliable and economically viable alternatives.
The Prolect
1.02     The Metohija I Multipurpose Project is the first phase of the
Hydro-System Radenic scheme for the Metohija region and provides water for
irrigating 1C,250 ha, and supplying the three principal towns and 12 villages
in the region with industrial and domestic - ter. The main components include
one dam and reservoir; distribution systems for irrigation and supply of
potable water, including a water treatment plant; and on-farm development.
*       The capacity of the dam and main canals is sufficient to meet the requirements
of the second phase of Hydro-System Radeni^ (about 10,000 ha).
Borrower and Executing Agency
1.03     The Water Management Organization "Metohija" (VOM) was both the
Borrower and implementing agency. The existing organization was expanded and
reorganized to meet the project's needs, including the establishment of a new
Department (BOAL Hydro-System Radenic) to operate and maintain the system.
The guarantor of the project was the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.



-2-
Proiect Financing
1.04     The Bank loan of US$54.0 million has financed US$43.0 million or 43%
of the project cost (US$99.0 million) and US$6.2 million of the original 11.0
million in the loan for interest during construction ($4.8 million was
cancelled). The remaining financing was covered by loans from the Government
of SAPK to VOM through the Bank of Kosovo (KBP),"' locatad in Pristina, the
capital of the Province.
Bank Role in the Sector
1.15     Lending in the sector has been in accordance with Bank country policy
focusing on the less developed regions and removing water supply constraints
for sustained economic development. Prior to the Metohija I Multipurpose
Project, three Bank loans had been extended to Yugoslavia to help finance
agriculture projects, one of which included both water supply and irrigation
components. Since that time the total number of Bank loans in the agriculture
sector has grown to 19. The Bank has actively assisted the Borrower in
project development and implementation, as well as in the strengthening of
institutions and formation of appropriate financial strategies.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION AND PROCESSING
Project Origin and Identification
2.01     In the early 1970s, the C-overnment of SAPK initiated plans to develop
an integrated and comprehensive program for the development of the water
resources of the Metohija region. As early as May 1973, the Provincial
Secretary of Agriculture informed the Bank of the intention of SAPK to apply
to the Bank for a loan to finance the water development program, which was
confirmed one year later in June 1974. In August 1973, the Government of SAPK
contracted Yugoslav consultants to review the feasibility of numerous
subprojects which the Government was considering to include in the water
development master plar. According to the tentative master plan, total
irrigated area in the Metohija region would reach 93,000 ha by the year 2000.
Hydro-System Radenic was part of this master plan, which would provide
irrigation for 21,000 ha and potable water to towns and industry in part of
the region.
2.02     The World Bank/FAO Cooperative Programme (CP) sent the first
reconnaissance mission to Kosovo in September 1973 to review the proposals
with Government and its consultants. Subsequently in May 1974, a CP mission,
joined by a Bank mission, identified a subproject for Metohija which was
considered to be the highest economic priority among numerous subprojects
defined by the consultants in a preliminary summary report on the "Metohija
Water Development Planning Study" (the master plan). The subproject required
the construction of two dams which together would provide irrigation of some
20-25,000 ha; water supplies for the towns of Djakovica and Orahovac and
neighboring villages in the project area. Total cost was estimated at US$93
million in mid-1974 prices, including physical and price contingencies (but
1/ Now Kosovska Banka Pristina, Udruzena Banka.



excluding the cost of water distribution and waste water systems in the
towis). At this stage, detailed feasibility studies were still lacking, and
additional field work was required. With the objective of accelerating
project preparation, the missicn also encouraged cooperation among IJNDP/WHO
(who had ongoing studies in water supply in Kosovo), Regional Planning
Consultants (who were studying infrastructure requirements in the Metohija
region) and the Provincial Government.
Preparation
2.03     Between November 1974 and September 1975, five missions (three CP,
one Bank, and one joint Bank-C?) provided guidance and assistance in project
preparation. During the first two missions, principal emphasis was placed on
the following aspects: (i) acceleration of completion of the feasibility
study for the urban water supply and waste water components so that they and
the agricultural component could be ready for appraisal together;
(ii) determination of the optimum source of water for supplying the urban
areas, i.e. whether groundwater was available or whether water from the
reservoirs should be used; and (iii) increased cost estimated in the final
version of the master plan for the subproject totalling US$220 million, or
some 140Z higher than the preliminary estimates of mid-1974, resulting in an
unacceptable economic rate of return of 5% to 7b. The main reasons for the
higher costs were due to the design of the irrigation distribution system and
allowance for the acquisition of land for the reservoir site and investment
for agricultural development. As a result, and in preparation for the ne::t CP
mission, the Bank requested Government to have its consultants conduct a
careful review of the project designs to determine if significant cost savings
could be made, and prepare cost estimates for different alternatives, as well
as details of project benefits. By this stage in the preparation process, the
Secretary for Agriculture of SAPK had delegated responsibility for the
preparation and the implementation of the project to VOM, located in Prizren.
Three organizations were commissioned to assist VOM; namely, VOM's
longstanding engineering consultants from Belgrade; the Belgrade Agriculture
Institute; and the Provincial Government's consultants who developed the
original master plan.
2.04     The CP preparation mission of May 1975 concentrated on formulating a
project to make the optimum use of a single dam and reservoir (Radenic), which
wo,uld irrigate an area of some 20,500 ha, which was roughly divided in half by
the Beli Drim river. As a result, total project cost was estimated at US$200
million, including conting-ncies. Since on this basis, the proposed Bank loan
of between US$50-60 million would only cover 25% to 30% of costs, the mission
suggested that the Bank should appraise the project as a whole, but finance it
in two tranches--the first to develop the right bank of the Beli Drim and the
second to develop the left bank.
2.05     A final joint Bank-CP preparation mission visited Kosovo in
September-October 1975, during which time the following main project details
were agreed upon: (i) due to budgetary constraints, Hydro-System Radenic
would be implemented in two phases, and final preparation would concentrate
only on Phase I; (ii) the size of the agriculture component was reduced to
about 10,000 ha for Phase I; (iii) the annual public water supply requirement
in year 2000 was reduced; (iv) groundwater supplies were deemed uncertain and
could only serve short-term needs; (v) the long-term water requirement for
irrigation and water supply was best supplied solely from the Radenic dam; and



- 4 -
(vi) the Radenic reservoir would have adequate storage capacity to serve both
phases of the Hydro-System Radenic. The reduced project cost was estimated at
US$100 million, excluding contingencies.
Appraisal
2.06     The Bank appraised the irrigation component of the project in
November 1975, and the water supply ccnponent, organizational and financial
status of VOM, and Government's financing plans were appraised in January
1976. Appraisal was based on a feasibility report for phase I of Hydro-System
Radenic prepared by VOM and its consultants with the assistance of the CP, as
described in the preceding paragraphs.
2.07     The feasibility report proposed the following components:  (i)
provision of irrigation for about 10,250 ha, including establishment of new
orchards on about 930 ha; (ii) livestock development; (iii) construction of
farm roads and other marketing facilities; (iv) agroindustries; and
(v) industrial ard domestic water supply for the towns of Djakovica, Zrze, and
Orahovac and villages. Estimated total cost was US$231.4 million, including
US$86.8 million as price contingency. With the Bank's allocation of US$54.0
million for this project, the loan would have financed only about 23% of the
project cost. Consequently, appraisal limited the project to the following
main components, which are described in detail in paras 2.15-2.16:
(i) irrigation, draina3e and soil improvement; (ii) provision of water supply;
and (iii) farm roads, buildings and demonstration farms. The livestock and
agroindustry components, which were dependex.t on incremental production
resulting from the irrigation component, were recommended for consideration
under forthcoming agricultural credit and agroindustries projects.
2.08     At the Decision Meeting held on December 19, 1975 the Region decided
that it would not be possible to recommend Board presentation of the proposed
loan for the Metohija I project unless there was significant progress with
achieving land consolidation in the Ibar Multipurpose Water Project
(Loan 777-YU), which was also being implemented in the Province of Kosovo near
the city of Pristina. By mid-1976, the Bank considered piogress towards land
consolidation under the Ibar project sufficient to go ahead with the Metohija
project.
2.09     In the Metohija project area, because of the irregular and scattered
nature of private holdings, land consolidation would have been desirable,
which would have permitted a less costly design of the on-farm irrigation
system. However, because of the difficulties encountered with land
consolidation in the Ibar project, appraisal opted for minor boundary
adjustments of parcels rather than land consolidation and designed the
irrigation system for individual farmers to fit the small parcels.
2.10     Several issues, which were ultimately resolved, persisted through to
the Loan Committee. They were the high irrigation cost per family (US$14,800)
and the low recovery of cost (full O&M costs but only 10% of capital costs).
In summary, the justification for proceeding with the project was supported by
the following: (i) the lack of alternatives to irrigation development in
Kosovo; (ii) alternative technical solutions which could reduce costs or reach
a greater number of beneficiaries had been explored but had not proved viable;
(iii) an acceptable rate of return (11%); and the country could at that time
afford to replicate such investments to reach additional numbers of the target



- 5 -
group, and to recover only a small part of the cost from the very poor
beneficiaries which was deemed to provide a much higher social rate of
return. Also, it was expected that the inclusion of Phase II benefits raised
the rate of return to '3%.
Negotiations
2.11     Negotiations were held in Washington during the period November 8-19,
1976. Financial questions, arising from the designation of VOM as the
Borrower, were the subject of considerable discussion, the purpose of which
was to agree upon a formula which would: (i) provide adequate capital
financing for the project; and (ii) ensure VOM's solvency by relieving its
debt service burden throughout the repayment period of the Bank loan.
Throughout the appraisal process it was apparent that the capital financing
ioans from the Bank and KBP would place a heavier debt service burden on VOM
than it would be able to support. Consequently, a scheme was agreed upon
which provided VOM with funds from the Provincial Government and rollover
financing by KBP.
2.12     Also, VOM's revenue generating capability was a subject of concern.
It was agreed that VOM would ensure that its gross operating revenue would be
sufficient to cover its gross operating costs, a portion of the capital costs
of the project and the remaining portion of debt service not covered by the
scheme referred to in para 2.11. Accordingly, a methodology was agreed upon
for generating sufficient gross operating revenues (para 4.18).
Board Presentation and Loan Effectiveness
2.13     The Board approved a loan for US$54.0 million on January 11, 1977.
Discussion focused mainly around the financing of interest during
construction. The staff advised that the financing of interest during
construction was entirely in accord with Bank policy and practice, which was
of long standing and had been selectively applied to previous operat4ons in
Yugoslavia, including a loan for a similar project in the same Province
approved in 1971 (Ibar Multipurpose Water Project). Pertinent information on
the two projects (Ibar and Metohija) was subsequently circulated to the Board,
which substantiated the statement made by the staff at Board presentation.
2.14     The loan documents were signed on February 3, 1977.  One special
condition of loan effectiveness was the appointment of a Finance Director for
VOM. Evidence of fulfillment of all of the conditions precedent to
effectiveness of the loan was received about two months beyond the originally
stipulated date, and the loan was declared effective on July 27, 1977.
Project Objectives and De3cription
2.15     The main objectives of the project were to:  (i) increase and
stabilize crop production in an area of 10,250 ha; (ii) increase income of
2,200 individual farm famiIies who are among the poorest in Yugoslavia; and
(iii) improve water supply ito three towns and 12 villages to benefit industry
and a present population oi 64,700, which is expected to double by the year
2000.

| *      extension staff.
Consultants' Services
2.le     About 60 man-months' services for the preparation of final design and
bidding dv -ments of project works and the training of local engineers.
III.  IMPLEMENTATION
Start-up
3.01     Acquisition of land on the site of the reservoir began in mid-1977,
and was completed in a timely and satisfactory manner in accordance with
Section 3.05 to the Loan Agreement. In spite of VOM's offer of allocating
land (to be irrigated from the project) or a cash compensation, the 60



- 8 -
displaced farmers preferred cash compensation. Land costs increased
considerably over appraisal estimates, and expenditures were 50% higher than
anticipated in local terms.
3.02     VOM retained the same engineering consultant firm from Belgrad,. which
had assisted in the preliminary engineering aspects for the project's
feasibility study to prepare final project designs and bidding documents (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02). However, since the appraisal mission had felt that
this consultant would require some specialized assistance in certain areas of
engineering, VOM sought the services of foreign consultants. It was not until
early 1978 that VOM, in consultation with the Bank, contracted a French firm
for this purpose.
3.03     Final designs for Radenic dam, the intake weir and main canal to the
reservoir were completed by the local consultants by end-1977. By end-1978,
the French consultants had completed their review of all designs for the
outlet works, water treatment plant, and water distribution network.
3.04     Also by end-1978, the dam access road was completed, dam construction
was underway (5% completed), and the diversion weir and feeder canal were
about 20 percent and 30 percent completed, respectively. The first
supervision mission (end-1978), since initiation of project works, estimated
that the project was about six months behind the construction schedule
estimated at apprai al, mainly due to the late appointment of the foreign
review consultants, which delayed the completion of several key project
designs.
3.05     A significant achievement shortly after project start-up was VOM's
organization of a demonstration area (Marmule), which was accomplished through
the cooperation of 28 farmers, owning a total of 32 ha, who introduced
boundary adjustment on their plots and sprinkler irrigation using equipment
provided by VOM.  Water was pumped from a nearby river for this purpose.  The
early establishment of this pilot scheme had a significant impact on other
farmers' awareness ef the use and advantages of mobile sprinkler irrigation in
small parcels, and their eventual acceptance of boundary adjustment.
Physical Implementation
3.06     The original implementation schedule, in which civil works would
start in 1977 and be completed in 1981, grossly underestimated the time
necessary to construct the varSous components of the project. In reality,
project works were not completed until end-1985-four years beyond the
appraisal estimate. A multitude of factors were responsible for the
persistent delays, chief among which were: (i) tardy completion of final
designs due to the late appointment of foreign reviewing consultants;
(ii) slow preparation of tender documents with many requiring considerable
revision; (iii) weak capability of several local construction contractors;
(iv) shortages of critical materials and supplies; (v) harsh weather
conditions during at least four months of the year; and (vi) problems with
boundary adjustment-land consolidation. The following table compares actual
completion dates with the appraisal estimates for the project's major civil
works.

3.07     On-farm development works caused special problems in project
implementation. These works consisted of soil improvement (drainage, erosion
control, and subsoiling); installation or the tertiary irrigation network
(placed under the subheading "Irrigation Distribution System" in the preceding
table); and land consolidation. As a practical and cost-effective decision,
these works were implemented simultaneously, to the extent possible, in order
to avoid repeated disturbance to field parcels and indemnification of farmers'
crops more than one time. Because of delays in achieving land consolidation
all of the other dependent on-farm development works also were delayed.
3.08     It was not until the fall of 1984 that the first land (2,800 ha) was
consolidated in the project area. In a sense, this represented a
breakthrough, since it was the first time any land had been consolidated in
the SAPK, despite continuing efforts under the Ibar Multipurpose Water Project
(Loan 777-YU).
3.09     Appraisal had estimated that project works and land consolidation
would be sufficiently advanced to permit the irrigation of 2,750 ha in 1979,
6,700 ha in 1980, and the total project area of 10,250 ha in 1981. However,
as a consequence of delays in both completion of essential civil works and
land consolidation, the first cropland (1,100 ha) was not irrigated until
1985. It is estimated that 7,133 ha will be ready for irrigation in the 1987
cropping season.
Procurement
3.10     Contracts were procured in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Loan
Agreement with several exceptions as described below. ICB prccurement
procedures were followed for: (i) civil works for the diversion weir, supply
canal, and rockfill dam; (ii) irrigation canals and primary and secondary
networks for 3,050 ha; and (iii) equipment for pumping stations, sprinkler
irrigation, including hydrants, water treatment plant and operation and
maintenance--all in accordance with the Loan Agreement. At the request of the
Borrower and with the Bank's prior agreement, civil works for the water
treatment plant were procured through local competitive bidding procedures
(LCB) rather than ICB, as was the construction of the second tranche of
irrigation canals and networks for 7,200 ha. Supply of hydraulic equipment
for automatic flow regulation and surge control, PVC pellets, asbestos fibers,
and trenching machines was permitted through international shopping based on
price quotations from three suppliers from three different countries. Also,
the provision for LCB procedures for individual items of equipment estimated
to cost not more than US$40,000 equivalent was increased to US$100,000
(including materials in addition to equipment) and the limit of the total cost
of such goods was increased from US$300,000 to US$600,000.
3.11     On-farm development works such as construction of the tertiary
network and soil improvement measures were carried out by VOM under force
account in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The Bank agreed to the
Borrower's request to include farm drainage (open and underground) also under
force account, since it was an integral part of the other on-farm development
works. All civil works contracts were won by Yugoslav contractors and foreign
contractors won seven of the 12 equipment contracts under ICB and
international shopping procedures.

3.12     The ICB procurement of glass reinforced pipe (GRP) for the main water
distribution system (about 57 km) proved to be the most difficult procurement
item. On June 1, 1981 the Bank agreed to VOM's request to use GRP pipes for
pipes larger than 1,000 mm diameter since GRP pipes represented not only a
technically superior solution from the engineering aspect but also a
considerable cost savings (steel pipes were estimated to cost about 50% more
than GRP).  It was not until almost two years later (April 13, 1983) that the
contract for GRP pipes was finally signed with the supplier. The main causes
of the delay were:  (i) the necessity for rebidding, since there had been two
errors in the original tender document which substantially changed the
quantities of pipe to be supplied and consequently could have affected unit
costs; (ii) revision of the technical specifications in the tender documents,
for which the Bank engaged two different consultants, which consumed
considerable time; and (iii) difficulties the Borrower encountered because of
local pressure to use domestically made steel pipes after it was agreed
between the Borrower and the Bank to use GRP pipes.
3.13     Appraisal had estimated that the project would be implemented through
a total of about 18 main contracts, both ICB and LCB. However, in reality the
number rose to more than 50. This not only affected the project
implementation schedule but also made project supervision and coordination
difficult.
Project Cost
3.14     The actual cost of the project was US$11G.1 million compared with
US$121.3 million estimated at appraisal. The major cost was the establishment
of the irrigation network with its equipment needs for sprinkler irrigation
and accounted for 45% of total project cost. Annual breakdown of cost by
component is given in Annex i, Table 2.  Estimated and actual costs are given
below.

Financing
3.15     The Bank financed $49.2 million or 43% of the total financial
requirements and cancelled $4.8 million of the original loan of $54.0 million
allocated for interest and other charges during construction. The remaining
financing was covered by loans from the SAPK government to VOM through KBP.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.16     All the operational covenants that came into play during the project
period were complied with. The adjustment of farm boundaries-land
consolidation is not yet completed. Section 1.02(d) to the Loan Agreement
required the establishment of BOAL Hydro-system Radenic for the operation and
maintenance of facilities prior to December 31, 1978. Howevel, early in
project implementation the Bank agreed to defer its formal establishment until
the project was closer to completion, and consequently, nearer to the time
when the first revenue would be forthcoming from the system. It was finally
established in February 1986. As irrigation did not commence until after the
loan was closed, the covenants on recovering project costs through water
charges is difficult for the Bank to monitor. Cost recovery is discussed in
Chapter 4.
3.17     With respect to reporting requirements, VOM met its obligations for
quarterly progress reports in a satisfactory manner, which helped the Bank
monitor the project. Annual progress reports were not submitted since they
dealt with information on agricultural production under the project, which
began in 1985 covering only a portion of the project area.
Disbursements
3.18     Disbursements lagged considerably behind the appraisal estimate
because of slow project implementation (Annex 2, Table 1). By the original
Loan Closing Date of December 31, 1982 only 28% of the total loan had been
disbursed. At the request of the Borrower, the Loan Closing Date was extended
on two occasions--the first to December 31, 1983 and the second to
December 31, 1984. However, the Bank continued until August 1985 to honor
withdrawal applications for eligible expenditures under contracts entered into
prior to December 31, 1984. The termination date for capitalizing the loan
charges was December 31, 1984. An undisbursed balance of about US$4.8 million
was cancelled from the category of interest and other charges effective
January 1, 1985. Disbursements by categories are shown in Annex 2, Table 2.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Agricultural Development
4.01     The Supply of Water.  The source of water for the project (both
irrigation and water supply components) is the Decanska Bistrica river. A
detailed reservoir operating study (covering a 19-year period) indicated that
no water shortages would occur. High river discharges occur from March to
May, and usually the irrigation season would start with a full reservoir. The
waters of the river are of excellent quality for irrigation and domestic water
supply purposes. The Decanska Bistrica river is a tributary of the Beli Drim



river which flows into Albania. A treaty signed in 1962 between Albania and
Yugoslavia allows Yugoslavia to divert up to 216 Mm3 per year. Project
needs equal only 32% of the allowable diversion. The Government of Kosovo
submitted to the Bank a statement indicating thai  the proposed diversions for
the project comply with the treaty.
4.02     The gross average water supply requirements based on domestic and
industrial demand are given in Annex 3. Agricultural water requirements for
different crops were computed using the Penman formula with crop and growth
stage factors recommended in FAO Water Supply Paper No. 24.  Allowing for
3
effective rainfall, the net requirement per hectare is 3,250 m . With an
overall efficiency of 71%, the gross irrigation demand is 4,580 m3/ha or a
total of 47.5 Mm3, about 30% of which is required in July, the month of
maximum demand.
4.03     Of the total project area of 10,250 ha, 7,000 ha are owned by
individual farmers and the remaining 3,250 ha are owned by Agro-Kosovo
Kombinat, which is an association of social sector enterprises. About 80% of
the individual farmers own less than five hectares, and the remaining 20% own
5-10 ha each. Holdings are scattered, averaging 7.3 parcels, and the minimum
size of parcels is 0.1 ha. The portable sprinkler system for the individual
farmers uses mobiie equipment, consisting of a single sprinkler on a 50 m long
"garden hose". The system is designed for a 12 m x 12 m pattern, operating at
3.0 atmosphere. Farmers own several portable units to irrigate several plots
or portions of plots, depending upon the crops, simultaneously. For the
social sector, the system consists of pipes and sprinklers operating in a 12 m
x 18 m pattern under a nozzle pressure of 3.5 atmosphere. Farmers are
receiving sprinkler equipment with 3-year, interest-free credit. Sales of
sprinkler equipment was the principal source of income for VOM during the
project implementation period.
4.04     Boundary Adjustment - Land Consolidation.  Because of the irregular
and scattered nature of the land holdings in the individual sector, some form
of land rationalization was required for optimum utilization of the irrigation
and drainage facilities. Because of the slow progress in land consolidation
under the Ibar Multipurpose Water Project (Loan 777-YU), it was agreed under
the Metohija project to introduce a less drastic approach; namely, adjustment
of parcel boundaries.
4.05     Even boundary adjustment proved to be a difficult and drawn out
process.  It was not until P-:ly 1982, that actual field implementation of
boundary adjustment began in the first tranche of 3,000 ha. However, about
the same time on February 12, 1982, the Government of SAPK decreed that land
consolidation should be carried out uniformly throughout the Province with
priority in the irrigated areas of Ibar and Metohija. This led to
considerable unrest within the Metohija farm community, which had previously
agreed to boundary adjustment. Despite the concerns raised by both the
Borrower and the Bank on the adverse effect of this decision on the Metohija
project, VOM was required to comply, and the process of boundary adjustment
was abandoned. Nevertheless, much of the preliminary work; such as,
identification of parcels and preparation of cadastral maps, that was already
done for boundary adjustment was applicable to the land consolidation process.
4.06     During much of 1983, the Bank voiced concern over the lack of
progress in achieving land consolidation. Finally, in October 1983, a
contract was awarded to the Institute for Photogrammetry in Belgrade, which
5530z



was signed by the Executive Council of SAPK and the Assembly of Djakovica
Commune for the purpose of completing land consolidation on 1,497 ha in the
project area by fall 1984. Under another contract (signed in December 1984)
with the same Institute, an additional 1,294 ha was to be consolidated by
end-1984 and the remainder of 7,459 ha by fall 1985, which would complete land
consolidation in the total project area of 10,250 ha (7,000 ha in the
individual sector and 3,250 ha in the social sector). The last supervision
mission noted that in one 250 ha sub-system, there were 105 individual farmers
on 500 fragmented plots of an average size of 0.5 ha. Following land
consolidation the number of plots was reduced to 173, with an average size of
1.5 ha. The farmers interviewed fully supported land consolidation, were
anxiously awaiting the opportunity to take possession of their new land, and
they wished the pace had been faster but commented that the land consolidation
staff carried out their task in a serious and meticulous manner. It was
mainly on the basis of the completion of land consolidation contracts that the
Bank agreed to the request of the Borrower to postpone the Loan Closing Date
one additional year to December 31, 1984. By fall 1984, approximately 2,800
ha had been consolidated, and consolidation of the remaining 7,450 ha was
completed by May 1986.
4.07     Support Services for Individual Farmers.  At the time of appraisal
some of the individual farmers obtained farm inputs and advisory services from
Kombinat Agrokosovo and the few production cooperatives in the region by
entering into contracts with these organizations for the sale of their crops.
However, the appraisal mission concluded that the extension service available
to farmers was deficient and incapable of satisfying present or future needs
of the farmers, particularly those farmers wr.o were not associated in any way
with the social sector enterprises.
4.08     Section 3.01 to the Loan Agreement requires VOM to employ qualified
agricultural staff in adequate number as needed to carry out the project. By
mid-1980, VOM had employed two agriculturists. They were very effective in
assisting farmers in the Marmule demonstration area. The appraisal report
also indicates that the project would provide and equip six extension units of
about three agents each, who would be responsible to VOM. However, this
approach to extension was modified, since in mid-1978, a new law was decreed
in SAPK concerning agricultural extension services for the whole Province.
The law stipulates that the agricultural cooperatives would have the dominant
role in providing direct technical assistance to the individual farmers
through the formation of basic specialized services in the cooperatives or
other forms of farmer associations, so that each of the 22 communes in the
Province would be covered by one such basic service. Each service would
consist of two to three specialists. By mid-1980 seven cooperatives were in
existence with a total membership of 1,085 individual farmers or about 50% of
the total number in the project area. The law also provides that the Union of
Cooperatives (founded in February 1977 at the Provincial Government level) be
responsible for coordinating the system. Under this law for agricultural
extension, the provision of advisory services to farmers has greatly expanded
and improved in the Ibar Multipurpose Water Project (Loan 777-YU), and it can
be expected to have similar beneficial effects in the Metohija project.
4.09     As mentioned in para 6.02, the Marmule demonstration area has been an
effective tool in familiarizing farmers with portable sprinkler irrigation and
related production technology. It has been the focal point for demonstrations
conducted by the extension agents in the project area in collaboration with
VOM's agriculturists.
5 5 30Z



4.10     VOM has continued its ongoing agreements with a number of
agricultural institutes in 3elgrade, principal among which are the Soil
Science Institute and the Institute for Mechanization.  Subject matter
specialists from these institutes have provided valuable service to VOM in
applying the appropriate technology for many of the on-farm development
measures under the projtct. It is expected that their involvement will
continue through providing necessary training for local technicians.
4.11     Marketing and Markets.  Project output would be marketed through the
existing specialized trade organization network. Kombinats in and around the
project area would purchase industrial crops, fruits and vegetables from
farmers through both long and short-term contracts for processing purposes.
However, at least 50% of the vegetables would be marketed by individual
farmers in the many local peasant free markets as fresh vegetables. Sales of
commodities and/or their products outside of Kosovo Province would be
coordinated by Agrokosovo Kombinat. In addition, the private sector has
responded to the increase in production from the 458 hectares irrigated in the
1985 season, and the substantially higher vegetable prices elsewhere in
Yugoslavia has been encouraging shipment in private vans to areas outside the
Province.
4.12     To ensure timely and efficient distribution of projec. output,
particularly of perishable commodities, the project was to finance improvement
and expansion of farm roads. The roads component did not materialize.
However, this need will be partially met by roads to be constructed under the
Kosovo Regional Development Project (Loan 2306-YU). However, the Government
of Kosovo ag;eed to ensure the provision of the necessary processing and
marketing facilities in the project area; such as, vegetable collecting and
processing centers, packing plants, cooling stations and transport facilities
by the time that significant incremental production is expected frLm the
project (Loan Agreement, Section 6.03).
4.13     Already, under the Kosovo Agricultural Development Project (Loan
1993-Y'U) seven new agroindustries were completed in 1983 in close proximity to
the project area ranging from processing of fruit and vegetables to cold
storage facilities at a total investment cost of Dinar 1,725 million. This
development could potentially enhance the marketing prospects for the output
from the project.
4.14     Incremental agricultural output from the project is to be marketed
primarily within Kosovo to help meet existing deficits.  An estimated 27%
population increase during the ten-year period 1983-1993 is expected to
generate substantial incremental demand within Kosovo, which, together with
current production deficits, would exceed the anticipated production increases
from the project. In 1984, Yugoslavia as a whole, imported over one half
million tons of wheat. Although very little of the output is expected to be
exported, much of it would contribute indirectly to Yugoslavia's foreign
exchange savings by reducing import requirements.
Potable Water Development
4.15     Existing public water supply in the project area wasr deficient in
towns and practically non-existent in rural areas where the inhabitants rely
on shallow wells with low yields of doubtful quality. One spring of variable
yield, supplemented by twc boreholes, supplied inadequate quantities of water
5530Z



I u
to Djakovica. Orahovac derived its supply from two wells and had problems of
both quality and quantity. In the early 1970s there were outbreaks of typhoid
and infectious hepatitis in Orahovac, which were attributed to the use of
polluLed water. Bacterial dysentery is common throughout the whole region.
4.16     Domestic and industrial demand projections assumed maximum per capita
daily consumptions of 200 liters for towns and 150 liters for villages by the
year 2000 in the areas to be served by the project. Between 30% and 40% of
the per capita water allowance in the rural area was allocated for livestock
use. Allowing for system efficiency of 90%, the net water requirement is
estimated at 12.1 Mm3 pee year.
4.17     The new water supply facilities, except for the distribution systems
for the towns of Djakovica and Orahovac, are operated and maintained by the
BOAL Hydro-System Radenic. The towns of Djakovica and Orahovac operate and
maintain their distribution system through existing water departments. The
main pipelines to these towns were completed in August 1985 and March 1986,
respectively. The BOAL Hydro-System Radenic supplies potable water from
source to faucet for consumers in rural areas and directly to industry in Zrze
and to the towns of Djakovica and Orahovac on the basis of metered bulk
supply. The connections to the first four village networks were completed in
April 1986 and the remainder will be made by the end of 1987.
Recovery of Project Costs
4.18     Irrigation.  't was envisaged at appraisal that water charges would
be set at a level high enough to generate revenues to cover operation and
maintenance costs, plus 10% of capital costs. The social sector was to pay a
higher water tariff than the private sector. The actual charges to be levied
were to be agreed upon by the Bank for the first time in 1979, and gradually
increased to full recovery of O&M by the fourth year of irrigation. The last
supervision mission in October 1984 reviewed the methodology proposed by VOM
and found it to be satisfactory. VOM would calculate the full recovery of
operation and maintenance costs, amortization, capital investment, and the
financial cost of the foreign exchange risk. A portion of this cost was to be
borne by SAPK. The remainder would determine the charge to the end user.
4.19     Irrigation commenced only in 1985 on a portion of the area, however,
no charges have been collected. VOM has recently proposed to the executive
council and KBP a water charge for 1987 of 56,300 dinar per hectare, which has
not been officially adopted. VOM has calculated that this price would cover
about 25% of the total cost (as defined in para 4.18). This amount is
approximately equal to the amount estimated in the appraisal report, adjusted
to 1986 dinar, to allow VOM to recover only O&M costs from the private
farmers. However, inflation in 1987 would bring revenues below the level
required to recover O&M costs.
4.20     Potable water supply.  It was stated at appraisal that both
investment and opera u. and maintenance costs would be recovered through a
water tariff. The tariff would be set at the level of long-run average cost
of water which, adjusted to 1986 prices, was estimated at dinar 78.54/m3.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that VOM would impose charges
sufficient to cover all expenses (including depreciation), and in addition
provide a rate of return on fixed assets of not less than 7%.

4.21     Water supply commenced in August 1985 to Djakovica, and the rest of
the system was completed by the end of 1986. A water charge of 45 dinar/m3
has been proposed for domestic users and 85 dinar for industrial users. VOM
states that these prices do not cover their total expenses, and have not been
officially adopted.
V.  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
5.01     Land Use, Yields and Production.  Prior to the project (up to and
incl4ding 1984, since irrigation did not begin until 1985), the area was
dry-farmed with cereals occupying 567, alfalfa 67, orchards and vineyards 102
and other crops (sugarbeet, sunflower, peas and vegetables) 11X.  About 172 of
the area was occupied by meadows or forest of little economic value.
Pre-project yields were low because of moisture deficits during the growing
season, inadequate drainage and poor soil management practices. The cropping
pattern was not expected to change in the future without the project, but
yields would 4mprove slightly due to improvement in general farming
practices. Appraisal estimated that yields of fruit trees, vineyards, and
winter crops would increase by about 20Z and summer crops by about 107 over a
five-year period without the project. With the introduction of irrigation,
there was a shift expected from traditional rainfed winter-cereal farming to
greater emphasis on high value summer crops which are responsive to
irrigation. The appraisal report expected areas under maize, sugar beet,
vegetables and alfalfa to increase at the expense of wheat. Cropped area was
expected to increase by 2,070 ha due to an increase in cropping intensity and
reclamation of small plots of wooded land. Based on data provided by the
borrower on present cropping patterns, in the 1984 cropping season, one year
before irrigation commenced, there had already bee;! a shift away from orchards
and to rye, sunflower atid tobacco tha was not foreseen by the appraisal
report. After irrigation commenced in 1985, the shift becomes much more
dramatic than the appraisal report envisaged away from orchards, with less
emphasis on sugar beet and alfalfa and more on soybean, tobacco, sunflower,
and other vegetables (Annex 6, Table 1).
5.02     The appraisal report expected the incremental yields under irrigation
to increase gradually, reaching full development in the sixth year of
irrigation in the individual sector and in the fourth year in the social
sector. This pattern has been adopted in the completion report estimates.
"Without project" yields from the appraisal report have been used as a
baseline, increasing to actual 1984 yields provided by the borrower. "With
project" yields provided by the borrower are roughly in line with appraisal
report estimates (Annex 6, Tables 1., 3 and 4).
5.03     At the time of appraisal, full agricultural development was expected
in 1986. Full development is now estimated to occur only in 1991.
Incremental production was expected to begin in 1979, but in fact first
incremental production was not realized until 1985. The project raises
agricultural production through an increase in cropped area and more intensive
and efficient use of land, water and other factors of production (Annex 6,
Tables 5-6).
5.04     Prices.  At appraisal, the prevailing financial farmgate prices of
outputs were in line with Bank forecasts of world prices (converted to
farmgate) of similar commodities for 1975-85. Therefore, economic prices in

the apprais-l report were assumed to be approximately the same as financial
prices. However, while domestic prices remained constant, and in some cases
increased in real terms over this period, world market prices and forecasts
have decreased. With the exception of tobacco. the average protection
provided to the major tradable crops (wheat, maize, soybean, sugarbeet, and
tobacco) was significantly higher in the 1980-84 period than the 1975-79
period. Of the five crops, the least protected has been wheat. Similarly,
the standard conversion factor used to shadow price local costs at appraisal
was 0.93. Currently the factor is estimated to be 0.75.
5.05     Analysis done for this completion report adjusts the five major
export crops by the average nominal protection coefficierts for the project
period. Local project costs, and operation and maintenance costs, as well as
the production costs for project outputs and locally traded outputs are shadow
priced by the standard conversion factor. The 1986 actual farmgate prices of
project outputs were provided by the Borrower (Annex 6, Table 2). These
prices are consistently higher in real terms than those estimated at appraisal.
5.06     Economic rate of return.  At the time of appraisal the internal
economic rate of return was estimated as 112, calculated on the basis of a
five-year implementation period, with incremental benefits starting in year
three of the project. In reality, the implementation period extended over
eight years, with incremental benefits starting in year seven of the project.
Actual costs were much less 'front loaded' than was anticipated at appraisal.
Revised calculations show that the rate of return of the project has dropped
to 9.5X. Although financial prices have gone up in real terms compared to
appraisal estimateo, the economic prices, wi-h adjustments for market
distortions, have stayed roughly in line. Therefore, prices do not seem to
play a major part in the difference between the two rates of return (Annex 6,
Table 7).
5.07     Prorating costs which would not have been incurred under Phase I of
the project 5-f works had not been designed to include Phase II (an additional
10,000 ha - see para 2.01) brings the rate of return up to 10.5%. The
appraisal report estimated that this adjustment would raise the rate of return
to 13X. Calculating separate rates of return for irrigation and water supply
by prorating 802 of common costs to irrigation, 201 to water supply yields a
10% rate of return to irrigation and 9% to water supply. The appraisal report
estimated 11.1% to irrigation and 10.9% to water supply.
Financial Performance
5.08     The appraisal mission estimated that, with appropriate water charges,
VOM would secure a small positive cash flow in the years following project
completion. As the project is only becoming fully operational this year, it
is not possible to forecast VOM's future financial viability with any degree
of certainty. As an indication, the appraisal estimate of O&M costs in the
first year after project completion, in 1986 prices, was 400 million dinar.
Water sales, using the level of water charge proposed by VOM for 1987 (56,300
dinar), and the maximum area available for irrigation (7,133 ha), could
potentially reach 401 million dinar. However, actual O&M costs may be higher
than appraisal estimates.
5.09     VOM was never intended to be a self-sustaining organization
financially. It was set up as an "investment" organization to become later an
sS30Z



- 19 -
"operating" organization once the project was completed. To date it has had
little revenue and has depended almost completely on the Government for all
its finance. Furthermore the Government undertook, as specified in the Loan
Agreement (Article VI, Section 6.02), to grant VOM the amount of all
maturities of all loans due for repayment before December 31, 1981 and
interest and other charges which w:ere scheduled to be paid by the borrowers to
the Bank and to Kosovska Banka in the years 1982-89. In the absence of any
substantial revenue, the Government has serviced the World Bank loan until now
and is likely to continue to do so. VOM has already benefitted from
rescheduling of its financial obligations as detailed in Annex 7, Table 3, and
complementary domestic loans were granted tc assist it in servicing its debt.
These measures will have to continue so as to allow VOM to meet its
obligations.
5.10     The actual cash flow statement and balance sheet of VOM for the years
1977-1985 are given in Annex 7. No interest was paid by VOM with regard to
its indebtedness, since this was paid by the Government, as detailed in the
Loan Agreement. Depreciation amounted to less than half a percentage of the
value of the fixed assets at 1985 year start. The revenue generated from
potable water sales, in 1985, amounted to about 0.75% of the value of fixed
assets at the start of 1985. Some revenue was also earned from the sale of
sprinklers.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization Development
6.01     Under the project, VOM, an;existing organization, was reorganized and
expanded to meet the project's needs. The position of General Manager was
upgraded to General Director, and a qualified person was appointed to serve as
Financial Director   The staff of the organization rose from 7 in 1977 to 103
in 1986. The irrigation works, including the dam, are operat.id and maintained
by BOAL Hydro-system Radenic. It has three divisions-Finance,
Administration, and Operations. The Operations Division has four sectors to
be headquartered at Djakovica, Rogovo, Ratkovac and Velika Krusa. Each sector
services about 2,500 ha and is staffed by a maintenance engineer, a skilled
technician, and a storekeeper. Field operations staff cooperate with VOM's
agriculturists and extension agents to promote proper use of irrigation
water.  A list of personnel with their qualifications is presented in Annex 4,
Table 1.  Equipment and vehicles for O&M are shown in Annex 4, Table 2.
Demonstration Areas
6.02     Shortly after project start-up, VOM, in mid-1978, organized a
demonstration area of 32 ha (Marmule) through the voluntary cooperation of 28
farmers (para 6.02). Plot boundaries were adjusted and aligned and portable
sprinkler irrigation was introduced using equipment provided by VOM. VOM's
agriculturists provided technical assistance to the farmers on matters of
cropping pattern and use of farm inputs. Water use and crop records were also
maintained by the agriculturists. The farmer beneficiaries were very
enthusiastic about the scheme. Its early establishment had a significant
impact on neighboring farmers' acceptance of boundary adjustment and interest
in sprinkler irrigation, which was new to individual farmers in the Metohija



- 20 -
region. Despite the success of Marmule, VOM was unsuccessful in obtaining
farmer cooperation for organizing an experimental area for vegetable
production and mechanization, primarily due to the negative attitude of
farmers in the vegetable growing section of the Metohija region towards land
consolidation. A trial area for study of irrigation methods for vineyards was
informally organized in collaboration with the Agro-Kosovo Kombinat, which
already had vineyards ih production.
Performance of the Bank
6.03     A good rapport existed between the Bank, the Federal and Provincial
Governments, and VOM, including its consultants, throughout project
preparation and implementation. On three occasions, during early project
implementation, the Bank received in Washington, the General Director of VOM,
other officials of VOM and its consulting engineers, primarily for the purpose
of resolving procurement matters. The Bank's guidance was constructive and
well received by VOM, particularly during difficult implementation periods.
6.04     Missions fielded by the Bank were balanced and had the necessary
expertise to provide the level of guidance and supervision necessary for
project implementation; however, Bank supervision probably should have been
more intensive in the first several years of project implementation. Direct
commumication between all parties concerned, as major issues arose requiring
expeditious decisions, undoubtedly would have speeded up project
implementation in the early years. Also, the last supervision took place in
October 1984, two months before loan closing, even though physical
implementation was far from complete, and many issues, such as land
consolidation and cost recovery, were still unresolved. Given the ongoing
relationships through other projects in the Kosovo region, the Bank may
consider providing continued assistance to VOM to help resolve outstanding
issues.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01     The project was well conceived and represents the best technical
solution for providing a reliable source of quality water for domestic and
industrial use and for irrigating small holdings. The project's physical
goals have been achieved, and thl planned infrastructure aimed at removing the
main constraint on agricultural and industrial development and improving
health standards is in place. With proper operation and maintenance, the full
potential benefits of this project will be realized.
Lessons Learned
7.02     The lessons learned from the project can be summarized as follows:
(a) The project was delayed partially because of delays in the
appointment of consultants, leading to delays in the
finalization of project design. Final designs and bid documents
for critical elements of the project should be in an advanced
stage of preparation at the time of Board presentation (paras
3.01-3.06).



- 21 -
(b) Acquisition of land went very smoothly. The 60 farmers whose
land was needed for the site of the reservoir were offered
irrigated land or cash compensation, and all 60 chose cash
compensation (para 3.01).
(c) Boundary adjustment-land consolidation presents difficult legal,
technical and particularly social problems and, therefore, the
Bank should be more cautious and realistic in establishing
implementation schedules when these issues are involved (paras
4.05-4.07).
(d) The issue of recovering operation and maintenance costs,
critical to the sustainability of the project, is not yet
resolved (paras 4.18-4.21). Bank supervision of the project
ended at the loan closing date, well before the scheme became
operational, before the issue of water tariffs became relevant.
The Bank, through its ongoing relationship with other projects
in the Province, may pursue the opportunity to provide VOM
guidance in this critical area.
