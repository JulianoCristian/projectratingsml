The project has a\n            core component enhanced by two small supplementary\n            components: (1) Restructuring services, the main component,\n            comprises a direct credit line of the Ministry of Finance to\n            about 250-270 eligible private enterprises to improve their\n            operations and to obtain new market-based financing. (2) The\n            restructuring promotion component will reinforce the core\n            component by soliciting demand, improving the quality of\n            enterprise sub-projects, supporting a marketing program, and\n            developing targeted short workshops. (3) The market\n            information improvement component will finance the\n            development and dissemination of a database of domestic\n            consulting firms, which will reinforce the core component by\n            facilitating teaming arrangements between foreign and\n            domestic consulting firms and transfers of skills and\n            know-how to domestic firms."}, "docdt": "1997-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
