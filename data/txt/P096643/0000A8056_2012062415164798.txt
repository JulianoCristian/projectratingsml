                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project, throughout its life, has been and still is very relevant to the Government's efforts to advance EU accession and improve the investment climate in Albania. The project
                         has achieved the end-of-project targets (most of it) by the closing date (by the completion of the Implementation Completion and Results Report, the team will be in the position to
                         provide accurate data). The most important achievement relates to the construction of a completely new and modern metrology laboratory, furnishing it with some of the most modern
                         and sophisticated equipment. It is expected to become fully operational in September, after allowing necessary time for the staff to reallocate from the old building to the new one,

                         creating thus the environment for providing EU standards in testing, measurement and calibration. The beneficiary agency - the General Department of Metrology - expects to meet
                         the performance targets for use of calibration services by the business sector and the number of kind of measurements that it is able to provide based on new equipment provided so

                         used in the existing laboratory building the indicator improvement has been gradual and the businesses have benefited from the project results over a period of 2 years). Significant

                         progress has been made in the Inspection reform. With the support of the project the government has a new law on inspection, an established General Inspectorate, and a fully
                         staffed institution. It is highly likely that the project will achieve its objective - the reduction of the number of inspectorates - by June 30, 2012 based on the expected approval of the
                         secondary legislation by the Council of Ministers. The project was responsible for completing the legal and institutional framework of this reform. Looking at how the reform has
                         worked so far, no issues are anticipated issue with meeting of this objective.The project has facilitated stronger Government's mechanisms and policies for systematically assessing
                         and improving the business environment by establishing the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) system. Furthemore, while the project helped design and establish the RIA system
                         in Albania, the further delay in adoption of the Decree instituting the RIA in Albania is undermining the satisfactory results achieved under the first component of project. Even though
                         this is not an outcome indicator, the approval of this Decree within the life of the project would be very good in strengthening the project outcomes.The project has also enhanced and
                         created capacity of the metrology, standards, testing and quality system to deliver EU compatible MSTQ services to meet business sector needs. Staff have been trained for the
                         inspection, RIA, metrology, standards and accreditation.
