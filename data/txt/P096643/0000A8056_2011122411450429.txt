                         The key decisions made by the client and the Bank were to (i) consider a potential extension of the closing date of the project mainly to allow for the completion of the metrology
                         laboratory and the installation of the laboratory equipments, (ii) agree in principle to allocate project funds for new activities to further advance inspection reform, and (iii) closely
                         monitor the progress and the implementation of the revised procurement plan to make sure that the project closes as agreed.
