"Ratings for the Business Environment\n            Reform and Institutional Strengthening (BERIS) Project for\n            Albania were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project design should have taken into\n            consideration the complexity and time in constructing a\n            metrology laboratory, especially in a country, where\n            buildings do not exists. It is recommended that the\n            preparatory work be financed prior to project launch and the\n            Bank team invests more in planning complex project\n            activities with more expertise. Fewer, measurable, and\n            objective monitoring indicators and a well-designed\n            evaluation system will better assess the baselines and\n            subsequently achievement of project outcomes.\n            Well-functioning implementation unit, staffed with competent\n            and committed people and fairly remunerated is essential for\n            a successful implementation of a multi-component and a\n            complex project. The Bank team did not continue to work\n            through most of the project life. This disrupted project\n            continuity and contributed to delays in responding to the\n            changing external environment and to meeting the demands\n            from the Borrower quickly and effectively. It is advisable\n            that project management and supervision activities are\n            planned early and transferred appropriately."}, "docdt": "2013-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
