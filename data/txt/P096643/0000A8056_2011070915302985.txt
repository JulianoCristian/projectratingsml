                         The overall objective of the BERIS is to assist the Government to: (i) facilitate business entry and operations in the formaleconomy; and (ii) strengthen the
                         enterprise sector's capability to increase exports towards the region and EU markets.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to be highly relevant for the Government's efforts to advance EU accession and improve the investment climate in Albania. Under the Facilitating Business
                         Entry and Operation Component, Parliament enacted the new Inspections Law, while the Council of Ministers is expected to adopt a Decree instituting regulatory impact assessment
                         (RIA) in Albania. Under the Strengthening the MSTQ System Component, persistent delays in procurement of metrology equipment and potential difficulties with construction of the
                         new metrology lab could diminish the significant progress made by the beneficiary agencies (METE, GDM, DA, DPS) also affecting the full achievement of project objectives.
