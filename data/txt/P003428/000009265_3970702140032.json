program, the project would modernize\n            facilities at 18 seed production, processing and\n            distribution centers in 12 provinces and two autonomous\n            regions.  It would also strengthen operations of the\n            National Seed Corporation (NSC), the central agency under\n            the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries\n            (MAAF) which is responsible for developing a comprehensive\n            seed quality assurance and control system.  The project\n            would contribute to increased production of high quality\n            seed for major food and cash crops and serve as a model for\n            planned construction over the next two decades of over 300\n            modern seed centers throughout China.  Principal features of\n            the proposed project would be construction of processing and\n            storage facilities, laboratories, offices, and staff housing\n            for the 18 centers; improvement of farm roads and irrigation\n            works at seed center farm sites; and provision of\n            pre-cleaning, drying, processing, testing, analytical and\n            farm equipment.  The project would also include a technical\n            assistance and training component designed to facilitate\n            access by China's seed industry to advanced seed\n            technology, modern quality assurance and control systems,\n            and improved management methods."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
