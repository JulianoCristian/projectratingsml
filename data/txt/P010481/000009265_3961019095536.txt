CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiary:           Punjab Forestry Department
Amount:                Credit: SDR16 million; US$24.87 million equivalent
Terms:                 Standard, with 35 years maturity
Commitment Fee:        0.50°% on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after signing
Project Description:    The main goal of the project is to promote sustainable land use in rural areas of
Punjab by redirecting public sector involvement towards the expansion of agro-forestry
production systems and the rehabilitation of degraded range and scrub land. The
project would inter ulia support the following components:
(a) Institutional Development would include: (i) reviewing the human resources
available to the forest sector by providing technical assistance and training; (ii)
improving the research facilities of the Punjab Forest Research Institute by providing
equipment, training, technical assistance and operating funds; and (iii) strengthening
PFD's capacity to monitor and evaluate sector development under the project.
(b) Farm Forestry Expansion would involve: (i) facilitating the transfer of
technology needed to expand private sector participation in the development of
sustainable supplies of wood and wood products through strengthening the extension
capability of the Forest Department with vehicles, equipment, training, and operating
funds; (ii) facilitating the transfer of information needed to increase smaliholder
participation in wood markets by providing the PFD with facilities, technical assistance
and operating funds; (iii) improving the availability of superior planting material by
providing the Punjab Forest Research Institute (PFRI) with operating funds to
undertake research on seed quality and to establish model nurseries; and (iv)
undertaking adaptive research by providing operating funds to conduct species/variety
trials and improve silviculture practices on farm lands.
(c) Social Range and Scrub Forests Rehabilitation would entail: (i) rehabilitating
and improving about 21,400 ha of range and scrub forests in Pothwar (10,200 ha) and
Thal (11,200 ha); (ii) introducing participatory planning and management systems for
public range and scrub lands through Community Organizations established in about
100 villages clustered around selected public reserves (68 villages in Pothwar, 32 in
Thal); (iii) testing mechanisms for cost recovery to sustain range and scrub
improvement; (iv) providing training and support to Punjab Forest Department staff
and farmers to promote a farmer oriented, participatory approach to range
management; and (v) supporting applied research on fodder trees and shrubs, range
systems ecology, feed quality, and related social and economic themes.

(d) Timber Plantations would cover a pilot component to enhance the positive
environmental conservation role of irrigated timber plantations and to define optimal
technical and organizational plans for the sustainable management of the plantations.
The pilot will involve operations over three plantations representing different
agroecological conditions and its results would be applicable to Punjab's 62
plantations.
Cost and Financing
Plan:                 Total project costs are estimated at US$33.7 million equivalent. Project baseline costs
are US$30.54 million. Physical contingencies account for US$1.94 million and price
contingencies, including the impacts of currency devaluation amount to US$1.27
million. Of the total project cost, US$22.64 million will be for investment and
US$11.11 million for incremental recurrent costs.

Benefits:               The primary benefits of the project include increased rural production, improved
productivity and environmental quality of forest lands, soil conservation measures, on-
farm fodder production, improved public sector efficiency in the forest sector, and
development opportunities for local participation, employment and income. The
investments in farm forestry research, tree improvement and extension are expected to
increase mainly the quality of forest raw materials. The project is expected to have
some dampening effect on environmental degradation in scrub forests, rangelands and
other forest areas through the rehabilitation of wasteland, pasture development and the
demonstration of plantation rehabilitation. The project would reduce grazing pressure
on natural forest areas and enable natural grass and forest cover to re-establish itself
and provide vegetative growth which would improve the resource base in the project
area.
ERR:                    The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project is estimated at 14 percent: ERR of
the farm forestry component is estimated at 14-19 percent; the return to the social
range and scrub forests component is estimated at 12 percent.
Risks:                  For farm forestry the primary risks are: (i) the possibility that the implementation of
the phase-out programs for seedling subsidies and government nurseries might be
delayed, which would mean a continued stimulus of wood supplies that is weakly
attentive to the demand for various types of wood; and (ii) the possibility that the
relatively small base of farm forestry producers at present would destabilize wood
markets and so discourage further on-farm expansion of wood supplies. The project
would address these risks by: (i) obtaining prior government approval of the timed
phase-out programs for subsidies and public sector nurseries (practically all
government interference in the sub-sector would be discontinued in time for mid-term
review and evaluation); (ii) broadening the base of wood producers by directing
applied research and extension activities towards communities where wood markets do
not presently operate well for logistical reasons and where incremental production
would likely be consumed by households; and (iii) contracting a market information
service in the private sector that would assist the planning of wood users and producers
and the development of forward contracts between producers and industrial wood
users. For the range and scrub forests component the primary risk is the reluctance
of PFD staff accepting a resource management approach for this sub-sector that jointly
involves the department, private sector and communities in decision making,
administration and the negotiated sharing of resource benefits. The project will
address this risk by: (i) providing TA for the facilitation of participatory management
of scrub/range land through proven micro-planning processes that ensure benefits to all
stakeholders; and (ii) conducting and implementing the proposed Human Resources
Development study for the sector. Among its outputs, the study should provide an

indicative plan for the deployment of public and non-public resources within the
sector.
Poverty Category:      Program of Targeted Interventions. The project qualifies for inclusion in the PTI since
it would be targeting the poor and the proportion of the poor among project
beneficiaries would likely be larger than their proportion in the overall population. On
the basis of recent poverty studies, about one third of the rural population in Punjab
falls near or below several measurements of the poverty line. Most of these rural poor
are farm households cultivating small areas of land and have not had equal access to
assistance provided by previous farm forestry campaigns, which have generally
benefitted the largest land holders. It is therefore likely that over one third of the
direct beneficiaries of the farm forestry component would come from poor rural
households. In addition, there would be indirect impacts of the project in the form of
additional income and employment that would be generated for small farmers (as well
as for larger landholders) and landless laborers through incremental wood production
for fuel and industry. The expansion in the supply of fuelwood under the project
would discourage the increased substitution of dung cakes, an inferior biomass fuel, for
wood, which, because of the diversion of dung as a manure and soil conditioner would
over time adversely affect farm productivity and profitability. Also, the social range
and scrub forest component, by design, aims to improve the incomes of poor, rural
households reliant on livestock grazing.

1. PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
Proiect Identification
1.01        The Provincial Government of Punjab (GOPunjab) through the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has
requested International Development Association (IDA) assistance in undertaking institutional reforns and
operations in the forest sector that would promote, among other objectives, the protection and extension of the
province's forest resources. Specifically, GOPunjab has expressed interest in comprehensive, sector-wide support
to: (i) undertake policy reform to facilitate private sector participation in wood production and the management
of forest resources; (ii) improve the Forest Department's capabilities in social forestry; (iii) rehabilitate and
increase the sustainable productivity of existing natural and plantation forest resources; and (iv) promote farm
forestry. GOPunjab prepared the present project in collaboration with the Bank Group and with financial support
from the Japanese Government.
Proiect Background
1.02        The project region will range over most of the province of Punjab.
1.03        The farm forestry component will involve scattered sites in both irrigated and baran, (rainfed)
agricultural areas -- but primarily irrigated areas and areas outside Murree, Kahuta and Kotli Sattian --
throughout the province while the component for scrub forests and rangelands will be restricted to the interior of
the Pothwar Plateau and Thai.
1.04        Punjab occupies 20.6 million ha of the upper Indus plain. The plains rise from about 200 m in
the south up to 300 m at the Pothwar Plateau and into the Murree hills in the north. The climate of the province
ranges from arid to semi-arid. Average annual rainfall varies from 100 mm in the southern areas to over 1,500
mm in the northern sub-mountainous tracts and highlands. In most of Punjab the climate is suitable for year-
round cropping, provided that water supply is not a limiting factor.
1.05        Five major rivers traverse the plains, providing irrigation water through an extensive system of
canals. Although the availability of irrigation water in the plain lands is frequently constrained, particularly for
farmers at the lower reaches of canals, it has established Punjab's dominance within the agricultural sector of
Pakistan. About 0.2 million tubewells supplement canal irrigation in some areas or substitute for it in others.
Together about 57 percent of the land in Punjab is cultivated, representing well over half of all agricultural land
in Pakistan.
1.06        Pakistan's population is approximately 126 million and is growing at about 3 percent a year.
Since independence (1947) the population has more than tripled, and by the year 2000 Pakistan will have some
150 million people. More than 45 percent of the population is under 14 years of age.  Nearly 77 percent of the
population lives in the Indus River Valley System and almost 70 percent of the country's population is found in



rural areas. Punjab has more than half of the country's population. Of its projected 68.8 million residents, 46.7
million are rural and 22.1 million urban3!.
II. ISSUES, OBJECTIVES, STRATEGIES
Natural Resource Management Issues
2.01         A critical feature of the problem of natural resource management in Pakistan is that resource
degradation is not caused by a few, large-scale enterprises, but by the unchecked activities of numerous small
cultivators or graziers who, because of their numbers, small land holdings, social independence and isolation, are
difficult to influence. Much of the pressure on forests can be attributed to continuing land clearance for
agriculture, forest encroachment for grazing and expanded pasture and illegal felling of trees for timber.
Although wood needs are met primarily outside forests, indigenous forests are in serious decline. Neither
plantation forestry nor farm forestry would be able to replace biological resources found in them, although they
would be able to provide many of the same products. Indigenous forests will require greater management and
protection even if the entire household sector shifts away from fuelwood use towards modem fuels.
2.02         Forest types in Punjab consist of: (i) natural forests, including conifer, scrub and riverine forests;
and (ii) plantings on farmland and public lands for fuelwood and commercial timber production.
A. Natural Forest Resources
2.03         Conifer Forests. Only 30,000 ha of sparse forest are now left, including the tract enclosing the
hill resort of Murree, where the influx of visitors during summer aggravates the problem of forest over-cutting.
In the upland areas where these forests are generally found, soil erosion, land slides and general ecological
deterioration have set in.
2.04         This small area is the only source of softwood supply within the province. Against the provincial
annual consumption of 0.3 million m3 of softwood, these forests presently have the potential for the sustainable
harvest of only 45,000 m3 a year.
2.05         Scrub Forests and Rangelands . Local agricultural communities depend on the scrub forests and
rangelands for domestic fuel, grass and grazing for their livestock and have rights on parts of the forests for
these uses. Heavy over-grazing has depleted considerable areas of the scrub. At places the vegetation is totally
gone. Misuse and uncontrolled grazing by nomadic graziers have aggravated the situation and have made more
lands barren. The sustainable yield of wood is estimated at only 53,000 m3/year.  Most of the Pothwar Tract, a
large rural area in Punjab which contains scrub forest lands and some of the potentially most productive ranges
in Pakistan, is subject to heavy soil erosion.
2.06         Riverine Forests. These are small scattered floodplain forests, locally called belas, found on the
banks of the Indus, Chenab, Jhelum and Ravi rivers. Originally, these forests were managed to stabilize the river
banks, protect adjoining areas from floods and preserve the floodplain bio-diversity and environment. The
control of water on the upper reaches of these rivers has eroded their utility and engineered their decline. Of the
5 1,000 hectares of riverine forests administered by the Punjab Forest Department (PFD), only 53 percent, are
wooded. The rest are blank, of which only 3,000 ha are plantable. The contribution of riverine forests to flood
protection and wood production is marginal and diminishing. Constituting only 0.13 percent of the total land
1/ Based on 1980 census figures (in thousands) of 34,241 rural residents and 13,053 urban
residents and population growth rates of 2.58* for rural areas and 4.38t for urban areas.
- 2-



area, the forest is too small to be physically and ecologically effective. Also, even if fully forested, the belas
would not become a major source of wood.
B. Plantings
2.07         Timber Plantations. The Government-owned and managed timber plantations were initially set up
to supply fuelwood for the railways. Previously the management of these areas aimed at the production of high
quality commercial timber as well as fuelwood as a by-product. About 142,000 ha out of a total of 285,000 ha
of plantations have access to residual supplies of irrigation water for the initial period of the forest rotation. Out
of this area, 79,000 ha actually support a tree crop; 63,000 ha are treeless. Of the treeless area, 49,000 ha are
unplantable; the remaining 14,000 ha might be salvageable with reforestation.
2.08         Farm Trees. Punjab has about 12 million ha of farmlands, which is more than the combined
farmland area of all other provinces. Over the past decade, the trees planted on or bordering these lands have
become a prominent source of wood for the province. According to a farm forestry survey carried out by the
Forest Sector Master Plan (FSMP), on average 17.7 trees are growing per hectare of farmlands in the Punjab.
Assuming a tree density of 700/ha, the total area under farmland trees would be equivalent to some 306,000 ha
of block plantations with an estimated annual growth of 5,200,000 m3. At this scale farm production would
provide more than one-third of the total current wood requirement and five times the combined potential wood
supply from all other sources in Punjab.
Institutional Issues
A. Legislation
2.09         Numerous laws and regulations exist to govern the public and non-public forest sector, all of
which essentially emanate from a basic code promulgated over a century ago. The 1927 Forestry Act, which
replaced the Indian Forestry Act of 1878, defined permanent public forest reserves in Punjab, prescribed penalties
and framed the police role of the Forest Department. The fundamental approach of the legislation is
administrative and there is considerable debate over whether such acts have actually facilitated forest
exploitation. The legislation contributes little to the development of forestry in the private sector and does not
provide for popular participation in the formulation of policy or in the investment planning for or the
management of forests, rangelands and watersheds. According to the FSMP recommendations, the Forest Act
should eventually be repealed and replaced with legislation that reflects modern, sound environmental
management.
B. General Planning and Operations of the Puniab Forest Department
2.10         In the forest sector the Punjab Forest Department (PFD) is accountable for the technical
management of forests, the execution of development projects and the administration of rights related to the
sector. The plans for its operations in reforestation and range rehabilitation are generally set out in standardized
documents (PC-l's) which function as a control mechanism for the spending of funds, and which are extremely
inflexible in use. The measurement of success is judged solely by the fulfillment of the plan targets, regardless
of the true environmental, economic or social impacts. In practice, plans are rarely subsequently adjusted to
changing local conditions; moreover, PFD staff are reluctant to consider cost sharing arrangements or self-help
activities by villagers because these situations endanger control over work and potential departures from officially
sanctioned expenditures. The findings of the institutional review undertaken during project preparation agreed
with the FSMP in highlighting a number of institutional weaknesses in the forest sector: (i) lack of continuity
between policy formulation and implementation; (ii) dearth of useful data (on resources, use, etc.) for planning
purposes; (iii) weak capabilities in planning, monitoring and evaluation; (iv) mismanagement of human resources
due to political interference, low morale and inadequate training; (v) public-sector orientation of forest
- 3 -



department staff with limited experience or interest in community and private sector participation; (vi)
insufficient research support; and (vii) inadequate finances.
C. Natural Forest Management
2.11         Scrub Forests and Rangelands. There are many provincial and federal agencies that have range
and scrub land management interests as part of their mandates.  The complexity inherent in range and scrub
forest management is compounded by the segregation of responsibility for livestock management, animal
husbandry, veterinary medicine, etc., among a wide array of government agencies. This has resulted in partial
attempts at range and scrub forest development by many separate (and non-communicating) departments and a
confusion of recommendations and policies that are frequently at cross purposes with one another.
2.12         In Punjab a degree of specialization exists within the PFD with the presence of a Range
Management Circle that is headed by a Conservator of Forests who is trained in range management. This CF
has the responsibility of supervising and supporting the work of all staff assigned to range management tasks
within the PFD. Most of the Range Management Circle support staff members are, however, either junior or
non-professional. The training that they receive allows them to carry out instructions, but not to act as advisors
or on their own initiative. Range management science is also not considered to be a viable career path within
the PFD. Consequently, the number of PFD staff having advanced training or specialization in range
management is very limited and range science as a profession is not highly regarded.
D. Plantings
2.13         Irrigated Timber Plantations. The current yield of about 2.8 m'/ha per year is low; although,
according to FSMP estimates, the plantations can yield 3 to 4 times the current production. The major
constraints bearing on the inefficient performance of the timber plantations in the public sector are: (i) poor
management and supervision; (ii) inadequate water supplies; (iii) deteriorating irrigation systems and waste of
water; (iv) deteriorating site conditions due to waterlogging and salinity; (v) lack of skilled staff at lower levels;
(vi) poor logging, inventory and grading system; and (vii) inadequate operating funds. These constraints are as
much managerial and administrative as technical.
2.14         Farm Plantings.  Recent progress in the adoption of farm forestry has been significant and was
fueled in part by incentives given to farmers in the form of subsidized seedlings and the guaranteed procurement
of privately produced seedlings by the PFD. The progress, however, has come at the cost of economic efficiency
and equity as the government's interventions have inhibited the development of broad-based private sector
participation. A recent survey, for example, showed that two-thirds of those households who planted trees in
1990/91 planted on average fewer than four and accounted for only one-twentieth of total plantings; whereas just
over 1 percent of those who planted accounted for over half of the trees planted. This would imply these trees
were, for the most part, planted on the largest land holdings4'. The narrow base of participation introduces the
risk that wood supplies and prices could swing widely on the economic decisions made by relatively few
farmers. The possibility of this happening is not trivial as the HESS survey estimates that most of trees are now
almost certainly being planted on agricultural or marginally productive agricultural lands. Changes in
government agricultural policies that affect the profitability of cropping would undoubtedly have some bearing
on whether these past investments continue. The statistics moreover raise the question whether the government's
subsidized distribution of seedlings is fair: those who benefit more from the subsidies are those having the best
means to pay.

2.15         Also, farmers undertook most of these plantings in anticipation of the development of marketing
channels to timber industries. Given the massive tree planting encouraged by government campaigns, it is
uncertain whether these local markets will be as extensive as would be required when the rotations are complete.
Credit markets in Pakistan for medium- to long-term industrial investments, particularly among wood-based
industries, are very thin. Apart from the problems of securing financing, the private sector is also likely to
contend with regulation and to face some technical difficulties related to the siting of new industries and the
logistics of collecting raw material.
Insufficient Community Participation
2.16         Symptomatic of the present approach of the PFD is the near absence of communication between
villages and the Department, especially where range management is concerned. Part of this may be attributed to
the requirement of officers to adhere to purely target-oriented work plans, which allow little scope, time or
incentive to involving villagers in forestry or range management activities.
2.17         Given the limited technical manpower available in the range management sector, the focus of
much of PFD's effort has been upon the planning, preparation and execution of range rehabilitation schemes on
public lands. There has been little or no effort focused on participatory strategies and methods. Where the PFD
does operate, the efforts undertaken to rehabilitate rangelands are not aimed at the overall management of the
areas per se, except when weakly enforced control of stocking rates are periodically imposed.
Technical Issues
2.18         Planting Stock. The quality of planting stock is consistently poor in Pakistan. This results in
lower productivity, uneven tree development, and increased weeding and maintenance costs. Most importantly,
poor quality of planting stock is causing very high rates of tree loss after planting. In farm forestry projects of
Jhelum and Attock regions of Punjab, average tree survival rates are below 40 percent. The provision of better
planting stock is one of the principal technical needs of the sector. Improving the planting stock will need to
consider two factors: better seeds selection and improved nursery operations. At present, PFD has limited
capacity to collaborate with the existing seed banks or to assist farmers in the proper selection and collection of
seeds. The calibre of nursery operations is also invariably low in both PFD and private nurseries.
2.19         Pastoral Use of Scrub Forests and Rangelands. One of the chief concerns regarding the use of
common property resources is the need to enhance the on-farm delivery of technical support to facilitate the
proper feeding, herd management and marketing of livestock and livestock products. These steps would
encourage an intensification of livestock production as a means of increasing income from the activity rather than
through an expansion of herd size and the extension of grazing.
2.20         Forestry Research. Nationally, the Pakistan Forest Institute (Peshawar) is the principal research
institution on forestry and range management. PFI has a number of research projects in the provinces and
collaborates with other research institutions such as the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC). GOP's
strategy is to retain the central role for PFI while promoting linkages with provincial research centers. Punjab is
one of the provinces (with Sindh, and AJK) that has a provincial research entity -- the Punjab Forestry Research
Institute (PFRI) located near Faisalabad in Gutwala. Established in 1982. PFRI is a relatively young institution.
2.21         A needs assessment for overall forestry research development in Punjab should be an integral part
of the general assessment of human resources development in PFD. Such a study would ensure that the available
resources for research are used efficiently. In the meantime, efforts in the areas of emphasis should be
streamlined and strengthened and a greater share of resources should be allocated to research on seed technology,
nursery practices, tree management and participatory management systems in the scrub forests and rangelands.

Policy Issues
2.22          Seedling Subsidies. The current policy of large-scale seedling subsidization for farmers is fiscally
wasteful, inhibits the provision of quality nursery stock from the private sector and discourages the operation of a
market-oriented response by farmers to demands for short-rotation timber and fuelwood. HESS surveys indicate
that farmers have been planting trees mainly for the production of timber for sale. The production of fuelwood,
however, is a primary by-product of this activity, and so long as farmers perceive financial incentives in the
production of timber, the production of fuelwood benefits as well. The government's policy of supplying
seedlings to farmers at subsidized rates produced an unhelpful market distortion and diverted resources from
areas where the government, more than the private sector, could have usefully played a role in promoting farm
forestry.
2.23          Transport Taxes and Regulations. Although the system of wood trading and transport appears to
be competitive and efficient overall in Pakistan. the system of transit taxes encumbers the marketing of wood and
wood products. Transit taxes and other restrictions applied to hauling wood products show considerable variation
depending upon location. For traders in Punjab, overall transit taxes on average take up the same share as about
half the total en route cost, which could be considered a rather high tax burden for a non-manufactured good.
The tax structure appears to be poorly understood by transporters and is subject to widespread abuse. A well-
publicized simplification and standardization of the system of transit taxes and regulations should bolster
incentives to tree growing and efficient marketing.
National Conservation Strategy and Its Implications for Punjab
2.24          Historically, the forest resources in the areas now constituting Pakistan, may never have been
very extensive, and there are presently few scientific criteria that can define a specific magnitude of increase in
the forested area as an objective for forest management in Pakistan. Assigning a specific objective for
reforestation is not essential for the definition of a workable strategy for the protection of existing forest
resources.
2.25          The NCS prescribes a two-pronged approach for forests: protection of existing resources while
expanding the supply of wood (for timber, fuel and feed) from farmland. Within the Bank's regional
environmental and forestry strategies, Pakistan is identified as a forest-deficit country where significant
improvements are needed at the institutional level to allow for participatory protection and use of forest
resources. Other areas of emphasis include land tenure and reforestation efforts.
Bank Group Assistance Strategy
2.26          The country assistance strategy for Pakistan focuses on two closely linked development goals:
poverty reduction and the easing of constraints to sustained growth. To address the poverty reduction objective,
the Bank Group's approach stresses the improvement of inadequate basic services and weak social indicators. To
support the growth objective, Bank efforts include: structural reform --with and emphasis on public finance
issues and improving the enabling environment for the private sector; removal of constraints on agricultural
productivity; and protection of Pakistan's natural resource base. In the forest sector, application of this strategy
would require progress on the following priority issues: (i) expansion of the role of the private sector in market-
driven subsectors such as nurseries, farm forestry, and plantations; (ii) reorientation of government operations to
support this private sector role through appropriate policies, regulations, community extension, research and
training; and (iii) increasing the role of users in the management of natural resources.

2.27         The Bank Group has already supported projects in several sectors with components to improve the
environment or to rehabilitate and develop natural resources. In agriculture the Bank Group projects have
focused on correcting waterlogging and soil salinity arising from inadequate irrigation drainage and on reversing
deforestation and depasturing on watersheds and rangelands5'. The Bank has also been the executing agency for
a series of projects-' to repair environmental damage ensuing from the temporary settlement of large numbers of
Afghan refugees. In the energy sector, Bank Group projects have focused on strengthening energy production
and distribution institutions; rationalizing local energy prices and the price structure for different consumers, with
regard to international energy prices; introducing energy conservation technology; introducing emission standards
for the release of pollutants into Pakistan's air and water; and requiring environmental impact assessment (EIA)
procedures to be undertaken before investing in energy producing activities. The Second Energy Loan (Ln.
3107-PAK) is the main project with environmental protection components.
2.28         The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the Bank, and other bilateral and
multilateral agencies are assisting GOP and the provinces to implement an environmental action plan based for
Pakistan based on the country's National Conservation Strategy (NCS). Associated with this assistance, the Bank
is supporting the Environmental Protection and Resource Conservation Project (Cr. 2383-PAK), and the
Balochistan Natural Resource Management Project (Cr. 2548-PAK) which are initiating actions, at the federal
level and in Punjab, Sindh, NWFP, AJK and Balochistan: to develop institutions responsible for the environment
and natural resource management, to formulate policies and legislation, to undertake field operations; to address
specific problems of land degradation; and, to conduct public education of the environment.
Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
2.29         The present project will form part of the implementation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-
supported Forest Sector Master Plan (FSMP) of Pakistan and NCS, the aims of which are broadly endorsed by
IDA. The project would also be compatible with the Bank Group's emerging strategy of comprehensive resource
management in Pakistan with its emphasis on site rehabilitation, institutional strengthening, education, training
and community participation. The project should, moreover, contribute to the alleviation of rural poverty. The
involvement of IDA will contribute significantly to the solving of problems of policy formulation and
implementation and in facilitating the coordination of a number of donors operating in the sector. In particular,
IDA's close coordination with the Asian Development Bank on the approach to the sector will foster the first
instance of a comprehensive donor strategy for forest sector development in Pakistan.
2.30         This strategy for forest sector development is consistent with the overall country strategy for
natural resources conservation and with Pakistan's National Conservation Strategy. It aims at increasing and
maintaining the sustainable productivity of forest resources through: (i) expanding the role of the private sector
in agroforestry, seedling production and forest resources use; (ii) reorienting government operations to support
this private sector role through appropriate regulation, community extension, research and training; and (iii)
increasing the role of users in the management of natural resources.

III. THE PROJECT
Proiect Obiective and Scope
3.01         The objective of the project is to improve the performance of the forestry sector in Punjab,
entailing the natural, financial and human resources operating in the sector. The impact of this improvement will
be an abatement in the deterioration in quantity and quality of the forest sector's sustainable contribution to the
welfare of rural and urban households in Punjab. Harvests of wood and other products for energy or for other
direct consumption by households, or for the development of wood-based industries that generate employment
and value added will be one form of contribution. Another may also take the form of a consumer surplus
realized in providing marketed wood energy less expensively. Other contributions will be environmental,
affecting incomes, for example, by reducing potential losses in agricultural productivity owing to the external
effects of certain land uses; influencing health; providing amenities; yielding recreational value; or providing
other intangible natural conservation benefits.
3.02         Characterizing the scope of operations, the main concerns of the project's intervention in the
sector are to:
(a)   improve the incentive framework governing the use of resources;
(b)   improve silvicultural productivity; and
(c)   improve development planning and the setting of resource management priorities.
Improving the incentive framework will encompass the decision making regarding investments in and use of
private, common and public property resources. Improving silvicultural productivity would include improving
planting materials, husbandry practices and the conduct of research. Improving development planning and the
setting of priorities will chiefly concern the collection and use of information on resources, and the provision of
environmental services.
3.03         The chief outcomes or goals of the project will include:
(a)    conditions that would encourage a broadening of the productive base of wood (for use as
an industrial raw material and as a fuel) supplied from farm land in terms of both numbers
of farms participating and quantities of wood produced per farm;
(b)    demonstrations of scrub forests rangeland and plantations rehabilitation and management
that maintain the availability of common benefits and forestall the deterioration of
resources through open access and the exploitative behavior of local populations and the
private sector; and
(c)   strengthened local public and community institutions managing the sector in Punjab.

(d)    implementing a pilot management and rehabilitation plan for three representative
plantations of Punjab's agroecological zones.
Detailed Features
Sector Activities
3.05          Human Resources Development. One of the main priorities for overall sector development is the
initiation of a comprehensive program of human resources development. This program would aim to foster
public/private interactions in the sector and to improve the efficiency of public sector services that facilitate
overall forest sector development without crowding out private sector roles. The first step in this direction will
be an in-depth study of human resources in the sector. GOPunjab has already agreed to the objectives of the
study and will implement the study as a priority task among the start-up activities of the project's launch.
Results of this study will be available by the end of first year of project implementation and will guide overall
institutional reform including, in particular: (i) implementation mechanisms for forest sector activities; (ii) the
strengthening and streamlining of PFD research; and (iii) the promotion of public/private interaction in fostering
demand for farm forestry products. Following up the HRD study, the project will provide funds to finance the
preparation of future projects in the sector based on the study's results and recommendations.
3.06          Research. The project will strengthen PFRI's human resources and facilities in areas directly
concerning this project, but primarily in the area of farm forestry, which is discussed further below. GOPunjab
will allocate funds to meet the specific research objectives of the project including the areas of planting stock
improvement, agroforestry technology and participatory rangeland rehabilitation. The development of this
research support program will take into account the research activities of PFI and other research institutes.
Another area of research will consider the environmental aspects of the public sector timber plantations and is
covered under the pilot component on plantations.
Farm Forestry
3.07          Objectives. The first objective of the farm forestry component is to encourage the farming
community to provide its own seedlings on a sustainable basis by the fifth year of the project. The PFD will
accordingly phase out its own farm forestry seedling production over the same period. Ideally, at the end of the
- 10 -



project farmers will have completely assumed all production aspects of farm forestry. The PFD would provide
seed, technical assistance, research and training to help ensure sustainability. In the past PFD's main objective
was to increase the numbers of trees planted by farmers using, for the most part, seedlings produced by the PFD.
The numbers planted were impressive, but survival percentages and tree quality were poor. The second objective
under this component is therefore for the PFD to increase its efforts to help the farmer improve the quality of
trees grown. The third objective is to help the farmer find profitable markets for the final products. These last
two steps will assist the farmer to maximize the net returns on his/her investment. The project will give high
priority to treating unproductive degraded/marginal lands and to encouraging a shift in emphasis towards
production by smaliholders.
3.08          Activities. Project activities will fall under three major headings: tree establishment, tree
management and marketing. The PFD, while maintaining a comparative advantage in research and extension on
tree establishment, will substantially increase its provision of technical assistance to farmers in tree management
and marketing.
3.09          Tree Establishment will involve introducing: (a) improved seed quality and quantity; (b) a wider
choice in species and varieties; (c) better seedlings through improved nursery practice; (d) better planting
techniques and spacing; (e) fertilizer application in the nurseries and at the time of planting; (f) development of
improved agroforestry practices; and (g) improved weeding and beating-up practices. Aiming to improve
seedling quality, species choice and establishment percentages, these tasks will require the coordinated efforts of
the Farm Forestry Wing (FFW) and PFRI.
3.10          Tree Management will undertake the introduction of: (a) appropriate watering practices; (b)
improved pruning schedules; (c) improved thinning schedules; and (d) determining optimum rotation ages. The
objective is to improve cultural practices to enhance significantly tree volume, quality and marketability. FFW,
PFRI and the PFD forest training schools will undertake these initiatives.
3.11          Marketing Intelligence will comprise: (a) introducing a log grading system based on measurements
that can be made by the farmer; (b) improving harvesting (felling, bucking, logging) practices; (c) improving
linkages between the producer (farmer) and the user (industry); (d) creating a data base; and (e) developing a
marketing strategy. The project will finance the purchase of private sector expertise and marketing services to
undertake these tasks with assistance from the PFD. Project financing will also support the contracting of private
sector services to provide periodic assessments of current marketing prospects and trends for various raw
materials and to produce information on wood purchase contracts and prices for regular dissemination by radio or
through other suitable mass media.
3.12          Phasing Out of PFD Nurseries. There are some 700 PFD nurseries currently providing farm
forestry seedlings requirements. These will be phased out by year 5 and replaced by over 1,000 farmer nurseries,
which are expected to be established by the same year. The project anticipates the following phasing of
nurseries:
Table 3.1 Phasing Out of PFD Nurseries
Number of Nurseries
Year     0          1          2          3         4          5          6
PFD             700       560        280        210        140        0          0

Numbers for the PFD are firm but only indicative for the private farmer nurseries (FF), assuming an average of
three per Markaz.

3.13          Targeting of Extension Activities. Although generally all farmers will have access to the
informational services of the project, extension activities will be organized primarily around groups of farmers
who hold each arable holdings of land of five hectares or less to broaden the production base of farm forestry.
These farmers, who form the largest percentage of cultivators, are greatly under-represented among participants
of previous farm forestry campaigns. As a group, these farmers constitute much of the rural poor in Punjab.
Moreover, the delivery of seedling subsidies will be directed towards those farming communities where average
household income are below the median income for the province, where farm tree planting is an unfamiliar
practice and where wood would be produced primarily for home consumption as fuel.
3.14          Implementation Arrangements. The delivery system will pattern the provincial civil administrative
structure, rather than the PFD's, to provide better coordination with other line departments, facilitate monitoring
and ensure even extension coverage throughout Punjab. One extension forester (Forester or Forest Guard) will
be posted to each of the 354 Markazs (there are on average 66 villages per Markaz). One Forest Ranger will
supervise the Extension Foresters in two Tehsils and there will be an SDFO to supervise Forest Rangers in each
of the 34 Districts. A DFO will be posted to each Divisional HQ. Three Conservators of Forests (CF) one each
at Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan will provide the overall supervision required to implement this component.
Heading the Farm Forestry Wing and Scrub/Rangeland conservancy will be the CCF(PD) stationed in Lahore.
Professional staff requirements will be as follows:

The project will finance these incremental staff: 58 professional, 70 technical staff, including drivers, and 162
support staff.  PFD will provide the remaining technical staff requirements through transfers. By the end of the
project, the PFD will absorb all technical staff below the level of CF, except for 34 Forest Rangers who will
remain at the Tehsil level to ensure continued farmer access to technical assistance. The CCF(PD) and two CF
posts will then discontinue, leaving one CF at the center.
3.15          Delivery Mechanisms for Seedling Subsidies. In its tree-planting campaigns PFD has provided
seedlings to farmers virtually free of cost. Under this project, the subsidy will be phased out over four years:
75% in year 1, 60% in year 2, 40% in year 3, 25% in year 4 and 0 in years 5 and 6. Under the current system,
when the farmer collects his/her seedlings from the private nurseryman, payment of the non subsidy element is
made (e.g., in year I of the project this would be 25% of Rs 1.75 or about Rs 0.44 per seedling). The
nurseryman is not paid the balance or subsidy element (in this case Rs. 1.31 per seedling) until the number of
seedlings actually planted by all the farmers obtaining seedlings from his/her nursery has been verified in the
field by a forest officer. Delays in the final payment (crossed check) to the nurseryman, by the DFO or his
- 12 -



designate, sometimes run into months. It is the nurseryman who is penalized if the seedlings are not planted, not
the fanner. The present project will intervene to simplify the process. One approach would be for a forest
officer to make payment (of the subsidy element) once he has verified that the nursery contains the contracted
number of quality seedlings of the correct species. As before, the farmer would pay the non-subsidy element on
collection of the seedlings. This would ensure prompt payment to the nurseryman and a reduction in the number
of PFD staff involved in the process. The project will use sampling techniques to determine the number of
seedlings planted. IDA and GOPunjab agreed that IDA funds would not be used for seedling subsidies. PFD
informed IDA that these subsidies will be covered by the Punjab Finance Department until the total elimination
of the subsidies (year 4 of the project).
3.16          Training. Critical to the success of the farm forestry component will be the training of territorial
forest guards, foresters, forest rangers and SDFO/DFO's in extension methods. PFD will undertake a crash
program before credit effectiveness using retroactive financing to train 200 foresters/FG's for two weeks, 40
SDFO/forest rangers for one week and 13 DFO/CF's for one week. The project will also finance under
retroactive financing before the project's launch training some 50 farmers in nursery and tree management
practices. PFD will run local training and refresher courses thereafter at both Forest Training Schools (Gora Gali
and Bahawalapur) and at PFRI for all technical staff and selected farmers. Some 1,350 staff and farmers will
have received in-service training by the time of the project's completion. The project will finance overseas study
tours (II senior officers for three weeks each) and short courses (12 weeks to a year for 37 DFO/SDFOs and
scientists from PFRI). These tours/study courses, to be conducted in countries with similar conditions will center
on farm forestry needs. Participants will be expected to produce comprehensive reports reviewing lessons
learned and their relevance to Punjab. The project will provide three PhD fellowships for PFRI staff covering
tissue culture, forest genetics and silvicultural practices on farmland.
3.17          Farm Forestry Research.  The two top priority areas for farm forestry research are the
improvement in seed quality/quantity (collection, processing, storage, etc.) and the improvement of nursery
practices. In addition, species/variety trials, improvement in cultural practices and dissemination of research
findings and farmer production should increase dramatically. The project will strengthen PFRI by financing
equipment, buildings, incremental staff (two Additional Directors, three Senior Research Officers, four Research
Officers, one Superintendent, one staff nurse and 56 support and technical staff) vehicles and technical assistance.
PFRI's Program Committee, which usually meets once a year to guide research priorities, will be reconstituted to
include a farmer representative from each territorial zone.
3.18          Technical Assistance in Farm Forestry. The project will finance consultancies covering the
following areas of farm forestry training and technology transfer: nursery techniques, extension and marketing.
Each consultant will be engaged for 6 months in the first year and a month each in years 2 and 3. In farm
forestry research, the project will finance a total of 24 staff months of technical assistance for improving seed
quality and quantity and for improving nursery practices. (See Technical Assistance Summary, Annex 3 Table
13; and Terms of Reference, Annex 4).
3.19          Taxes and Permits. Current tree cutting permits and transit taxes discourage planting by farmers.
PFD will abolish these permnits and transit taxes for all farm forestry trees except for Acacia modesta in all areas
and for trees within an 8-km belt along national boundaries. PFD agreed to contact local authorities to repeal the
octroi charges on farm forestry products, which penalize marketing between districts.

Social Range and Scrub Forest Management
3.20         Working with communities lying adjacent to reserve range and scrub forest areas in selected tracts
of Pothwar and Thal, the project will initiate a pilot program of range management that aims to involve
stakeholders in the protection, management and utilization of resources. The project will support the
rehabilitation of degraded communal land and the promotion of fodder crops on private land. During project
implementation PFD and IDA will assess the feasibility of applying lessons learned from this component to
range/scrub areas outside of Pothwar and Thal.
3.21        The establishment of participatory management over selected scrub forests and range lands will
involve the following three processes:
(a)   the formation of Community Organizations (COs):
(b)   the preparation of microplans defining improved land use and management through participatory
planning; and
(c)   the sanctioning and implementing of formal agreements between communities and the Forest
Department.
3.22         Formation of Community Organizations. Following the selection of priority reserves and a
preliminary screening of villages, the project will invite communities where a majority of members wish to
participate to form COs. The COs will have a formal constitution and membership will be open to all members
of the community, both men and women. In some instances existing village organizations, for example, those set
up through the activities of NGOs, could form the basis for a CO.
3.23         Participatory Micro-Planning. The implementation of the component will use participatory
methods to define the resource use and priority needs of enlisted communities, concentrating particularly on those
uses and needs that impact range and scrub forest resources on public and communal land. The COs, working
with project personnel, will define alternative strategies for the use of these resources within the constraints of
technical options and their needs and priorities. The strategy would likely include pasture improvement,
afforestation with multipurpose trees, rehabilitation of degraded land, and the planting of fodder trees and crops
on private land (see physical treatments below). The micro-plan would also lay down grazing plans and
regulation for the protection and management of improved rangeland and scrub forest.
3.24         Joint Management Agreements. The micro-planning process will lead to a formal agreement
between the COs and the Forest Department defining the terms of participation in joint management of the
range/scrub forest area. The agreement will link the community to the management of a defined area of the
public reserve, specifying management treatments, protection measures, arrangements for sharing products,
sanctions, and conflict resolution procedures. The DFO will approve joint management agreements.
Physical Treatments
3.25         The technical options on offer during the participatory planning process will depend upon local
conditions and priorities. The following is a listing of a number of anticipated interventions with estimates of
the scale of their application.
3.26         Pasture Establishment on Public and Communal Lands. The project would establish improved
pasture on public land (Reserve Forest) in Pothwar and Thal and, where available, on community (shamlat) land
in Pothwar. The establishment would involve selective uprooting of undesirable plants, land levelling, plowing,
- 14 -



and seeding, followed by protection for one year. About 5,100 ha in Pothwar and 8,000 ha in Thal would
receive this treatment together with approximately 500 ha of private lands.
3.27         Afforestation in Scrub Forests. The project will plant multipurpose tree and shrub seedlings,
raised in local nurseries, on public land in the scrub forest areas of both Thal and Pothwar (where available,
communal land in Pothwar would also be treated). Tree establishment would follow land preparation. and, in
Pothwar be accompanied by soil and water conservation measures. The establishment phase in Thal would likely
require watering. Lands undergoing this treatment may in total amount to about 5,100 ha in Pothwar and 3,200
ha in Thal.
3.28         Improved Range and Pasture Management. The project will introduce rotational and deferred
grazing systems on both improved pastures and untreated public lands in consultation with COs under the
technical guidance of the FD. The COs will subsequently regulate the use of these areas, which are expected to
total as much as 10,200 ha in Pothwar and 8,000 ha in Thal.
3.29         Development of Water Points. Where the groundwater is deep in Pothwar the project will assist
in the construction of mini-dams to create ponds on public land for the watering of livestock. In Thal, the
project will help install hand pumps at selected sites. In total, the project proposes the placement of 30 water
points in Pothwar and 20 handpumps in Thal.
3.30         Fodder on Private Land. To reduce livestock pressure on public land and to supplement fodder
during the winter deficit period, the project will encourage farmers to cultivate fodder crops on private land. As
part of this effort the project will provide seed of improved varieties of fodder crops (oats. vetches, sorghum and
maize) to introduce production on 400-500 ha. The project will also promote the cultivation of fodder trees
through the farm forestry component of the project.
3.31         The project will target in total the forming of 100 COs over the project life, 68 in Pothwar and 32
in Thal. The following table summarizes the expected average areas to be treated per community in Pothwar and
Thal.
Table 3.3 Participation of Community Organizations

Additional Management (ha)                              150         300
In total. the 100 COs would participate in the improvement and joint management of about 39,600 ha of public
and communal range land and scrub forests.
3.32         Table 3.4 presents the expected phasing of CO formation under the project. These initial targets
are relatively modest to allow for close monitoring of progress.

Selection Criteria and Planning Methods
3.33         The project will finance an Initiation and Site Selection Study at the start of the project to identify
and select reserves for the introduction of participatory management. The study will assess current land use and
potential, as well as the expressed needs of adjoining communities and their willingness to participate in the
project (see Terms of Reference, Annex 4). Criteria for site selection will be both physical and socio-economic,
and will include the willingness of surrounding villages to participate.
3.34         In implementing participatory management, the project will adopt a cluster approach, through
which groups of villages around the same reserve would develop joint management plans in concert. The
objective of this strategy would be to handle management units in an integral and coordinated fashion, and to
consider concurrently the interests of neighboring villages. This would represent a departure from current PFD
practice, whereby planning is executed on a compartment by compartment basis without reference to neighboring
communities.
Terms of Participation
3.35         The project will finance the direct costs of range and scrub forest improvement. Through the
participatory planning process, COs will be jointly involved in decision making regarding which physical
treatments and proposed grazing systems to adopt. Joint management agreements will define COs responsibilities
for the protection of improved and rehabilitated areas and for the enforcement of agreed grazing systems.
3.36         CO members will also be entitled to free fuelwood during thinning of afforested areas and to a
share of the final yield. Grazing access and grass cutting will be available to community members on payment
of the regular per animal grazing fee. In addition, the COs will receive for a time a watch and ward fee,
equivalent to the wages of one guard per 150 hectares of treated land (approximately one guard per CO).
3.37         Cost recovery. Early in the implementation, the project will develop and test mechanisms to
mobilize funds from within the community for continuing investment in range land and scrub forest
improvement. This might take the form of a fund under the control of the CO into which members would make
contributions. The initiation and site selection study will examine candidate mechanisms for cost recovery taking
into account existing rights of access to reserves.
Implementation Arrangements
3.38         Existing PFD staff from the Range Management and Rawalpindi Circles, under their respective
Conservators of Forests, will implement the component; however, over the course of the implementation the
project will provide financing on a declining basis for one draftsman and 18 technical and support staff to aid the
expansion of the work program in the two target areas. The professional staff implementing this component will
- 16 -



report to the Chief Conservator of Forests (Project Director), Lahore. By the end of the project professional staff
will return to their regular postings and contracts for other support and technical staff would be completed.
3.39         Two specially trained spearhead teams will assist and train PFD field staff in the processes of
forming Community Organizations, participatory planning, and formulating joint agreements. Each spearhead
team will consist of three Forest Department staff (a DFO, an SDFO, and a Forest Ranger) and two resource
persons. The project will recruit resource persons with skills in participatory appraisal and planning techniques
from universities, research institutes, and NGOs specializing in training in participatory work. Of the two
resource persons on each team, one will be a specialist in institution building and community development, and
the other in livestock and rangeland management. Spearhead teams will in all cases work alongside local FD
field staff, who will take responsibility for continuing SRSFM work in communities.
Training and Reorientation
3.40         Success in participatory management will depend upon a reorientation of PFD staff towards
providing a client-centered, flexible and responsive service. This will require training in participatory planning,
institutional building, and technical and training skills. The project will provide training for the two spearhead
teams, FD field staff, and farmers. The training program will draw upon the staff and facilities of the Punjab
Forest Research Institute, the Department of Rural Sociology of the University of Agriculture at Faisalabad, and
NGOs experienced in training in participation such as the South Asia Partnership and the Association for the
Development of Human Resources. Provision is also made for workshops, study tours and overseas training.
Studies and Research
3.41         The project will undertake a site selection study in the first year of the project. This would
identify priority reserves according to their ecology, biological potential, current patterns of land use, and
potential for involving adjoining communities in improved range management (see Terms of Reference, Annex
4).
3.42         An external evaluation of the component, assessing the progress and impact of the participatory
approach to land management, will take place in year 3 as part of the project's mid-term review. This study will
examine the extent to which SRSFM activities have been successful in meeting their objectives, especially with
respect to attempts to build effective and sustainable institutions; and make recommendations as to the
continuation of the component (see Terms of Reference, Annex 4).
3.43         Research themes will include:
- Introduction trials of grasses, shrubs, and trees;
- Establishment of exclosures for ecological studies;
- Range conditions and trend;
- Rotational and deferred grazing systems; and
- Economic analysis.
- 17 -



Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements
3.44         Monitoring and evaluation will be particularly critical to this component given its innovatory
nature, and the importance of adopting a learning stance towards participating communities. Feedback from
participants will be essential in ensuring that strategies can be adjusted in a timely manner so as to meet agreed
objectives. In addition to conventional financial and physical monitoring criteria, the project will develop social,
institutional and attitudinal indicators with support from technical assistance. These will nevertheless be as
simple and standardized as possible, and designed to meet management needs. Suggested indicators are included
in Annex 3. The PFD Monitoring Unit will compile collected data. The project will actively involve COs in
moniitorinig through the selection of verifiable indicators of physical. social and economic impact and the
collection of data. As noted above, an external evaluation of the SRSFM component will occur in year 3.
Technical Assistance
3.45         The project will provide 12 staff months of internationally recruited TA for human ecology in
range management (to help address issues defining the role of local participation and pastoral institutions), 6
moniths of internationally recruited TA for research on traditional and adapted grazing systems, and 18 staff
monithis of local consultancy training in participatory resource planning. Locally recruited resource persons will
support spearhead teams in participatory planning activities (See Technical Assistance Summary, Annex 3 Table
13; and Terms of Reference, Annex 4).
Irrigated Timber Plantations
3.46         The project will undertake a pilot operation to assess the land use of public sector timber
plantations and to explore alternative institutional arrangements, particularly those incorporating local community
or private sector participation, that would better support sustainable, socially profitable uses of the environmental
and biological resources enclosed in their areas. The operation will focus on three representative plantations,
whose selection the Bank and PFD will jointly agree upon following a general diagnostic study of all plantation
sites using the implementation arrangements presented in Annex 3 and technical assistance detailed in Annex 4.
3.47         Environmental Surveys. The project will undertake surveys of the topography, soils, fauna and
flora of public sector timber plantations. The objectives of these studies are to provide a) baseline measurements
of environmental/ecological conditions and constraints that delimit land management options; b) data to guide the
designi and analysis of contingent valuation studies of the plantation areas' principally non-timber forest products
among local stakeholder communities or groups in or around the sites; and c) parameters for an analysis of land
use involving some form of bio-economic optimization. Selected detailed studies will also include hydrological
surveys as necessary for drawing up detailed engineering options to re-design or rehabilitate existing irrigation
systems and structures as part of the exercise to formulate new management plans for the plantation areas.
3.48         Contingent Valuation Studies. The project will identify and count the principal local stakeholder
;,roups within and around the selected plantations, and describe their main socio-economic characteristics.
Separately, the project will undertake analyses of stakeholder use of plantation resources and of the values that
stakeholder groups impute to those resources with the use of contingent valuation surveys. These studies would
result in specific recommendations for increased community and private sector participation in the sustainable
maniagement of the plantations.
3.49         Management Plans. Given data from the environmental and contingent valuation studies and
engineering estimates, the project will select three representative plantation and specify, from estimated and
known biological relationships, a tentative zoning of the three pilot plantations into areas for xeric forest, tropical
thorn, timber production and other uses. The objective of the zoning exercise will be to optimize land use within
the plantations according to the comparative advantages of areas; the cost of incremental investments, operation
- 18 -



and maintenance; and the nature of participatory, institutional arrangements with local communities.  Within the
non-timber production zones -- so called "low intensity production areas" -- the plan will outline improvements
to the production of non-timber products and suggested extraction rates. For the high intensity timber production
areas, the plan will entail an exercise to optimize harvest scheduling.
3.50          Improvement of Water Management. The project will undertake engineering trials of improved
water management options for the selected plantations to gauge their technical and economic efficiency. These
trials will include the range of requirements of various land uses and management objectives for different
compartments in each plantation. The project will produce detailed plans for the improvement or rehabilitation
of the irrigation systems at the three selected sites. These plans will be subject to IDA approval before they are
implemented by PFD.
3.51          Improvements in the Legal Framework and Institutional Arrangements. The project will
commission an independent study to propose specific changes in the legal framework currently applying to the
plantations to promote their environmental role and allow for their multipurpose management. The study will
consider the requirements for permitting a broad range of private/public sector institutional arrangements aiming
for the financially autonomous management of plantations and an increased role for the private sector. The
project will define amendments in the existing laws and propose new legislation on the basis of the study's
recommendations.
Proiect Costs and Financin2
Project Costs
3.52          Table 3.6 presents the summary cost estimates for the various project components. Project costs
are expressed at projected April 1995 value and include duties and taxes. For the most part, the base cost
estimates reflect the expenditures of comparable provincial government agency operations, including
reforestation, soil erosion control, forestry extension, staff training, construction contracts and vehicle and
equipment purchases. Consultant service costs are based on recent contracts for similar services in Pakistan.
The cost estimates include allowances for physical contingencies of 15 percent for civil works and 10 percent for
machinery, equipment, materials, training and technical assistance, where applicable. The cost estimates also
include allowances for price escalations during the implementation period based on IDA estimates for domestic
and foreign rates of inflation. The following are the fiscal year inflation rates on which the cost estimates were
based:
Table 3.5 Inflation Rates Used in the Project Costing

2000/01            6.0                2.4
The exchange rates used in the costings are constant purchasing power parity rates. The exchange rate at the
time of the appraisal (June/July 1994) was approximately Rs 30/US$. Adjusting for projected inflation, the cost
estimates employ an exchange rate of Rs 32.0/US$ up to the start of the project.

Project Financing
3.53            Table 3.7 sets out the proposed financing of the project components.  IDA  disbursements against
the costs of incremental staff decline from 80 percent at the start to 40 percent by the last year of the project.

IDA/Bank Group financing will amount to approximately US$24.87 million. The Government's share of total
project costs tally to about US$8.88 million, including the financing of taxes. Of total project costs excluding
taxes and duties (US$29.80 million), IDA/Bank Group financing would cover 84 percent. Excluding taxes and
duties, the Government would finance approximately US$4.93 million equivalent. An IDA Credit of US$24.87
million would be made to GOP which would pass it on to GOPunjab in accordance with its standard budgetary
procedures.
3.54            GOPunjab will provide their share of project finances to the implementing agencies out of annual
budget appropriations. Funds for provincial expenditures would flow from the Federal Ministry of Finance
directly to the province as development funds. GOPunjab will provide its share of project finances to the
implementing agency PFD out of annual budget appropriations. Full amproval by the Executive Committee of
the National Economic Council (ECNEC) of the proiect's Planning Commission Form No.1 (PC-I) and
sanctioning of proiect expenditures would be a condition of project effectiveness.

Procurement
3.55           Table 3.8 provides a summary of arrangements for the project's procurement of civil works, goods
and services. Retroactive financing up to US$3 11,000 for procurement of essential goods and services under all
categories of expenditure was requested by the Government of Pakistan to allow early start-up of project
activities and maintain the momentum achieved during project preparation. All retroactive financing is expected
to be for eligible expenditures incurred between January 1, 1995 and the date of Credit agreement signing.

3.56           Civil Works: Civil works estimated to cost US$4.70 million include afforestation (US$0.99
million), field works (US$2.89 million) and other works consisting of the construction of offices, staff housing,
garages, sheds, seed stores and fencing (US$0.82 million). These works, which are small in size and scattered
over various locations, are not expected to attract any foreign contractors. To maximize contract size, however,
these works will be packaged into groups valued at least equal to US$40,000 equivalent and undertaken
following local competitive bidding procedures (LCB) satisfactory and acceptable to IDA. PFD will invite bids
from CWD registered contractors of the appropriate categories for undertaking these works. GOPunjab's
procurement procedures have been reviewed during appraisal and found to be consistent with the Bank's
Guidelines. It has been agreed that PFD will use LCB bidding documents developed under the 1992 Flood
Damages Rehabilitation Project for procurement of civil works (for contracts up to Rs. 15 million/ US$456,000
equivalent). Afforestation expenditures will occur under the scrub forest/range component and include nursery
expenditures, land preparation and planting out costs. These works will be undertaken at a number of sites and
would generally require close supervision of the staff of PFD. Field works include soil conservation works
(such as gully plugging, check dams, contour ripping, levelling and vegetative hedges), canal rehabilitation,
- 21 -



pasture establishment, adaptive research trials and demonstration plots. Similar to the afforestation works under
the same component, these works would be small and scattered, undertaken at many sites, and would generally
require the close supervision of forestry staff of PFD. As for afforestation, a combination of LCB procurement
and force account will be used for field works. At appraisal it was agreed that, wherever possible, civil works
will be executed through local contractors using suitably packaged LCB contracts. Where private contractors are
not available, the work will be executed by force account.
3.57         Vehicles and Equipment - (US$6.43 million). Vehicles, motorcycles, heavy machinery and
laboratory equipment estimated to cost the equivalent of US$5.86 million will be procured following
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in suitable packages by grouping similar items together. A
preference limited to 15 percent of the CIF bid price or the actual customs duty applicable to non-exempt
importers, whichever is lower, will be extended to qualified local manufacturers in the evaluation of ICB bids.
GOPunjab has formally , following loan signature, no further government/inter-ministerial clearances will be
required to initiate ICB procurement of vehicles and other equipment financed under the project. Computers
with peripherals and software worth US$0.31 million will be procured following LCB procedures as most
foreign suppliers of this equipment are represented in the country. Items or groups of items relating to office
furniture, tools and equipment including seed collection, testing and laboratory implements (other than motorized
transport, bulldozers, tractors with implements and some laboratory equipment) required at different places and in
small quantities and costing less than the equivalent of US$50,000 will be procured through international or local
prudent shopping by obtaining at least three quotations from reputed suppliers, subject to an aggregate amount of
US$200,000.
3.58         Technical Assistance, Training. Mass Awareness, Studies and Marketing Services - (US$11.51
million). Technical Assistance (US$2.44 million) consisting of Institutional Development (US$1.79) and Project
Preparation, Evaluation and Supervision (US$0.65) and Marketing Services and Studies (US$3.30) will be
contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines - Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The
World Bank as Executing Agency. Studies include soil mapping and local support for the range/scrub forest
initiation and site selection study and will be subject to IDA approval. Foreign and local Training (US$5.77
million), including US$3.40 million for mass awareness expenditures, comprising art work, videos, films, service
awards and other publicity materials as part of the publicity and extension activities, will be procured following
normal GOPunjab administrative practices that are acceptable to IDA.
3.59         All civil works and goods contracts in excess of US$200,000, and all consulting contracts in
excess of US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals will be subject to IDA's prior review. However,
with respect to all consulting contracts, irrespective of value, prior review will continue to be required for: (a)
terms of reference; (b) single source contracts regardless of value; (c) all consultant contracts and assignments of
a critical nature (because of environmental safety or public health considerations); and (d) contract amendments
valued at about US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 for individuals, or those that raise the total
contract value to about US$100,000 equivalent. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Works, Goods and
Consulting Services will be used. Bank staff will selectively post-review about 10 percent of the awarded
contracts (including bid evaluations) which are below the threshold levels.
Disbursement
3.60         The Credit will be disbursed over six years, with the Credit closing June 30, 2001. The proceeds
of the Credit will be disbursed against:
(a)    90% of expenditures on afforestation and field works and 80% of expenditures of other
civil works;
- 22 -



(b)    100% of foreign expenditures, 100% for ex-factorv, and 80% for locally procured
equipment;
(c)    100% of expenditures on consultant services, training and studies; and
(d)   incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis according to the following program: 80%
in FY96 and FY97. 60% in FY98 and FY99, and 40% in FY2000 and thereafter.
3.61         IDA will disburse against certified statements of expenditure (SOEs) for: (a) civil works and
goods contracts below US$200,000 equivalent; and (b) training, afforestation works, field works and incremental
staff salaries, allowances and operating costs. Disbursement applications for all other items will be fully
documented. Supporting documentation for SOEs will not be submitted to IDA, but will be retained by
GOPun jab and be made available to IDA staff during supervision.
3.62         To facilitate timely project implementation, PFD will open a special account for IDA project
funds with the National Bank of Pakistan with an authorized allocation of US$800,000. This account will be
used for both local and foreign expenditures of less than US$100,000 equivalent under all categories. All
expenditures above US$100,000 could be submitted directly to IDA for payment without using funds from the
special account after the implementing agency has made project expenditures. PFD will submit applications for
replenishment of the account to IDA on a monthly basis (the minimum replenishment being US$50,000) or
earlier if the account falls below 50% of its allocation. A schedule of disbursements is provided in Annex 3.
Accounts and Audit
3.63         The participating entities will establish separate accounts for the project. These accounts, together
with supporting documentation, including contributions from the Provincial Government, and the Credit, would
provide a comprehensive record of project financing and expenditures. Assurances are sought from GOP and
GOPunjab that: (a) these accounts would be maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound auditing
standards consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA; (b) certified copies of the
annual financial statements and SOEs. together with the auditor's report, which would comment separately on the
SOEs. would be submitted to IDA no later than nine months after the close of each fiscal year; and (c) the
Special Account would be audited annually and an audited statement of the account and the auditor's report will
be submitted to IDA no later than nine months after the close of each fiscal year.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Organization
Implementation
4.01         The Punjab Forest Department will be the main implementing agency for the project with the
Secretary serving as overall manager. The Department will liaise with the IDA and prepare half-yearly progress
reports on all aspects of the implementation of these components. During appraisal of the project, the capacity
of PFD to execute the project as well as its overall capacity to lead sector development were evaluated and
certain deficiencies related to priority areas of planning, research, monitoring and evaluation, interaction with
private sector and local communities were deficient (see para. 2.10). Project support is therefore directed
towards increasing PFD's experience and know how in these areas while building on the Department's present
experience in farm forestry.
- 23 -



4.02         For overall project implementation, an Administration Unit consisting of one Procurement Officer,
one Accounts Officer and support staff will be established in the office of the CCF/PD. It will assist the CCF in
making procurement of goods and equipment, account keeping, audits, preparing half-yearly reports and
processing disbursement applications. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for the project will be carried out by
the existing CF(M&E) who reports directly to the Secretary of Forestry. The addition of two DFOs (one each
for the farm forestry and social range/scrub forests components), two SDFO/ROs, one Economist, two
Statisticians and II technical and support staff will strengthen the M&E office. The primary role of the unit will
be to maintain a Management Information System (MIS) that will first assist the implementation of the project
and then monitor other sector development. (See Annex 3, for further details of the scope of the work program
for the MIS under the project, which will include the monitoring and evaluation of project's implementation, its
financial management and its socio-economic impacts). The project will finance short-term technical assistance
at the time of the project launch to aid in the setting up of the MIS and in training personnel. In addition, the
project will provide financing for the hiring of local consultancies to conduct studies as needed by the Bank for
its supervision missions.
4.03         One Chief Conservator of Forests/Project Director (CCF/PD; new position) will head the
organization. There will be four CFs under him -- three for extension (farm forestry) at Rawalpindi (new),
Lahore (existing), and Multan (new), and one for Range Management (existing). In Farm Forestry, each Civil
Division (8) will have a DFO (Extension) and each District (34) an SDFO and 19 Forest Rangers (FRs) will be
located at Tehsils (about one for two tehsils). The lowest tier will comprise extension workers (Foresters/Senior
Forest Guards) at Markaz level (354). Only incremental staff, including support staff will be provided. The
farm forestry incremental staff positions, except some nucleus technical staff, will be discontinued at the
completion of the project.
Conduct of Forest Department Operations
4.04         There is consensus on the need for reorganization of the Forest Department to ensure the
sustainability of projected benefits under the project. In particular, PFD will have to reconcile the demands of a
course to alter its current, limited role as protector of state lands with the budgetary constraints that inescapably
confront public institutions managing forest resources.
4.05         PFD has already agreed to establish a separate cadre of forest officers under a Social Forestry
Wing, providing career opportunities as attractive as other career paths within the Department. A chief
conservator of forests will head this wing. The project will contribute by financing on a declining basis required
incremental professional and technical personnel and their support staff.
4.06         Also, if the Forest Department is to expand its role in the range sector beyond one of simply
undertaking revegetative work on state rangelands to one of executing a rational, socially oriented and integrated
range management program, it will need to revamp its regulations to allow the recruitment and career
development of officers with range science backgrounds.
4.07         Because rational range management -- especially in Pakistan -- will be an essentially human-
oriented discipline, the PFD will reclassify the Range Management Circle as the Integrated Social Range
Management Circle to emphasize a new focus not only on range rehabilitation and development of grasslands,
but on a holistic approach to range ecosystems, including vegetation and livestock, and range economic systems,
including human needs, values and markets.
4.08         The project will require that PFD establish appropriate linkages with the Animal Husbandry Unit
and the Agriculture Department to ensure that the latter focus their attention on livestock improvement and feed
improvement in villages. The Conservator of the Integrated Social Range Management Circle will have the
responsibility of maintaining a permanent liaison with related departments in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.

Proiect Reviews
4.09         The Administration Unit, with support from the M&E unit, will undertake quarterly reviews of
progress in implementation. In addition, PFD will carry out a comprehensive review of the project progress in
the third year of the project, and the Bank would participate in this review. The mid-term review will cover all
aspects of project implementation and project impact. This review will identify shortcomings, if any, and areas
of improvement and recommend actions for dealing with them for government's consideration.
V. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefits
5.01         The primary benefits of the project include increased rural production, improved productivity and
environmental quality of forest lands, soil conservation measures, on-farm fodder production, improved public
sector efficiency in the forest sector, development opportunities for local participation, rural employment and
income. The investments in farm forestry research, tree improvement and extension are expected to increase
mainly the quality of forest raw materials. The project is expected to have some dampening effect on
environmental degradation in scrub forests, rangelands and other forest areas through the rehabilitation of
wasteland and pasture development. These activities will reduce grazing pressure on natural forest areas and
enable natural grass and forest cover to re-establish itself and provide vegetative growth which would improve
the resource base in the project area. Nevertheless, not all of these expected benefits are readily quantifiable.
5.02         Timber and fuelwood will be the main outputs of the project's farm forestry component. Since
fuelwood is a main source of energy for both rural and low income urban areas, these incremental production in
fuelwood will help ease the shortage of fuelwood in both project areas and throughout the country. The increase
in the supply of fuelwood will favor the realization of a consumer surplus and discourage the increased
substitution of inferior biomass fuels, such as dung cakes, for wood. This inter-fuel substitution is expected to
become increasingly prevalent in the future without the project, especially among poor rural and urban
populations, as fuelwood becomes relatively scarcer. One of the environmental consequences of this process, if
left unaddressed, is a gradual deterioration of the productivity of farm lands as dung is diverted from its use as a
manure and soil conditioner. The loss of farm productivity in turn has clear implications for the sustainability of
rural incomes among the least advantaged.
5.03        The project should lead to a significant increase in the availability of raw material for industry.
New processing capacity would most likely be needed to utilize fully this potential incremental supply. The
anticipation of supplying raw material markets would in fact be the primary motivation behind farmers'
participation in tree planting. Although farmers will be planting chiefly for these commercial reasons, their
activity will also produce substantial quantities of fuelwood as a by-product.
5.04         The pilot timber plantations component would lead to environmental benefits in the form of
inventories and plans for biodiversity conservation and the demonstration of modes for the rehabilitation and
sustainable use of Punjab's 285,000 ha of plantations. The demonstration of management systems with increased
private sector participation is expected to cause an increase in land use efficiency in these plantations and a
decrease of budgetary allocation from public budgetary resources.
5.05         The scrub forests and rangelands component, concentrating on the rehabilitation or improvement
of key resource areas through its micro-planning approach, should enhance the productivity of approximately
13,600 ha of pasture, along with about 8,300 ha of scrub forests. Additionally, the project will introduce
improved varieties of fodder crops over an estimated total cropped area of 400-500 ha to improve the farm
- 25 -



production of forage. These improvements are expected to benefit about 20,000, mainly poor, rural households
that are dependent upon common property resources and animal husbandry by increasing their net income by
about US$36 per household.
5.06         Financial and Economic Analysis. The table below summarizes the average, expected financial
and economic rates of return for the field operations of the project. Details of individual derivations are
provided in the following sections, Annex 3 (Implementation Plan) and in Annex 6 (Financial and Economic
Analysis, including an appendix of tables). The overall financial and economic rates of return of the project are
both expected to fall within a range of 12-18 percent.

The net benefits of farm forestry do not include an assessment of the environmental impact of producing more
trees on farms, which would likely increase overall returns to the project. Similarly, the results here are likely to
understate the returns to the social scrub and range component for not accounting for environmental benefits
accompanying the anticipated changes in the land use. They nevertheless are sufficient to justify the inclusion in
the project of the pilot activity in social range management. It was not possible to valuate the potential
environmental and economic benefits of the pilot plantations and institutional strengthening components.
5.07         The economic analyses used border prices, at August 1994 value, for major tradeable commodities
derived from World Bank projections of cif or fob values adjusted for local handling and transportation costs to
the farm gate. The derivation of border prices for major agricultural commodities was based partially on data
presented in "Pakistan: Irrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy Review" and adjusted for current prices. The
commodity price projections used were those provided in the World Bank's "Revision of Primary Commodity
Price Forecasts and Quarterly Review of Commodity Markets -- March 1993." In general, the crop and activities
budgets of the analysis use the average of prices expected to prevail over the period between 1993 and 2005.
The prices used in the analysis are listed in tables that follow Annex 6. The border prices for non-tradeable
commodities that constitute minor project costs were estimated from current local prices using a Standard
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9. The analysis also applied the SCF to minor costs of tradeable commodities.
5.08         The economic price for fuelwood was derived partly on the basis of its equivalent kerosene
content and on an estimate of the medium- to long-term agronomic effects of diverting on-farm use of manure as
a substitute for wood as a fuel for cooking. An indicative price for industrial grade wood was based on the
import parity value of manufacturing short-fibre pulp using estimates of local costs of conversion. The financial
wage for casual labor was priced at Rs 63/day, which was considered to be a reasonable estimate of marginal
value product. The economic wage was then derived using the SCF.

Sensitivity Analysis
5.09                  Variations in the benefits or costs of the range development or in the project costs
associated with this component have little impact on overall project performance: the scale of this pilot effort is
too small relative to farm forestry to have much bearing on the ERR. Farm forestry benefits are the main
determinant of the project's rate of return. Keeping all costs at their base levels, a decrease in the incremental
benefit stream from farm forestry of 40 percent would lower the ERR to the average opportunity cost of capital
assessed for Pakistan: 10 percent. Further decreases in the benefit stream without compensatory decreases in
costs would produce a negative overall net present value (NPV) for the project when discounting at 10 percent.
The sign of the NPV switches with a uniform 95 percent increase in project costs associated with farrn forestry.
It would take an increase in all costs included in the economic analysis of about 65 percent to switch the sign of
the NPV if incremental benefits are at their estimated baseline values. Chart I in Annex 6 simulates the
expected impact of combinations of variations in costs and benefits on expected profitability of project
investments. The chart shows that performance of the project would depend more upon changes in benefits than
in costs (see Chart I in Appendix I to Annex 6). The project does not appear to be very sensitive to changes in
benefits. For example, a uniform decrease in the incremental benefit stream of 20 percent would not switch the
NPV as long as all costs do not increase at the same time by as much as 30 percent.
Fiscal Impact and Sustainability
5.10           On year I of project implementation, the share of government financing of the project will
compare to about 25% of PFD's expected, without-project, budget --based on historical trends. Starting from
year 2, this share will be comparable to about 5 to 6% of the expected without-project budget, as indicated in
Table 5.2 below. The project is therefore not expected to overly stretch PFD's capacity of implementation.
Support to recurrent costs will further ensure that PFD's capacity is not exceeded. IDA, however, will only
disburse against incremental recurrent costs and on a declining basis (para. 3.60).

5.11         At the end of the project implementation period, the institutional and operational costs introduced
by the project (residual staff salaries, benefits and travel/daily allowances and operational costs in Research and
Monitoring and Evaluation, mainly) would amount to about Rsl I million (US$350,000) per year. These will
have to be borne in full by PFD but appear reasonable because of their relatively small size (about 1% of
without-project total PFD budget) and because of the expected relief that policy reforms under the project will
have on the government's budget. In particular, the combined phase-out of farm forestry seedling subsidies and
government nursery activities would represent a saving estimated at about Rs6O million (US$2 million) per year.
The net impact of the project, after completion, would therefore be an increase of more than US$1.5 million per
year that could help alleviate the overall fiscal condition of the Province or be reallocated to traditionally under-
funded areas of public sector activity (such as research, poverty alleviation on degraded lands and environmental
conservation). Additional gains in efficiency are also expected from the future large-scale application of lessons
of the project's demonstration activities (institutional reform in range/scrub forests and timber plantations).
Environmental Impact
5.12         Community participation in natural resources management is one of the major strategic
underpinnings of this project and is absolutely necessary for the sustainability of the changes in environmental
management that the project plans to introduce. The principle of participatory implementation will guide the
institutional and policy reforms included in the project and should lead to the improved delivery of technical
services to communities in and around existing forest resources as well as to farmers involved in farm forestry.
Through participatory implementation, the following areas of Pakistan's natural environment should receive
beneficial impacts from specific project components:
(a) Improved Soil and Moisture Conservation: Investments in farm forestry, irrigated timber
plantations and scrub/range land will lead to increased soil cover, decrease in fallow land, and
sustainable increase in productivity of the land through improved land management and return of
more organic matter to farm land; and
(b) Improved Grazing Conditions: Investments in range rehabilitation and management will lead
to an increase in the availability of fodder. Participatory management will ensure that this
increase is sustainable. Already, during project design, a participatory approach was used for the
definition of acceptable land treatment specifications. This approach will continue through project
implementation with the interface of multidisciplinary spearhead teams and NGOs who will link
between government agencies (livestock, agriculture, forestry) and local users of the scrub/range
project area.
Project monitoring activities will evaluate the degree of environmental improvement achieved during project
implementation and detect any sign of non-sustainability of improvements (through over-grazing for example).
5.13         Carbon Emissions. The accumulating evidence concerning the environmental consequences of the
residential burning of various types of biomass and petroleum fuels would suggest that forest sector development
could contribute towards an improvement of Pakistan's balance of greenhouse gases. Looking at the CO2
emissions per cooking task from household fuels, recent reviews at the World Bank7' have found that total net
emissions are highest for charcoal, followed by natural gas, kerosene and coal. For wood, the net carbon effect
depends upon whether the wood is sustainably managed. If sustainably managed, the use of wood represents no
net carbon emissions. If wood is not drawn from sustainably managed supplies, the net carbon emission effect is

Implications of Inter-fuel Substitution." Industry and Energy Department Working Paper, Energy
Series Paper no. 51 (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 1992).

positive. The reliance on sustainably-grown and managed fuelwood is more environmentally advantageous than
reliance on petroleum fuels or non-sustainably managed fuelwood.
Risks
5.14         Farm Forestry. For this component, one risk is the possibility that the implementation of the
phase-out programs for seedling subsidies and government nurseries might be delayed and that planting
campaigns of previous years in addition to planting under the present project would lead to a destabilization of
wood markets. However, safeguards built in the project -- such as prior government approval of the timed
phase-out programs for subsidies and public sector nurseries as well as monitoring of market signals and the
impact of project activities -- should alleviate this risk. The government, moreover, will have discontinued
practically all interference in the sub-sector in time for the mid-term review and evaluation.
5.15         Although PFD will briefly continue the seedling subsidy scheme, the project will reduce the
possible risks it raises by strictly limiting the total value of subsidy to be made available. In principle, the
subsidies would be used in those communities where wood markets do not operate well primarily for logistical
reasons and where the substantial part of the incremental production that might be realized through the project
would likely not be marketed, but instead be consumed by households.
5.16         Another possible risk in farm forestry is that, although farmers have been planting with the
expectation of marketing their wood primarily as a raw material for industry, which would command a higher
price than would fuelwood, it is as yet unclear that the present capacity of wood-based industries would be able
to absorb all of the short-rotation production due to come on stream soon from past planting campaigns.
Moreover, given the difficult environment for industrial investment in Pakistan, it is doubtful that much
additional capacity would be able to develop quickly, even if short-term prospects of raw material supplies
appear encouraging.
5.17         This risk, however, is not expected to be critical. Only about 15% of the wood harvested by
farmers would be marketed as higher value timber for domestic industry. The great bulk of the wood would be
sold in the market for fuelwood and this market should be able to absorb without much difficulty the production
increment preferably directed to industry. The possible realization of lower real prices for raw materials in the
short term and expectations of non-rising real prices at least in the medium term should provide additional
incentives for investment in various wood-based industries. Also, as international prices for pulp wood increase,
there is at least an even chance that the export of wood chips may become feasible, which would provide
additional marketing opportunities and incentives.
5.18         Moreover, the project would support the launching of a market information service, provided by
the private sector, that would assist the planning of wood users and producers. The aim of the service would be
to assist the development of forward contracts between producers and industrial wood users, encouraging and
facilitating further investment planning. The extension efforts of the project are also aimed at broadening the
base of wood producers. With the development and dissemination of market information these activities should
make aggregate wood supplies less sensitive to short-term price variations than they might otherwise be.
5.19         Scrub Forests and Range Lands. Bank studies indicate that governments routinely neglect
problems concerning the state of common property resources within their purview of natural resources
management. That finding is valid to some extent for Punjab and perhaps represents the greatest risk to this
component. In part, a potential lack of strong government support might be ascribed to a reluctance of the
forestry department to modify how it views its role and use of its resources in the subsector in isolation of the
way it views and conducts its management mandate in other areas. What may pose a particular problem for the
department is the prospect of accepting a resource management approach that jointly involves the department,
private sector and communities in decision making, administration and the negotiated sharing of resource
benefits. Related to this may be the difficulty of the department to cooperate with NGOs (and a risk in having
- 29 -



selected NGOs not performing satisfactorily). The project would aim to address this risk by providing TA for
the facilitation of participatory management of scrub/range land and conducting the proposed Human Resources
Development study for the sector. Among its outputs, the study should provide an indicative plan for the
deployment of public and non-public resources within the sector. This plan would provide the basis for
developing a consensus within the forestry department on the future direction of its role and on the adjustments
that need to be made within its organization. The training of personnel in support of the study's
recommendations would also be a high priority of the project.
5.20         Scrub forest rehabilitation measures will include reseeding and revegetation at selected sites.
Many areas have poor soils with very limited fertility. There is a risk of failure of some of the revegetation
attempts. Special care will be made to build on research already undertaken at PARC and PFI to select the most
adapted species of grasses and trees. Leguminous vegetation will be favored to counteract the limited levels of
soil fertility.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01         The following agreements were reached at negotiations. The Borrower, GOPunjab and/or PFD
will:
(a)   initiate an in-depth study analyzing the institutional capacity of PFD. The study will be
completed by June 30, 1997, and its recommendations be considered for execution within
the present project. The study will be prepared by PFD in consultation with Punjab P&D
using external and internal TA (para. 3.05);
(b)   agree with IDA, by December 31, 1995, on an action plan based on the results of the
environmental study of the public sector timber plantations carried out by PFD and IUCN
in December 1994. Thereafter, PFD will carry out the agreed action plan (para. 3.06,3.46);
(c)   implement the agreed program for gradual transfer of commercial nursery activities to the
private sector. By June 30, 1999 PFD will have discontinued all nurseries activities except
for the running of model nurseries for research and demonstration (para. 3.12);
(d)   implement the agreed phase-out program for seedling subsidies throughout the province
eliminating these subsidies and guaranteed seedling procurement by June 30, 1999. By
project effectiveness, PFD will set the level of subsidy at no more than 75% of seedling
production cost (para. 3.15);
(e)   select suitable consultants, before December 31, 1995 to assist in technical aspects of farm
forestry promotion and research (para. 3.18);
(f)   implement the farm forestry training program targeting PFD staff and local farmers (para.
3.16);
(g)   cause PFRI to develop in accordance with guidelines satisfactory with IDA, and adopt, by
December 31, 1995 and thereafter carry out a research program on priority areas of farn
forestry (para. 3.17);
- 30 -



(h)    abolish, by July 1, 1995, the permit and tax requirements for the cutting and transport of
farm forest trees outside of the border area. Permits on conifers and Acacia modesta trees
will be maintained for environmental protection reasons (para. 3.19);
(i)   implement the treatment of scrub/rangeland with the participation of local institutions
according to formal PFD-CO agreements to be cleared with IDA before July 31, 1996
(para. 3.21, 3.24, 3.35 and 3.36);
(j)    establish two spearhead teams (micro-planning facilitators) by June 30, 1996 and provide
training to these teams (para. 3.39);
(k)   implement training for PFD staff and farmers in participatory range/scrub management
(para. 3.40);
(I)    carry out, by June 30, 1996 a range/scrub site selection study in accordance with terms of
reference agreed with IDA (para. 3.41). Selected sites will be primarily in the Pothwar
and Thai areas with the possibility of extending this pilot to other areas after IDA
concurrence (para. 3.20);
(m)   recruit consultants, by December 31, 1995, to assist in the carrying out of technical
assistance under the project (para. 3.05, 3.18, 3.44-3.46, 4.09 and Annex 4);
(n)    provide adequate funds to project entities as outlined in para. 3.54;
(o)   follow the procurement arrangements outlined in para. 3.55-3.59;
(p)    GOPunjab would establish acceptable accounting and auditing arrangements as outlined in
para. 3.63; and
(q)   initiate a mid-term review of the project during FY 1997 with IDA participation and
complete the mid-term review by December 31, 1998 (para. 4.09).
6.02         The IDA Credit will not become effective until: (i) GOPunjab has satisfied IDA that the level of
farm forestry seedling subsidies are no more than 75% of the actual costs of production (para. 3.15); and (ii)
ECNEC has approved the project's PC-I and sanctioned project expenditures (para. 3.54).
6.03         With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be suitable for an IDA credit of
SDR16.00 million (USS24.87 million equivalent) on standard terms with 35-year maturity. The Borrower would
be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

PAKISTAN
PUNJAB FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
ANNEX 1
ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE FOREST SECTOR IN PUNJAB
1.          Demand and Trade. The consumption of roundwood for use as fuel far outweighs the quantities
presently used for industrial purposes. For 1993 the Household Energy Strategy Study (HESS) data base
estimates a roundwood fuel demand of about 13 million m3; whereas, the demand for industrial wood is
estimated at about 1.8 million m3. This partly reflects the generally relatively nascent and small-scale nature of
wood based industries in Pakistan. Much of the economic activity generated within the sector therefore revolves
around the trade of fuelwood.
2.          There are an estimated 13,530 fuelwood traders in Punjab, of which more than 90 percent are
involved in retail marketing. In addition, about 1,980 traders market both timber and fuelwood (there are about
3.500 traders dealing exclusively in timber). It is likely that most of these are also primarily retailers.
3.          The number employed in the sale of fuelwood is estimated at approximately 28,200. Of these,
about 20,130, including owners, would be permanently employed in the trade. Of those permanently employed,
some 17,060 are in involved in retailing; the remaining 3,070 are employed in the wholesale trade.
Approximately 8,000 are employed part-time, mostly in the retail trade. Revenue in 1991/92 from sales of
fuelwood is estimated to have been Rs 3,700 million. Over 90 percent of the marketed fuelwood is produced by
farms.
4.          A significant portion of the roundwood sold to industries has been hardwood for furniture making.
The furniture industry, concentrated around Lahore, Gujrat and Chiniot employs possibly as many 10,000 people
working in about 1,500 shops. Most of the high-quality timber used in the industry is shisham and is produced
on irrigated plantations and other public lands. Supplies of shisham from these areas, however, has been
declining for some time, and there is now a severe shortage of veneer quality shisham logs. Although in the
future, some shisham may also be produced on farms, the supply from this source would be quite limited and
would not likely be of the quality produced under long rotations.
5.          Most of the furniture industry is artisanal and small-scale; there are, however, at least two larger
concerns in Punjab that operate to supply the industry with processed materials. These are Jhelum-based
chipboard manufacturers that together employ about 800 people. Their raw material is mostly mango and poplar,
supplies of which appear to be adequate; however, these industries face the same problem of obtaining shisham
logs of veneer quality, which is required for many of their finished products.
6.          Most of Pakistan's 40-odd pulp and paper mills are located in Punjab, but none uses domestic
hardwoods as a source of fibre material. One market pulp mill is under construction with a capacity to produce
100 tons of kraft pulp per day from eucalyptus. If this business is capable of competing efficiently with
imported wood pulp then there should be considerable potential to replicate the enterprise to expand the supply
of raw material to existing local paper industries.
7.          Energy SuPDIV Considerations. Fuelwood is the most important fuel in Pakistan, supplying over
50 percent of the energy consumed. The projected demand for fuelwood in Punjab for 1993 is estimated at 17.5
million tons and is expected to increase at an annual rate of about three percent. The main users of fuelwood are
- 32 -



Annex I
rural households, who also supplement the use of fuelwood with the buming of dung cakes and other inferior
biomass fuels.
8.            The expansion of the supply of fuelwood in itself is a desirable outcome not because the effective
cost of its use ranks favorably with other modem fuels -- it is about as cost effective as kerosene, but far more
expensive than natural gas or LPG (see the following table) -- but because the population is heavily reliant on
wood energy and modem energy altematives cannot be made extensively available, technically and economically,
for some time. It is environmentally and economically worthwhile, as the viability of modem altematives
develops, to address physical scarcities of fuelwood, promote the sustainability of the fuelwood supply and avoid
increased substitution into the use of lower quality biomass fuels.

9.            Interfuel Substitution and Farm Productivity. Although fuelwood use is not a major factor in the
degradation of forest cover in Punjab, an increasing relative scarcity of wood can lead to other environmental
consequences. The real price of fuelwood in Pakistan has not increased over the last ten to fifteen years, partly
due to increasing incomes among some groups (fuelwood is an inferior good), but partly due to its substitution
with other, lower quality biomass fuels. Especially among poorer households, other biomass fuels, such as cow
dung and crop residues, are highly substitutable for fuelwood. The use of these biomass sources as fuels instead
of as manures will lead to a gradual deterioration in soil nutrients and in other physical characteristics of soil,
unless elements are replaced with the application of chemical fertilizers. For poorer households, the cost of such
fertilizers may be prohibitive. At best, cash incomes would decline, adding further to the entrenchment of rural
poverty. Although increases in the price of fuelwood have so far not been observed at regional levels, pockets
of fuelwood scarcity would add pressure local markets and would propel these developments.
10.           Interfuel Substitution and Rural Health. Further interfuel substitution among the poor could have
other human health effects for the women and children who are exposed to a large number of pollutants from the
ground-level buming biomass fuels in poorly ventilated houses. As dung releases three times the amount of
suspended particulates produced by the burning of fuelwood, it would be potentially much healthier and less
costly, in terms of health care costs and lost household labor to bum more fuelwood than dung. As a matter of
health policy, it should be reasonable to prefer actions that lead to substitution towards fuelwood and other

modem fuels to those that maintain or increase dependence on low quality biomass fuels. It should be noted,
however, that strong correlations between health and the indoor combustion of fuels have not been well
established, but even if they were, this in itself would not justify the subsidization of modem fuels. What is
being suggested instead is that increases in the supply of wood that lower the cost of its collection or purchase in
comparison to other biomass fuels are likely to be substantive steps in the direction of improved rural health.

PUNJAB FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
ANNEX 2
THE PROJECT'S LINK TO THE BANK'S FOREST SECTOR POLICY
1.          The project will be an instrument to attain the forest development and conservation goals outlined
in the World Bank's forest policy paper, dated june 1991. In particular, it will (a) encourage sustainable
resource use and discourage deforestation; (b) expand forest resources; (c) develop models for the participation of
local people in forest management; and (d) foster nature preservation. Under the project, most accessible forest
resources would be brought under scientific and sustainable management to maximize their contribution to the
economic, social and environmental goals of the province of Punjab. All forest management activities would be
carried out according to forest management strategies, which would be continuously updated as new information
becomes available through resource inventories, socio-economic surveys and environmental studies financed
under the project. Sustainability would be the main guiding criterion in allocating forest resources to various
uses. Institutional, technical and procedural systems, which are partly lacking or ineffective today, would be
established to apply this criterion to all forestry decisions (Human Resources Development subcomponent).
Resource expansion programs supported by the project would aim to rehabilitate degraded forest areas and lands
(Rehabilitation of Scrub Forest and Rangelands component) and to introduce production in areas where mixed
forestry/non-forestry land uses are feasible, complementary and desirable (Expansion of Farm Forestry
component). Such land management interventions would be designed to balance national and local needs. In
this context, the project would support a pilot schemes for people's participation in forest development and
maintenance (Rehabilitation of Scrub Forests and Rangelands). Institutional arrangements to be introduced by
the project would help secure the preservation of nature and environment and enhance forestry planning and
operations by inserting social and environmental aspects into the decision-making process.
2.           For the type of activities supported under the proposed project, the Bank's forestry policy requires
that several prerequisites be met by the concerned government to justify Bank/IDA involvement. These
conditions and the corresponding policies and activities supported by the proposed project are summarized below
(the Bank's conditions are underlined):
(a)   adoption of policies and an institutional framework to ensure conservation and sustainable
use of existing forests and to promote active participation of people an the private sector in
the long-term management of forests. The project has been designed in accordance with a
policy framework promoting planned utilization and regeneration of forest resources (the
National Conservation Strategy and Environmental Action Plan); optimizing resource use
by balancing environmental, social and economic goals; developing systems and methods
to secure people's participation in planning, managing and utilizing forest resources; and
strengthening environmental management and nature conservation capabilities. A major
effort would be made under the project to address the current institutional shortcomings of
the Punjab Department of Forestry, GoPunjab's main agency for managing forest
resources.
(b)   adoption of a comprehensive and environmentally sound forestry conservation and
development plan that contains a clear definition of the roles and rights of the government,
the private sector and local dwellers. A key objective of the project would be to ensure
that all of PFD's forest operations are regulated by up-to-date and scientifically prepared
- 36



Annex 2
forest management plans. These plans would be prepared in line with sound economic,
environmental and social goals. The government has established a framework for the long-
term protection and development of forest resources in the preparation of a forest sector
master plan. The project would assist in continuing the planning process to ensure that the
Master Plan can be updated and revised as and when required.
(c)    establishinz the institutional capacity to implement and enforce the above commitments.
With its environment and institutional development components and its provisions for
technological improvements and training/education, the project would make a major
contribution to improving the institutional capacity of the PFD to help ensure sustainable
and socially-minded conservation-oriented forestry.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
l. The Project
A. Summary of Project Scope and Objectives
1.          The purpose of the project is to improve the performance of the forestry sector in Punjab,
entailing the natural, financial and human resources operating in the sector. The impact of this improvement will
be an abatement in the deterioration in both quantity and quality of the forest sector's sustainable contribution to
the welfare of rural and urban households in Punjab. Harvests of wood and other products for energy or for
other direct consumption by households, or for the development of wood-based industries that generate
employment and value added will be one form of contribution. Another may also take the form of a consumer
surplus realized in providing marketed wood energy less expensively. Other contributions would be
environmental, affecting incomes, for example, by reducing potential losses in agricultural productivity owing to
the external effects of certain land uses; influencing health; providing amenities; yielding recreational value; or
providing other intangible natural conservation benefits.
2.           Characterizing the scope of operations, the main concerns of the project's intervention in the
sector are to:
(a)   improve the incentive framework governing the use of resources;
(b)   improve silvicultural productivity; and
(c)   improve development planning and the setting of resource management priorities.
Improving the incentive framework will encompass the decision making regarding investments in and use of
private, common and public property resources. Improving silvicultural productivity will include improving
planting materials, husbandry practices and the conduct of research. Improving development planning and the
setting of priorities will chiefly concern the collection and use of information on resources, and the provision of
environmental services.
3.          The chief outcomes or goals of the project will include:
(a)   conditions that would encourage a broadening of the productive base of wood (for use as
an industrial raw material and as a fuel) supplied from farm land and timber plantations in
terms of both numbers of private farmers participating and quantities of wood produced per
farm or per plantation;
(b)   demonstrations of scrub forests and rangeland rehabilitation and management that maintain
the availability of common benefits and forestall the deterioration of resources through
open access and the exploitative behavior of local populations; and
- 38 -



Annex 3
(c)    strengthened local public and community institutions managing the sector in Punjab.
4.            Specific project objectives within this scope will involve the following:
(a)    regarding the improvement of the incentive framework in the area of:
Private Property Resources:
i)    to obtain a more efficient allocation of financial and non-financial resources;
ii)   to improve access to technical information for the majority of farmers;
iii)   to improve access to quality planting material of choice;
iv)   to broaden popular base of on-farm wood production;
v)    to reduce the tax burden on marketing of wood and wood products; and
vi)   to improve farmers' prospects for marketing wood to industries.
Common Property Resources:
i)    to remove indifferent or detrimental government policy leading to further
privatization or conversion of resources to open access;
ii)   to expand technical opportunities; and
iii)   to reduce fiscal requirements for rehabilitating and managing community
grazing areas that impact forested and potentially forestable land resources.
Public Property Resources:
i)    to develop approaches for resolving user rights conflicts that presently lead
to the conversion of resources to open access or poaching;
ii)    to reduce the burden on Government for managing state forests and
protected areas; and
iii)   to demonstrate environmentally and financially sustainable private/public
collaboration in the management of public sector timber plantations.
(b)    regarding the improvement of productivity with respect to:
Planting Materials:
i)    to improve the genetic quality and vitality of planting material; and
ii)    to improve efficiency in the distribution of planting materials.
Silvicultural Practices:
- 39 -



Annex 3
i)    to improve the maintenance, pruning and harvesting of commercial plantings
on private farms;
ii)   to improve farmers' decisions of the product-mix of materials to be made
available for market; and
iii)   to expand the technical options available to scrub forest and rangeland
management.
Research:
i)    to improve the formulation of work plans;
ii)   to provide resources for financing research; and
iii)   to improve links to extension.
(c)   regarding the improvement of development planning in the area of:
Plannjing:
i)    to improve the forest sector and biodiversity data base;
ii)   to eliminate uncoordinated, ad hoc interventions of various governmental
departments and agencies;
iii)   to improve the efficiency of the use of existing human resources in the
sector; and
iv)   to introduce a framework within the PFD for assessing resource management
alternatives with a view towards determining optimal land use.
Environmental Services:
i)    to improve the effectiveness of bio-diversity protection;
ii)   to reduce the damage of unofficial stakeholder claims in protected areas; and
iii)   to increase public awareness in natural resource conservation through mass
media campaigns.
These objectives entail achieving the project outputs that are presented in the following table.

C. Financial and Economic Analysis
Summary
8.           Project benefits include increased rural production, productivity and environmental quality,
improved public sector efficiency in the forest sector and development opportunities for local participation,
employment and income. The investments in farm forestry research, tree improvement and extension are
expected to increase the quantity and quality of forest raw materials. The project is expected to have some
dampening effect on environmental degradation in scrub forests, rangelands and other forest areas through the
rehabilitation of wasteland and pasture development. Not all of these expected benefits are readily quantifiable.
The economic analysis did not cover the studies and mass awareness campaigns for environmental education, and
the pilot environmental plantations component.
9.           Such environmental benefits would include, for example, recreation, watershed protection, flood
control, the productivity of rangelands and the substitution of wood for inferior biomass fuels. Although benefits
under each of these categories may be realized, a broad consideration of the array of production, consumption
and environmental impacts would much complicate the analysis. In any case, adequate data to undertake such
analysis are not available and only proxy measures of such impacts might be made.
I0.          The project is expected to increase the establishment of trees on farms by an average of about 5
million trees a year over the ten years following the start of the project, as compared to a the number of trees
that would be planted in a future without the project. With improvements in per tree productivity under the
project, this increased rate of planting is expected to lead eventually to an increase in the supply of wood from
farms by about 8 million tons a year.  Part of this supply would be available for wood-based industries, part
would satisfy household energy demands.
11.          Regarding supplies to industry, the project is expected to lead to a sustainable incremental supply
of approximately 2 million tons of raw material over the course of twenty years. New processing capacity will
probably be needed to absorb all of this increased output. The anticipation of supplying raw material markets
would in fact be the primary motivation behind farmers' participation in tree planting. Although farmers would
be planting chiefly for these commercial reasons, their activity would also produce substantial quantities of
fuelwood as a by-product.
12.          The increase in the supply of fuelwood will favor the realization of a consumer surplus and
discourage the increased substitution of inferior biomass fuels, such as dung cakes, for wood. This inter-fuel
substitution is expected to become increasingly prevalent in the future without the project, especially among poor
rural and urban populations, as fuelwood becomes relatively scarcer. One of the environmental consequences of
this process if left unaddressed is a gradual deterioration of the productivity of farm lands as dung is diverted
from its use as a manure and soil conditioner. The loss of farm productivity in turn has clear implications for
the sustainability of rural incomes among the least advantaged. The contribution of the value of this substitution
to the overall net benefits of the farm forestry component, however, is expected to be relatively small.
13.          Under the scrub forests and rangelands component, the project will finance physical investments
improving approximately 13,100 ha of pastures and 8,300 ha of scrub forests. Additionally, the project would
also extend improved grazing management over 18,200 ha of untreated pastures. The total pasture area projected
to benefit should amount to approximately 3 1,300 ha. Including the improved areas of scrub forests, the total
targeted area for improved land management under this component would be about 39,600 ha. The project
would also would assist the private production of fodder on some 400-500 ha with the introduction of genetically
improved planting materials. These improvements are expected to benefit about 23,700, mainly poor, rural

14.           Financial and Economic Analysis. The table below summarizes the average, expected financial
and economic rates of return for the field operations of the project. Details of individual derivations are
provided in the following sections and in the appendix of tables accompanying Annex 6. The overall financial
and economic rates of return of the project are expected to range from 12 to 18 percent.

The farm forestry net benefits do not include an assessment of the environmental impact of producing more trees
on farms, which would likely increase overall returns to the project. Similarly, the results here are likely to
understate the returns to the social scrub and range component for not accounting for environmental benefits
accompanying the anticipated changes in the land use. They nevertheless are sufficient to justify the inclusion in
the project of the pilot activity in range management.
15.           Overall, the results appear satisfactory and are not critically sensitive to variations in any one cost
or benefit stream. As described below, these results derive from conservative assessments of quantifiable impacts
on rural and urban incomes. Moreover, the impacts considered were generally those that would be most directly
perceived. There are likely numerous secondary environmental net benefits that could also contribute to the
justification of several components, but for lack of data are not developed here. The general approach to the
analyses was to examine whether proposed investments could stand primarily on the basis of effects most directly
relating to the production and consumption of commodities. Such effects would also be the ones most likely to
be understood and appreciated by personnel screening the project within the GOPunjab and the World Bank
Group.
Prices Used in the Financial and Economic Analyses
16.          The commodity prices used in the financial and economic analyses are listed in Tables I and 2 of
Appendix I to Annex 6. Project financial costs were expressed at projected end-1994 value, and include duties
and taxes. The economic cost estimates exclude these elements. Base costs reflect the expenditures of
comparable provincial government agency operations, including reforestation, soil erosion control, forestry
extension, staff training, construction contracts and vehicle and equipment purchases. Consultant service costs
are based on recent contracts for similar services in Pakistan. The cost estimates in the analyses include
allowances for physical contingencies.
17.          The economic analyses use border prices for major tradeable commodities derived from World
Bank projections of cif or fob values adjusted for local handling and transportation costs to the farm gate. The
derivation of border prices for major agricultural commodities was based partially on data presented in "Pakistan:
Irrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy Review" and adjusted for current prices. The commodity price
- 46 -



Annex 3
projections used were those provided in the World Bank's "Revision of Primary Commodity Price Forecasts and
Quarterly Review of Commodity Markets -- March 1993." In general, the crop and activities budgets of the
analysis use the average of prices expected to prevail over the period between 1993 and 2005 (see Annex 6,
Appendix 1, Table 3).
18.          The border prices for non-tradeable commodities that constitute minor project costs were estimated
from current local prices using a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9. The analysis also applied the SCF to
to minor costs of tradeable commodities.
19.          The economic price for fuelwood was derived partly on the basis of its equivalent kerosene
content and on an estimate of the medium- to long-term agronomic effects of diverting on-farm use of manure as
a substitute for wood as a fuel for cooking. An indicative price for industrial grade wood was based on the
import parity value of manufacturing short-fiber pulp using estimates of local costs of conversion.
20.          The financial wage for casual labor was priced at Rs 63/day, which was considered to be a
reasonable estimate of marginal value product. The economic wage was then derived using the SCF.
21.          Unit costs and values are expressed in terms of constant end-1994 prices. The appearance of a
price or unit cost for a commodity or service that remains unchanged through the time horizon of the analysis
implies that the current price of the commodity or service (also called the nominal price) is adjusting from period
to period according to the given rate of inflation in the economy. Equivalently, for each period the cost of the
commodity is not more expensive relative to the prices of most other goods during that period. As long as
incomes also adjust according to the inflation rate, quantities of goods can be purchased more or less in the same
quantities as in the first period, and the same decisions can be made as before if all prices and incomes increase
by the same amount. For many commodities in the analysis there are no particular reasons to assume that
nominal prices would change by more or less than the general rate of inflation and so no real change, relative to
1994 prices and incomes is expected. In some instances, however, movements in the real prices of certain
commodities are assumed to avoid an implication that prices become much more distorted over time. Recent
government decisions permitting the further deregulation of the pricing of agricultural inputs and the general
loosening of restrictions binding economic activity and trade, if not reversed, should in the future increase the
likelihood of closer correlations than realized now between the border and domestic prices for several tradeable
commodities. As a guarded view, the working assumption of the analysis is that the basic deregulation to date
will not be reversed, and although pricing is not expected to become more distorted, it is not expected to become
much less so.
Farm Forestry
Introduction
22.          Discussions of the state of Pakistan's forest sector frequently begin with the observation that
forests (of all conditions) now cover only a small proportion of the land area and that these remaining resources
face imminent catastrophic depletion. The ensuing argument made on this observation alone is that tree cover
should be extended on a massive scale to meet existing wood shortages and expanding, population-driven, future
demands.
23.          Historically, however, the forest resources in the areas now constituting Pakistan, may never have
been very extensive, and the attention to the developing scarcity that gained some prominence under British
colonial administration is likely to have derived more from the specialized needs of the introduced railroads than
from a comprehensive assessment of the evolving wood balance. Although the administration and the original
- 47 -



Annex 3
technical demands have passed, the forest policies and the approach of national forest sector planning from this
era have carried considerable momentum.
24.          As in other instances where market and non-market signals have induced changes in behavior,
households have formed expectations about and adapted to changes in the availability of wood from traditional
sources. This much has been demonstrated by recent experience in Punjab. The massive planting of trees on
farm land over the past nearly ten years has now made farm forestry the largest source of household wood
supplies in Punjab.
25.          The essentially financial motivation behind the expansion of farm forestry is attested by the
Household Energy Strategy Study (HESS) survey that concludes that farmers have planted trees mainly for the
production of timber for sale. The production of fuelwood, however, is a primary by-product of this activity,
and so long as farmers perceive financial incentives in the production of timber, the production of fuelwood
benefits as well. This may appear to be a rather trivial factual statement, but it does express an alternative to the
strategy presently favored by the Punjab Forest Department (PFD) for increasing wood supplies from private
lands.
26.          The PFD prefer a supply-side approach to eliminating a broadening excess demand "gap" for
fuelwood that would consequently provide a stimulus for further investment in wood-based industries.
Specifically, the proposal is an expansion of an on-going USAID-financed scheme that encourages on-farrn
investments in tree planting by selling seedlings to farmers at subsidized prices. The approach seems to embody
an assumption that. however justified in the context of national planning, linear plantings, or the substitution of
crops for the establishment of block plantations, would appear attractive now only with a reduction in the current
cost of investment. Later on farmers would become convinced of the decision expedited by the 'psychological'
bribe. (At full cost, however, the returns to investments in trees are currently very attractive -- provided that
farmers do not face cash flow constraints.
27.          One difficulty with this approach is that it could lead to inappropriate land use decisions. For
example, without the seedling subsidy, it would not be financially profitable to replace barani crops with a block
plantation of eucalyptus, except on land of very low productivity. Economically, this is also the case. The
subsidy, however, depending upon the level of expenditure, is likely to render some uneconomic land uses
financially acceptable.
28.          Another concern is that, unless some plans are made in advance, the marketing of wood produced
from further massive plantings on farm land may face the kind of problems that followed India's farm forestry
campaigns. In India, partly due to uninformed silvicultural practices. large quantities of wood came onto the
market in the mid- to late 1980s which could not be sold as timber, although this had been the intention of
fanners who had planted trees in the early 1980s in response to rapidly rising wood prices during the 1960s and
1970s. Because of difficulties in accessing other wood-based markets, the disposal of the wood was limited
mainly to the construction pole market, which subsequently crashed.  Fuelwood markets, equally depressed, also
offered little relief. Farmers who had expected to receive a minimum income per tree when deciding to plant
found that they would be fortunate after 1986 to earn ten times less than what they had expected. Many farmers
consequently began to harvest prematurely and uproot trees to return areas to crops. Although conditions which
may have exacerbated market operations in India may be absent in Pakistan, the potential for large oscillations in
Pakistani wood markets, with undesirable financial, economic, environmental and social costs, nevertheless
appears credible.
29.          The financial consequences of large wood market oscillations include impacts on incomes for
consumers and producers, which will in turn have an effect upon the transition between low-quality biomass
fuels and fuelwood on one hand, and between fuelwood and other fuels and sources of energy on the other. The
- 48 -



Annex 3
focus of the project may not be the supply of (wood) energy, yet forest sector development and energy policy
objectives (and implications) are likely to coincide in many instances. This is such a point. Income is a major
determinant of decisions to switch from fuelwood to modem fuels, as well as from dung and crop residues to
fuelwood. The development of wood production and marketing in a way that increases rural income and
broadens its distribution should also encourage the transition to relatively efficient and clean sources of energy.
Similarly, consumers could benefit from an increase in their purchasing power if, as a result of forest sector
development, the supply of fuelwood becomes relatively less scarce, allowing more dung to be used as a soil
conditioner than would have been used otherwise.
30.          If large quantities of wood are brought to market and not easily disposed, however, triggering a
crash in prices, consumers may benefit for a while from very low fuelwood prices, but are then likely to face a
period of accelerating real price increases to levels above those that prevailed before the crash as former
producers switch to other activities. Once out, all but the largest producers are likely to stay out until prices rise
high enough to justify the risk of re-entering the market. Consequently as prices increase in real terms, more
consumers -- especially among low income groups- -- would switch from purchasing wood to collecting it and
increase their use of lower quality and less efficient biomass fuels than would have otherwise done had prices
remained relatively stable at initial levels or at levels that were low but still financially attractive to producers.
An opportunity would therefore be lost to direct consumption towards using a renewable supply of energy and
from accelerating the depletion of another. A similar lost opportunity arises from foregone wood producer
income and its multiplier effects.
3 1.         The swings in interfuel substitution induced by large market oscillations in turn occasion
environmental, economic and social repercussions. The economic and environmental consequences are further
discussed below. Of the social impacts, what is primarily in mind is the health hazards, particularly for women,
associated with indoor air pollution from household cooking. As dung releases three times the amount of
suspended particulates produced by the burning of fuelwood, it would be potentially much healthier and less
costly, in terms of health care costs and lost household labor to burn more fuelwood than dung. As a matter of
health policy, actions that lead to substitution towards fuelwood and other modem fuels should be preferred to
those that maintain or increase dependence on low quality biomass fuels. For further discussion on the
household health aspects of burning various fuels refer to Hosier".
32.          Clearly, lessening the relative scarcity of wood in Punjab is desirable, but since the supplies of
wood channelled through the markets are critical, the consequences of wood supply strategies on the operation of
wood markets should be a prominent concern. Whether the present policy of seedling subsidization has already
encouraged in Punjab a market-destabilizing overplanting of a few species is debatable, but it is revealing that
this question has now drawn so much attention. Assuming that the current policy will not destabilize markets,
whatever benefits the policy may produce must still be weighed against efficiency criteria such as those implied
by the alternative land use issue described above and against fiscal implications. Given the government's limited
resources, the subsidies also divert funds from other uses. This consideration is all the more relevant when the
government borrow for the financing of much of its development budget. Moreover, the subsidies are not likely
to lead to a sustainable effect on producer behavior unless they are maintained.

Annex 3
33.          Instead of pushing through an expansion of wood supply through a subsidization scheme one
could consider a strategy of drawing out a measured supply response through stimulating and/or facilitating a
demand-led expansion of wood industries and markets. Such a strategy would have two advantages. The first
relates to the source of incentives for farmers' participation: conditions would be set in place that motivate
farmers to invest in plantings on the basis of forward sales of raw material and of comparisons to market
opportunity costs, rather than on the basis of subsidized capital costs. The second relates to the scale of effort:
plantings for wood industries should be on a scale large enough so that fuelwood, as a by-product, is produced
on a scale sufficient to generate a consumer surplus. Ideally this strategy would avoid a 'boom/bust' fluctuation
of supply. i.e., avoid large over- and undersupply or, perhaps more practicably, to have fluctuations occur within
relatively narrow bands around a medium- to long-term clearing price. Meanwhile, welfare is improved via the
impact of long-term price trends on rural and urban consumer behavior.
34.          Industrial demand for wood, however, may not be strong in the absence of good prospects of
adequate supplies at attractive prices. To some extent a prior demonstration of increased planting may need to
occur to stimulate a demand-led expansion of wood industries and markets. If farmers are reacting to prospects
of tuture profits from wood plantings, yet sales prices in the longer run need to be lower to be consistent with a
demand-led expansion of farm-produced wood, then farmers' per unit costs of production will have to fall to
mainitain present levels of profit at lower sales prices.  The seedling subsidization has this effect, but very
weakly. A much better approach, for its long-term fiscal implications alone, would be to lower the per unit cost
of production through improving the productivity of farms. The present analysis demonstrates this in modelling
the project's impact of an increase in farm productivity of 25 percent through extension efforts while phasing out
the current policy of subsidizing seedlings for farmers.
Approach
3*5.         The project is "large" in the sense that the project is likely to affect both the quantity and price of
wood in Punjab. The impact of price changes are only partially accounted for. Price adjustments to reduce
excess demands in the cash fuelwood market would, for example, lead to some interfuel substitution and affect
decisions to collect versus to buy fuelwood. If the project leads to a long-term reduction in fuelwood prices, it is
possible that a switch from collecting to purchasing more fuelwood would benefit the environment and in turn
benefit rural welfare in general. While the impacts of interfuel substitution have not been estimated, the analysis
uses price adjustments to calculate benefits in the form of the period-by-period consumer surplus that may be
realized under the project.
36.           The approach of the analysis is to model explicitly, over time, the investment responses of wood
producers to changes in the investment costs of establishing plantings, to improvements in the sustainable
productivity of their stands, and to adjustments in the market price of wood. This involves developing a
fi-amework that can account for past observations of wood demand, the development of farm forestry and the
movement of prices, given some reasonably known technical parameters.
37.           The chief outputs of the analysis are projected time series of the aggregated marketed output of
fuelwood and tinber and their composite price. The prices emerging from the analysis are in general not
equilibrium or clearing prices: wood markets are diffuse and consumers have a range of alternatives to
purchasing wood. At the same time, producers are not obligated to lower prices to clear their output: population
growth will continue to exert an upward pressure on prices while producers can postpone harvesting as long as
this is financially advantageous. The analysis also recognizes that producers, because of the growth period of
forest rotations, are not in a position to increase production much beyond a certain point in the short term. The
result is that consumers in the aggregate are generally always in a position of wanting to purchase more wood at
the current price, but are constrained from doing so because of the limitations of supply. Period by period
- 50 -



Annex 3
adjustments in the price of wood can be expected, but not enough to eliminate excess demand. Excess demands,
of course, would be shifting continually period by period, moving the "goal posts" of adjustment each time.
38.          Using these time series of outputs and prices with and without the project, the analysis estimates a
consumer surplus as the main quantifiable benefit over the next twenty years. There likely are environmental
benefits, but because of the difficulty of isolating identifiable and measurable environmental impacts, they have
not been explicitly included. The analysis however, indirectly accounts for some environmental impacts in
adjusting the consumer surplus by the economic conversion factor fuelwood.
39.          The base rate of return calculation accounts for the project costs of extension and research,
converted to economic values, and for the incremental costs of establishing plantings. The costs for establishing
plantings includes investments for replacing growing stock that has come to the end of its useful economic life.
Results
40.          The simulation implies that without the project, farmers will be planting out between 40 to 50
million seedlings a year over the first six years. With the project, planting is higher as farmers respond more to
increases in the productivity of their investments than to the subsidization of seedlings. The wood price does not
change sharply, but in the with project situation is also lower period by period as compared to without the
project. This could be explained by noting that the increases in productivity of the growing stock lowers the cost
of investment for the farmer per unit of output, and so stimulates more investment. Larger supplies of wood
decrease excess demand and lead to a decrease in the wood price. In comparison, the seedling subsidy has a
weaker effect in encouraging investment. In general, the behavior of the system appears consistent with
observations and with short-term expectations of the forest department regarding the take up of seedlings by
farmers.
41.          These results system fairly well reflect the stylized facts of recent farm forestry plantings and
price movements. The analysis does not claim to present a comprehensive set of causal relationships that explain
investment behavior, but it does demonstrate a logical mechanism that mirrors the rationale of the component
and offers sufficient, monitorable conditions for affirming a decision to accept the project.
42.          Base Rate of Return. The base financial rate of return to the farm forestry development is
estimated at about II percent. When the value of the resources saved by the government through the removal of
the seedling subsidies are included in the net benefit stream as incremental resources available to the government
for development, the rate of return increases to about 14 percent. The base economic internal rate of return,
excluding the value of additional resources released to the government in phasing out the seedling subsides over
the project period is estimated at 14.5 percent. Including the value of additional resources to the government, the
rate of return is estimated at about 19 percent.
Social Range and Scrub Forests
Approach
43.          This pilot component aims to improve the efficiency of traditional grazing systems in promoting a
working partnership of local pastoral organizations and government institutions for the regulation of the use of
lands suitable for grazing. Broadly, this partnership would work toward strengthening a sustainable pastoral
economy, and will be the framework within which land improvement investments would be undertaken and other
existent services and resources mobilized. Among the expected outcomes of this partnership are land use
agreements, or contracts that lead to an overall reduction of grazing pressure on pasture and scrub forest areas,
while increasing overall forage availability and access. The actions producing these outcomes will include
- 51 -



Annex 3
rehabilitating or improving high potential pasture areas through soil and vegetative conservation works, reseeding
and ponding and/or other water harvesting techniques. Areas of scrub forests will be replanted with fodder-
producing species of trees. Treatments will vary from area to area according to the conclusions of the
microplanning exercise and the constraints of agroclimatic and geophysical characteristics. Feed supplementation
from farm production, where possible and economic, will be promoted. The project will also concentrate on
animal health. Above all, the project will work, in assessing the potentials of all grazing lands and pastures
within the catchment areas of communities, including public and private lands, to adapt stocking and marketing
strategies in ways that enhance forage utilization in consideration of animal performance. This might involve,
among other measures, the introduction of rotational grazing arrangements on public land and greater access to
marketing information to guide the acquisition and disposal of stock.
44.          Apart from its environmental aspects, the component will also contribute toward poverty
alleviation. Its activities will involve and affect the poorer segments of the rural population. Operating in the
Pothwar Plateau and Thal areas, the project should add to the cash incomes of households who generally hold
little productive, arable land.
45.          There is also a likelihood that a significant fraction of rural women will benefit through the
project since women are in fact engaged in much of the herding. Although this work by women is generally not
openly admitted, it exists and is tolerated because of the necessity for male members of households to seek
employment outside the community.
46.          To measure the project's potential impact on incomes, the analysis considers a generalization of
the current conditions facing poorer villages in the project areas, based on the results of the socio-economic
surveys conducted by the preparation mission. These have led to estimates of the average size of the shamiat
area of these villages, its current productivity and exploitation, the average size of the village, expressed in sheep
units (SUs) (most of the animals to be affected would be small stock), and the capacity and level of use of other
sources of fodder. The labor time required for keeping livestock has been estimated, along with the average
value of income per sheep unit realized from the sales of culls, wool and household consumption of meat. In the
without project situation, the productive value of animals gradually decreases over time to reflect deteriorating
conditions of forage supply and quality as well as the longer distances over which animals would eventually be
grazed.
Results
47.          The analysis estimated project financial internal rates of return (IRRs) for the developments
involving 68 communities in Pothwar and 32 communities in Thal. To the two areas the analysis apportioned
the project costs for community extension, including the purchase and operation of heavy equipment, vehicles,
the construction of staff offices and housing, equipment and tools, portion of component technical assistance and
training, incremental staff salaries and other overhead expenses. Residual values for heavy equipment, vehicles
and office equipment partially offset incremental project costs at the end of the project's implementation period.
For the Pothwar development the financial internal rate of return was estimated at approximately 17 percent. For
Thal, the IRR was estimated at 15 percent. The rate of return of the component as a whole is estimated at 16
percent (the calculation is displayed in Annex 6, Appendix 1, Table 7). This result is not very sensitive to small
variations in the benefit or cost streams.
48.          For the economic analysis livestock revenue was converted into its economic value using a
conversion factor of 0.60, which was derived from a calculation of the average import parity value of mutton
produced in barani areas in central Punjab. Using economic values for inputs, outputs and project costs, the
economic internal rate of return (ERR) for Pothwar was estimated at 15 percent and for Thal at 11 percent. The
- 52 -



Annex 3
rate of return for the component in aggregate amounts to about 12 percent. See Appendix 1, Tables 4 and 6 for
the calculations of the economic budgets of grazing and husbandry development in Pothwar and Thal. Annex 6,
Appendix 1, Table 7 presents the calculation of the analysis.
Overall Project Results
Base Rates of Return
49.          Overall project rates of return were estimated on the basis of the net benefit streams of the farm
forestry and social range and scrub forest components, and the costs of institutional support under the project,
which include Human Resource Development, incremental administrative operating expenditures and the
establishment and operation of M&E facilities. The base financial rate of return (IRR) of the project was
estimated at 12-15 percent. The base economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated to range from 14 to 18
percent.
Sensitivity Analysis
50.          Variations in the benefits or costs of the range development or in the project costs associated with
this component have little impact on overall project performance: the scale of this pilot effort is too small
relative to farn forestry to have much bearing on the ERR. Farm forestry benefits are the main determinant of
the project's rate of return. Keeping all costs at their base levels, a decrease in the incremental benefit stream
from farm forestry of 40 percent would lower the ERR to the average opportunity cost of capital assessed for
Pakistan: 10 percent. Further decreases in the benefit stream without compensatory decreases in costs would
produce a negative overall net present value (NPV) for the project when discounting at 10 percent. At the base
level of incremental benefits, project costs associated with project activities plus institutional support costs, but
excluding the investment costs and incremental operating costs of the activities themselves, would have to
increase uniformly by about 90 percent to switch the sign of the project's NPV. Separately, institutional support
costs have a switching value of about 1900 percent: their contribution to overall project costs is small. In
contrast, the sign of the NPV switches with a uniform 95 percent increase in project costs associated with farm
forestry. It would take an increase in all costs, including all investment and incremental operating costs of
activities, of about 65 percent to switch the sign of the NPV if incremental benefits are at their estimated
baseline values. Combinations of variations in costs and benefits show that the performance of the project would
depend more upon changes in benefits than in costs (see chart I in Appendix I to Annex 6). Still, the project
does not appear to be exceptionally sensitive to changes in benefits. For example, a uniform decrease in the
incremental benefit stream of 20 percent would not switch the NPV as long as all costs do not increase at the
same time by as much as 30 percent.

11. Implementation Arrangements
A. Overall Responsibility
51.          While GOP have overall liability for the IDA credit agreed to with the Bank, GOPunjab will
execute the project. GOP will make the proceeds of the IDA credit available to GOPunjab as the primary part of
its assistance to the implementation of the project. GOPunjab shall carry out the project and shall provide, or
cause to be provided, as needed, the funds, facilities, services and other resources required for the project.
B. Implementing Agency
52.          The Punjab Forest Department will be the main implementing agency for the project on behalf of
GOPunjab with the Secretary serving as overall manager. The Department will liaise with the IDA and prepare
half-yearly progress reports on all aspects of the implementation of these components.
53.          One Chief Conservator of Forests/Project Director (CCF/PD; new position) will head the
organization. There will be four CFs under him -- three for extension (farm forestry) at Rawalpindi (new),
Lahore (existing), and Multan (new), and one for Range Management (existing). In Farm Forestry, each Civil
Division (8) will have a DFO (Extension) and each District (34) an SDFO and 19 Forest Rangers (FRs) will be
located at Tehsils (about one for two tehsils). The lowest tier will comprise extension workers (Foresters/Senior
Forest Guards) at Markaz level (354). Only incremental staff, including support staff will be provided. The
farm forestry incremental staff positions, except some nucleus technical staff, will be discontinued at the
completion of the project.
54.          For overall project implementation, an Administration Unit consisting of one Procurement Officer,
one Accounts Officer and support staff will be established in the office of the CCF/PD. It will assist the CCF in
making procurement of goods and equipment, account keeping, audits, preparing half-yearly reports and
processing disbursement applications. Monitoring and evaluation for the project will be carried out by the
existing CF(M&E) who reports directly to the Secretary of Forestry. The addition of two DFOs (one each for
farm forestry and range), two SDFO/ROs, one Economist, two Statisticians and II technical and support staff
will strengthen the M&E unit. The primary role of the unit will be to maintain a Management Informnation
System (MIS) that will first assist the implementation of the project and then monitor other sector development.
See below for further details of the scope of the work program for the MIS under the project, which would
include the monitoring and evaluation of project's implementation, its financial management and its socio-
economic impacts. The project would finance short-term technical assistance at the time of the project launch to
aid in the setting up of the MIS and in training personnel. In addition, the project will provide financing for the
hiring of local consultancies to conduct studies as needed by the Bank for its supervision missions.
B. The Role of the Bank
55.          The Bank will supervise the project starting with a mission to launch the project following credit
effectiveness. Following the project launch, the Bank will conduct three semi-annual reviews before a mid-term
review, now scheduled within the third year of the project's implementation. A semi-annual review will follow
the mid-term review and then two annual reviews. A final Bank mission to review the project's completion will
take place after the close of the project.
- 54 -



Annex 3
C. Administrative and Implementation Arrangements for Farm Forestry
56.           The delivery system will pattern the provincial civil administrative structure, rather than the
PFD's, to provide better coordination with other line departments, facilitate monitoring and ensure even
extension coverage throughout Punjab. One extension forester (Forester or Forest Guard) will be posted to each
of the 354 Markazs (there are an average of 66 villages per Markaz). One Forest Ranger will supervise the
Extension Foresters in two Tehsils and there will be an SDFO to supervise Forest Rangers in each of the 34
Districts. A DFO will be posted to each Divisional HQ. Three Conservators of Forests (CF) one each at
Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan will provide the overall supervision required to implement this component.
Heading the Farm Forestry Wing and Scrub/Rangeland conservancy will be the CCF(PD) stationed in Lahore.
Professional staff requirements will be as follows:

57.           The project will finance these incremental staff: 58 professional, 70 technical staff, including
drivers, and 162 support staff.  PFD will provide the remaining technical staff requirements through transfers.
By the end of the project the PFD will absorb all technical staff below the level of CF, except for 34 Forest
Rangers who will remain at the Tehsil level to ensure continued farmer access to technical assistance. The
CCF(PD) and two CF posts will then discontinue, leaving one CF at the center.
58.           Delivery Mechanisms for Seedling Subsidies. In its tree-planting campaigns PFD has provided
seedlings to farmers virtually free of cost. Under this project the subsidy will be phased out over four years:
75% in year 1, 60% in year 2, 40% in year 3, 25% in year 4 and 0 in years 5 and 6. Under the current system,
when the farmer collects his/her seedlings from the private nurseryman, payment of the non-subsidy element is
made (e.g., in year 1 of the project this would be 25% of Rs 1.75 or Rs 0.45 per seedling). The nurseryman is
not paid the balance or subsidy element (in this case Rs. 1.30 per seedling) until the number of seedlings actually
planted by all the farmers obtaining seedlings from his/her nursery has been verified in the field by a forest
officer. Delays in the final payment (crossed check) to the nurseryman, by the DFO or his designate, sometimes
run into months. It is the nurseryman who is penalized if the seedlings are not planted, not the farmer. The
present project will intervene to simplify the process. One approach would be for a forest officer to make
payment (of the subsidy element) once he has verified that the nursery contains the contracted number of quality
seedlings of the correct species. As before, the farmer would pay the non-subsidy element on collection of the
seedlings. This would ensure prompt payment to the nurseryman and a reduction in the number of PFD staff
involved in the process. The project will use sampling techniques to determine the number of seedlings planted.
- 55 -



Annex 3
IDA and GOPunjab will agree on a suitable system during negotiations. In addition, the subsidies would be
targeted toward poor households.
59.          Under an expenditure category of marketing services, project financing will support the
contracting of private sector services to provide periodic assessments of current marketing prospects and trends
for various raw materials and to produce information on wood purchase contracts and prices for regular
dissemination by radio or through other suitable mass media. The project will also employ the private sector for:
(a) introducing a log grading system based on measurements that can be made by the farmer; (b) advising on
harvesting (felling, bucking, logging) practices; (c) improving linkages between the producer (farmer) and the
user (industry); (d) determining the role of the middle man in marketing; (e) creating a data base; and (f)
developing a marketing strategy. The Bank would agree on the procurement and contracting of these services.
60.          Phasing Out of PFD Nurseries. There are some 700 PFD nurseries currently providing farm
forestry seedlings requirements. These will be phased out by year 5 and replaced by over 1,000 farmer nurseries,
which are expected to be established by the same year. The project anticipates the following phasing of
nurseries:
Table 7. Phasing Out of PFD Nurseries
Number of Nurseries
Year     0          1         2          3         4          5          6
PFD            700        560        280       210        140        0          0
FF              0         200        620       720        830       1035       1035
Numbers for the PFD are firm but only indicative for the private farmer nurseries (FF), assuming an average of
three per Markaz.
61.          Targeting of Extension Activities. Although generally all farmers will have access to the
informational services of the project, extension activities will be organized primarily around groups of farmers
who hold each arable holdings of land of five hectares or less to broaden the production base of farm forestry.
These farmers, who form the largest percentage of cultivators, are greatly under-represented among participants
of previous farm forestry campaigns. As a group, these farmers constitute much of the rural poor in Punjab.
Moreover, the delivery of seedling subsidies will be directed towards those farming communities where average
household income are below the median income for the province, where farm tree planting is an unfamiliar
practice and where wood would be produced primarily for home consumption as fuel. As a working figure, poor
households whose per capita income falls at or below Rs 400 per month.
D. Administrative and Implementation Arrangements for Social Range and Scrub Forest Management
(SRSFM)
62.           Existing PFD staff from the Range Management and Rawalpindi Circles, under their respective
Conservators of Forests, will implement the component; however, over the course of the implementation the
project will provide financing on a declining basis for one draftsman and 18 technical and support staff to aid the
expansion of the work program in the two target areas. The professional staff implementing this component will
report to the Chief Conservator of Forests (Project Director), Lahore. By the end of the project professional staff
will return to their regular postings and contracts for other support and technical staff would be completed.
63.          Two specially trained spearhead teams will assist and train PFD field staff in the processes of
forming Community Organizations, participatory planning, and formulating joint agreements. Each spearhead
- 56 -



Annex 3
team will consist of three Forest Department staff (a DFO, an SDFO, and a Forest Ranger) and two resource
persons. The project will recruit resource persons with skills in participatory appraisal and planning techniques
from universities, research institutes, and NGOs specializing in training in participatory work. Of the two
resource persons on each team, one will be a specialist in institution building and community development, and
the other in livestock and rangeland management. Spearhead teams will in all cases work alongside local FD
field staff, who will take responsibility for continuing SRSFM work in communities.
64.          The operation of this component will consist of a number of sequential steps; namely, the
selection of the villages, the motivation of the villagers, the formation of a community organization so that the
villagers can operate as a group, the microplanning of work to be carried out in the village in the project period,
and the execution of the microplan. Except for instances when an NGO is operating, all of these steps will fully
involve PFD.
65.          Selection of Villages. The PFD along with the NGOs will select villages on the basis of the
following criteria:
(a)   the people of the village are willing to participate in the program;
(b)    within reasonable distance of the village sufficient range and scrub forest land is available
for rehabilitation;
(c)   the site quality of the available land is satisfactory (this would ensure that there is more
likelihood of the success of the program which would encourage others to emulate); and
(d)   the villages are distributed as far as possible in different forest ranges which will allow
sharing of the workload by staff posted in different parts of the Pothwar and Thal areas.
Selection of the villages should be completed at least a year in advance of the year when the work will be
undertaken.
66.          Motivation of the villagers, grou, formation, signing of agreement and entitlement of the villagers
for participation. Wherever possible, the project will engage NGOs to carry out the work of motivation of the
villagers. The NGOs will work under the administrative guidance of the local PFD. Where NGOs are not
available, the PFD will carry out this task. The motivation work will consist of meeting the villagers
individually and in mass meetings to explain to them the program, to understand what their reactions are, to find
out whether they are interested to form village organization to participate in the program, their responsibilities
and the benefits that they would be entitled to as compensation. If through these interactions, a majority of the
villagers agree to participate, the NGO or the PFD will assist the villagers to form a representative group drawn
from as many families as possible but not exceeding 20 members. The group should include at least four landless
people. The group would then sign with the PFD an agreement specifying the program, the responsibilities of
the parties, the cost and benefit shares and the penalties in the breach of the agreement. The general principles
to be incorporated in the agreement follow. Preferably, PFD will appoint an NGO at the time of the project
launch to standardize a document containing the methods to be followed in motivation and group formation
work.
67.          The project will provide the following entitlements to the villagers:
(a)   individuals who agree to rehabilitate their private range land will receive as an incentive
free grass seeds and tufts, some assistance in land preparation with the provision of tractors
- 57 -



Annex 3
with attachments and diesel (the total cost of this assistance not exceeding about Rs 700
per ha) and free technical advice;
(b)   in the case of rehabilitation of common, state and FD range lands, the project will bear the
total cost of rehabilitation while the Community Organization (CO) will be responsible for
the protection of the land and the regulation of grazing as specified in the microplan. In
exchange for this support, the CO will be entitled to a compensation of Rs 625 per month
for every 50 ha of range land (i.e. Rs 150/ha per year) and allowed grazing at a fee per
grazing cattle;
(c)   in fodder plantations, the project will finance the cost of planting. The CO will be
responsible for its protection and for the regulation of grass cutting and lopping. The
members of the village will receive free grass, free lops and tops and about 20% (to be
decided by the government) of the final product when the plantation is be finally felled;
and
(d)   the project will finance the cost of scrub forest rehabilitation work while the protection of
the area from misuse will be the responsibility of the CO. The CO will be entitled to free
grass cutting, spaced or thinned fuelwood free of royalty and 20% of the final product
when the forest is felled.
68.          Microplanning. PFD, NGOs and COs will jointly prepare microplans. The microplan will be a
brief document in the local language consisting of the following sections. It has to be understood that
microplanning is not an elaborate exercise intended to document precise quantitative data and rigid targets. On
the other hand, it is proposed to be an indicative document specifying indicative targets, responsibilities of
different parties and their entitlements. The plan will form a part of the agreement that the CO will sign with
the PFD.
69.          The first section in the microplan will, along with a map, list the land available (i.e., agreed to be
spared) for private, non-private range land and FD scrub forest rehabilitation work in the project period. It will
also indicate whether any other similar schemes or operations are being carried out. If there are other activities
under way, the plan would explain how the present scheme would not duplicate ongoing work. The second
section of the microplan will tabulate a tentative target for the project period and approximate the forest
production and the number of grazing cattle, or other livestock, that the area would ultimately bear. The third
section will specify the costs and the responsibility of the parties in sharing it, while the final section will
indicate the benefits and the entitlements of each party and how the benefits would be provided.
70.          Rangeland Imnrovement. Depending on the existing quality of the range, the area will be either
revegetated or reseeded. If the range has sufficient increasers, revegetation will be carried out, which would
consist of protection for a few years followed by regulated grazing. If the range is in poor condition, the
existing vegetation-will be removed by disc plough, cultivated and seeds of appropriate species of grasses and
legumes will be broadcast. For shade, about 100 seedlings of non-grazable species will be planted in 30 x 30 x
30 cm holes. If the reseeding is successful, the reseeded area would be protected for the first three years and then
opened for regulated grazing.
71.          There will be no fencing for the revegetation or the reseeded area. The CO will arrange suitable
supervision of the area during its closure and will regulate grazing on it afterwards. The CO will receive a
compensation for this support as mentioned above. Revegetation and reseeding will be planned so that sufficient
areas are kept open for grazing.
- 58 -



Annex 3
D. Administrative and Implementation Arrangements for Timber Plantations Pilot Component
72.          This component will be under the overall direction of the CCF/Project Director and will be
implemented by existing staff of the PFD at headquarters and in the various plantations to be covered by studies
and/or demonstration of management systems. Technical assistance will be used for the following studies: (i)
environmental/biodiversity inventories and rapid socio-economic surveys covering all public sector plantations;
(ii) selection of three representative plantations for detailed implementation of a demonstration project on the
rehabilitation of plantations for multipurpose use (conservation and commercial); (iii) design of models for
financially and environmentally sustainable involvement of the private sector in plantation management; (iv)
design of rehabilitation and improvement plans for land and water resources of the plantations to maximize its
multipurpose output, biodiversity conservation in particular.
73.          Rehabilitation of water management and irrigation systems in selected plantations: this
rehabilitation will follow the methodology and criteria followed in the Second Irrigation System Rehabilitation
Project (ISRPII). PFD would obtain from the Punjab Irrigation Department all pertinent information,
specification and other model documents for adaptation to rehabilitation works in the irrigated plantations. PFD
would contract, through the use of TA and service funds, the assessment of water ditribution systems in the three
selected plantations and determine the nature and extent of problems with respect to needs under the proposed
land-use objectives of every compartment of the three plantations (as defined in IUCN's Study on Environmental
& Ecological Considerations for Management of Punjab's Irrigated Plantation, December,1994). This
preliminary survey work will result in a set of Condition Survey documents that will be submitted, along with
proposed solutions, to IDA for review and comment. At this stage, a formal determnination of respective
authorized entitlements for water of the three plantations will be required. Rehabilitation work will include canal
bank rehabilitation, and, if needed, restoring canal prisms to their normal section by cleaning or the use of brush
and stakes as sediment traps, modification of selected structures and outlets. No systematic, large scale lining of
canals will be implemented. Once the works have been approved by IDA they will be contracted out by PFD
according to IDA guidelines.
E. Accounts and Audit
74.          To facilitate timely project implementation, PFD will open a special account for IDA project
funds with the National Bank of Pakistan with an authorized allocation of US$800,000. An account will be
allocated to the office of the Project Director stationed at Lahore. This account will be used for both local and
foreign expenditures of less than US$100,000 equivalent under all categories. All expenditures above
US$100,000 could be submitted directly to IDA for payment without using funds from the special account after
the implementing agency has made project expenditures. PFD will submit applications for replenishment of the
account to IDA on a monthly basis (the minimum replenishment being US$50,000) or earlier if the account falls
below 50% of its allocation. This account, together with supporting documentation, including contributions from
the Provincial Government, and the Credit, will provide a comprehensive record of project financing and
expenditures. PFD will have the account audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards
consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA. PFD will submit to IDA certified
copies of the annual financial statements and Statements of Expenditure (SOEs), together with the auditor's
report, which would comment separately on the SOEs, no later than nine months after the close of each fiscal
year.

III. Implementation Schedule
The Timing of Project Events
75.                 The following table presents an indicative scheduling of the project's overall
implementation including procurement events, summary component activities and supervision. Using scheduling
software, PFD will establish a file similar to this one -- and other project component files as necessary -- at the
time of the project launch, taking into account IDA recommendations on the level of detail in which to define
some of the tasks. PFD will share this file or files with IDA, along with GIS and financial files, and produce
updated versions in time for IDA supervision missions.
The Use of Scheduling Software
76.          Scheduling software are computer applications for time management that facilitate the break down
of some project into a sequence of constituent tasks whose duration and relationship to one another can be
presented graphically in a chart. Such programs are useful for communicating the process by which a project is
to be implemented, but they typically have more powerful capabilities. They would likely also allow the linking
of resources to defined activities and so assist the planning of the use of available resources. After defining tasks
in appropriate detail, specifying task relationships and assigning resources to tasks, a manager using the software
could record data on the actual use of resources and the completion of tasks once the project is under way to
produce reports on the status of the project's implementation, including the rescheduling of planned tasks and
their completion times. In the present context, the PFD will use scheduling software to plan the activities of the
components in detail and to communicate information on their progress for its own use as the chief implementing
agency and for IDA's supervision of the project. The structure of tasks for the project's components can in turn
structure the use of a financial management software package, which would be used to provide the accounting
data that scheduling software files require in tracking the use of resources. The software would then be used to
produce reports that would expedite PFD's dialogue with IDA regarding the use of funds and disbursements.
77.          PFD will use scheduling software not only to schedule the implementation of individual project
components, but as a tool employed in combination with financial management and GIS software to track
changes in the state of forest sector against applications of resources under the project. The information on the
status of resource use and task completion which is stored in the MS Project file can be "exported" into the
tabular form of a data base. This data base can then be combined with others registering information associated
with geographic locations of interest to the project. The GIS software would then employ this extended data
base, which would also contain socio-economic data and sectoral monitoring data on the project's impact such as
indicators of the performance of farm forestry plantings, nurseries, the performance of COs, the status of joint
management agreements and rehabilitated range lands, etc., to convey information through maps. In combining
the use of software in this way, PFD will be able, for example, to show where in the province resources for
extension are employed and where changes in the farm production of wood by product and quantity are
occurring.
78.          For farm forestry, PFD can establish extension implementation schedules for separate divisions of
the province. These could then be combined as the subprojects of a provincial Project File. Project management
would likely also set up separate files for the scrub forests and rangelands in Pothwar and Thal, and, if
appropriate, for subregions within these two areas.

Annex 3
IV. Monitoring and Evaluation
A. Progress of Implementation
Monitoring Physical Achievements and Progress Reporting
79.          The project's monitoring system will be designed to record basic physical progress and financial
data required to assess the status of the project's implementation and evaluate its financial management. The
project management office will periodically report on the progress of project implementation, including actual
accomplishments versus planned tasks, and actual expenditures versus planned allocations.
80.          The project management unit will present these data in semi-annual reports, which will serve the
Bank as well as GOPunjab in providing a common frame of reference for analysis and decisions. The report's
summary of the project status will describe project implementation within the reference period, commenting on
the situation for each component and on progress of the project as a whole. They will indicate advances as
scheduled and agreed with the Bank, as well as the project's general impact to date. The report will provide
information on financial management. Questions and problems from prior reports will be addressed, and new
or remaining questions will also be discussed. Implementation and impact indicators will be provided in a
format to be designed and agreed upon at the time of the project's launch. The reports will also indicate the
status of compliance with legal covenants.
81.          The presentation of each semi-annual report should use the following outline:
1.    Executive Summary
2.    Project Status
- Implementation by Component
Implementation Indicators
Compliance with Legal Covenants
- Significant Developments since the Previous Report
3.    Project Administration
- Monitoring and Evaluation
- Coordination among Involved Institutions/Departments
4.    Financial Reporting
- Disbursements
- Acquisition Procedures
- Financial Reports
- Project Technical Assistance
5.    Project Evaluation
- Problems and Recommended Corrective Actions
82.          The semi-annual reports will include tables of implementation indicators, expenditure indicators
and status of legal covenant indicators.

Annex 3
Monitoring of Socioeconomic Benefits
83.          The project's monitoring will also link physical progress and financial monitoring with monitoring
that evaluates impacts on local communities and individual beneficiaries. The project will undertake
representative household surveys and field investigations to measure the impact with and without the project.
Special attention will be given to measuring changes in output due to investments in land development and to the
grazing management improvements introduced under the project. Household investigations will also measure
the project's impact on increasing household wealth and on improving access to public services. These data will
be retained in the project's overall information system to allow for the establishment of correlations between
investments and financial, economic and social benefits.
B. Management Information System
84.          The project will support the establishment of a computer-based Management Information System
(MIS) based on a set of related if not integrated personal computer software applications to facilitate the
management of financial, temporal and spatial information. The applications under consideration for
constituting the MIS are Microsoft Project, for computerized project management (CPM), Quicken, for
financial management, and ATLAS-GIS or Map Info, as a desktop GIS package.
85.          Microsoft Project could be used to facilitate overall project scheduling and detail planning of
subprojects such as the individual community developments under the social range and scrub forest component.
One of the attractive features of the software is its facility for relating time scheduling with resource use and
cost data. A number of Bank-financed projects are now employing the software; their experience will help
guide the design and use of implementation files for the present project.
86.          Quicken would standardize financial accounting and facilitate the production of reports organized
by expenditure class, procurement class, disbursement class, location, or client. The software would provide
the framework for developing a financial database of actual costs, resource use and disposition of assets.
87.          The GIS software would permit the storage of maps and the consolidation of various sets of
information associated with specific physical sites of the project's operation. Not only would the GIS be used
to document existing site conditions and changes in land characteristics and use under the project, as would be
required, for example, for the social range and scrub forest component, but it could also record the spatial
features of a wide range of project implementation activities, such as the introduction of various farm forestry
husbandry techniques, as well as of the project's impacts on economic, marketing and social conditions. As a
tool for synthesizing data collected in monitoring, the GIS could be used with the CPM, the financial accounting
software and possibly other software applications to portray when, where, by whom , for whom, and using what
resources and techniques project implementation is expected to occur and to compare actual versus planned
achievements against observed conditions following the completion of the project.
88.          The detailed specification of the MIS will begin at the time of the project launch and is expected
to be completed by the time of the first semi-annual review. The project will finance technical assistance to
design the MIS, install and adapt the software applications, and train project personnel.
C. Key Performance Indicators
89.          The remainder of this annex is a listing of possible project implementation and impact indicators
for use in the MIS. The indicators are not listed in any particular order of priority. The lists are not intended
be exhaustive accounts nor are all items to be considered necessary; although, strongly recommended items are

A. Overall Forest Sector
Human Resources in Punjab Forest Sector
Objective:         This consultancy aims at the improvement of the institutional set-up in the forestry sector
of Punjab by concentrating both on public sector institutions and the public at large. In
particular, a study will produce specific province-wide recommendations concerning: (i)
redistribution of roles between public sector forestry institutions and the private sector; (ii)
redefinition of roles within forestry agencies of the public sector; and (iii) required
governmental actions to support the role of public and private sector institutions involved
in the forestry sector in an economically efficient way. In addition, the consultants will
assist PFD in contracting out services for the preparation and mass diffusion of programs
promoting the conservation of forests and natural vegetation according to the
guidelines recommended for the implementation of Pakistan's National Conservation
Strategy (see IUCN: Implementation Design for the NCS of Pakistan January, 1992).
Study Methodology:
Sector Obiectives and Present Capacitv: Two working groups will be created in the Punjab
Forest Department (PFD). Group 1, at management level, will examine sector objectives
in the light of present and future provincial and national needs related to forestry. This
will include a review of policies, legal frameworks, responsibilities, comparative
advantages, linkages, structure and funding. Group I will define the forest sector for the
future regardless of constraints. Group 2 will concentrate on human resource issues
including staff numbers, education, training and experience profiles, deployment, job
descriptions, personnel policies, training opportunities and funding of training. The
findings of the two working groups would form the basis for a thorough review of human
resources and the institutional setting in which the human resources operate. The review
will include PFD, other government institutions and private sector institutions including
local rural communities.
Consensus Building Workshops: Series of working level workshops will be held to discuss
the working groups recommendations and reach provincial consensus (with Federal, NGO,
and popular participation) on the need for action and a time-table for implementation of
recommended changes. High level PFD and GOPunjab support to the recommended action
plan will be sought.
Duration:         to be initiated at project launching and will extend for a period of 12 months.

Objective:    The duties summarized here aim at: (i) assisting PFD in the execution of works and services for
the implementation of the pilot component on Irrigated Timber Plantations as prepared in the
plans designed for three selected plantations as detailed above; and (ii) evaluation of the results of
this demonstration component.
Duties:      For each of the three demonstration plantations the consultant will assist PFD in: (i) the
contracting out of services related to land and water system rehabilitation and management using
the guidelines and methodology followed in the Second Irrigation System Rehabilitation Project
(including assessment of water distribution systems and preparation of reports on land and water
systems condition surveys and proposed solutions for IDA review and comments--irrigation system
rehabilitation work will include canal bank rehabilitation, restoring canal prisms to their normal
section, and modification of selected structures and outlets. No systematic, large scale lining of
canals will be implemented); (ii) the contracting out of works for the rehabilitation of land and
water management systems in the plantations according to plans acceptable to IDA; (iii)
supervising these works as well as planting reforestation included in the demonstration component;
(iv) implementing selected organization and management arrangements with private sector and
local community involvement; (v) monitoring of relevant physical, socio-economic and financial
indicators of the pilot's impacts; (vi) evaluation of the pilot and dissemination of its results in to
stages--mid term review and at year 5 of project implementation; (vii) definition of policy
implications of the pilot component; and (viii) preparation of an action plan for the
implementation of these policy implications.
Duration:    The above activities will be implemented as soon as the detailed plans for the three selected
plantations have been finalized. It is expected that this work will extend for about 3 years.

ANNEX 5
DETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES
A. Price Contingencies
1.          The foreign cost component of the project's price contingencies are based on projections, current
as at May 1994, of changes in the World Bank's Manufactured Unit Value (MUV) index, which is based on
manufactured exports, expressed in U.S. dollars, from selected industrialized countries to developing countries.
2.          The projected rates of annual local inflation were provided by the Country Operations, Industry
and Finance Division, Country Department III (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) of the World Bank, and are
based on movements in the Consumer Price Index. Given these projections of foreign and domestic inflation,
movements in the nominal rupee/US$ exchange rate were estimated, assuming that the real effective exchange
rate remains constant.
3.          The inflation rates are yearly values within each project year, with project years corresponding to
fiscal years. Fiscal years start in Pakistan on July 1. The exchange rates used are constant purchasing parity
rates estimated for project-year midpoints. An exchange rate of Rs 30.0/US$ was applied at the time of data
collection to convert local and foreign exchange costs, while a rate of Rs 31.2/US$ was used to convert costs up
to the start of the project. The following table summarizes the parameters used:
Table 1. Inflation Rates and Exchange Rates Used in the Costings and
Project Analysis
Fiscal         Domestic       Foreign Inflation   Exchange Rate
Year           Inflation                            (Rs/US$)
1994/95          13.5              1.5                31.5
1995/96          9.5               1.8                32.8
1996/97          6.5               2.6                34.7
1997/98          6.3               2.5                36.0
1998/99          6.3               2.5                37.3
1999/2000        6.2               2.4                38.7
2000/01           6.0               2.4               39.7
4.          Four months were expected to pass from the time of the collection of data and the negotiation of
the loan. The Base Costs presented in the Detailed Cost Tables have been adjusted to account for inflation during
this period, i.e., base costs are values expected to be current for the beginning of December 1994. For domestic
- 97 -



Annex 5
costs, this adjustment was approximately 3.3 percent. The adjustment for the foreign exchange components of
costs was zero. An additional adjustment was made to the price contingency estimates to account for inflation in
the time between negotiations and the project start up (6 months). For local costs, this additional adjustment was
4 percent. Again there was no adjustment for foreign costs in this period.
5.            Cost estimates for incremental government staff are based on revised pay schedules as of June
1994. They are calculated on the midpoint monthly salary of the basic pay scale range and include allowances
of 40 percent of the basic pay for housing, travel, etc. Inflation rates of 2 percent within project years were
applied to these base costs, which reflects the general lag in the cost of living adjustments for civil service
employees.
6.            The compounded rates generally applied to base costs (plus physical contingencies) to arrive at
costs including price contingencies were the following:
Table 2. Compounded Inflation Weights (%)
1995/96       1996/97       1997198       1998199       1999/00      2000/01
foreign           1.5           3.4           6.1            8.7           11.4         14.1
local             7.9           16.5          23.9          31.7           40.0        48.6
Compounded rates of 9 percent and 8.1 percent were used to adjust local costs until the time of negotiations and
to the project start. The corresponding compounded rates for foreign cost adjustments were zero and 1.3 percent.
B. Physical Contingencies
7.            A general rate of 10 percent was applied to base costs for physical contingencies. A rate of 15
percent was used for most civil and field works. No physical contingencies were calculated for incremental staff
costs.

ANNEX 6
METHODOLOGICAL DETAILS OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1. Farm Forestry
A. Analytical Framework
1.          The analysis assumes that it is possible to define aggregated producers' profit, [I , in terms of
current price, output, the cost of establishing plantings several periods earlier and an additional cost for adjusting
the size of the growing stock in the current period:
I=pq,-vI- 2 CJ2
2
where p is the present value of fuelwood sold seven years after an initial investment, q, is the
quantity of wood produced at this time, v is the per unit of growing stock cost of investment, 1, is the investment
in growing stock measured in physical units and c is the unit cost of adjusting the size of the growing stock. All
values are to be interpreted in constant terms. Investment and the present value of wood will vary from period
to period, and so too the value of the profit function.
2.           Revenues are discounted by a annual rate of r, which the analysis assumes for Punjab to be 10
percent. The discounted price of fuelwood at a time t is therefore
Pr=  Pt-6  =pPC I
where
w_1
The supply of wood, q, is a linear production function of the growing stock:
q,=AK
where A is the period's productivity parameter and K is the growing stock.
3.           A change in the growing stock in a period is a result of investment (or disinvestment) and the
natural deterioration of the growing stock:
- 104 -



Annex 6
dK=k=X-6K
Here, 6 is the rate at which the growing stock is naturally decaying.
4.          The objective of the producer(s) is to maximize profit over all future periods, given the relation
between investment, decay and the rate of change in the growing stock. That is, to maximize
fU( t) e-rdt
0
such that
K=I -8K
The associated Hamiltonian is therefore
H=e'rM+A (I-6K)
The variable multiplying the second term in parentheses, X, is the Lagrange multiplier for the
investment condition. The variables n, x, I and K vary over time.
5.          From the Euler equation, the conditions of optimality imply that
I=   Ap   _ v=  ApP  _ v
c(r+6) c c(r+6) c
Noting that
dt   dt
the change in the growing stock at a time t becomes
k*= A(pP - V_6Kc
C(-+8)    c
- 105 -



Annex 6
This is a differential equation in two of the state variables of interest: the growing stock, K, and
the price, P.
6.           In the simulation of the development of the growing stock and the movement of prices with and
without the project, the cost of investment, v, varies from Rs 1 1.9 per ton of growing stock to Rs 17.7 as the
seedling subsidy is gradually phased out. This corresponds to an initial seedling price of Rs 2.1 per planting
without the subsidy. This price includes the cost of replacing failures (20 percent of the seedlings in the first
year of planting). Other costs initially amount to approximately Rs 2.45 per planting for other inputs and for
labor employed in planting, maintenance and protection. [This calculation uses a conversion ratio of four
established trees per ton of growing stock, seven years after planting.] With the project and the development of
competitive private nurseries, the seedling cost is expected to decline. Other costs per planting are likely to
increase somewhat as farmers learn to intensify their tree management. Without the project, the subsidization of
seedlings is expected to continue for period in which the project would be implemented. The investment cost
without the project is then initially Rs 9.9 per ton of growing stock (farmers continue to pay for all other costs),
then about Rs 18 when the subsidy discontinues, it is assumed, six years later.
7.           The productivity parameter, A, like the cost of investment, v, is a short time constant in the
equation. It may change period to period as an external input to the mechanism that governs the farmers'
investment decision. Within each period it is treated as a "given". Under the project, the productivity of farm
plantings is posited to improve by about 25 percent through the application of superior husbandry techniques and
the use of genetically superior planting material. In the present framework, this is quantified as a change in the
A from 0.14 to 0.175 tons of wood produced yearly per ton of growing stock. The analysis phases in this
productivity improvement over a period of 6 years, as the trees established during the project's implementation
period graduate into the pool of growing stock on farms. Without the project, the productivity parameter
remains constant at 0.14.
8.           A second equation in the two state variables is needed to calculate a solution. This is provided by
having the price adjust to excess demand, that is, to the gap between the quantity of wood provided from the
farms and the quantity that consumers in the aggregate would purchase at a given price.
dP=P=t [qd_q,l
where q, is the quantity demanded and , is the speed at which the price is adjusting to the gap
between q, and q, in the period. From HESS data, it appears that over the last ten to fifteen years the real price
of fuelwood has been adjusting very slowly -- less than one percent a year. The analysis reflects this features in
using a value that would fit these observations and the expected adjustment given the current estimated gap
between current supply and unconstrained demand.
9.           The unconstrained demand for wood is found in estimating an aggregated demand schedule. A
linear relation is assumed:
P=ao -ald
- 106 -



Annex 6
where a,, the slope, is positive. A plot of the schedule produces the expected downward sloping
demand curve (here a straight line) with the curve intersecting the price axis at a,. The quantity demanded at a
given price, P, is therefore
ao-P
a,
With population growth, the demand schedule is shifting outward, so from one period to the next
more wood is demanded at any given price. As long as the slope of the demand schedule remains constant for
the timeframe of the analysis, the price intercept will move proportionately to the population growth rate. This
means that given an initial intercept of a, at time 0, the intercept increases at the rate of growth of the
population. So at time t, the position of the intercept is
ao =aOinitial eg
Substituting this relation into the equation above, the price change at time t after a specified initial
time is given by
p  p[a.i.iti.le   t-P Kt
al
The slope of the schedule is expected to be small to reflect the observed high rate of substitution
between purchased fuelwood and other fuels.
10.          With assignments for v, A, c, ao ini.j1 a1, r, and 8, the two-equation differential system in K and P
can be solved given a starting point for the growing stock and price. The starting point would be selected eight
years from now, which would be the time, if the project proceeds on schedule, when the trees established during
the first year of the project join the pool of growing stock from which wood is harvested on a sustainable basis.
The solutions for K for years 7 to 20 then indicate how many established trees are present in years I to 14. The
difference in the number of established trees from one period to the next indicates the progression of new
plantings.
B. Parameter Assignments
I.          For the analysis, this initial condition was estimated to be about 21.7 million tons and Rs 1000/t at
a point seven years from the start of the project (eight years from the present). The initial demand schedule
intercept at this time was estimated at 4000. The following is a summary of the parameter value assignments
used for differential system:

Like Ko and P0, the assignments for the productivity parameter A refer to a starting point eight years from now.
12.            With these assignments, a Runge-Kutta algorithm  was used to solve numerically the differential
equations. The results were interpreted to provide indicative projections of the numbers of trees on farms, the
wood produced and the wood price movement for the next twenty years with and without the project, with and
without the current policy regime for seedling subsidies. The projections for wood production and it price were
then used to estimate the year-by-year consumer surplus (deficit) that the alternative imply.

Annex 6
C. Results
13.          The simulation implies that without the project, farmers will be planting out between 40 to 50
million seedlings a year over the first six years. With the project, planting is higher as farmers respond more to
increases in the productivity of their investments than to the subsidization of seedlings. The wood price does not
change sharply, but in the with project situation is also lower period by period as compared to without the
project. This could be explained by noting that the increases in productivity of the growing stock lowers the cost
of investment for the farmer per unit of output, and so stimulates more investment. Larger supplies of wood
decrease excess demand and lead to a decrease in the wood price. In comparison, the seedling subsidy has a
weaker effect in encouraging investment. In general, the behavior of the system appears consistent with
observations and with short-term expectations of the forest department regarding the take up of seedlings by
farmers.
14.          The behavior of the differential system fairly well reflects the stylized facts of recent farm forestry
plantings and price movements. The analysis does not claim to present a comprehensive set of causal
relationships that explain investment behavior, but it does demonstrate a logical mechanism that mirrors the
rationale of the component and offers sufficient, monitorable conditions for affirming a decision to accept the
project.
15.          The increased plantings with the project resulting from the solution of the differential system
mean that there are incremental farm investment costs in aggregate. These were included up to year 14 so that
corresponding benefits appear within the twenty-year time horizon of the analysis. The analysis also included the
project costs of forestry extension and research, and recurrent costs that decrease over time. Re-investment in
stands has been accounted for in the projected development of the standing stock (this was part of the investment
decision entailing the farmers' optimization of profit for each period).
16.          Base Rate of Return. Given the solutions of the analysis, given the information available, the base
financial rate of return to the farm forestry development is estimated at about II percent. If one includes the
value of the resources saved by the government through the removal of the seedling subsidies as incremental
resources available to the government for development, the rate of return increases to about 14 percent. The
base economic internal rate of return, excluding the value of additional resources released to the government in
phasing out the seedling subsides over the project period is estimated at 14.5 percent. Including the value of
additional resources to the government, the rate of return is estimated at about 19 percent.
17.          Alternative assignments for the parameters in the equations are possible, but solutions appear not
to be stable for wide departures from the values used in the analysis. The analysis concludes that the targets of
the project have some likelihood of turning out an acceptable economic result in increasing the standing stock of
trees on farms and in lowering the cost of fuelwood to consumers. Additional environmental benefits and the
incremental availability of resources for development investments further increase the probability that the rate of
return of the component would exceed ten percent.
11. Social Range and Scrub Forests
A. Analytical Framework
Productivity and Incomes without the Project
18.          The villages to be targeted are expected to have grazing areas, including those in scrub forests,
averaging 300 hectares per community on the Pothwar Plateau and 600 hectares per community in Thai. For the
- 109 -



Annex 6
analysis the communities in Pothwar without the project keep on average 750 animals, measured in sheep units
(SUs) per community, on the given size of total community grazing area, and for Thai communities keep on
average 1066 animals per community.
19.         The stocking of animals on the grazing areas breaks down as follows. Of the 300 hectares of
grazing areas per community for Pothwar, about 225 ha are expected to consist of pastures while 75 ha would
fall in scrub forests. The perennial forage biomass of the Pothwar pastures is estimated at 300 kg/ha. Scrub
forest perennial forage biomass is estimated at 500 kg/ha, not all of which is of high digestibility. On average
three SUs would be stocked per hectare of pasture and one animal would be supported on average in the scrub
forests. In total, about 675 SUs would be stocked on pastures per community in Pothwar and 75 SUs would be
grazed in scrub forests. For Thai, perennial forage biomass production is estimated at 200 kg/ha for pastures and
about 333 kg/ha for forests. Of the average herd of 1066 SUs per community in Thal considered here, about
1000 SUs would be found on pastures and 66 SUs would use the forests (a total forest area of about 100 ha).
Present Incomes from Livestock
20.          From the surveys it has been determined that sales of culls from the herd provide on average Rs
52.5 per SU. The off take is estimated at 5%. Approximately 0.6 kilograms of wool per SU provide an income
of Rs 8.2 per SU. Households consume about 1.25 kilograms of meat per SU, which is valued at about Rs
32.80. The total value of income per SU is therefore estimated at about Rs 94.50. As mentioned above, the
analysis shows this revenue as slowly declining over the next 20 years to reflect worsening trends in forage
utilization, animal nutrition and husbandry standards.
Present Costs of Production
21.          Present labor requirements, supplied by adults and children, are estimated at 2.43 mandays per SU.
At a wage of Rs 63/day, the full value of this labor amounts to about Rs 153 per SU.
Current Net Revenue from Livestock
22.          With a full costing of the labor employed, the present net revenue from livestock is negative,
which is consistent with observations of the frequency of women, children and elderly engaged in minding the
animals. In general, women's time is not valued as highly as men's, and where possible, many men avoid
working with the livestock and seek employment outside the village.
Productivity and Incomes with the Project
Sources of Benefits
23.          Under the project total perennial forage biomass would increase, first of all, on improved pastures
and then on unimproved areas following changes in the management of grazing. For Pothwar the production
from improved pastures (75 ha per community on average) is estimated to reach about 2.4 t/ha. Perennial forage
biomass for unimproved pastures (150 ha) and for treated scrub forests (75 ha) would rise to about 600 kg/ha
and 1000 kg/ha, respectively. Stocking on improved pastures could increase to about 4 SU/ha, while 2 SU/ha
would be stocked in the unimproved pastures and in the treated scrub forests. With these stocking rates, the total
number of animals stocked would match the number held without the project. Adding in some incremental
forage production on farms, total perennial forage biomass would increase, indicatively, from about 105 tons for
the total grazing area without the project to about 405 tons with the project. For Thal perennial forage biomass
would increase from 200 kg/ha to 1.5 t/ha on improved pastures (250 ha) and from 200 kg/ha to 400 kg/ha on
unimproved pastures (250 ha) following changes in the management of grazing. In improved scrub forests (100
- 110 -



Annex 6
ha) perennial forage biomass is expected to increase from about 333 kg/ha to about 600 kg/ha. Total forage
biomass per community in Thal would therefore improve from about 133 t without the project to approximately
541 t with the project. Stocking on improved pastures would increase from 2 SU/ha to 2.5 SU/ha. Stocking on
the unimproved pastures and improved scrub forest areas would increase from about 0.66 SU/ha to 1.33 SU/ha.
24.          The changes in grazing management would likely include the closure of some areas at the start,
and some destocking might be required. This is reflected in the analysis and represents an increase in
incremental costs with the project in the form of foregone income. In the medium term, however, animal
populations with the project are allowed to be at least as high as current estimates.
25.          In addition to the income from livestock, villages should also profit from the incremental
production of wood from afforested scrub forest areas. The scrub forest improvements under the project are
expected to add an average of 370 trees per hectare. Roughly thirty of these trees per hectare could be harvested
each year and replanted, stalting after ten years, to sustain an incremental supply of about 1000 tons of fuelwood
for the village. The average yield per tree is expected to be 1.85 maunds (74 kg). The income from this harvest
was valued at Rs 25 per maund (or Rs 0.66 per kilogram at the farmgate).
Incomes from Livestock with the Project
26.          With the improved availability of forage and nutrition under the project, it is expected that culled
animals could achieve a 20 percent increase in weight and that the offtake can increase to 25 percent. These
changes alone would increase the value of income from the herd by about Rs 236 per SU over five years, and
this increment should be realized as cash. The analysis has ignored increases in marketed wool and quantities of
meat consumed by households.
Net Revenue with the Project
27.          Five years after the investment, if works are completed in one season, villages are expected to
earn incremental income of about Rs 103,880 (US$ 3,351) in Pothwar and Rs 134,370 (US$4,334) in Thai from
their livestock, which would amount to an increase of about Rs 138 (US$ 5.5) per SU in Pothwar and Rs 123
(US$4) per SU in Thai. The value of incremental wood produced from the afforested areas would eventually
bring the community's incremental net income to approximately Rs 211,480 (US$6,822) in Pothwar and to about
Rs 244,270 (US$7,880) in Thai. Assuming an average of 200 households per community, incremental net
income would then amount to about US$34 per household in Pothwar and about US$39 per household in Thal
(see Appendix 1, first pages of Tables 4 and 6). If for rural households in these area per capita income is
estimated at half the national average of US$400, the project impact calculated here would represent an increase
in household incomes of less than 20 percent: the scale of calculated incremental net benefits considered here,
given the level of investments envisioned for the component, would probably not be an unreasonably high
expectation.
B. Results
28.          Project financial internal rates of return (IRRs) were estimated for the developments involving 68
communities in Pothwar and 32 communities in Thal. Part of project costs for community extension, including
the purchase and operation of heavy equipment, vehicles, the construction of staff offices and housing, equipment
and tools, technical assistance, training, incremental staff salaries and other overhead expenses were apportioned
to the two areas. Residual values for heavy equipment, vehicles and office equipment partially offset incremental
project costs at the end of the project's implementation period. For the Pothwar development the financial
internal rate of return was estimated at approximately 17 percent. For Thal, the IRR was estimated to be 15
- 111 -

percent. The rate of return of the component as a whole is estimated at 16 percent (the calculation is displayed
in Appendix 1, Table 8). This result is not very sensitive to small variations in the benefit or cost streams.
29.          For the economic analysis livestock revenue was converted into its economic value using a
conversion factor of 0.60, which was derived from a calculation of the average import parity value of mutton
produced in barani areas in central Punjab. Using economic values for inputs, outputs and project costs, the
economic intemal rate of return (ERR) for Pothwar was estimated at 15 percent and for Thai at 11 percent. The
rate of return for the component in aggregate amounts to about 12 percent. See Appendix I, Tables 4 and 6 for
the calculations of the economic budgets of grazing and husbandry development in Pothwar and Thai. Annex 6,
Appendix 1, Table 7 presents the calculation of the analysis.

1/ The landed cost of pulp at Karachi over the last x years has declined
to about $400/t from $900/t in step with cyclic trends in the world market.
The present price of kraft wood pulp of about $400 -$450/t is thought
to mark the trough of the current cycle. The cif cost used here is an estimate
of the minimum average cost of imported pulp required over the project period.
The feasibility of this import price must be matched against the expectations of
North and South American pulp industry export price projections.
2/ Estimated at Rs 0.41/tUkm for approximately 1200 km.
3/ Estimated at approximately $550/t pulp including capital charges
and an operating margin of $100/t to obtain a minimum return on a 100-150 TPD
plant investment (employing used European equipment) of $20 million.
