(NSP) for Guinea was unsatisfactory. The project\n            failed to achieve its main objectives, institutional\n            development was negligible, sustainability is unlikely, and\n            the performance of the Bank was unsatisfactory while the\n            Borrower's was marginally satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, any new large scale\n            activity should be preceded by and tested in a pilot\n            operation. Second, agricultural support services\n            interventions should be sequenced in a logical manner. In\n            the NSP, production and marketing activities should have\n            been undertaken only after an apparent increase was seen in\n            the demand for improved seeds and the use of complementary\n            farm inputs. Third, private operators should be involved\n            from the outset in a project aimed at developing the private\n            sector. Finally, Borrower commitment to the project is\n            essential for successful implementation and achievement of\n            project objectives. In the NSP, success was compromised by\n            the Government's failure to replace NSP's weak\n            management and provide counterpart funds in a timely manner."}, "docdt": "1996-07-26T00:00:00Z"}
