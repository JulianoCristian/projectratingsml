period, set up the first national improved seed\n            production system in Guinea.  It will serve as a catalyst of\n            ongoing activities and will build on existing institutions\n            to identify, produce and distribute improved rice, maize and\n            groundnuts seed.  This will contribute to an increase in\n            foodcrop production and farmers' income.  The project\n            will be implemented through (a) strengthening the Ministry\n            of Rural Development's research stations; (b) setting\n            up strategically located Seed Conditioning Centers; (c)\n            establishing seed quality control facilities; and (d)\n            training staff to carry out selection, base and improved\n            seed production and quality control activities.  Finally,\n            the project will entail (e) providing an organization and\n            management system that will ensure the control and\n            coordination of country-wide seed production activities."}, "docdt": "1987-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
