Following are the\n            project components. 1) The establishment of the Societe du\n            Patrimonie des Eaux du Niger (SPEN), will require technical\n            advisory assistance, and staff training, to attain the\n            complexities of institutional reforms, new tariff\n            structures, and concessionary, and regulatory framework\n            regarding water sales. Studies will be financed on water\n            resource management, i.e., an analysis of alternative\n            strategies, and, integrated monitoring of groundwater\n            pollution in shallow aquifers. 2) Based on technical studies\n            which have identified sector investment needs, urban water\n            networks will be extended, coverage, and private connections\n            increased, and evaluation of service delivery will follow.\n            Included are technical studies, supervision of works, and\n            procurement planning. 3) Extension of rural water supply\n            facilities, management development, and sanitary hygiene,\n            and health education will prod private, and community\n            participation. 4) The urban sanitation pilot program\n            includes rehabilitation/construction of latrines, of school\n            sanitation, stakeholder capacity building, and urban\n            sanitation. 5) An environmental development program will\n            support improved living conditions, through appropriate\n            wastewater disposal, to protect groundwater pollution,\n            improve sanitation systems, and health aspects."}, "docdt": "2001-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
