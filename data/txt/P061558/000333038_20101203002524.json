for\n            Niger were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: private sector\n            participation is a feasible delivery option even in a poor\n            country like Niger, which was able to attract international\n            competition for urban water services and at the same time\n            was able to promote local private operators for rural\n            facilities. Rehabilitation investments, which are critical\n            to the improvement of the services in the context of a\n            Public-Private Partnership (PPP), should be delegated to the\n            lease contractor. This will ensure timely execution and\n            avoid conflicts with the asset-holding companies, which tend\n            to favor large-scale investments. Regulation by contract can\n            coexist with an independent regulatory agency. An\n            independent regulator which does not rely on extensive and\n            discretionary powers, but on adequate regulatory tools (the\n            financial model) can effectively act in favor of the\n            development of water services. Project Coordination Units\n            (PCUs) should not be assimilated to Project Implementation\n            Units (PIUs). PCUs do not act as substitutes to Government\n            departments or agencies and do not hamper capacity building;\n            they are simply a very effective tool for coordinating\n            multi-agency, multi-donors programs."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
