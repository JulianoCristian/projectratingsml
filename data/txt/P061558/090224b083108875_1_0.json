Water shortages\n            were frequent in the service area, including Niamey the\n            capital city. Government interference had led to high\n            management instability and an overstaffing of the water\n            utility. The Niger Water Sector Project (WSP) supported by\n            the World Bank provided access to safe water and improved\n            sanitation services in urban towns and rural areas. The\n            targeted population benefited from better living conditions\n            and environmental health. The Bank played a leading role in\n            the policy dialogue with the government on the sector reform\n            and coordinated efficiently with other donors involved in\n            the project. As a result, more than half a million people\n            gained access to piped water. Other beneficiaries included\n            rural community members, including Water Users'\n            Associations (WUA), craftsmen, small-scale enterprises,\n            local consulting firms and, Non-Governmental Organizations\n            (NGOs), whose capacities have increased through the urban\n            sanitation pilot program and the rural water and sanitation\n            component. The project aims to support the government of\n            Niger\u2019s efforts towards achieving the Millennium Development\n            Goals (MDG), developing infrastructure and improving the\n            business environment."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T05:13:00Z"}
