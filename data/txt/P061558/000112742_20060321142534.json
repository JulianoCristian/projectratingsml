It is anticipated that\n            groundwater stability, surface waters, and related\n            ecosystems will be endangered due to sewerage works;\n            wastewater discharges will affect both urban, and rural\n            environments; income revenues will be affected by the loss\n            of productive agricultural land; and, public health may be\n            temporarily affected as a result of unsafe sanitary\n            conditions. Mitigation measures include: 1) regular\n            systematic monitoring of groundwater, and aquifers, to\n            ensure long-term safety of the water resources, to be\n            controlled by the Ministry of Water Resources; 2) water\n            treatment facilities will be designed to control sludge\n            disposal, under the aegis of the Ministry of Hydraulics,\n            and, appropriate technical specifications within the bidding\n            documents will enforce sludge treatment processes, for the\n            safe production of drinking water; 3) compensation for land,\n            or income losses, will be reimbursed by the Societe du\n            Patrimonie des Eaux du Niger; 4) public awareness, and\n            sanitary hygiene education will be promoted to minimize\n            health hazards. Precautionary clauses in the bidding\n            documents will ensure air, and noise abatement, to ease\n            temporary construction nuisances; and; 5) vegetative\n            propagation, and reforestation will be implemented under the\n            supervision of the Ministry of Water Resources."}, "docdt": "2000-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
