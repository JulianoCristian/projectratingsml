1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Sector Background

By the turn of the century, the development of the water supply and sanitation sector
(WSS) in Niger was facing critical challenges in terms of viability and sustainability.

The access rate to safe water in urban areas served by the National Water Corporation
(SNE) was estimated in 2000 at 76 percent 1 , but SNE was unable to deliver on its
objectives in terms of development and operational performance. Government
interference had led to high management instability and an overstaffing of the utility.
The financial situation of the company was undermined by inadequate cost recovery
policies and the accumulation of arrears from public customers. By 1996, urban water
investments came to a standstill, as the Government and donors recognized that SNE was
no longer a credible recipient of external funding and that sectoral reform was urgently
needed. A substantial backlog of investments resulted, since SNE was not in a position
to finance significant renewal and system expansion. Consequently, water shortages
were frequent in the capital city and only 45 percent of the urban population had
affordable access to household connections and standposts. The remainder had to rely on
vendors, neighbors and other sources (wells) for their water supplies, which entailed a
significant financial burden.

The access rate to safe water in rural areas was estimated in 2000 at 52 percent, but
taking into account the actual availability of rural water facilities, the effective access rate
was only 36 percent. The development of services, led by the Ministry of Water
Resources (Ministère des Ressources en Eau, MRE), was hampered by the absence of
guidelines on the participation of beneficiaries, inconsistencies in the legal framework on
the responsibilities of central and local governments, and the lack of accountability.
Community management --through village management committees that were often
under the control of village chiefs-- had not resulted, as expected, in improving the
availability of rural water facilities. Most open wells were adequately maintained, but
maintenance of hand pumps and operation of small piped systems faced a number of
problems.

Access to improved sanitation was even less developed. Surveys carried out in 2001
showed that in Niamey, only one-third of the population was satisfied with their
sanitation systems. About 90 percent relied on traditional latrines and 8 percent on pour-
flush latrines. Only 8 percent of schools had adequate sanitation facilities. Very few
pilot sanitation projects had been executed, mainly by NGOs. Niamey, Zinder, and
Maradi had prepared urban and sanitation master plans, but these plans could not be

economically justified solely on the basis of the construction of conventional sewer
networks, as proposed, and no investments had been made up to then. Ground and
surface water pollution, mainly from lack of adequate sanitation facilities, was of
increasing concern.

Government strategy

Urban Water Supply. In 1999, the Government had initiated urban water sector reform
to improve the technical and financial performance of the sector, with a view to:
(i) reducing operating costs; (ii) introducing private sector commercial management; (iii)
increasing water coverage through the development of production and distribution
systems and quality improvements; and (iv) reaching financial autonomy in the medium-
term to support implementation of investment programs without resorting to Government
subsidies. The reform was part of a global private sector participation (PSP) program
that was supported by the Privatization and Regulatory Reform Technical Assistance
Project (Cr. 3130-NE).

contract was selected as the appropriate PSP option. The new institutional framework
involved four main actors: (a) the Government, responsible for defining sector policy,
managing water resources, and developing tariff policy (taking into account socio-
economic constraints and the need for financial equilibrium in the sector); (b) the Multi-
sector Regulatory Agency (Autorité de regulation multi-sectorielle, ARM), responsible
for developing a regulatory framework, monitoring urban water services and contractual
arrangements among stakeholders; (c) a public asset holding company, Société de
Patrimoine des Eaux du Niger (SPEN), responsible for investments; and (d) a private
operator, to be selected after competitive bidding, in charge of delivering services. SPEN
and the Government were to enter into a concession contract, complemented by a
Framework Agreement (Contrat-Plan) designed to monitor their respective commitments
to the development of services, whereas the private operator (owned in majority by an
international professional partner) was to enter in a 10-year lease contract with the
Government and SPEN complemented by a Performance Contract.

SPEN was created in August 2000. The professional international partner was selected in
December 2000. The lease contract was signed with the private operator, Société
d'exploitation des eaux du Niger (SEEN), on March 20, 2001.

Rural Water Supply. The MRE was aware of the mixed results of past investments. It
was willing to revise its rural water and sanitation strategy by drawing lessons from
initiatives tested in the sector with respect to the decentralization of decision making, the
participation of beneficiaries in project design and programming, as well as systematic
use of local contractors and consultants. The preparation in 1999-2000 of the Master
Plan for the Development and Management of Water Resources (financed by UNDP)
created an opportunity to formulate new basic principles for the development of the
sector: (a) water facilities should be owned and developed by water users; (b) private
sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should assist communities in

                                             2
designing and operating facilities; and (c) the regional offices of the MRE (Directions
Départementales des Ressources en Eau, DDREs) should focus on implementing and
monitoring the national water policy.

Urban Sanitation. A strategy for Urban Environment Management was prepared under
the Bank-supported Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2957-NE, closed
March 31, 2003). In an effort to effectively deal with existing sanitary conditions, the
strategy included a variety of technical options to be used in appropriate locations. The
Government's strategy emphasized hygiene education and provided adequate scope for
operation and maintenance of sanitation facilities and ways in which payment for
installation, operation and maintenance costs could be made by beneficiaries. The new
sanitation strategy would take into account coordination and allocation of responsibilities
within the Government and municipalities, the integration of sector responsibilities, and
possible identification of a lead agency.

The Government eventually embodied the above-mentioned strategies in two Sector
Policy Letters (one for the urban water sub-sector, one for the rural water sub-sector) that
were issued on March 8, 2001. The Letters reiterated the Government's commitment to
the reforms' objectives. The Urban Water Policy Letter also included action plans to
ensure the viability of the sub-sector through: (i) a series of measures to ensure timely
and regular payment of water bills, and to reduce the water consumption of Government
agencies; the private operator would also be authorized to disconnect Government
agencies if bills were not paid (with a few strategic exceptions, the so-called "bonded
customers"2); and (ii) gradual adjustment of water tariffs so that the sub-sector could
achieve financial equilibrium by the year 2006. The first tariff increase (5 percent)
occurred in February 2000 (before the private operator's appointment) so as to avoid the
perception that the reform was the cause for the tariff increase. The Government
requested donors' support to implement this sector policy through a new operation.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The new project was fully consistent with the sector strategy and with the Bank Group's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved on November 11, 1997 (Document No.
IDA/R97/127), which emphasized the critical importance of water supply and water
management. Following extensive national consultations during the CAS preparation
process, increasing access to safe water was identified as one of the three major
objectives of Bank's assistance. In addition, the proposed project would support and
facilitate private sector participation in urban water supply which was prepared, as
mentioned above, under the Privatization and Regulatory Reform Technical Assistance
Project, in line with another central objective of the CAS, i.e. to promote open
economic policies. The quality of the sectoral dialogue that was initiated during the


2
  Bonded customers were priority customers (hospitals, barracks) that could not be cut-off and for which
the Government gave a guarantee of payment of water consumption within two months of reception of
bills; other public customers could be cut-off for non-payment, as well as the private customers.


                                                   3
preparation of the PSP and the trust it had generated were key factors in the decision to
continue and expand the Bank's support to the sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The objective of the project is to increase sustainable and efficient access to improved
potable water supply and sanitation services in urban and rural areas of its territory
through: (a) improving water production and distribution efficiency and providing
affordable sanitation services; (b) strengthening the institutional capacity in the areas of
regulatory oversight and policy formulation, monitoring and regulation; and (c)
rehabilitating rural water facilities, developing on-site sanitation services, and
implementing community-based management of rural water facilities involving private
sector participation.

Key performance indicators selected for measuring and monitoring progress towards
achieving project's development objective include the following:
 Additional number of people with access to safe water in urban areas;
 Access rate to piped water facilities in rural areas covered by the project;
 Additional number of people benefiting from on-site sanitation services in the peri-
   urban areas of Niamey covered by the project; and
 Financial equilibrium of the urban water sub-sector.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The Project Development Objective was not revised. However, target values of the key
indicators related to the access to services were revised in 2006 to reflect the scaling up
of activities that would result from the Additional Financing (AF).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Primarily, the project was to provide: (i) access to safe water in urban areas to 230,000
additional people (the target was increased to 380,000 people after the AF); (ii) access to
on-site sanitation for 40,000 additional people in Niamey (125,000 people after the AF);
and (iii) access to safe water for 55 percent of the population in rural areas covered by the
project (75 percent after the AF). The entire urban population served by SEEN was also
to benefit from a 24-hour water service. The targeted population was to benefit from
better living conditions and better environmental health. In addition, getting water
services closer to households through the social connections program and the standpipes
financed by the project, would limit reliance on costly water vendors. The financial
burden of water expenses on family budgets would be reduced and households would be
able to consume more water3.

3
 The urban household surveys carried out during project preparation in Niamey showed that half of the
households that were not connected to the network spent 10 percent of their monthly budget on water.

                                                 4
Other beneficiaries included craftsmen, small-scale enterprises, local consulting firms
and NGOs, and communities: their capacities were to increase through training and
participation to the urban sanitation pilot program and to the rural water and sanitation
component. Rural community members, including water users' associations (WUA),
would benefit in the long-term from an enhanced network of formal and informal
institutions that would help plan, install, and provide maintenance of infrastructure
facilities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The total project costs (including taxes and duties) amounted to US$79.4 million, which
was co-financed by the French Development Agency (AFD), the West African
Development Bank (BOAD), the Republic of China, the Borrower and the Private
Operator (SEEN). The project included five components, as follows:

                                                            IDA         Other Financing

1.7 Other Significant Changes

On January 30, 2006, the Borrower requested additional financing because: (i) project
activities in secondary urban centers were facing cost overruns; and (ii) the urban
population expressed a stronger than expected demand for the social water connections
and the on-site sanitation facilities. The Bank reviewed the Government request and
found that (i) the cost overruns were beyond the Government's control (see Section 2.2,
Factors that gave rise to problems in implementation); (ii) urban households had already
mobilized contributions to support the additional demand for connections and sanitation
facilities; and (iii) additional funds were not readily available from the national budget or
the co-financiers, whereas the original IDA funds were already fully committed. The
Bank agreed to provide additional financing in the form of a Grant of SDR 7 million
(US$10 million equivalent) to inter alia complete the works in 12 secondary centers, to
construct 5,600 additional social connections, 70 standpipes and 4,000 additional
sanitation facilities and to rehabilitate eight water systems in secondary urban centers.
These activities were in line with the original PDO and project components and were
appraised on April 14, 2006. The Additional Financing was approved on July 18, 2006
and became effective on March 14, 20074. The original Development Credit Agreement
was amended to reflect a new closing date, December 31, 20095.

The five project components were allocated additional funding as shown in the below
table:

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project was based on a sound analysis of the urban and rural water and sanitation
sectors, and on lessons learned from projects implemented in a similar context. A
qualified team with the required skills was in charge of project preparation, which
benefited from the sector knowledge accumulated during the preparation of the Public-
Private-Partnership (PPP) under the Privatization and Regulatory Reform Technical
Assistance Project and the implementation of the Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project (see Section 1.1, Government Strategy). Technical studies for most of the
activities that were contemplated under the urban water supply component were readily
available. The background analysis was complemented by an assessment of the rural
piped water systems and various surveys and studies of the improvements of services,
which were carried out using a participative approach to meet the demand of the
beneficiaries (see this Section 2.1, Participatory Process). Safeguards issues were also
covered based on an appropriate participatory process with all stakeholders. The project
was the first project in Niger to obtain a certificate of conformity from the Environmental
Appraisal Office (BEEEI).
 
Lessons learned from water sector operations with Private Sector Participation in West
African countries (notably Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, and Senegal) had been reflected in the
design of the urban water supply PPP. These lessons included: (i) the use of a detailed
financial model as a transparent regulatory and management tool to monitor progress in
achieving financial equilibrium; (ii) the inclusion of strong financial incentives in the
lease contract with the private operator in order to reduce the unaccounted-for water and
increase the efficiency of bill collection, (iii) measures to improve payment performance
of Government water bills by reducing water consumption of public agencies and
enforcing coercive measures against non-paying public customers; and (iv) the
importance of the timely provision of planned investments in infrastructure rehabilitation
and expansion to achieve planned operational improvements.

One key lesson, which had hampered the smooth execution of previous PPPs, was the
importance of a timely provision of rehabilitation investments. Whenever these
investments are outside the control of the private operator, implementation delays could
lead to conflicts, as performance objectives would not be met. To reduce this risk, it was
agreed that key interventions in the rehabilitation of the existing water distribution
networks, and associated funding would be the responsibility of the private operator. The
private operator would also execute part of the new capital investment program that was
related to small extensions of the water distribution networks, on behalf of SPEN.

The strong linkage between the previous Bank operations mentioned above and the
proposed project reinforced the rationale for the Bank's intervention, as well as the Bank
team's experience in playing a leading role in projects dealing with multiple agencies and
donors.



                                            7
Project design, objectives and organization were realistic and took into account the
complexity of activities. Project preparation took also into consideration the inherent
complexity of the project, with activities scattered throughout the country and
implemented by multiple agencies: SPEN for urban water component, the Directorate of
Inventory and Management (Direction de l'Inventaire et de la Gestion des Ouvrages
Hydrauliques, DIGOH) for the rural component, the Directorate of Construction of New
Water Works (Direction des Travaux Neufs d'Alimentation en Eau Potable, DTNAEP)
for the sanitation component and the MRE and the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) for
the capacity building component. The project design and objectives gave a clear priority
to the urban water component and to the facilitation of the PPP, but also aimed at
assigning a significant impact to the rural component and at ensuring that the pilot
sanitation program would be easily replicable. The use of a small PCU in charge of
project monitoring, reporting and financial management, which proved to be efficient in
Senegal, was replicated under the Niger project, with an additional mission to provide
quality control of the procurement by relatively inexperienced departments of MRE. In
addition, implementation of the challenging on-site sanitation program, which entailed
multiple actors and a variety of tasks, was to be coordinated by a NGO with adequate
experience in small urban works.

Government's commitment and participatory process
The Government's commitment to the reforms, particularly to the PPP in the urban water
sub-sector had been amply demonstrated with the creation of SPEN and the signing of the
affermage contract prior to project inception. The Government also evidenced its
willingness to support adequate cost recovery policies and to restore the financial
viability of the sub-sector by approving a 5 percent increase of the water tariffs in
February 2000.

The project preparation and design followed a comprehensive participatory approach,
including:
 Consultations with local communities, local and international NGOs, local
   governments, staff of on-going projects, government agencies and the private sector;
 A stakeholder workshop, launching the process of defining a strategy for improved
   WSS services in peri-urban areas;
 Beneficiary surveys to assess demand for improved water and sanitation services and
   to validate cost recovery policies, particularly as regards beneficiary contributions to
   the cost of sanitation facilities. The surveys were completed by a Willingness to Pay
   Study in urban areas.
During the implementation phase, the project was to actively involve: (i) neighborhood
groups in urban and peri-urban areas in deciding on the location of new stand pipes,
selecting stand pipe operators, monitoring user charges, and selecting sanitation options
as well as the operator of sanitation facilities; (ii) pupils, teachers, and parents in the
implementation and management of the school sanitation facilities. In rural areas, the
project was to support community-based institutions in order to improve social cohesion
by: (a) establishing representative WUAs, with accountable committees; (b) providing
mechanisms for conflict resolution; and (c) involving women in the process.

Risks and their mitigation
The major risks for the overall sustainability of the project were correctly identified in
project preparation, including the risks related to : (i) the capacity of SPEN and the ARM
to maintain autonomy and effectiveness; (ii) the ability of the private urban operator to
achieve operational and commercial improvements; (iii) the Government's willingness to
approve annual tariff increases and pay for water consumption in a timely manner; (iv)
the urban population's willingness and capacity to pay for improved water and sanitation
services; and (vi) the willingness of rural communities to shift the responsibility of water
facilities' management to local private operators.

The mitigation measures that were built in the project were adequately designed and
eventually minimized these risks: (i) the Government's interferences were strictly limited
by its contractual arrangements with SPEN and SEEN, whereas capacity building was
provided in the areas of sector management and regulation; (ii) strong incentives for
operational and commercial improvements were built into the lease contract and key
rehabilitation works were entrusted to the private operator; (iii) tariff increases were to be
progressively implemented until financial equilibrium is achieved in 2006, along with the
improvement of the quality of service; (iv) the regular payment of Government water
bills was covenanted in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and Government
subsequently improved the budgeting and paying process for public water bills; (v) a
willingness-to-pay study was carried out during project preparation indicating that tariff
increases would be socially acceptable; and (vi) in parallel with the outsourcing of rural
water operations, the project helped to create consumer associations and trained officials
of these organisations.

The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessed the project's Quality at Entry in May
2001 and rated it as Satisfactory. Subsequently, the Quality at Entry of the Additional
Financing was also assessed by QAG in July 2007 and was rated as Highly Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

Project restructuring
The project was not restructured and was never at risk.

Mid-term review
The Borrower and the Bank carried out a mid-term review (MTR) in May 2004 and
assessed the overall progress of the project towards achieving its development objectives.
Based on the results of the MTR the team made proper recommendations for the second
term of the project, notably with respect to: (a) streamlining the payment of water bills of
bonded public customers by centralizing it at the Ministry of Finance; (b) solving fiscal
problems regarding the application of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) that would affect the
water tariff at the expense of the consumers; (c) speeding up the rehabilitation and
extension of the water treatment plants in Niamey; and (d) speeding up the rehabilitation
works of the first lot of 15 secondary rural centers.




                                              9
Factors that contributed to successful implementation
 The PCU's efficiency facilitated implementation by helping the MRE departments to
  coordinate actions, by providing timely feedback on issues and by improving the
  quality of procurement documentation.
                                                                         6
 The stability of the management of SPEN, SEEN, ARM, and the PCU , reinforced the
  commitment of executing agencies to properly implement the project.
 The overwhelming demand of the urban population to be connected to the piped water
  network by means of social connections and to acquire appropriate household
  sanitation facilities, has greatly contributed to the success of the social connections
  program and of the urban sanitation component.
 The decision to make SEEN responsible for the social connections program as well as
  for the small extensions of the distribution network was critical to the success of this
  component. An increase in the number of customers meant an increase in revenue
  base, of which SEEN was the first beneficiary party. This was an important driver for
  SEEN to implement the program quickly and efficiently.
 Through the establishment of exchange programmes with SONES from Senegal and
  ONEA from Burkina Faso, SPEN took advantage of learning from the experiences of
  asset-holding companies and efficient public operators in other countries of the sub-
  region.

Factors that gave rise to problems in implementation
 The selection process of the NGO in charge of coordinating the Urban Sanitation Pilot
  Program was inconclusive, as the candidate NGOs submitted financial bids that were
  extremely high. The Bank team then recommended 7 modifying the scope of
  responsibilities and to instead seek the recruitment of a contract management agency
  (maître d'ouvrage délégué, MOD), in charge of procuring the numerous works and
  consultants contracts associated with this component, and for executing the outreach
  and community mobilization activities. A specialized consultant was selected after
  competitive bidding and delivered a satisfactory performance.
 Substantial cost overruns occurred in the procurement of the rehabilitation works in
  secondary urban centers and led to the Government's request for the Additional

  Some changes occurred in the ministerial department in charge of water and sanitation. A ministerial
reshuffle in 2003 replaced the MRE by the Ministry of Hydraulics (MH), with identical responsibilities.
The MH was reorganized in 2006 with the creation of a Directorate of Urban Water, Semi-urban Water (in
charge of rural piped water systems) and Sanitation (Direction de l'Hydraulique Urbaine, Semi-Urbaine et
de l'Assainissement, DHUSUA) and of a Directorate of Rural Water, in charge of rural water points
(Direction de l'Hydraulique Rurale, DHR). Most of the project facilities had been already constructed at
that time. Another ministerial reshuffle took place in April 2010 with the creation of the Ministry of Water,
Environment and Struggle against Desertification (Ministère de l'Eau, de l'Environnement et de la Lutte
contre la Désertification, MEELCD), where the General Directorate of Hydraulics (Direction Générale de
l'Hydraulique, DGH) took over the responsibilities of the former DHUSUA and DHR.

 The Bank's recommendation was based on the satisfactory experience with a MOD in implementing the
Dakar Peri-urban Sanitation Program under the Long Term Water Sector Project (Cr. 3470-SE).

   Financing. Cost overruns resulted from circumstances beyond the Borrowers' control
   and were also reported in civil works contracts financed by other donors. A
   November 2005 audit initiated by AFD found that the costs estimates based on
   benchmarks from neighboring countries were unrealistic in the Nigerien context,
   which emerged from ten years of political instability, without any significant civil
   works contracts in the infrastructure sector for many years. Therefore, the few
   contractors who came back in the country after the return of the democratic regime in
   early 2000 took advantage of their monopolistic position at the beginning of the
   project. In addition, the substantial decrease of the exchange rate between the SDR
   and the CFA Franc (from CFAF 963 for one US$ at appraisal to CFAF 791 in June
   2003) has had a significant impact on cost overruns.
   The mobilization of the financial contributions of the rural communities was initially
   slow, which led to staging of the rehabilitation of rural facilities in two phases. Phase
   I comprised the first 15 villages that provided contributions. The remaining 40
   communities swiftly provided their contributions once the rehabilitation works started
   in the Phase I villages, and were all included in Phase II.
   Previous rural actors (management committees) prevented the transfer of the
   management of rural water facilities in some cases, as they were reluctant to release
   their responsibilities; this was also observed with some WUAs, which had managed
   the rehabilitated facilities during the period between the end of the rehabilitation and
   the selection of the operators. In addition, the arrangements did not foresee any role
   for the local governments (mayors), which were elected for the first time in 2006.
   After timely approval of tariff revisions that helped to restore the financial equilibrium
   of the urban water sector in 2006, water tariffs have since been frozen by the
   Government as part of its poverty alleviation policy. This policy, which the
   Government has justified by the very low living standard of an important part of the
   population, now faces its limitations since, according to the latest financial forecasts,
   the financial equilibrium of the sub-sector is at stake if tariffs are not increased in
   2010.
   A similar situation occurred for the payment of public water bills. The public
   customers were current on their payments until 2006, and then arrears grew and were
   settled as an effectiveness condition of the Additional Financing. Since that time,
   arrears have increased to reach about CFAF 1 billion by the closing date of the project.
   IDA suspended disbursements for country-related reasons in January 2010, which
   prevented the processing of payments during the grace period; the suspension was
   lifted on April 30, 2010 (i.e. once the grace period for submitting withdrawal
   applications (WA) had lapsed). The Government requested a retroactive extension of
   the closing date on May 18, 2010, in order to process the outstanding WAs, which
   amounted to CFAF 1,065 million (SDR 1.23 million equivalent). On June 18, 2010,
   IDA granted an extension of the closing date to July 31, 2010.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design
Monitoring was based on predetermined physical indicators measuring progress of
project implementation and performance indicators measuring outputs and outcomes.
The design of monitoring and evaluation arrangements benefited from the experience of
previous projects that relied on PPP (particularly the Senegal Water and Sanitation Sector
Project), with the necessary adjustments required by the complexity of the Niger
operation (urban sanitation pilot program and rural water and sanitation). Monitoring and
evaluation arrangements included the following:
 The PCU was specifically in charge of collecting and consolidating the information
    from the various executing agencies and of producing monitoring and evaluation
    reports and indicators;
 Supervision missions by IDA, which included other donors' participation, with
    explicit assessments of the action plans attached to the Sector Policy Letter.
    Supervision missions included field visits to closely monitor development impacts,
    particularly for the urban sanitation pilot program and the rural water and sanitation
    component;
 A specific decentralized system was to be established to monitor the implementation
    of the rural water component and the operation of rural facilities (see below);
 Annual reviews of the outcome of the financial model of the urban water supply sub-
    sector, carried out jointly by MRE, SPEN, ARM and the Bank, in view of assessing
    the annual tariff increases.

Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation
The project maintained adequate monitoring and regulatory tools:
 All indicators were relevant, quantifiable and measurable;
 SEEN's Performance Contract (attached to the Lease Contract) included verifiable
   indicators consistent with the project performance indicators; from 2005 onwards, the
   indicators were verified and validated by ARM;
 SPEN's financial model developed under the project was complemented by a
   regulatory accounting financial model developed for ARM under PPIAF financing,
   which integrated SEEN's financial information and served as the basic regulatory tool
   to optimize the investment programs and to propose water tariff revisions;
 Various specific studies of impact were carried out before project completion, such as
   (i) an assessment of the transfer of the management of rural water facilities to private
   operators; (ii) an assessment of the impact of the social connections and the
   standpipes programs on the living conditions of the urban population; and (iii) an
   environmental/social/sanitary impact assessment of the urban sanitation pilot program
   in peri-urban areas of Niamey.

However, the decentralized monitoring system of rural facilities was not implemented as
expected in the project areas. AFD and WSP are currently providing support to the
Ministry in charge of Water to develop a national monitoring system.



                                            12
Monitoring and Evaluation Utilization
Results of the above monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities served IDA supervision
missions and triggered, whenever necessary, detailed recommendations to the
Government and executing agencies. M&E results were also used extensively in the
preparation of the Additional Financing.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
The implementation of the Environmental and Social Management Plan was regularly
monitored by Bank safeguard specialists. The final assessment was carried out in June
2009 and the overall safeguard compliance was rated as Satisfactory. The assessment
found that the initially-planned activities had been fully implemented, including: (i) the
timely compensation of temporary income losses from the interruption of market-
gardening activities by the digging of trenches in Niamey, which was reduced to a
minimum by modifying the design and layout of project facilities; and (ii) the restoration
of the Gogo-Mashaya Valley, which had been jeopardized by desertification stemming
from the abstraction of water resources for water supply. The institutional strengthening
of BEEEI, through training and provision of equipment and funding of operational
expenditures for monitoring and dissemination was satisfactorily implemented.

Fiduciary Compliance
Fiduciary compliance was also monitored regularly by the Bank specialists based in
Niamey. The recommendations of the periodic reviews were implemented by the
executing agencies and the PCU. The final procurement assessment (including a post
review of procurement activities) found that the project's procurement performance was
Satisfactory, with an appropriate monitoring of the procurement plan and an adequate
filing system. The final financial management assessment found that the overall FM
performance was Satisfactory. Reporting and audit covenants were complied with. The
current disbursement rate is 97.2 percent. The retroactive extension of the closing date
(see Section 2.2, Factors that gave rise to problems during implementation) now allows
for processing the outstanding WAs, after which the Credit and the Grant will be fully
disbursed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The operation and maintenance arrangements for the urban water supply investments
financed by the project have been successfully tested since 2001 under the lease contract:
(i) unaccounted-for water (UFW) decreased from 20 to 14.7 percent; (ii) the bill
collection rate on private customers increased from of 79 to 97 percent; and (iii) the staff
productivity improved from 8 staff to 5 staff per 1,000 connections. The Government is
fully aware of these achievements and therefore has renewed its commitment in a new
Letter of Sector Policy (LPS, dated April 16, 2010) to maintain the PPP option for the




                                            13
management of the urban water sub-sector with an extension of the ongoing lease
contract with the private operator8.

The urban water sector reached financial equilibrium in 2006 and maintained it
afterwards, meaning that the sector has become financially autonomous and able to fully
cover its operational and capital expenditures without Government subsidy. However,
the last updated financial projections show that a 14.9 percent increase in the water tariff
would be needed in 2010 to maintain the financial equilibrium. In addition, the payment
of Government agencies' water bills has been deteriorating since the end of 2007, which
also constitutes a risk for the financial equilibrium of the sector. Mitigation measures for
this risk will be included in the design of the follow on project. Therefore, the settlement
of outstanding public arrears which is already a condition of disbursement for the AFD
co-financing grant, will be a condition of negotiation of the follow-on project if not
settled before.

The operating record of the private operators of rural facilities is much shorter. A
diagnostic study of rural piped water systems, which was carried out in 2009, showed that
the systems managed by private operators were significantly more reliable and
accountable and generated more funds for adequate maintenance and renewal of
equipments than the systems under community management. On the basis of the project
experience, DHUSUA developed new guidelines to better involve local governments and
provide support to WUAs and operators. The support is being deployed through a
network of local consultants (Bureaux de Conseil et de Contrôle, BCC).

With the support of the international donor community, the Government has prepared a
National Water Supply and Sanitation Program (PNAEPA) for achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. The Government has requested that IDA finance part of the
program up to US$50 million over the period 2011-2015, under a follow up operation to
be delivered in FY11. This program will support post-completion operation of the
present project since the Bank and other donors will continue to assist the urban water
and sanitation sector until 2015 along the same sector approach. It will allow continued
monitoring and evaluation of the urban water and sanitation sector with the same
instruments and tools such as the sector performance indicators and the financial model.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The development objective of the project is highly relevant as are the project design and
implementation. The project objective was (and remains) consistent with the country's
primary priorities and is in line with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy.



8
 This commitment was confirmed by a letter from the Government to the private operator, dated April 26,
2010.


                                                  14
The project design was consistent with country conditions and reflected the lessons
learned in successful water and sanitation operations in West Africa. The project
addressed critical bottlenecks to sustainability by making physical investments in
increased water production and distribution capacity and provided adequate solutions to
boost services coverage, including the provision of affordable water connections and
adapted sanitation facilities. The implementation arrangements were tailored to actual
capacities.

The continued relevance of project objective, design and implementation arrangements is
highlighted by the fact that the Government has prepared a follow-up operation (the
PNAEPA) with similar development objectives that donors are ready to support.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the project objective is rated as Satisfactory as evidenced by
development impact indicators that have been achieved or exceeded.

Access to urban water services improved well above expectations as a result of the
project, particularly through private connections that offer a better quality of service
and an increased quantity of water at a lower cost. The number of people with access to
water service increased in eight years by 541,000 people, i.e. 142 percent of the end-of-
project target (EOPT)9. Most (80 percent) of those additional people with access to the
service are supplied by private connections, either social connections directly financed
under the project or ordinary connections, which were made possible by the increase of
the water production capacity and the expansion of distribution networks funded by the
project10.

Access to rural water services has markedly improved as a result of the project. The
rate of access to rural water services in project areas improved from 52 percent in 2001 to
78 percent at the end of 2009, representing 104 percent of the EOPT.

Access to improved sanitation in Niamey has increased as a result of the pilot urban
sanitation component, which has provided access to improved sanitation for more than
120,000 people, representing 96 percent of the EOPT. In addition to the construction of
household and school facilities, the project helped develop and implement efficient
mechanisms for generating and managing demand for improved sanitation that will be
used for scaling up the pilot program.




9
 All values of EOPT in the ICR refer to the targets that were revised at the time of the Additional
Financing. They are much higher than the target values specified in the original DCA.
10
  On average, a household connection serves 10 people and a standpipe serves 250 people. The calculation
takes into account the social connections and standpipes constructed under the project (18,133 and 416,
respectively), and the new ordinary connections that were made possible by the project's investments in
production capacity and network extensions (25,550).

                                                  15
The financial equilibrium of the urban water supply sub-sector was reached, as
expected, at the end of 2006 and maintained afterwards. Even though the financial
equilibrium was formally maintained by the project closing date, however, uncertainties
remain about the Government's ability to approve the tariff revisions needed to
strengthen the equilibrium in 2010, because of the political situation and the unfavourable
conditions of food crisis prevailing in Niger.

Other outcome indicators have, with only one exception, reached or exceeded their
targets:
 In contrast with the situation of rationing that existed in the urban centers in 2001
    (including the capital city Niamey), water supply is now continuous (24 hours a day/7
    days a week) throughout the entire service area, except during periods of power cuts
    (100 percent of the EOPT);
 UFW decreased from 20 percent to 15.3 percent (99.6 percent of the EOPT), which is
    an outstanding performance by regional standards;
 The objective of reducing the annual consumption of the public agencies by 1 million
    m3 has not been achieved. This is attributable to: (i) the insufficient rehabilitation of
    public agencies' internal installations; and (ii) the inefficiency of the communication
    campaign for a better water management in public offices, military camps and
    hospitals. However, reduction of the percentage of the consumption by bonded
    public customers has reached 94 percent of the EOPT.
 41 rural piped water systems (164 percent of the EOPT) are currently managed by
    private operators.

The above achievements measured by outcome indicators of the PDO (sustainable access
to services) are confirmed by the key output indicators measuring the number of social
water connections, the expansion of production and distribution facilities, the number of
rural systems rehabilitated, and the number of on-site sanitation facilities (see Annex 2
for the detailed output indicators per component). A detailed list of project activities, as
planned and as actually completed, is provided in the Appendix to Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency
An ex-post economic analysis has been carried out, using a similar methodology to the
one used in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) (and in the Project Paper of the
Additional Financing). As in the PAD, the ex-post analysis focuses on the urban water
supply component (representing 87 percent of the total project costs) for which
quantifiable benefits can be measured (incremental water sales, cost savings and
consumer surplus).

The results of the ex-post analysis are given in the table below, together with the results
of the previous analyses:




                                             16
                      ERR (%) and NPV (US$ million) Estimates
                                             PAD          Project         ICR
         Estimates
                                                          Paper
        Economic rate of return           15.0%           17.3%          13.3%

        12% discount rate
       
        Values calculated for the additional investments only.

The ex-post ERR is satisfactory, albeit below the PAD estimate. The difference is
essentially attributable to the cost overruns that were observed during implementation
(see Section 2.2).

The ex-post Financial Rate of Return (FRR) has also been calculated and is estimated at
6.8 percent, to be compared to the PAD estimate of 8.1 percent.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The overall outcome of the project is rated Satisfactory since (i) the project development
objective, its design and implementation are highly relevant; (ii) all key indicators related
to the development objective have achieved their targets (with the qualification
mentioned above on the short-term robustness of the sector's financial equilibrium), as
well as most of the other outcome and output indicators; and (iii) the project has achieved
a satisfactory level of efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The social connections program and the standpipe programs in the peri-urban areas of the
major cities have had a positive impact on the households' water expenditures. The
surveys carried out in 2009 found that (i) among the households who benefited from
social connections, 62 percent spent more than 10 percent of their daily budgets on water
prior to the connection; this percentage decreased to only 16 percent after the connection;
and (ii) among the households who benefited from a standpipe in peri-urban areas, 49
percent spent more than 10 percent of their daily budget on water before construction of
the standpipes, and 19 percent after construction. Even though the surveys do not allow
precise measurement of households' income and of the income distribution of
beneficiaries, the geographical targeting of the programs on peri-urban neighbourhoods
can be considered an acceptable proxy for poverty targeting.

Women were closely involved in the selection of the sites and of the caretakers of the
standpipes and a significant portion of the latter are managed by women. Women also
selected the technical options for household sanitation facilities. The above-mentioned
surveys revealed a generally positive appreciation of the programs by the beneficiaries
and a widespread opinion that the incidence of water-related diseases (diarrhea,
dracunculosis) has substantially decreased with these programs.



                                             17
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
SPEN has become a lean organization, employing qualified staff under conditions distinct
from the civil service, with independent contracting authority, and has proven its capacity
in preparing and implementing large investment programs. SEEN is a well-managed
organization, having put much effort into building the capacity of its staff. It has
introduced modern support systems for billing and collection, consumer registration, and
maintenance and repair of the water supply systems. ARM has mastered the regulatory
tools, despite a slow start and initial frictions with the other actors, and has satisfactorily
carried out its monitoring and regulatory responsibilities, even though its tariff
recommendations to secure the sector's financial equilibrium were not readily applied by
the Government after 2007.

In rural areas the shift from community management to private operators encountered
some interference from previous actors, WUAs and local authorities. Of the 54 operators
that had been selected, 13 are no longer managing the rehabilitated facilities, for a variety
of reasons 11 . However, the percentage of communities that adopted the new
arrangements (75 percent) is well above initial expectations (50 percent).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
n/a

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
n/a

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The Risk to Development Outcome is rated Moderate.

The sustainability of the project outcome is highly likely as many project outputs were
completed long before the closing date. The retention rate of social connections
customers (i.e. the percentage of customers who are not cut-off for non-payment) is about
95 percent, well above what is observed elsewhere in West Africa. The beneficiaries of
on-site sanitation facilities are using them effectively and appreciate the improvement of
their immediate environment. The availability rate of rural piped water systems has
substantially improved.

As mentioned above, the only remaining risks pertain to the robustness of the financial
viability of the urban water supply sub-sector vis-à-vis the Government's commitment to



11
  According the most recent assessment (May 2010): (i) the selected operator never signed the contract in
three villages; (ii) five villages did not agree with the water tariff; (iii) the mayors terminated contracts in
two villages; (iv) a district authority (préfet) terminated two contracts; and (v) one operator terminated its
contract for lack of financial viability. Wherever there is no private operator, facilities are managed by
WUAs.


                                                      18
approve the needed tariff increases and the resumption of the payment discipline among
the public water customers. SPEN and ARM have explored various scenarios of tariff
increases, combined with a rescheduling of the on-lent debt of SPEN, which would allow
restoring SPEN's financial equilibrium (see Annex 3). A 14.9 percent tariff increase,
together with debt rescheduling, would be the most likely applicable scenario, which
would be pursued in the course of the preparation of the next IDA operation.

The continuation of donors' support, which would normally be warranted by the project's
successes and beneficial impacts in Niger water and sanitation sector, has become
contingent on the socio-political environment of the country.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The project was highly relevant to the country's development priorities and the Bank's
CAS. The Bank team covered in-depth social and environmental aspects while properly
designing technical and institutional aspects of the project. The risk analysis was realistic
and the proposed mitigation measures proved to be effective during implementation.
Lessons learned from earlier projects in the region were considered and incorporated into
the design. The project was designed in such a way that planned outcomes could be
achieved without major revisions during project implementation. Because of the Bank's
long experience supporting implementation of similar multi-donor sector reform
operations, its role was critical for the successful implementation of the sector reform: (i)
through its catalyzing power to ensure that other donors participate in project preparation
and funding; (ii) ensuring the soundness of the operation because of its technical
credibility and past experience; and (iii) ensuring that governance and fiduciary issues are
properly addressed because of its long-standing track record in these areas.

The budget devoted to preparation (US$465,000) was commensurate with the scope and
the complexity of the operation and reflects the level of support provided by the sector
and country management.

QAG (QEA4) rated the Quality at Entry as Satisfactory, but the (second-stage) panel
expressed concerns over three aspects. First, the panel felt that the size and scope of the
project was too large and that an Adaptable Program Loan focusing initially on urban
water supply would have been preferable in consideration of the risks. Second, the panel
found that the likelihood that SPEN and ARM would deliver their responsibilities was
low, due to the risks of Government interference and their initial weak capacities and the
panel recommended (unspecified) mitigation measures. Third, the panel was clearly
uncomfortable with the concept of financial equilibrium and would rather have it
replaced by more conventional financial covenants. In hindsight, none of these concerns
appears to be justified, as (i) the complexity of the project did not prevent a satisfactory
outcome of all components; (ii) SPEN and ARM built satisfactory capacities as a result of

                                             19
the project; and (iii) the financial equilibrium covenant, already tested with success in
Senegal, appeared to be particularly suited to allow SPEN to benefit from the major part
of the consumer tariff increases (at start-up the lease contractor rate was very close to the
average consumer tariff and the revisions of the latter were indeed designed to build a
mark-up for the assets-holding company).

QAG (QEA8) later assessed the Additional Financing and rated it as Highly Satisfactory.
The panel noted that "the task team was quite successful in managing the risks [identified
by QEA4] during implementation". The panel for QEA8 emphasized the successful
implementation of the project and its generally satisfactory results and found "the
justification for the additional financing to be cogent, and its processing seamlessly with
supervision to be exemplary in many ways."

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
There were a total of twenty-one supervision missions over the almost nine years of
implementation, slightly above the Bank average. Bank teams always included necessary
skills to cover the relevant supervision topics and there was a high level of continuity in
the Bank team during project preparation and supervision, thereby increasing sector
knowledge and ensuring institutional memory. The supervision missions focused on the
development impact, with a particular attention given to performance indicators and to
the execution of the Sector Policy Letter action plan. Missions were systematically
coordinated with other development partners. Aide-memoires, BTOs and ISRs were
produced in a timely fashion and reported candidly on implementation, while providing
detailed assessments and recommendations.

On several occasions and particularly at the beginning of the project, when SPEN, ARM
and SEEN were adjusting to their contractual relations, the Bank team played the role of
facilitator between the sector partners. The Bank team continuously reminded all
stakeholders to comply with their engagements, particularly the Government with regard
to tariff adjustments and the payment of its water bills. The flexibility and
expeditiousness that were demonstrated during the processing of the Additional
Financing also witness the quality of supervision, as confirmed by QAG in the QEA8
assessment.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
In view of the above ratings of quality at entry and of supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The project was high in the country's priorities and the Government's commitment to the
project's development objective and to the implementation of reforms was



                                             20
unquestionable.    The Government performance was Highly Satisfactory during
preparation.

During implementation, the Government demonstrated its commitment by approving the
tariff increases and paying its water bills in a timely manner until the sector realized
financial equilibrium at the end of 2006. This commitment weakened afterwards, but,
throughout the project, the Government provided timely counterpart funds for the water
sector and ensured the stability, without interference, of the management of the sectoral
public agencies.

In view of the above, the Government performance is rated as Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the implementing agencies is assessed separately.

The implementation performance of SPEN and the PCU was Highly Satisfactory. The
physical implementation of the urban water supply component by SPEN was swift and
efficient, as was procurement and contract management. As mentioned above, SPEN had
no control over the cost overruns which led to the Additional Financing. The partnership
with SEEN functioned satisfactorily.

The PCU carried out its coordinating role and its implementation responsibilities
regarding the Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building component very
satisfactorily. The PCU prepared donors' meetings and the annual reviews. In addition
the PCU effectively carried out its monitoring and reporting responsibilities, and its
fiduciary responsibilities, including procurement quality control.

DIGOH and its successor, DHUSUA, efficiently handled the overall execution of the
rural water supply and sanitation component and made the necessary adjustments
(phasing of investments and financial contributions).           Implementation was
deconcentrated at the departmental level through the DDREs, which were in charge of
contract management, including assistance to communities in selecting the private
operators. DHUSUA could have been more proactive in facilitating the start-up period of
the new arrangements and helping WUAs and operators to address issues. However,
DHUSUA draw lessons from the PSE experience to develop new guidelines for
managing rural facilities and support WUAs and operators.

The implementation performance of DTNAEP in the Urban Sanitation Pilot Program
benefited from the assistance of a contract management agency, which facilitated the
interventions of the multiple actors (masons, NGOs and community-based organizations
(CBOs), local consultants).




                                           21
Even though it was not formally an executing agency, ARM's performance was
Satisfactory. The agency progressively built capacities in monitoring the urban water
sub-sector performance and using the regulatory tools (financial model).

BEEEI satisfactorily monitored the implementation of the Environmental and Social
Management Plan.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
In view of the Government`s and of the implementing agencies performance, the overall
Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Many lessons have been learned from the Niger Water Sector Project; some of them are
listed below:

      Cost recovery can be achieved in difficult conditions as this has been the case
      in Niger, one of the poorest countries in the World. Ranked 174 out of 179
      countries in the 2007 Human Development Index (HDI) and an average per
      capita income of US$280, Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world. The
      country's location in the Sahel region makes water a scare commodity which
      needs to be properly managed. Improving the efficiency of the water utility
      while matching investment programs to the real needs of the sector, has helped
      achieving cost recovery with tariff increases acceptable to the population.
      Private sector participation is a feasible delivery option even in a poor country
      like Niger, which was able to attract international competition for urban water
      services and at the same time was able to promote local private operators for
      rural facilities.
      Improving in a sustainable manner water service provision requires both
      supporting sectoral reform and financing key investments. Tackling water
      sector reform without the funding of major investments can be risky as the
      latter usually provide a counterbalance to the political cost of the reform.
      Changes in operational performance, improving commercial and financial
      efficiency to restore financial equilibrium could not take place without more
      people getting access to water and the improvement of the service for current
      customers. Investments financing is critical for any reform package to address
      production capacity constraints, limited water distribution networks and high
      technical losses that many water utilities in developing countries are facing to
      properly deliver their services. The Niger water sector reform was accompanied
      by an important investment program which resulted in increasing significantly
      the water production capacity in Niamey and expanding water distribution
      networks. The full implementation of this investment program was essential to
      the successful reform that took place in Niger. In that respect, the financial
      model that was developed at the onset of the project has been a powerful tool to
      optimize investments and assess required operational efficiency gains consistent
      with the financial equilibrium of the sector and socially acceptable tariffs.

                                         22
       Rehabilitation investments, which are critical to the improvement of the
       services in the context of a PPP, should be delegated to the lease contractor.
       This would ensure timely execution and avoid conflicts with the asset-holding
       companies, which tend to favor large-scale investments.
       Regulation by contract can coexist with an independent regulatory agency.
       An independent regulator which does not rely on extensive and discretionary
       powers, but on adequate regulatory tools (the financial model) can effectively
       act in favor of the development of water services.
       Project Coordination Units should not be assimilated to Project
       Implementation Units. PCUs do not act as substitutes to Government
       departments or agencies and do not hamper capacity building; they are simply a
       very effective tool for coordinating multi-agency, multi-donors programs.

Economic Analysis

The project was submitted to an ex-post cost-benefit analysis. The methodology used in
this analysis and its scope are similar to the one used in the PAD.

The PAD provided a cost-benefit analysis of the urban water supply component of the
project, taking into account as benefits:
    (i)     the incremental sales of water;
    (ii)    operational costs savings resulting from the shift to a private operator and the
            improved unaccounted-for water rate; and
    (iii) consumer surplus accruing to the consumers previously obtaining water from
            vendors or standpipes and benefiting now from private connections or
            standpipes.

The incremental sales of water were valued using the water rate applicable to the first
block of the tariff schedule. The operational cost savings were estimated as the
difference between (a) the cash operating expenditures per m3 that were observed under
SNE's (public) management before the reform (CFAF 250/m3); and (b) the lease
contractor rate paid to the private operator at the start-up of the new arrangements (CFAF
190/m3). The cost-benefit analysis takes into account a reduction in operating and
exploitation costs only for the quantity produced without the project, as savings from the
incremental amount of water produced cannot be attributed to the introduction of a
private operator. The consumer surplus was estimated at CFAF 40/m3 sold to new
domestic consumers.

On this basis the PAD found an economic rate of return (ERR) of 15.0 percent for the
urban water supply component, which accounted for 83 percent of the total project costs
(excluding taxes).

The Project Paper of the Additional Financing also included a cost-benefit analysis of the
additional investments scheduled for the urban water supply component, which took into
account only the incremental water sales and the consumer surplus attributable to the
additional investments, as there were no additional cost savings. The ERR of the
additional investments was estimated at 17.3 percent.

The ex-post analysis also focuses on the urban water supply component, and uses a
similar methodology taking into account: (i) incremental sales; (ii) cost savings; and (iii)
the consumer surplus. The investment costs (excluding taxes and price contingencies)
considered in the analysis amount to about US$95.9 million, i.e. 87 percent of the total
cost of the project. Equipment renewals (estimated at 30 percent of total investments) are
assumed to occur every ten years. Incremental operating costs are calculated using the
energy, chemicals, commercial and maintenance costs observed in the current operations
of SEEN. The detailed assumptions used in the analysis can be found in the Project Files.

The results of the ex-post analysis are, together with the PAD and PP estimates are given
below:

         Economic rate of return           15.0%              17.3%            13.3%

         12% rate
         
          Values calculated for the additional investments only

The ex-post values of the ERR and the NPV are satisfactory, albeit lower than the PAD
estimates, which is attributable to the higher than expected investment costs.

Financial Analysis

The PAD's financial analysis included (i) a calculation of the Financial Rate of Return
(FRR) and of the NPV (with a 10 percent discount rate) of the urban water supply
component, which were estimated at 8.1 percent and US$1.97 million, respectively; and
(ii) a review of the conditions of the financial equilibrium of the urban water sub-sector.

A similar analysis was conducted ex-post and its main findings are given below.

Financial Rate of Return. The annual financial cash flows consist of (i) incremental
SPEN's revenues the current share of SPEN in incremental water sales; (ii) incremental
cost savings; (iii) incremental operating expenditures of SPEN at current prices; and (iv)
investment and renewal costs. Based on the above, the ex-post FRR is estimated at 6.8
percent and the financial NPV is estimated at US$ -4.23 million. The difference with the
PAD estimates mainly result from the higher than expected investment costs.

Financial Equilibrium. In line with para. D.6 (b) of Schedule 4 to the DCA, "targeted
financial equilibrium" is defined as being the cash and near cash balance, positive or nil,
for the years 2006 and beyond, as calculated in the urban water supply sub-sector's
financial model. The table below, which summarizes key financial data and indicators of
SPEN, shows that financial equilibrium was reached at the end of 2005.

SPEN has been able to control its operating expenditures, which amount to less than
CFAF 30/m3: this is the lowest cost observed among water assets holding companies in
the sub-region. SPEN has been, as expected, the main beneficiary of the water tariff
increases, even though its remuneration amounts to less than 14 percent of the sub-
sector's revenues (after reaching 20 percent at the end of 2006), as shown in the table
below:

However, the above tables show that SPEN's financial position has deteriorated since the
end of 2006, because consumer tariffs have been frozen, whereas the lease contractor rate
continued to benefit from the contractual indexation. In addition, SPEN cannot cover its
annual debt service, which is impacted by the on-lending conditions of several loans
extended to the Government. Some loans are on-lent at a 9 percent interest and have to
be repaid over seven years, which is indeed beyond the cost recovery possibilities and
inconsistent with the lifespan of the water assets that were financed.

Therefore, SPEN and ARM have explored various scenarios of tariff increases, combined
with a rescheduling of the on-lent debt of SPEN, which would allow restoring SPEN's
financial equilibrium. A 14.9 percent tariff increase, together with debt rescheduling,
would be the most likely applicable scenario, which would be pursued in the course of

                                    Borrower's Contribution

Background

The Government of Niger, with the support of the World Bank, initiated in 1996 a
Program of Economic Liberalization that included a progressive disengagement of the
State from a dozen public and para public enterprises.

The institutional reform of the water supply sector was part of this Program. The
objective of the reform was to build an autonomous and financially viable urban water
sub-sector that could ensure the delivery of safe water to urban centers at the lowest
possible cost. The activities that were implemented under the institutional reform
included:
      SNE's privatization, which materialized with the establishment of a public
        company, SPEN and of a private company, SEEN;
      The implementation of the Water Sector Project (PSE) that would finance and
        support the reform;
      A support to the Multisectoral Regulatory Authority (ARM), established as an
        independent arbitrator between the sectoral actors.

The PSE is a development and institutional support project that is brought about by the
cooperation between the Government of Niger and external support agencies (ESA),
namely the World Bank (BM), the French Development Agency (AFD), the West
African Development Bank (BOAD) and the People's Republic of China (RPC).

The main objective of the project is to fund investments and to contribute to institutional
development in order to increase the coverage of water services and the access to basic
sanitation facilities and to strengthen the planning and management capacities of the
sectoral agencies through the following actions: a) improving the efficiency of water
production and distribution and delivering affordable sanitation services ; b)
strengthening institutional capacities in policy formulation, control, monitoring and
regulation et c) rehabilitating and expanding urban and rural water supply facilities,
developing household sanitation facilities and adopting community management of these
facilities with the support of the private sector.

The Ministry in charge of Water (MEELCD)12 was responsible for the global oversight of
the project, whereas day-to-day coordination was vested into a project Coordination Unit


12
  The Borrower's contribution refers to the current organizational set-up of the water sector. Footnote 5 in
the main text of the report lists the organizational changes that occurred during project implementation.


                                                    41
(UCP). Physical implementation was delegated to three executing agencies: SPEN for
the urban water component, the General Directorate of Hydraulics (DGH) for the rural
water component and the urban sanitation component; finally, the Environmental
Appraisal Office (BEEEI) was in charge of implementing the Environmental and Social
Management Plan (PGES). UCP implemented the institutional strengthening and
capacity building component.

    I. ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL
        STRENGHTHENING AND CAPACITY BUILDING COMPONENT

The Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building component was satisfactorily
implemented. Thus, the institutional reform was implemented without any social
disturbance and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders thanks to its well-thought
mechanisms. Similarly, the effective building of capacities of the various actors and the
adequacy of the support to the institutions in charge of the reform explain in part the fact
that the essential objectives of the project were reached. In addition, the institutional
design of the project was adequate, as the PSE relied on a programmatic approach
(implementation through line Ministry and agencies) and as its preparation was carried
out by Governmental units under the supervision of the MEELCD. The Permanent
Secretary of the MEELCD chaired the project's Steering Committee.

The following goals have been reached:
    Institutional support to the establishment of SPEN and of the Water Sector
      Directorate of ARM;
    Support to the Government by strengthening the capacities of the staff of BEEEI
      and providing OT equipment;
    Strengthening the capacities of the Ministry executives involved in the
      implementation of the reform and of the project (DGH, BEEEI, Directorate of
      Hygiene and Public Health in the Ministry of Health, Directorate of Budget in the
      Ministry of Finance, SPEN and ARM) ;

Assessment of outcome

The results of the component are substantial. The component contributed to improve the
operational effectiveness of several public agencies and to increase the competencies of
the executives in charge of the reform. The component also helped improving knowledge
of the country's water resources.

Performance of the IDA team during implementation

The regular monitoring of project activities by the IDA team allowed achieving results
that were assessed as satisfactory by the project partners.

Performance of the PCU



                                            42
However, it is important to mention that the UCP activities, which were carried out by a
limited number of staff, essentially focused on processing disbursements, without
possibility to control works. In addition UCP did not benefit enough from capacity
building, which led to a significant turnover of its staff.

II. CONTRIBUTION OF THE MULTISECTORAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY
(ARM)

Assessment of the implementation of the PSE

Project implementation
In line with the recommendations that were formulated prior to the establishment of the
UCP, the UCP remained a light structure with a coordinator, a procurement specialist, an
accountant and a project assistant. This staff delivered adequately the tasks that were
assigned to them.

Steering Committee
The only noted weakness was the fact that the Project's Steering Committee was not truly
operational. The committee regrouped too many members, which did not create the
conditions for an effective and efficient participation. To ensure a better visibility in
project monitoring, it would be essential to review the size of the Steering Committee and
to make a clear separation between members and resource persons.

Assessment of outcome

PSE's contribution to the sector is substantial. Its main objective, i.e. to support the
reform, has been largely achieved. Most of the initially planned activities of the five
project components and of the performance indicators have been completed. One may
mention, inter alia, the technical and financial performances of the urban water sector, the
increased rate of access to services and the increased water production capacity, the
completion of urban and rural water investments, the execution of the pilot urban
sanitation program, etc.
However, the communication plan that was designed to sensitize the population about the
reform and the need to increase tariffs was not implemented.

Performance of executing agencies

The Multisectoral Regulatory Authority participated to the meetings that were held
during the supervision missions of the PSE. ARM always agreed with the findings of the
aide-mémoires regarding the performances of the executing agencies, particularly for the
urban water sub-sector.

Performance of the IDA team during implementation

The participative approach that was used by IDA during implementation allowed all
actors to be fully aware of the project achievements. During the two weeks of each

                                            43
supervision mission, all actors reviewed the various aspects of project management, the
activities of the executing agencies, procurement and financial management, the sectoral
regulatory activities, the execution of investments and the arrears on public water bills.
These meetings allowed addressing several issues and reshaping some activities.

IDA insisted, each time that it was deemed necessary, to move meetings to the ARM
offices. These meetings, which regrouped representatives of the private operator and of
the Ministries in charge of Finance and Water, reviewed issues related to the protracted
problem of public arrears, to the indexation of the lease contractor rate Pe, and to the re-
visiting of the lease contract.
These commendable initiatives are appreciated and allow all actors to face their
responsibilities.

Lessons drawn from the implementation of the project and the reform

Merging the institutional reform of SNE's privatization with the execution of a priority
investment program and with the implementation of progressive tariff revisions (that
allowed reaching financial equilibrium in December 2006) has contributed to achieve
PSE's objectives. The [financial covenants of the] Financing Agreements bound the
Government to proceed with the tariff revisions that allowed reaching and maintaining
the financial equilibrium.

III. CONTRIBUTION OF THE WATER ASSETS HOLDING COMPANY OF
NIGER (SPEN)

Assessment of outcome

The convincing achievements of PSE that were reached as early as 2005, i. e. well ahead
of the closing date, led the ESA to provide additional financing, which allowed extending
the project until the end of 2009.

The project investments allowed reaching and even exceeding the targets that were set at
the start-up of the reform and also allowed SPEN to comply with the obligations set in
the Contrat-Plan. The project investments allowed to serve more than 540,990 additional
people between 2001 and 2008, through the construction of 43,700 service connections
(of which 18,133 social connections) and of 416 new standpipes in low-income peri
urban areas. The water production capacity increased by 47 percent, from 97,400 m3/d to
143,500 m3/d. The length of the distribution network increased by 58 percent (1,110 km).
The storage capacity increased by more than 45 percent and the access rate went from
64.7 percent in 2001 to 72.7 percent in 2009.

Performance of the donors during implementation

The overall performance of the ESA, which is measured in terms of timely response to
no-objection and disbursement requests, and of contribution to monitoring and evaluation,
is rated as very good. The general compliance with procurement procedures allowed for

                                            44
a swift and transparent mobilization of funds. The scope and periodicity of the
supervision missions is appreciated, particularly because the missions were jointly carried
out by the project donors.

 IV. CONTRIBUTION OF THE GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF HYDRAULICS
                            (DGH)

  A. ASSESSMENT OF THE RURAL WATER AND SANITATION COMPONENT

Implementation assessment

The final objective of the Rural Water and Sanitation component is to « contribute to the
improvement of the living and health conditions of rural and semi urban population
through sustainable supply of safe water, hygienic use of water and sanitation facilities
and adequate sanitation conditions ». Its immediate objective is to « achieve the
sustainability of water and sanitation services through the rehabilitation of 50 rural water
systems in the Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions the training of the service providers
and actors and the construction of latrines, in order to contribute to improving health in
rural areas ».

Overall, this component reached or even exceeded its initial quantitative targets.
Actually, 54 rural water systems were rehabilitated (to be compared to 50 initially
planned) and 41 (vs. 25 planned) of them are managed under a public-private partnership;
110 masons (vs. 100 planned) have been trained and equipped to meet the demand of on-
site sanitation facilities in rural areas; in addition, the project helped establishing and
training 55 WUAs (vs. 25 planned). As regards the construction of [public] blocks of
latrines, the target of building 195 blocks has not been reached because the communities
had to contribute 10 percent of the costs, i.e. CFAF 140,000 per block. Facing such a
level of financial contribution, the rural population gave priority to their participation to
rural water investments, which explains why only 31 blocks were eventually constructed.
Assessment of outcome

The component activities have contributed to substantially improve the living conditions
in 54 targeted villages, which regroup about 266,400 people. The impact of the activities
on the rate of access to safe water is summarized in the table below:

 Region                                           Access Rate (%)
                                2001                   2006                    2008
 Maradi                         56.0                   82.4                    82.4
 Tahoua                         31.3                   60.5                    73.4

One of the noted weaknesses is the absence of support of the project to the Advisory and
Control Consultants (BCC), which serve as relays between the field actors and the offices
of DGH, as well as the lack of post-project monitoring.

          B. ASSESSMENT OF THE URBAN SANITATION COMPONENT

Implementation assessment

The main objective of the component is to improve the health conditions of the
population of the peri urban areas that were targeted for increasing access to adequate
sanitation. The component, which initially planned to reach 60,000 people, actually
reached 120,000 people in the eight peri urban neighborhoods that were targeted in
Niamey.

The component helped to build 7,758 household latrines (vs. 8,000 initially planned), to
construct or rehabilitate 37 blocks of latrines for 25,000 students in Niamey schools, to
build 17 public toilets and to connect 12 schools (with 3,600 students) to water services
and to provide hygiene education to households. Training programs benefited to 50
masons, 25 craftsmen, 50 members of neighborhood sanitation committees and 100
teachers.

The institutional design was not fully adequate. Initially, two directorates claimed
responsibility for implementing the urban sanitation component, namely the Directorate
of Construction of New Water Works (DTNAEP) of the Ministry in charge of Water,
which was the executing agency of the component and the Directorate of Public Hygiene
and Sanitary Education (DHPEPS) of the Ministry of Public Health, which was to
provide technical knowledge. This conflict created coordination issues until DHPEPS
removed itself from the project. Furthermore, the use of a contract management agency
(MOD) to implement the component did not allow DTNAEP to fully appropriate the
component and the municipality of Niamey, which was an important stakeholder, gave up
participation after a few months as it felt it was not compensated enough for its activities.
The Technical Execution Committee (CTE) was barely visible in field activities and the
beneficiaries got the message that the activities were actually funded by the MOD, hence
the appellation « CIMA Project » that was given to the component by the beneficiaries.

Assessment of outcome

The component's objectives were largely achieved in spite of some difficulties and of
administrative delays. Beyond the above-mentioned achievements, the pilot program
allowed to test the mechanisms and approaches proposed in the National Urban
Environmental Management Strategy (SNGEU). The pilot program validates the
operational value of the wastewater and excreta disposal chapters of the SNGEU, subject
to adjustments that were made during implementation. The project's attractiveness to
households mostly results from the high level of subsidy (90 percent) that was granted for
the construction of individual facilities.

      V. CONTRIBUTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL APPRAISAL OFFICE
                              (BEEEI)

BEEEI's intervention as an executing agency of the PSE was one of the first
opportunities of this kind that have been offered to the Office. BEEEI was in charge of
monitoring the implementation of the Environmental and Social Management Plan
(PGES). BEEEI's intervention thus rested on three pillars:
    Monitoring the restoration of the ecological equilibrium of the Gogo-Mashaya
    Valley, which was affected by the mobilization of water resources to supply the
    city of Zinder ;
    Strengthening the capacities of the actors involved in the implementation of the
    PSE for a better monitoring of the PGES; and
    Overall environmental monitoring of PSE activities.

Final assessment of the restoration of the ecological conditions of the Gogo-Mashaya
valley

The activities related to the restoration of the ecological equilibrium of the valley were
executed by a Nigerien NGO, SDR. Works included:
    The stabilization of sand dunes over a 40-hectare area by mechanical and
      biological means;
    Tree plantations (break winds) over a 10-km line in the areas adjacent to the
      villages of Gogo, Daba and Mashaya.

Capacity building of the actors involved in the implementation of the PSE for a
better monitoring of the PGES.

BEEEI established a network of field staff to closely monitor of PSE activities. The field
staff benefited from specific and on-the-job training related to the institutional and legal
frameworks together with the acquisition of tools of environmental and social appraisal.
Two training sessions to improve awareness of environmental concerns in the
implementation of the PSE have also been organized.
The first session regrouped the executives of the executing agencies, while the second
session regrouped field agents that were primarily responsible of gathering monitoring
information. The training sessions benefited 90 local and national staff.

Overall environmental monitoring of PSE activities
In line with its assignment, BEEEI helped the PSE in preparing the TORs of specific
environmental and social impact studies as needed, which allowed:
    An independent assessment of the impact of project activities on the biophysical
      and human environment;
    An adequate identification of mitigation measures and the preparation of specific
      environmental and social management plans;
    An effective monitoring of the implementation of mitigation measures.

                                            47
The impact assessment and review procedures have been complied with, as well as the
Bank safeguards. It was not necessary to activate [additional] safeguards and all
conditions were met for a sustainable management of resources.

The environmental and social monitoring missions that were carried out annually by
BEEI found that the PSE interventions resulted in:
    Improving access to better quality water and increasing water consumption;
    Reducing the incidence of water-related diseases in the project areas;
    Increasing the abstraction of groundwater resources to improve access to safe
      water;
    Increasing domestic wastewater production, which may over the long-term
    increase the incidence of water-related diseases, as the development of wastewater
    collection facilities did not match the development of water supply networks;
    A compensation of the temporary income losses of market gardeners who were
    affected by project activities; all parties were adequately compensated either in
    Tillabéry or in Niamey.

Annex 8. Comments of Co financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The following comments were received from AFD on June 28, 2010.

Achievement of Project Objectives

The sector policy target that had been set in 2001 was to produce 70,000 m3/d in 2005
and to reach 100,000 m3/d in 2010 and 120,000 m3/d in 2015. The target was exceeded at
completion of the Water Sector Project. All rehabilitation works were actually executed.
The production capacity of the two treatment plants in Niamey has been increased. The
daily water production in Niamey reached 133,186 m3/d in 2008, which allowed SEEN to
reduce the water shortages that existed in several parts of the city and to meet the
growing demand for new service connections.

This outcome contributed to establish the financial equilibrium of the urban water sub-
sector in 2006 and to consolidate the equilibrium until 2008. Since then, the sector's
financial forecasts have pointed to the need to increase water tariffs by 19 percent on
January 1st, 2011 at the latest, in order to maintain the financial equilibrium. The tariff
revision is all the more critical as SPEN was not allowed since 2006 to apply the yearly
indexation of tariff levels to compensate inflation.

Finally, although the sector's financial equilibrium remains fragile, the project allowed
consolidating the sector reform that delegated urban water supply to SPEN and SEEN
under concession and lease contracts. The project reached its targets in terms of water
production and increased connections to services. However, an adequate tariff policy,
the control of the water consumption of public agencies and the regular payment of the
water bills of public agencies and bonded customers, represent challenges to be
addressed to ensure the viability of the sub-sector.

Project Execution

The project generally faced cost overruns of about 40 percent, which stemmed from
inaccuracies in the cost estimates of detailed design studies and from the low number of
bidders. The AFD-financed components were no exception, as the financial bids of the
candidates were 50 percent higher than the engineer's estimate. Lengthy negotiations
with the lowest bidder to bring back its bid within the financing envelope delayed the
works' commencement. Therefore, the closing date of the financing agreement had to be
postponed from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2007.

It should be noted that, in spite of the start-up delays, once the contracts were signed,
they were executed within their contractual delays. In addition, thanks to a revision of
design and allotment of contracts, all scheduled works were executed within the initial
budget. Final cost savings even allowed executing 700 additional social connections.




                                            49
Harmonization of AFD and World Bank Components and Coordination

The AFD and World Bank financing were designed under the common framework of the
investment program defined to support the implementation of the reform of the sub-sector.
To ensure complementarity, the World Bank and BOAD funded water storage and
distribution works, whereas AFD funded production works and remote control facilities.
SPEN was the executing agency of all components.
The satisfactory collaboration between the teams of the World Bank and AFD in Niamey
and at headquarters is appreciated. Several joint supervision missions were carried out
and the two donors always harmonized their views on all issues related to the sector's
institutional framework, tariff policy, investment planning and eventually the
consolidation of the financial equilibrium.
