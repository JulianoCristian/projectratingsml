The project includes:\n            (a) fifty-nine wateryards with about 83 tubewells to be\n            constructed on two main and two feeder stock routes; and (b)\n            facilities and materials for veterinary inspection,\n            treatment and vaccination at about 18 veterinary centers\n            along stock routes.  The project further includes:  (c)\n            project administration facilities (office, housing, vehicles\n            and equipment); and (d) technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1984-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
