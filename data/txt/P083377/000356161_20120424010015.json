Project for Kyrgyz\n            Republic were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was significant;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: in\n            circumstances where a whole system is on the verge of\n            collapse, the need for flexibility in project design is\n            required. By preventing a complete collapse and allowing\n            services to recover to a minimal level, others donors could\n            be persuaded to invest and be more strategic later on. If\n            the investment is spread to more towns, it is important that\n            the task team adjusts the targets. While new technologies\n            significantly improved the availability of services and the\n            operations of utilities, capacity building should be an\n            integral part of project design. The use of modern\n            technology and equipment has had a significant impact on\n            improving the efficiency of the participating utilities,\n            especially in reducing energy consumption."}, "docdt": "2012-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
