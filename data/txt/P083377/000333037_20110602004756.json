population of participating\n            small towns. Project implementation performance has been\n            consistently rated 'satisfactory' throughout\n            implementation. The project was expected to be completed by\n            the end of 2010, six months ahead of the closing date, but\n            due to the political unrest in the Kyrgyz Republic in the\n            spring and summer of 2010, the pace of project\n            implementation was slower than anticipated. As of May 15\n            2011, two reaming activities were experiencing delays beyond\n            the control of the implementing agency, in coordination with\n            the Ministry of Finance, applied to the World Bank for an\n            extension of the project closing date by three months, until\n            September 30, 2011, based on force majeure. The extension is\n            necessary to complete: (i) the procurement of special\n            machinery; and (ii) ongoing works in Kok-Jangak, a town\n            located in the South of the Kyrgyz Republic."}, "docdt": "2011-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
