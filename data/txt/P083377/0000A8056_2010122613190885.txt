                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project continues to be rated Satisfactory and it is to close on June 30, 2011, with ARIS processing the last procurement package for supply of special machinery for municipal
                         utilities.
                         At this stage, given the satisfactory performance of the project and its likely capacity to disburse all funds almost entirely by the closing date, the World Bank's management does not
                         consider an extension justified. On the other hand, as no additional financing could be granted under the emergency response IDA 15 cycle, the World Bank is now considering the
                         Client's request for a repeater project under IDA 16 cycle and a corresponding decision will be communicated to the Government in due course.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
