﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.     Although the country had made significant progress in reducing its poverty level from 55
percent in 1999 to about 41 percent in 2003, at the time of appraisal, in 2004, the Kyrgyz Republic
counted among the poorest countries in Central Asia, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
of US$ 379. The poverty rate in urban areas (31 percent) was lower than in rural areas (46 percent),
but the majority of welfare gains among the urban poor were concentrated in Bishkek and Osh, the
capital and the second largest city of the Kyrgyz Republic respectively. Based on the 2001 Household
Budget Survey, nearly 60 percent of urban individuals residing outside Bishkek and Osh lived below
the absolute poverty line. According to the 1999 National Census, about 1.7 million or 35 percent of
the Kyrgyz Republic's total population lived in urban centers. About half of the total urban population
was concentrated in Bishkek (750,000) and Osh (209,000), the other half was scattered among 23
smaller towns with populations ranging from about 9,000 to 70,000.
2.     Sector issues. The collapse of the former Soviet Union and the withdrawal of state subsidies
rapidly caused lack of proper maintenance and subsequent deterioration in the availability and quality
of public services. Once taken for granted, drinking water, solid waste collection, sewerage and road
maintenance services were often available only intermittently, or had stopped altogether. Steady
decline in municipal services led to public health problems and visibly reduced the standard of living
of the population. At the time of appraisal, large portions of local service infrastructure, installations,
and equipment were in need of urgent rehabilitation, so as to restore services at minimally acceptable
levels. Furthermore, the local self-governments (LSG)2 struggled with the conceptual changes required
to effectively provide services in a market-economy environment; local service providers were hit
particularly hard by the simultaneous lack of available fiscal resources, qualified staff departing to
better paid jobs (often to other countries), and by the rapid deterioration of the infrastructure.
3.     Rationale for Bank involvement. Work on administrative reform, decentralization and local
government development was high on the agenda of the government. Despite some deficiencies,
decentralization in Kyrgyz Republic was significantly ahead of that in other Central Asia countries.
With the support of the donor community, in particular the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), a series of laws had been
already adopted on various aspects of local administration and LSG. A National Strategy for Further
Decentralization and Local Self-Government Development was enacted in 2002 and set the agenda
and responsibilities for improvement of intergovernmental fiscal relations and local administration
procedures. However, there were few resources provided for investments.
4.     The Small Towns Infrastructure and Capacity Building Project (STICBP) was the first
comprehensive operation to support infrastructure improvements and capacity building in small towns.
The project was timely. Even though it focused exclusively on development objectives at the local
level, it would complement the broader program, which the Bank and the donor community were
developing - under the proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) - to support the
implementation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS).
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
5.     The development objectives of the project were to improve the availability, quality and
efficiency of local infrastructure services for the population of participating small towns.
6.     Key indicators: The indicators measured i) improvements in quality and availability of local
infrastructure services, and ii) improvement in efficiency of the utilities operating the services.
Intermediate outcome indicators measured a) number of town development strategies and utility's
Performance Improvement Actions Plans adopted by participating towns, and b) number of urban
infrastructure projects and social infrastructure projects implemented.
2 Local Self Governments in the Kyrgyz Republic are the local institutions, such as the municipalities in towns and Ayl-
Okmotu in rural settlements, in charge of local administration and services.

﻿1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
7.     The objectives were not revised.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8.     The expected beneficiaries of the project included:
*  Population in participating small towns. The about 750,000 population in these towns would
benefit in terms of: (a) increased availability of water supply in hours per day; (b)
improvement in water quality; (c) increase in frequency of solid waste collection in number of
collections per month; (d) increase in kilometers of roads with adequate pavement; and (e)
increase in kilometers of roads with street lighting.
*   The living conditions of the same population were also expected to improve through the
repair, replacement, upgrading or rehabilitation social infrastructure under the responsibility of
the LSGs (such as kindergartens, primary schools, parks, markets, health facilities, and
community facilities).
*  Public utilities which would benefit from: (a) increase in bill collection rates; (b) reduction in
accounts payable; and (c) reduction in energy use per cubic meter of water produced.
1.5 Original Components
9.     The project consisted of three components as follows:
Component A: Small Towns Infrastructure Improvements (US$13.5 million). The component
included three Sub-Components: (A. 1) Urban Infrastructure Improvements (UII); (A.2) Social
Infrastructure Improvement (SII); and (A.3) Detailed Design, Bid Document Preparation, Technical
Supervision, and Technical Studies.
Sub-component A.1: UII   financed grants for the repair, rehabilitation, replacement or
upgrading of local infrastructure service installations and equipment (water supply, waste
water treatment, solid waste collection and disposal, and urban roads) that were under the
responsibility of local self-governments.
Sub-component A.2: SII financed small grants to improve the living conditions of the
population in participating small towns through the repair, replacement, upgrading or
rehabilitation of social infrastructure under the responsibility of the LSGs, such as
kindergartens, primary schools, parks, markets, health facilities, and community facilities.
Sub-component A.3: Detailed Design, Bid Document Preparation, Technical Supervision and
Technical Studies: The subcomponent financed consulting services for project management,
the preparation of final design and procurement documents for UII investments, the
organization of tenders, and technical supervision of UII investment implementation as well as
additional technical studies.
Component B: Institutional Strengthening (US$ 0.8 million). The component financed: (a) the
preparation of Performance Improvement Action Plans (PIAPs) for participating LSGs that would
apply for financing of UII investments; (b) the provision of training, advisory services, and workshops
to help local infrastructure services providers implement and achieve the objectives of PIAPs; (c)
training of LSG staff in procurement and monitoring of SII investments; and (d) the provision of
technical assistance to various entities of the National Government for the development and
implementation of specific policy actions for local government activities under the National Strategy
for Further Decentralization and Local Self-Government Development. The component would also
include a limited amount of equipment (computers and software) that would support specific activities
in PIAPs, in particular for strengthening billing and collection systems.
Component C: STICBP Implementation Support (US$ 1.3 million). The component supported
project implementation by financing: (a) the provision of local experts for helping LSGs develop SII
investments; (b) the creation and maintenance of a system to monitor and evaluate the performance

﻿and results of the project; (c) a portion of operating costs of the STICBP project management unit
(PMU) within ARIS, including staff salaries, in-country travel costs and mandatory employer
contributions to the Kyrgyz Social Fund, and the purchase of a limited amount of office equipment
and vehicles; and (d) annual audits of project accounts.
1.6 Revised Components
10.    The project components were not revised.
1.7 Other significant changes
11.    There were no changes in the design, scope, and implementation arrangements of the project.
However, in addition to the provision of additional financing in the amount of SDR 2.7 million in
2009, there were changes in the completion date and allocation of funds among disbursement
categories, as described in more detail below:
(i) Additional Financing. A SDR 2.7 million Additional Financing (AF) was approved in April
2009 to help the project cope with the effects of cost inflation in the construction industry. Higher
than anticipated increases in the cost of construction materials in 2007 and 2008 resulted in a rapid
rise in the cost of most ongoing contracts and threatened to endanger the satisfactory continuation
of the project. The AF covered: (a) the financing-gap for the completion of the third-year urban
infrastructure investment program of STICBP in the four towns of Batken, Kara-Balta, Kok-Jangak
and Nookat. It also covered the implementation of a few complementary investments that were
needed to enhance the effectiveness of investments already carried out in other towns; (b)
additional operating costs of ARIS resulting from a concurrently approved extension of the Closing
Date by fifteen months, and (c) associated additional cost of consulting services and project
monitoring and evaluation;
(ii) Funding allocations. The original Grant amount of SDR 2.10 million was reallocated across
categories of expenditure three times, in August 2007, in March 2008, and in March 2011.
Likewise, the original Credit amount of SDR 8.20 million was reallocated across categories of
expenditure in March 2008 and March 2011.
(iii) Closing Date: The closing date of STICBP was extended twice for a total period of 18 months.
The first extension was for 15 months from March 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011 in connection with the
AF, to enable completion of works already underway. A subsequent extension by three months to
September 30, 2011 was warranted to compensate for the delays incurred in the completion of the
last two contracts as a result of the political unrest in Spring and Summer 2010.
12.    The design, components, development objectives and expected outcomes of the original
project remained the same. The AF increased component funding as follows:
Table 1: Costs by component

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
13.    Project Background. STICBP was built on the experience that the Bank had previously
gained in assisting the local government sector in other countries of the ECA Region and other
regions. It helped achieve the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of April 2003 by
3


﻿supporting the Government's efforts to address the challenges that the country faced in its attempts to
promote growth and reduce poverty.
14.    Project preparation was supported by an $ 850,000 PHRD Grant (TF 53124) which allowed
the hiring of national and international consultants needed to carry out the preparatory work. The
project was demand-based by definition and therefore the full investment program could not be
identified by negotiations. However, an investment program pipeline was developed and designs and
procurement documents for the first year of implementation were completed by Grant/Credit
Effectiveness.
15.    Soundness of background analysis. Decentralization and local utility issues had been
assessed through Bank Economic Sector Work (ESW), prior to project preparation. Project preparation
itself largely benefited from, and relied on, studies by the Urban Institute (a USAID funded
consultant), UNDP and other donors.
16.    Assessment of quality at entry and project design: The demand-driven nature of the project
allowed for flexibility to expand the number of towns or investments covered during implementation.
The design included incentives for Local Self-Governments (LSG) to prepare their own investment
plans to demonstrate commitment to results. It also included provision to support LSGs in improved
management practices and systems. ARIS was chosen as implementing agency for its implementation,
financial management (FM), and procurement capacity. Indeed, ARIS proved an important factor in
ensuring successful implementation. During preparation, a social survey was carried out in six of the
seven towns that would benefit from the First Year Investment Program. ARIS also conducted an
Environment Assessment and prepared an Environment Management Plan (EMP), which contained
relevant mitigation and monitoring measures along with institutional responsibilities for EMP
implementation.. A number of alternative project designs were considered, including a municipal
fund-type operation, but was premature, and still is, in the current economic context.
17.    Lessons of previous projects taken into account. In designing STICBP, lessons learned from
other municipal infrastructure projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA) and other
Regions were incorporated by: (a) placing all decisions on investment priorities and, where practical,
on specific project features, in the hands of LSGs; (b) complementing the investment component with
institutional support to LSGs and/or their utilities; and (c) simplifying implementation arrangements
and adjusting them to prevailing social and economic realities of the country.
18.    Risk Assessment. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified several potential risks
and mitigation measures. The table below summarizes the risks and mitigation measures identified in
the PAD along with an assessment of the risks by the ICR team.

20.    Adequacy of participatory process. During preparation, particular attention was paid to local
ownership and involvement in the project through Town Development Strategies and PIAPs, and
involvement of local communities in the definition of SII.
2.2 Implementation
21.     STICBP was not restructured, and no changes were made to the design. The Bank conducted
a Mid-Term Review (MTR) in November 2007. Its purpose was to review the overall project
performance since inception; assess the continuing relevance and validity of the PDO; assess the
effectiveness of project design, implementation arrangements, and the quality of works; and make
recommendations to strengthen project management and implementation.
22.    The following factors affected project implementation:
(i) Political and social unrest. After project effectiveness the Kyrgyz Republic experienced two
revolutions. In 2005, the "Tulip" revolution saw the ousting of the first President since
independence. Although it did not cause direct damage to project investments, the following years
were marked by regional polarization. STICBP, ARIS and the Bank had to deal with high demand
for investments from all towns at a time when the Bank was the only donor supporting secondary
towns. To avoid exacerbating social tensions, STICBP sought to assist as many beneficiaries as
possible with improved solid waste management and Social Infrastructure Investments (SII). By
end-2011, 22 towns, comprising about 480,000 beneficiaries, received special machinery to
improve solid waste management.. This approach was justified since at STICBP inception, solid
waste management in several towns was on the brink of collapsing due to the lack of basic
equipment. While the political unrest in Spring/Summer 2010 did not cause direct damage, it
delayed completion of ongoing operations (especially in the South). This was because contractors
were forced to suspend work for months and move equipment to safer locations. Furthermore,
temporary suspension of disbursements by the Bank and extensive changes in key management
positions of government (including ARIS), slowed implementation.
(ii) High turnover of Task Team Leaders (TTLs). During implementation, five TTLs managed the
project. Changes were particularly frequent in the last two years, with two successive TTLs
staying only a few months each. Dedicated local Bank staff coupled with the strength of ARIS,
managed to make up for this short-coming, which did not adversely affect project performance.
(iii) Inadequate quality of the engineering and final design studies. Implementation of the UII
program was initially slower than anticipated because of inadequate engineering and design
studies carried out during project preparation. Extensive additional studies and technological
changes turned out to be necessary for the projects in Cholpon-Ata, Talas, and Tash-Kumyr. In
Cholpon-Ata, the proposed water treatment plant had to be moved to a different location (since the
original site was found to partially intrude onto an archeological park) and a more appropriate
treatment technology had to be adopted. In Talas, extensive changes were needed to ensure
satisfactory functioning of the waste water treatment plant. In Tash-Kumyr the project design was
incomplete and additional elements (pumping station) had to be included to make it operational.
Beside delays in start-up and completion, these changes also resulted in significant cost increases.
5


﻿(iv) Project Management Consultant (PMC). A PMC was hired at the beginning of project
implementation to support ARIS in dealing with project management, feasibility studies, selection
of investments, evaluation of technical designs, procurement, and capacity building for
supervision engineers. The PMC worked with ARIS for about two and a half years. ARIS
benefitted from PMC's initial support and training, which helped establish good supervision and
contract management systems. After initial results were achieved, both parties agreed to terminate
the PMC contract, and ARIS allocated the remaining funds into physical investments.
(v) Low capacity of contractors. The professional capacity of contractors turned out to be
extremely poor in several cases. In Tash-Kumyr, the works contract had to be suspended and
terminated since the contractor proved to have neither the expertise nor the technical means to
execute the road reconstruction. In Tokmok, the contractor, possibly after finding a more lucrative
job elsewhere, abandoned the site after about 80% of the works had been completed. In both cases,
ARIS engaged in lengthy re-tendering and contract negotiations to identify a willing contractor to
complete the works.
(vi) Price escalation of construction materials was an important factor in project cost increases.
Between 2005 and 2007 most construction materials experienced increases between 50% and
150% on the local market.
(vii) Lack of reliable and accurate data. A critical problem for the preparation of PIAPs (as well
as for the Monitoring and Evaluation system) was the availability of reliable and accurate data at
the level of local utilities and local governments. There were multiple reasons for the limited
accuracy of the data, including: (i) absence of proper record keeping systems (ii) lack of a separate
accounting for the various types of services; and (iii) low skills of the personnel.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
23.    M&E Design: Given the demand-driven nature of STICBP, defining specific indicators with
targets in advance was not feasible, and in the PAD outcome indicators were phrased as expected
results. Once requests from towns were received and projects were selected, outcomes indicators were
defined. Availability was measured as percentage of town residents with i) more than 12hr/day regular
water supply, and/or ii) solid waste collected regularly, twice per month. Satisfaction was measured
through percentage of residents reporting better water quality, while Efficiency of the participating
utilities through i) improved revenue/cost ratio, and ii) energy efficiency in operating water supply
systems. A survey, conducted 18 months into implementation, collected baseline data for selected
towns, with regular collection and reporting thereafter. Data was not collected for all project treated
towns, because participating municipalities and /or utilities were not all able to collect data, and the
project could not finance a survey to cover all towns. Core sector indicators were introduced in 2009.
These changes did not imply any change to the results framework agreed to at negotiations. A final
beneficiary survey was completed in 2011, which focused on the following indicators:
*   Increase in percentage of population, having water at least twelve (12) hours regardless of
season.
*   Decrease in percentage of population not satisfied with quality of water.
*   Increase in percentage of population covered by municipal solid waste collection 2
times/month.
*   As five towns received assistance to improve their sewerage services, the survey also
measured number of beneficiary reporting improved sanitary services, and the data is available
among the intermediate indicators of this ICR.
24.    .M&E implementation. Although data quality varied by town (and utility), ARIS regularly
collected data agreed to at negotiations. By project end, the final survey did not fully capture all the
achievements of STICBP. During implementation, substantial shortcomings in service provision due
to fast decaying infrastructure and equipment, as well as weakening utility capacity created a critical
situation on the ground. Some PDO indicators, especially in solid waste management, had targets
based on investments concentrated in fewer towns. Since the project prevented the situation from
getting worse, the team should have adjusted the targets once investments where spread to a larger
6


﻿number of towns. The project could have also collected more data on rehabilitation of social
infrastructure.
25.    M&E utilization. Data collected by ARIS was compiled into regular project reports and used
by utilities and municipalities to improve their performance. ARIS developed an accounting software
customized to the needs of utilities, which was instrumental in improving billing and collection rates..
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
26.    Safeguard. STICBP was not expected to have any significant or irreversible environmental
impacts, and was classified as Environmental Category "B". A framework Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was developed during project preparation and adhered to during
implementation. Based on the framework EMP, ARIS prepared site specific Environmental Impact
Assessments (EIA), which were submitted to and officially approved by the country designated
authority. Subsequently, the approved documentation was attached to the civil works contract.
Environmental supervision and monitoring were performed satisfactorily by ARIS engineers in
coordination with the local environmental inspectors, municipalities and utilities. There were no
complaints on the way the project addressed environmental management, and there were no
environmental issues for any of the project sites. Finally, there were no other major safeguard issues
related to the implementation of the project.
27.    Fiduciary. STICBP complied with fiduciary covenants during implementation. Procurement
was carried out according to plan and in accordance with the Bank guidelines. Delays caused by
country circumstances were promptly addressed. Financial Management was satisfactory, with timely
reporting and regular, unqualified audits.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(a) Transition arrangements.
*  Institutional. All infrastructure financed under STICBP has been turned over to municipalities,
and it is expected that they will provide adequate budgetary resources for operation and
maintenance. The PIAPs are a living tool that the utility can continue use to monitor and
improve their performance and to develop service strategies.
*  Financial. The Financial Sustainability of municipalities and utilities remains a major problem
in the Kyrgyz Republic, in the long term.
*   Staffing and management capacity. There is no uniformity among the municipalities. While
some are well staffed and managed, others suffer from staff shortage. Overall, technical
capacity staff is weak, as many who receive training are leaving for better employment
opportunities elsewhere.
(b) Monitoring and evaluation. The utilities are responsible for monitoring the performance indicators
developed under the project. Given their weak technical capacity, it is likely that many may not
monitor the indicators after project closure.
(b) Follow on project. A component to support activities and objectives of the STICBP was included in
the Additional Financing for the Bishkek and Osh Urban Infrastructure Project (BOUIP), which is
currently under implementation and will continue the successful municipal and social infrastructure
investments supported by STICBP.
(d) Future Impact Evaluation. It is recommended that an impact evaluation be conducted after three
years of project closing to assess the sustainability of the project's achievements.

﻿3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
28.     The objectives, design and implementation of STICBP remain highly relevant to the country
and to the Bank's current Interim Strategy Note (ISN). One of the pillars is to support social
stabilization through social services and community infrastructure and employment, especially in the
South, which has been gravely affected by the events of 2010. The project was developed as demand-
driven, and its design is adequate for the needs of the country. The dire situation of public services at
the time of approval, and the consequent very high demand for support by all participating towns,
justified, during implementation, to have broad coverage, and the consequent thinner spread of project
investments. This approach has led to less ambitious results and moderate shortcomings in the
achievement of some objectives (see section 3.2). In the current situation, where many towns, through
the assistance from STICBP, have re-established minimum levels of basic services, more focused
investments, on a smaller number of towns, could yield more significant results. Implementation was
satisfactory, with a strong performance by ARIS.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
29.    Moderately Satisfactory. The STICBP development objective was to improve the availability,
quality and efficiency of local infrastructure services for the population of participating small towns.
The highlights of the project's achievements are given in Table 3:
Table 3: PDO - improve the availability, quality and efficiency of local infrastructure services for the population of
participating small towns- key indicators and results achieved. See Annex 2 for detailed analysis.

30.    Availability:  The targets for Water supply were achieved.     Even though solid waste
management did not achieve all its targets, it improved in all towns under difficult circumstances
leading to a satisfactory achievement for this objective._Water supply increased beyond expected
levels for all towns monitored except Uzgen. This town was affected by severe power cuts, which
limited pump operations, according to the 2011 survey. The decision to increase the number of towns
with solid waste management systems limited the equipment allocated to each town, which in turn
limited the impact the project could have had on overhauling the entire service. Targets were not
adjusted accordingly. Given that the World Bank was the only donor investing in the sector at the
time, the trade-off was to salvage the system from complete collapse by restoring minimum service
levels in as many towns as possible. The success of this strategy, in retrospect, allowed other donors
to subsequently come in and set the stage for scale up.
31.    Quality of the water has improved, but systems could be rehabilitated only partially, leaving
old and rusted pipes negatively affecting water quality in some monitored towns. In Tokmok,
beneficiaries report much improved water pressure, even at the highest floors, but complain of rust and
sand in the water. This objective is rated moderately satisfactory for meeting its targets, with
substantial shortcomings in some towns.
8


﻿32.    Efficiency of the utilities. While the financial sustainability of utilities and municipalities
remains weak, there was a substantial improvement in reducing energy consumption and cost, leading
to a moderately satisfactory outcome for this objective. By improving the urban and social
infrastructure, the project strengthened utility and local government management capacity and
significantly improved bill collection. The project was particularly successful in improving the
availability of basic services such as drinking water supply, sewerage and solid waste management.
The installation of new technologies, high efficiency pumps, dramatically improved energy efficiency.
Capacity, however, suffered from frequent staff changes and outdated technical skills.
33.    Social Infrastructure Improvements. A large number of activities under the SII component
focusing on the rehabilitation of social and educational facilities in the participating towns have been
successfully implemented. Examples of SII include the rehabilitation of facilities (heating, plumbing,
roofing) of schools (about 40), kindergartens (about 15), public sport centers (about 10), community
buildings (6) and hospitals (6), for about 104,000 direct beneficiaries, especially youth and students of
the several schools and kindergartens rehabilitated by the project. Beneficiaries are reportedly satisfied
with the assistance provided by the project, and to address further social needs this component has
been scaled up in the BOUIP AF. Thus the results of this sub-component are considered satisfactory.
Details on type of social infrastructure is provided in Annex 2.
34.    Institutional development impact. The STICBP had a positive institutional development
impact, as demonstrated by the intermediate outcome indicators in the Results Framework:
*   To be eligible for STICBP financing, interested municipalities had to prepare Town
Development Strategies and implement Performance Improvement Action Plans (PIAPs) for
their utilities. All 23 towns prepared and approved their strategy and PIAPs;
*   Training programs on institutional development delivered to local government bodies and
service providers have improved skills and capacities;
*   Collection rates for water invoices have increased substantially due to improvements in the
billing system. In monitored towns, collection increased on average from 35 percent to 85
percent, reflecting growing customer satisfaction with service delivery.
3.3 Efficiency
35.    A traditional economic analysis was not feasible during preparation due to the nature of the
project. For the ICR, a partial economic analysis was done, which focused exclusively on water sector
investments. It produced an economic internal rate of return of 13.72%, with a benefit-cost ratio of
1.36, with values up to 14.01% and 1.47 respectively in Kok-Jangak, a town in the South. The analysis
took into account benefits such as time saved (confirmed in 2011 survey) and avoided treatment of
waterborne diseases. The project was extended by 15 months under the additional financing, from
March 31, 2012 until June 30, 2011. Subsequently it was extended for another 3 months. The delay
was due to the events of Spring/Summer 2010, to complete works in Kok-Jangak, and to procure and
distribute another batch of special machinery for the utilities. Benefits from additional equipment on
utility performance, especially for solid waste management, could not be captured by the 2011 survey.
Overall the efficiency is rated moderately satisfactory.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
36.    Project relevance, design and implementation are rated satisfactory as they remain relevant
and adequate to the country context. Achievement of PDO is satisfactory in terms of improved
availability of services to the beneficiary population; quality and efficiency are moderately satisfactory
with some shortcomings in overall improvements against the set indicators. Finally, efficiency is rated
moderately satisfactory with a reasonable IRR of 13.72% for the water investments, leading to an
overall outcome rating of moderately satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
9


﻿37.    Although the PDO did not explicitly include them, and impacts on poverty and gender aspects
were not measured systematically during the project, the final beneficiary survey carried out in 2011
reported that many respondents felt that the project had a positive impact on women and children. The
impact was associated with reduced distance to drinking water sources, more availability of water, and
consequent less time needed to collect water or carry out chores that require water.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
*   Several training programs financed under the project have improved the capacity of local
municipalities and utilities. Some have managed to increase their revenues to an extent that
has enabled them to buy expensive equipment, such as a crane, with their own resources.
*   Implementation of automated accounting system financed under the project was instrumental
in improving the billing and collection rates of utilities for water and solid waste.
*   The capacity of local utilities has been improved as shown by improvement of service delivery
and in collection rates.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Positive
*   Based on the results of STICBP, a few towns, including Kant, Kara-Balta, Tokmok and Talas
are currently preparing similar projects to be financed by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is already
financing further investments in the three towns of Issykul.
*   Anecdotally, some of the utilities, which participated in the STICBP, are providing advisory
support to nearby rural utilities
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
38.    A beneficiary survey was carried out in 2011 and measured specific impacts from the
availability of water (>12 hr/day) and general satisfaction of the population with the quality of public
services for water and sewerage. The survey produced encouraging results that helped to better
understand what are the people expectations and needs. A detailed summary of the survey can be
found in Annex 5.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant
39.    The risk to development outcomes is significant based on the following factors:
*   Most utilities do not have adequate financial resources for the operation and maintenance
(including buying spare parts) of the water and waste water system, as their tariffs are
significantly below the cost recovery level.
*   Distribution networks are very old and the quality of infrastructure facilities of utilities is
weak. Due to financial constraints, many utilities are not in a position to expand their pipe
replacement program.
*   The technical capacity of utilities is weak. This has implications on the correct operation and
maintenance of the systems. There have been cases when the local utility staff did not know
how to operate the equipment correctly (i.e. high efficiency pumps) and caused breakages that
require repair and/or further investment. Poor O&M may thus lead to faster deterioration of
installed systems.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory.
10


﻿40.    There was no official assessment of the Quality at Entry by the Quality Assurance Group
(QAG). The ICR deems the quality at entry to be satisfactory and the project as well conceived.
During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all
major relevant aspects: technical, financial, economic, institutional, procurement and financial
management. A number of alternatives were considered for the project design. In addition, major risk
factors and lessons learned from other municipal infrastructure projects in the ECA Region and other
Regions were considered and incorporated into the project design. At the time of preparation, the
social unrest that has affected the last 7 years had not been anticipated. As explained in the sections
below, Quality of Supervision and Borrower Performance, the Bank, the Government and ARIS were
very adaptable in responding to the crisis and took this into account in prioritizing the investments,
given the funds available under this project, and in spreading some of the project financing to cover
more towns to ensure the most urgent need could be met.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory.
41.    The Bank's performance during implementation was satisfactory. Supervision missions were
undertaken regularly and included appropriate expertise. Although there were changes in team
leadership over the course of the project, supervision remained consistently strong, with good
continuity of several team members. Issues were promptly identified and corrective measures taken,
especially in response to the crises. Procurement and FM support was timely. Adherence to the EMP
was monitored. Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated. The Implementation Status
Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of achievement of
development objectives and project implementation. However the Results Framework, and especially
the targets proposed in 2006, could have been adjusted with the likelihood that more modest results
could be achieved through smaller investments in more towns in solid waste management. The task
team also monitored safeguard and fiduciary compliances. The Bank maintained a collaborative
relationship with the client and was regarded as a trusted partner, as recorded in the client assessment.
The Bank team showed flexibility and adapted to the fluid situation in the Kyrgyz Republic, especially
in responding in a timely manner to the needs generated by the 2005 and 2010 crises.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.
42.    Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above,
overall Bank Performance is rated as satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.
43.    As mentioned in Section 2.1, the Government had shown its commitment to the objectives of
the project at the time of project preparation. Despite three changes of administration, and the absence
of a leading agency responsible for local governance and public utility services in the central
administration, the Government maintained its commitment throughout implementation. Project
effectiveness and AF effectiveness were timely, despite political changes. There was no problem with
counterpart funding. Government officials worked closely with the Bank project team on a continual
basis.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory.
11


﻿44.    Despite the difficult environment created by the political unrest in 2005 and 2010, ARIS staff
demonstrated a noteworthy resiliency and commendable dedication to their work, without which it
would have been impossible to maintain the strong performance of the project and bring it to
satisfactory completion.
45.    All project activities were completed on time before project closing. The beneficiary
assessment of ARIS's performance was highly positive. ARIS is regarded as responsive to local needs,
proactive in addressing problems, professional and timely in terms of implementation and quality, and
a supportive partner to LSGs and utilities. ARIS was very effective in carrying out all aspects of
project management, including financial management, procurement, and reporting.
46.    Financial Management: Overall the financial management arrangements established by ARIS,
including accounting, reporting, budgeting, external auditing, funds flow and FM staffing were
satisfactory to the Bank during the life of the project. No significant accounting or internal control
issues were discovered. The project was also in full compliance with the Financial Covenants of the
Legal Agreement, including maintenance of an acceptable accounting system and submission of
interim and acceptable annual audited financial statements.
47.    Procurement. The procurement performance was satisfactory. ARIS' procurement files for
the project were very well organized, with all the necessary documents included and clearly labeled.
Procurement planning in general was adequate, and the plan was updated once a year and published on
the Bank's external web site.
48.    Prior to project completion, three procurement ex-post reviews were conducted, and the
project was included in the Kyrgyz Republic Country Portfolio Fiduciary Review.
49.    Reporting. ARIS submitted all required quarterly and annual reports in a timely manner.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.
50.    In light of the Government and ARIS performance as discussed above, the overall
performance of the Borrower was satisfactory.
6. Lessons Learned
* In circumstances where a whole system is on the verge of collapse, the need for flexibility in
project design is required. The STICBP faced the typical dilemma of the water/urban sector
in Central Asia. Public services were functional prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, but
deteriorated rapidly due to i) the lack of funding by local authorities and utilities, even for
basic O&M ii) inexistent maintenance or capital investment since the late eighties; iii)
obsolete and energy inefficient technologies; and iv) the limited and departing technical
capacity of local operators. In a situation where the Bank was the only donor providing
financial support for the rehabilitation of public services in small towns, the project faced all
these challenges at once, and difficult trade-offs had to be made. The project had to be
pragmatic in prioritizing demands/investments. STICBP supported towns that had reached a
breaking point to re-deliver services to acceptable levels while strengthening utilities which
had virtually stopped functioning. ARIS and the Task Team's flexibility have allowed the
project to serve the needs of the beneficiaries timely and effectively.
*  By preventing a complete collapse and allowing services to recover to a minimal level,
others donors could be persuaded to invest and be more strategic later on. With services
running again and utilities back in operation, some towns have witnessed increased revenues
and investment, and are no longer in "emergency mode." More donors are now investing or
preparing investment in selected small towns. These focused investments could yield
significant results in fewer selected towns, with higher economic rates of return and greater
impact.
*  If the investment is spread to more towns, it is important that the task team adjusts the
targets. In the case of this project, it could have made the difference between a satisfactory
outcome and a moderately satisfactory outcome.
12


﻿* While new technologies significantly improved the availability of services and the
operations of utilities, capacity building should be an integral part of project design. The
use of modern technology and equipment has had a significant impact on improving the
efficiency of the participating utilities, especially in reducing energy consumption. The
knowledge of how to install, operate and maintain new systems (energy efficient pumps,
computerized billing and accounting, and metering, etc) is vital for utilities to keep up with
proper operation and maintenance of installed equipment. Practical and on-the-job training,
which accompanied the new installation, was one of the most appreciated aspects of the
project according to beneficiaries. Further, where computerized billing and accounting
systems were installed and utility staff trained, utility revenue and management capacity
visibly improved.
7. Comment on issues raised by Borrower/Implementing Agency/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
51.    Beyond the formal project evaluation, ARIS and the utilities that participated in the ICR
round-table held on March 16, 2012 felt that the project had other tangible results. They made
reference to numerous success stories, such as the resuscitation of several utilities, and the remarkable
improvement in fee collection after the introduction of the computerized billing system. Improved
collection allowed some utilities to purchase new operational equipment from own resources (e.g
purchase of a new crane by Uzgen Vodokanal).

Sub-component A.3: Detailed Design, Bid Document Preparation. Technical Supervision and
Technical Studies:
The sub-component financed the various consulting services ARIS required for the implementation of
the project. This included the engineering and technical final design studies as well as tender
documents for the UI investments financed under sub-component A. 1. With the exception of the
First-Year Investment Program, all technical studies were carried out by Kyrgyz engineering firms.
For the first 2.5 years packages were reviewed by an international Project Management Consultant
(PMC) hired by ARIS. The PMC's role was to assist ARIS in the organization and coordination of
project implementation. The hiring of such a consultant was deemed advisable since ARIS had no
prior experience with the management of relatively complex large-scale investment operations.
Component B: Institutional Strengthening
Originally, this Component was to finance (a) preparation of Performance Improvement Action Plans
(PIAPs) for participating LSGs that would apply for financing of UII investments; (b) the provision of
training, advisory services, and workshops to help local infrastructure services providers implement
and achieve the objectives of PIAPs; (c) training of LSG staff in procurement and monitoring of SII
investments; and (d) the provision of technical assistance to various entities of the National
Government for the development and implementation of specific policy actions for local government
activities under the National Strategy for Further Decentralization and Local Self-Government
Development. The Component also financed purchase of equipment (computers and software) that
supported specific activities in PIAPs, in particular for strengthening billing and collection systems.
While the first three activities were implemented relatively successfully, resources for support to the
Government for the development and implementation of a policy framework for decentralization were
never called up. The funds were subsequently reallocated.
Component C: STICBP Implementation Support
19


﻿The project supported implementation by financing: (a) the provision of local experts for helping
LSGs develop SI1 investments; (b) the creation and maintenance of a system to monitor and evaluate
the performance and results of the project; (c) a portion of operating costs of the STICBP project
management unit (PMU) within ARIS (including staff salaries), in-country travel costs, mandatory
employer contributions to the Kyrgyz Social Fund, and the purchase of office equipment and vehicles;
and (d) annual audits of project accounts.

﻿Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)
Given the nature of the project there was no economic and financial analysis done at preparation. At
ICR, an analysis of the efficiency of the project, with relatively little data available for this work, was
carried out, and the results are summarized below:
Economic benefits of investments. The water supply investments generated both direct and indirect
benefits. These include time saved in collecting water, reduced health care costs, preventable loss of
income from water borne diseases. Indirect benefits include these from small business development,
and improved services within small towns. In order to estimate the benefits the incremental benefits
assessed include:
a. Value of time saved for water collection;
b. Reduced costs associated with water borne diseases which include labor losses and treatment
costs;
c. Savings in costs of boiling untreated water;
d. Savings from not having to buy bottled drinking water;
e. Increased producer surplus to current businesses and a small number of new business which
emerged as a result of improved water supply
The project costs included investment costs and incremental repair and maintenance costs.
Economic rates of return. For the computation, a discount rate of 12% was used. The economic rates
of return from the water development component and the road development component are presented
below in the Table:
Measures of economic efficiency and rates of return on investment in water development
Water sector component
Benefit: Cost ratio                                       1.36
Net Present value of incremental benefits per head (US $)  14.7
Internal Economic Rate of Return (%)                      13.72
The benefit/cost ratios for the water sector components are positive. The above results show that a
dollar invested in the water sector generated benefits to the tune of $1.36. Similarly the rate of return
on the investment in the project over a period of 25 years is about 13.72 %.
Evaluation of capacity building support for project implementation. The second and third components
of the project provided assistance for capacity building and institutional support for project
development and implementation. For capacity building, a conventional cost/benefit analysis cannot
be easily quantified in monetary terms. The capacity building component financed preparation of
Performance Improvement Action Programs (PIAP) for participating Local Self Governments;
training, advisory services and workshops to help local infrastructure providers to implement the
PIAPs; technical assistance for development and implementation of policy actions for further
Decentralization and Local Self Government Development. Similarly, the provision of local experts
for supporting LSG to develop investments; development and maintenance of an M&E system;
support for project management including procurement, financial management and annual audits.
Conclusions: The results of this analysis are primarily driven by key assumptions and values of
parameters considered. Further the analysis is constrained by lack of field level data on project
benefits and beneficiaries. It may also be noted that rates of return do not consider the possible
indirect benefits and the multiplier effects and inclusion of these indirect benefits could further
improve the returns from the project

﻿Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
General information on research
This Report is based on the results of impact evaluation survey carried out in January-February 2011.
Beneficiaries of Kara-Balta, Kok-Jangak, Nookat, Cholpon-Ata and Sulukta were evaluated on impact
of the water supply system rehabilitation whereas Batken's beneficiaries were surveyed on impact of
the rehabilitation of sewerage system.
Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the survey. Sample of 520 households from 6
participating towns was used for qualitative analysis and 12 focus groups of residents, service
enterprises and local authorities were organized for qualitative study. The survey included questions
about quality of water and supply, sewerage and services.
Survey questionnaires were designed to reflect Project indicators and included improved quality of
water supply, improved access to sewerage and improved billing system and services. Impact and
attitudes expressed by the beneficiaries of participating towns on rehabilitation works are summarized
below.
Main conclusions by towns
BATKEN
Improved access to sewerage system
One of the questions on the survey concerned the level of satisfaction with the rehabilitated sewerage
system in the residential houses and apartments. Respondents reported 1.5 times increased satisfaction
with the sewerage system outside house (from 30% to 45%), 1.3 times inside house (from 32% to
42%) and 1.5 times in the apartments (from 25% to 37%).
In particular, share of households (HH) using sewerage system has increased 2.7 times, to 65 percent.
Share of apartments where sewerage system has never been repaired has decreased 5.2 times, from 73
percent to 14 percent. Number of apartments reporting functional sewage system has also increased 4
times, to 45 percent. Share of apartments with pipes cluttered every week has decreased 3 times to 13
percent in addition to the 5.2 times decrease (from 73% to 14%) in number of apartments with no
rehabilitation works reported every done. Share of respondents who mentioned no repair works has
decreased from 49 percent to 0 percent against basic data survey.
Improved billing and payment
Vodokanal reported 1.65 times increase in fees collection for sewerage services with 1.4 times growth
in number of population willing to pay for services. Actual figures show that share of non-payers has
decreased from 11 percent to 1 percent comparing to those 73 percent paying the bills.
CHOLPON-ATA
Improved availability of water supply
Improved availability of water has improved by about 80%.
Improved quality of water supply
Participating beneficiaries were asked whether they struggle with frequent interruptions in water
supply and how do they rate improvement in quality of water supply. According to the survey 37
percent of respondents is not satisfied with the quality of water supply that is almost two times lower
comparing to 63 percent of dissatisfaction a year ago. Share of households consuming water with no
preliminary cleaning has increased almost 2 times, to 11 percent.
Improved billing and payment
In Cholpon-Ata 97 percent of beneficiaries were reported paying the bills for water services. Despite
increase of tariffs for water supply that constitutes 50 soms per month, 63 percent of beneficiaries pay
the bills monthly. According to Vodokanal 90 percent of the beneficiaries receive the bills however
due to low income some of the bills remain unpaid.
SULUKTA
Improved availability of water supply
Number of days per week during last month, during which water was lacking, has decreased from 5 to
4.3.
Distribution of water supply by days of week and day time became more even. Difference between
maximal and minimal share of week water supply has decreased from 29 percent to 13 percent.
24


﻿Difference between maximal and minimal share of average daily time of water supply decreased from
62.1 % to 36.3%. Supply of water is scheduled therefore beneficiaries have daily water supply
increased to 3.5 hours. Residents reported improvement of sanitary and hygiene conditions,
availability of time and water for gardening.
Improved quality of water supply
Percent of beneficiaries satisfied with improved quality of water supply has not significantly changed.
Majority of respondents reported no interruptions in water supply from individual and public stand
pipes that accounts for 96 percent and 87 percent respectively. According to the beneficiaries 76
percent continue boiling and 91 percent cleaning the water. Share of those who consume water without
preliminary cleaning amounts to 2% against 60% year ago.
Improved billing and payment
Survey indicates that beneficiaries pay for the water services given that tariff has not been increased.
Moreover, share of households paying the bills increased by 10 percent and amounted to 34% as they
receive bills. Vodokanal reports that share of respondents regularly receiving bills (receipt) for public
utility services has increased by 12 percent and amounted to 90 percent. Share of respondents
receiving bills (receipt) for drinking water has increased by 6 percent and amounted to 97 percent.
KARA-BALTA
Improved availability of water supply
Number of days per week during last month with no water has decreased from 3.2 to 1.2. Daily
distribution of water supply became more even. Difference between maximum and minimum share of
average daily supply of water decreased from 37 percent to 8 percent. Share of dwellers in residential
houses with 24 hours water supply/day has increased 28 times, to 85%. Average daily supply of water
has increased from 18 to 22 hours.
Improved quality of water supply
63 percent of respondents reported no interruption in water supply from individual stand pipes that see
increase by 8 percent since last year. Share of respondents mentioning no interruption in supply from
central water supply system has decreased by 10 percent, to 61 percent. Water is mainly unclean and
muddy due to frequent pipe breaks and rust. Share of those consuming water with no preliminary
cleaning has increased by 17 percent and amounted to 68 percent.
Improved billing and payment
Practically all respondents pay bills for water supply. Fee/capita per month has grown for 8 soms and
amounts to 28 soms. Share of households accepting this fee has increased by 7 percent and amounted
to 24 percent. Share of households paying yearly has decreased 3 times and amounts to 20 percent.
Share of households receiving no bills has decreased (3%). 13% of respondents pay bills via post or
bank that was not typical last year. Share of respondents who do not receive bills (receipt) for utility
services and drinking water accounts for 98%-99%.
KOK-JANGAK
Improved availability of water supply
Average number of days per week with no water supply due to interruptions has decreased from 2.6 to
1.5 days. Distribution of water supply by days of week and day time became more even. Difference
between maximal and minimal share of week time of water supply decreased from 15 percent to 1
percent. Difference between maximal and minimal share of average daily time of water supply
decreased from 49 percent to 12 percent. Average daily water supply increased from 4 to 14 hours.
Share of respondents using water more than 12 hours per day amounts to 45 percent, out of them 44
percent - day and night. Year ago all households could use central water supply system no more than
12 hours per day.
Improved quality of water supply
Respondents mentioned high quality of water supplied out of stand pipes. No interruptions in water
supply from individual stand pipes were reported by 82 percent of respondents, it is 18 percent more
than year ago. Share of respondents mentioning no water has increased by 37 percent and amounted to
73 percent of total users. 49 percent of users boil water and 79 percent clean it to improve quality.
Share of those consuming water with no preliminary cleaning amounts to 14 percent, year ago it was
55 percent. Vodokanal guarantees that upon completion of rehabilitation works residents will have day
and night access to water.
Improved billing and payment
25


﻿Share of respondents paying no bills has decreased 1.7 times, to 18%. Fee/capita per month remains 7
soms. Share of households accepting the fee rate has decreased from 19 percent to 6 percent. Share of
households paying once per month increased 1.4 times, to 55 percent. Notification on payment and its
collection now and year ago is mainly made by controllers. Share of those who are not notified on
payment has increased 3.8 times (to 19 percent). Share of respondents receiving no bills has decreased
1.8 times, to 19 percent. Share of respondents receiving bills monthly has increased by 16 percent and
amounted to 55 percent. Share of respondents receiving bills (receipt) has decreased by 18 percent and
amounted to 82 percent. Share of respondents regularly receiving bills (receipt) for drinking water has
increased by 12 percent and amounted to 83 percent.
NOOKAT
Improved availability of water supply
Average number of days with no water per week has decreased from 2 to 0, both for users of
individual and public stand pipes. Water supply during day time became more even. Difference
between maximum and minimum share of average daily water supply decreased from 26% to 15%.
Number of hourly water supply has increased at average for 1 hour - from 12 hours to 13 hours.
Number of hours of water supply has increased at due to increased number of public stand pipes from
11.3 to 12.9 hours. Share of respondents consuming water for more than 12 hours per day amounts to
52 percent, out of them 31 percent- day and night. Year ago central water supply system was used by
37 percent of households for more than 12 hours per day, out of them 31 percent day and night.
Improved quality of water supply
Respondents mentioned high quality of water supplied out of stand pipes. No water from individual
stand pipes was mentioned by 74 percent of respondents that is 22 percent lower than year ago. Share
of respondents mentioning no water in public stand pipes has decreased by 7 percent and amounted to
79 percent of total users. Main drawback of water is hardness.
For improvement of water quality majority of respondents boil (84%) and clean (75%). Share of those
consuming water with no preliminary cleaning amounts to 4 percent against 45 percent year ago.
Nevertheless, majority of participants of FG mentioned that quality of water has significantly
increased with minor pollution during rainy days.
Improved billing and payment
Share of respondents paying no bills practically has not changed and amounted to 10 percent.
Fee/capita per month has increased by 3 soms and amounts to 9 som. Share of households accepting
this fee has decreased twice to 22 percent. Share of households paying monthly has increased almost 7
times, to 26 percent. Share of households paying yearly decreased from 31 percent to 48 percent due to
improvement of services quality and accessibility of services. Notification on payment and its
collection as now and year ago is mainly made by controllers. Billing system contributed to better
information and awareness on bills and tariffs. Three-forth of respondents have bills paid monthly
against 80 percent of users having bills yearly. 13 percent of respondents do not receive bills at all.

﻿Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
Kyrgyz Republic:
Small Towns Infrastructure and Capacity Building Project (STICBP)
Workshop on findings of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
A workshop on the findings of the draft ICR for the STCIBP was organized by the World Bank and
ARIS on March 16, 2012 and attended by key ARIS staff, who worked on the project, some directors
of water utilities, which had been beneficiaries of the project, one representative of the Ministry of
Finance, one Member of the Parliament, and members of the Task Team of the WB. The detailed list
of participants is attached in the Annex 1 to these minutes.
Results of the ICR consultation with stakeholders:
The workshop was opened by the presentation of the findings of the draft ICR. The analysis of results
has shown that in terms of availability of water supply services, 90% of the project towns monitored
have reached the target. In terms of quality of water, 56% of towns monitored have reached the targets.
In terms of availability of solid waste collection (at least 2 times/month) 29% of the monitored towns
have reached the target, and 71% have seen improvements.
The round table concluded that the uneven achievement of targets was due to the fact that most of the
investments were aimed at the rescue of the declining infrastructure, primarily of the production
facilities. In the same way, the rather low rate of target achieved in solid waste collection was due to
the fact that funds for solid waste management were spread among 22 towns and in many of these
towns by the time of the project start the solid waste utilities have ceased to operate or were operating
on very minimal level. The impact of the project was significant in brining to regular operations solid
waste management utilities utilities in 22 towns and made great progress on the service levels, even in
cases when the target was not achieved. Another contributing factor to the lower than expected rate of
target achievement could be related to the distribution of more equipment in June 2011, the impact of
this equipment on solid waste collection could not be captured by the 2011 survey and could not be
measured by the ICR.
One of the important side effects of the project is development of the local private market of services
and goods to supply the needs of the utilities. This trend was not officially measured within the project
monitoring and evaluation framework.
Despite the formal project evaluation data, ARIS and vodocanal directors have referred to a number of
success stories, occurred during the course and as a result of the project. Such stories include the boost
in fee collection after the introduction of a computerized billing system, which has allowed some
utilities to purchase new equipment from their own resources (e.g purchase of a new crane in Uzgen
vodocanal).
Recommendations of the external participants (from the Govemment, Parliament and Vodocanals)
1. In order to achieve and sustain the results, in the future, similar projects should preferably
focus on deeper investments and changes, as alternative to cover many towns, but with limited
investments/improvements (supported by the MP M. Sabirov).
2. Less funding should be devoted to training and capacity building, compare to infrastructure
investments (point made by MP M. Sabirov). This recommendation was opposed by the
directors of the vodocanals, as they have stated, the training received was limited to essential
sessions in the course of the project, which was immediately applied into the operations (e.g
Grundfos pump operations), and utilities are in general suffering from the lack and shortage of
qualified personnel, with updated knowledge on utility management.
3. While the overall project rating is stated as Moderately Satisfactory, a number of significant
achievements due to the project is not reflected in the RF. In case the RF would be broadened
and re-adjusted during the course of implementation, the chances for project to be rated
satisfactory would be higher.

Annex 2. Lessons learnt by the workshop participants
For the time of Project implementation the following are some of the key lessons learnt:
1. Substantial progress has been achieved in understanding project management and evaluation.
Efficiency in handling organizational issues and working with the local population extensively
contributed to better tariff policy and knowledge management.
2. Little is known about how to sustain efficiency after the Project. Sustainability of the
outcomes greatly depend on further funding and leadership therefore constant peer and expert
review and evaluation as well as communications are important to address. In order to
maximize ability to attract private capital and reduce indirect costs vodokanals have to be
privatized for better services and efficiency. Although on job trainings were timely provided,
developing local capacity and technologies remain crucial for better functioning and
management.
3. The project epitomizes good practice in its support to all small towns however little has been
done in engaging all stakeholders and brining them to common understanding. One example
of the poor participation of the stakeholders concerns local authorities. Experience shows that
it is important working closely with local governments over cost estimation, prioritization and
monitoring.
4. New technologies have significantly improved services and water supply despite the costs
associated with their procurement and maintenance. Billing system as one of the technological
solution has already increased collection of fees from 25% to 80% in average whereas energy
efficient pumps have considerably enhanced the services.
5. Solid effort has been devoted to creating a market for local enterprises to provide the services
needed to plan and maintain, improve utility performance and serve people in low income
areas. The project also helped building recognition of preferences and constraints linked to the
decisions of the users.

﻿I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Background and rationale
The Kyrgyz Republic is a small and land-locked country with the population of about 5
million of which 65% live in rural areas. Agriculture is a dominant sector of economy and accounts for
about 40% of GDP. Almost half of the total population is employed in the agricultural sector,
producing 17% of total exports. These shares rise substantially if food processing and other agro-
industries are included. Since independence the country has pursued a determined policy of
privatization and market development.
The Kyrgyz Republic faces substantial challenges in rebuilding basic infrastructure in urban
areas. Since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, there has been rapid deterioration in the
availability and quality of public infrastructure services. Services once taken for granted (drinking
water, solid waste collection, treatment, etc.) are often available only intermittently or not available at
all. Steady deterioration in the quality of municipal services has led to public health hazards.
Today, after more than a decade of severe neglect, large portion of local service infrastructure,
installations, and equipment have deteriorated and are hardly repairable. It needed to be rebuilt or
replaced entirely if service delivery is to be restored to minimally acceptable levels. The capacity of
local governments in providing infrastructure services is limited due to lack of available fiscal
resources and weak institutions. Consequently, local authorities and operators are unable to function
under such a constrained environment, and fail to manage utilities and cope with the rapidly
deteriorating infrastructure.
An important factor to consider under the current conditions is that responsibility for the
delivery of the most basic local public services was transferred to local self governments (LSGs) as
part of the Kyrgyz Republic's move towards decentralization in the mid-1990s. Most LSGs were then
- and continue to be today - unable to assume new responsibilities due to the lack of necessary fiscal
resources, technical means, and institutional capacities.
The Kyrgyz Government's policy aimed at improving quality of infrastructure services and
decentralization of governance in the country determined the importance of the Project. Infrastructure
facilities and services became an integral part of the local authorities' responsibility with all related
consequences to include immediate rehabilitation and reconstruction.
In this regard, improving access to quality infrastructure services and rehabilitation of
infrastructure facilities in small towns has become one of the most important social tasks of the
Government. It should be noted that before this project no single investment project addressed the
issue of providing access and rehabilitation of infrastructure facilities. It became important to address
the devastating infrastructure environment of 23 towns legally set before October 25, 2004 at rayon
and oblast levels. These towns had to meet certain conditions to be treated under STICBP.
Through improvement of urban and social infrastructure and capacity building, the project has
created good preconditions for sustainable development of utility operators and sovereignty in tackling
the issues related to the utility management and infrastructure maintenance. The Project is the first
comprehensive initiative that supports upgrading infrastructure in small towns at the national level
within the framework of decentralized governance system.
B. Overall assessment of the Project objectives and tasks
The Small Towns Infrastructure and Capacity Building Project focused its efforts on small
towns of the Kyrgyz Republic. The Project beneficiaries were the small towns' residents, municipal
utility enterprises, local self-government bodies, NGOs and the Project partners.
The key objective of the Project was to improve the availability, quality and efficiency of local
infrastructure services for the population of participating small towns.
32


﻿This objective was achieved by (a) financing the rehabilitation and/or repair of basic infrastructure
and utility service facilities, installations and equipment, and (b) assisting local governments in
increasing the effectiveness of the management of local infrastructure services.
The urgency of the key objective of STICBP did not diminish over the Project implementation
it rather gained more importance given the deterioration of the existing infrastructure. The same is true
about the tasks set for achievement of this objective. Successful achievement of the project goals was
accompanied by the following approaches:
*      First - decentralized approach to investments use. This has contributed to increased
accountability of local self-government bodies, participation of small towns in decision
making regarding the use of investments.
*      Second - Participatory monitoring and evaluation of subprojects enabled improving the
quality of works and monitor the investments provided.
*      Third - necessary institutional development trainings were delivered to local government
bodies and service providers. The Project assisted the public utility enterprises in improving
their performance efficiency to deliver infrastructure services to residents of small towns and
contributed to strengthening their capacity to implement further reforms.
Components addressed three critical tasks:
These tasks included management of rehabilitated facilities, rehabilitation of infrastructure
facilities and improvement of social infrastructure and strengthening the capacity of utility enterprises.
There were some infrastructure problems that have not been resolved or not resolved in full by the
project due to lack of mandate, as well as problems that were identified during project implementation.
These circumstances have not allowed addressing the tasks by the Government in full. The positive
results achieved under the project in improving access to water supply services were limited to zones
(areas) of residence of specific beneficiaries covered by the area of rehabilitation works. It impeded to
fully cover and solve the problem of drinking water in some towns. There is a need for improvement
of the technical condition of utility enterprises, reconstruction of facilities and networks, and
improvement of management efficiency. This would enable addressing the challenges the Government
faces in a better way. Given the critical condition of the drinking water supply systems in towns at the
beginning of the project, the project treated maximum number of towns rehabilitating and replacing
equipment. Due to limited resources, water supply systems in most of the towns remained desolated
with no rehabilitation and construction treatment. This leads to frequent breaks and continual leaks of
potable water. The problem of municipal assets maintenance and supervision was not fully addressed.
Service providers work almost without proper oversight, which leads to adoption of poor management
and technical solutions, and failure to introduce procedures aimed at reducing operating expenses. This
problem limits the access of the beneficiaries to quality infrastructure services offered by providers.
The problem with municipal property of towns was not resolved. The property of water supply and
sewerage facilities handed over to mayor's offices and town governments following the Government's
resolutions does not match the list of property and inventory. In some towns, the property of the water
supply and sewerage facilities has been handed over to municipal ownership only partially.
Immovable property transferred to municipal ownership was not always properly registered with the
State Registry as required by the national legislation and in some cases it has not been included in the
Register of municipal property by the town municipalities.
II. Evaluation of implementation
A.     Project results by components
In order to achieve Project objective, the following structure of the project was adopted. The
project consists of three components: Component A "Small Towns Infrastructure Improvements
Program"; Component B "Institutional Strengthening"; and Component C "STICBP Implementation
Support". Each of these components deals with specific tasks. In general, the components were
designed to accomplish the tasks set for the Project by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic.
Component A. Small Towns Infrastructure Improvements
33


﻿STICBP aimed at assisting the participating local self-government bodies in implementation
of Town Development Strategies developed by them through development and implementation of
Small Towns Infrastructure Improvements. The STIIP included three subcomponents:
(A. 1)  Urban Infrastructure Improvements (UII);
(A.2)  Social Infrastructure Improvements (SII) and
(A.3)  Technical Assistance in Preparation of Detailed Design and Bidding Documentation for
Selected UII Subprojects, including conducting technical studies for this effect and technical
supervision over implementation of UII subprojects.
Subcomponent A.1 Urban Infrastructure Improvements (UII)
Under this subcomponent grants were provided for the repair, rehabilitation, and replacement
or upgrading of local infrastructure service installations and equipment necessary for improving the
utility services. The Program aimed at addressing urgent problems in such sectors as water supply,
waste water treatment, solid waste collection and disposal, and urban roads that are under the
responsibility of local self governments in line with the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic On Local Self-
Government and Local State Administration (dated January 12, 2002).
Under the Urban Infrastructure Improvements Subcomponent 24 subprojects of total value
12,664,428 USD were implemented in 18 towns in water supply, waste water and local roads sectors
(see Annex 1 for detailed information on each town).
Efficiency of implemented subprojects should be emphasized here as all construction and
installation works specified in the detailed design and estimates were fully completed.
Special machinery. Over the period from 2006 through 2011 the Project supplied 101 items of
special machinery for collection and disposal of solid and liquid domestic waste of total value USD
3,258,211. Special machinery was procured for 22 towns out of 23. Machinery was not procured for
Kara-Kul because OJSC "Naryn HPS" provides utility services in this town (see Annex 1 for detailed
information on each town).
The following works have been completed under the Project:
14 pumping stations and 44 deep wells rehabilitated;
1 pumping station constructed and 6 wells drilled;
New water rowers and chlorination units constructed;
Old and inefficient pumps and electrical equipment replaced by energy saving equipment with
three years of warranty and support maintenance;
Existing reservoirs rehabilitated;
New reservoirs constructed (two V1500m3 in Uzgen; a V50m3 water tower in Tokmok; two
V200 m3 reservoirs in Shopokov; a V1000 m3 reservoir, a V800m3 reservoir and four
reservoirs with V50m3 each in Sulukta).
In Nookat, for example, drinking water was supplied by a schedule, the volume of water
supplied to the distribution network of the town was not sufficient and the debit of water generated
from Kapka and Chechme-Say sources constituted 30 1/s before the Project, and reached 90 1/s after
rehabilitation of all installations; water supply hours improved and 24 hours/day supply was
accomplished. In Sulukta, following rehabilitation of a set of reservoirs and drilling of a new well at
Kara-Bulak zone, and relocation of main water pipes from zones under threat the water supply to
Bokonbaev and Kirpichnaya areas became reliable, even through before the Project these districts used
to get water only once per week.
In the sewerage sector earlier catastrophic situation with treatment and disinfection of waste
waters was improved. In Talas a biological treatment pond and sewerage pumping station with the
capacity of 300 m3 /h were built. In Mailuu-Suu head treatment plants, two sewerage pumping stations
with the influent flow volume of 20,000m3 /day were rehabilitated. Besides, improvement of the
disinfection rate from 20% to 78% according to the SES, contributed to the improved environmental
and epidemiological situation in the town and downstream of the Mailuu-Suu River. Sewerage
pumping stations were built in Naryn and Tash Kumyr to prevent pollution to the Naryn River by
inflows of wastes.
34


﻿4 kilometers of road were paved in downtown of Tash Kumyr. The STICBP rehabilitated new
water stand pipes and chlorination stations and installed bactericidal lamp and electrolysis system of
water disinfection which uses salt and generates sodium hypochlorite. Such a system was used in
Kyrgyzstan for the first time (in Shopokov and Cholpon-Ata). In Batken the Project completed
complex set of rehabilitation works, having actually constructed a new system of head sewerage
installations to replace the ruined one - 2 compact installations KU-200 were installed, administrative
and production buildings were rehabilitated, pumping station, chlorination unit, sludge pond and
biological ponds were provided equipment. Two preschool education facilities - "Altyn-Beshik" and
"Oruk-Zar", railway "Kelechek", clinics and some administrative and housing units were additionally
connected to the collector.
Subcomponent A.2 Social Infrastructure Improvements (SII)
Besides infrastructure subprojects the Project included activities aimed at strengthening the
capacity of local self-government bodies and service providers. Implementation of SII subprojects was
part of strengthening the LSG capacity as the LSGs were responsible for selection of subprojects and
contractors, conducting bidding and technical supervision over implementation of works. Under the
framework of the STICBP 88 social infrastructure subprojects (schools, hospitals, kindergartens,
sports and play grounds) have been implemented in 23 small towns of the total value USDI,167,504
(see Annex 1 for detailed information on each town).
Subcomponent A.3 Preparation of detailed designs of UII subprojects and technical
supervision
This subcomponent targeted development of detailed designs and bidding documentation for
UII subprojects. ARIS was directly in charge of ensuring technical supervision over UII subprojects
implementation in line with the Framework Agreements signed with the town municipalities. For the
first two and half years of the project ARIS was supported by a Project Management Consultant
(PMC). ARIS and respective consultants provided technical assistance to towns and conducted
trainings and seminars for (a) development and implementation of Utility Enterprise' Performance
Improvement Action Plans (PIAP), (b) rendering support in PIAP implementation, (c) empowering
LSG to manage procurement, implement and supervise SII subprojects, (d) development and
implementation of special policy on the input of small towns' municipalities to implementation of the
National Strategy for Further Decentralization of State Governance and Development of Local Self-
Government.
Component B. Institutional Strengthening
The Component B aimed at providing technical and institutional support to town
municipalities to engage them in STICBP implementation.
Elaboration of Town Development Strategies (TDS) and Investments Plans for all small towns
that had not developed them yet was one of the critical tasks in strengthening the capacity of small
towns' LSGs. This task was accomplished during STICBP preparation phase. It was a requirement
under STICBP that all applications for infrastructure projects submitted by small towns to be both
consistent with TDS and IP of the respective town and operational. The activities for strengthening the
capacity of communal services providers included development of Performance Improvement Action
Plans for utility enterprises in all small towns, except for Tash-Kumyr. PIAPs were agreed with the
town municipalities. The Consultant hired for development of PIAPs also prepared detailed reports on
the utility enterprises operating in the sectors of drinking water supply, sewerage and collection and
disposal of solid waste. In the report the Consultant made specific recommendations for LSG of each
town and service provider. Recommendations focused on key improvements in management,
interaction between the LSG and service providers, improving or changing the status of service
providers and transferring the assets.
To support PIAP implementation a number of trainings were conducted for LSG staff and the
service providers:
Technical trainings focused on:
a.     Operation and maintenance of pumps, electrical equipment. This training was conducted by an
International Consultant and representative of manufacturing companies for engineers and
operators of water utilities;
b.     Operation of machinery, vehicles and heavy equipment;
35


﻿c.     Operation and maintenance of special machinery provided for solid waste and water utility
enterprises (KKP). The training was conducted for engineers, mechanics and drivers by the
Consultant -the Institute of Transport and Communications.
d.     Water loss management and reduction. The training was conducted by an International
Consultant for the LSG and heads of utilities;
e.     Basic principles and methods of water treatment and disinfection. The training was conducted
for 12 towns participating in the Project to rehabilitate their water supply systems. The
training was conducted by the Department of sanitary and epidemiological supervision under
the Ministry of Health.
Trainings on Management Improvement:
a.     A seminar on legal issues of interrelations between the LSG and service providers was
conducted for all towns jointly with the Urban Institute. Practical recommendations were
made based on the assessment of enterprises and LSG.
b.     A practical seminar was developed for solid waste enterprises based on operation materials of
the special machinery and development of financial and service documents. The seminar was
held in premises of utilities of Jalal Abad, Balykchi and Kara-Balta and included
demonstration of their activities;
c.     Consulting services were provided for Nookat and Talas to introduce the system of managing
solid waste and collection in the newly established enterprises;
d.     Information campaigns were conducted for solid waste enterprises of 22 towns to support
sustainable operation of special machinery supplied by the Project;
e.     In Batken a Business Plan of Solid Waste Enterprise was developed and training on operation
and maintenance of sewerage treatment facilities was conducted for the local specialists.
Improvement of Financial Management:
a.     An automatic billing system was introduced in 12 water utility operators in Balykchi, Talas,
Kyzyl-Kya, Kant, Naryn, Mailuu-Suu, Cholpon-Ata, Shopokov, Tash-Kumyr, Nookat,
Sulukta, and solid waste enterprises (KKP) in Balykchi, Karakol, Mailuu-Suu, Shopokov and
Naryn. This helped to improve the quality of service delivery, make the controllers' work
transparent and raise the service fee. The customer service quality was improved and
population was granted opportunity to obtain information on services rendered and,
subsequently, demand the proper quality of services. Information on arrears as of the end of
month, nature and sources of these payables, summary report on fines and the point of contact
to appeal to in case of any questions became also available for the customers. IC accounting
software was introduced in Kant and Shopokov.
Trainings contributed to building the capacity of local self-government bodies and local
service providers. This helped ensuring sustainable operation and management of assets of
local self-governments and service providers.
Component C. STICBP Implementation Support
This component provided for overall STICBP management performed by the Community
Development and Investment Agency through funding of the following:
* Services of international experts to assist in development of subprojects under SII
subcomponent;
*   Establishment and maintenance of the system of monitoring and evaluation of the Project
performance and outcomes;
*   Operational expenses of the Project Management Unit (PMU) in ARIS;
*  Annual audit of Project accounts.
Special emphasis was made on selection of staff of the Project Management Unit (PMU) to
ensure efficient implementation of the Project. All PMU specialists were equipped with necessary
36


﻿computer and office equipment, furniture and other appliances procured in line with the requirements
of the World Bank procurement procedures. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic allocated an
office building for ARIS as co-financing to the Project. The Project implementation support also
included conducting baseline studies and impact assessment to evaluate achievement of indicators as
per the accessibility and quality of basic infrastructure services in small towns and the level of
populations' satisfaction with these services. The table X2 1 reflects data of surveys:

audited and the audit findings were submitted to the World Bank and presented at the ARIS
Supervisory Board meetings.
Material investment outcomes:
a)     Works executed under the project, construction, reconstruction of water intake facilities,
replacement of pumping equipment to pumps with higher pressure and efficiency,
construction of second line pumping stations with installation of horizontal pumps and partial
reconstruction of water supply network have increased volume of water supplied and
improved availability and quality of services provided by the utility operators.
b)     Rehabilitation and construction of buildings of chlorination units and pumping stations has
improved the quality and disinfection of drinking water.
c)     Efficiency of public utilities improved, pumping equipment was replaced to power saving
highly efficient pumps with enforced protection (3 levels of protection) and 3-year warranty
period. All of these contributed to extension of the service life of pumps from 10 to 15 years
and reduction of electricity costs.
d)     The level of public satisfaction with services improved. Water was supplied even to districts
that had no access to water prior to the Project in Sulukta and Kok-Zhangak; thus the
population finally gained access to water.
e)     Rehabilitation of sewerage system has improved the environmental situation along the trans-
boundary river basins, where sewage is discharged. This reduced the pollution of the river
used for irrigation of gardens and watering of the cattle by sewage discharge.
f)     In some small towns rehabilitation of water systems made it possible to supply water to areas
where no rehabilitation works were carried out. In Jalalabad, following the rehabilitation of
water supply system, the water pressure increased greatly, and the apartment gas water heaters
designed for hot water began to work again.
Institutional Development Outcomes:
The project impact was aimed at improving governance and public services. The following
were undertaken to enhance the institutional capacity:
a.     Establishment of three new municipal enterprises is one of the outcomes of the project
activities. Some towns did not have utility operators for town improvement and waste
collection and disposal, because they were transferred to private ownership, for example, in
Tash-Kumyr and Uzgen special enterprises for town improvement and waste water collection
and disposal were newly established. This enabled shifting from collecting taxes to applying
37


﻿tariffs approved by the city Kenesh for the first time. However, institutions that could
effectively manage the infrastructure facilities were not in place due to many factors, the most
critical of them being outstanding arrears of the utilities.
The Municipal Property Department considered the possibility of establishing an operator for
maintenance of sewerage networks that could become a self-financing unit under the
department. It would be expedient to create an institution at the central level to promote the
interests of utility enterprises. Capacity building and strengthening the material and technical
basis of existing institutions of municipal enterprises, partnerships, condominiums, etc. is
possible.
b.     The project delivered trainings and seminars for the staff of designated enterprises to
strengthen capacity, in particular, in billing system. The institutional development requires
attention not only to technical investments, but to management improvement including
financial one.
c.     Improvement of management through introduction of the billing system made it possible to
increase the rate of collection of payment for drinking water from 35% to 85%. It also has to
do with improved level of people's satisfaction with the quality of water supply services.
Financial performance of water utility operators in Uzgen, Kara-Suu, and Nookat has greatly
improved, and now these enterprises are operating at a profit.
B. STICBP Disbursements
Disbursements made under the main project over the period from 2005 through September 30,
2011 constituted USD 17,597,759.29. Disbursements under the additional financing amounted to USD
4,360,309.73 (see detailed table in Annex 2).
C. Performance of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, LSG, contractors and
consultants
The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has created favorable conditions for project
implementation. In particular, a working group of 15 persons was formed, which was tasked to solve a
number of key issues related to the small towns. The commission included heads and personnel of
ministries and departments, the Prime Minister Office, the Presidential Administration, the Executive
Director of the Association of Towns, and the STICBP Coordinator. The acting First Vice Prime
Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic was appointed as a Chairman of the commission. However, there are
unresolved issues of cooperation between the Kyrgyz Republic Government and LSGs on asset
management, sewerage, solid waste collection and outstanding arrears of public utilities.
During the project implementation, cooperation of ARIS and LSG has been successful. LSGs
participated actively in preparation and implementation of subprojects headed by managers appointed
from LSGs. They monitored directly on site the contracts implementation, and in the case of
controversial issues they addressed to ARIS to solve the problem.
Nevertheless, the following issues have to be highlighted:
-      Poor planning has become a major problem during preparation of subprojects. For example, at
the stage of project preparation and implementation the LSGs of Kara-Suu, Nookat and Batken towns
delayed preparation of permission and guidance documents or the prepared documents were of low
quality. This led not only to delay in implementation of planned works by the contractors, but also to
additional expenditures. In particular these were issues related to provision of ADS (Architecture and
Design Specifications), ETA (Engineering technical assignment), and problems with allocation of land
not legally assigned to municipal ownership or under private ownership. Facilities sometimes did not
belong to the municipalities.
-      Frequent turnover of key players led not only to delays in implementation of subprojects, but
also to the need to revise the original plans. Increase in work volumes inevitably led to cost escalation
by about 15% and need for additional time (over 12 months) to complete the project. Delays in
completion as well as increase in costing were also caused by lack of continuity in decision-making.
38


﻿- Local authorities sometimes were reluctant to meet 3% co-financing commitment. LSGs
violated their obligations under the Framework Agreement to pertain disbursements. Moreover, local
budget often had no co financing expenditures that also contributed to delays (up to 6 months) of the
works and frustration of the contractors, who had to mobilize commencement of works out of these
resources. The Project had to repeatedly contact and address issues of co-financing to the higher
authorities. As an example, following towns - Batken and Kok-Zhangak - had implementation of their
subproject dramatically delayed.
Contractors
In the process of implementation, two important issues came up while the contractors were
working on site. First is the low organizational and logistical capacity of the latter. Second problem
was related to low participation in tenders. The contractors did not have sufficient capacity to
implement subprojects in time and quality. During preparation and conducting tenders, weak logistical
and financial base, lack of skilled professionals, working capital, machinery, lack of experience in
planning the production process and preparing tender documents, etc. became evident. A small
number of construction companies participated in tenders sometime overestimating costs for relatively
low quality work. It should be noted that the contractors and international consultants are not well
experienced in building relations with LSG yet.
Consultants
Urban Institute was directly involved in preparation of business plans for municipal water
utilities, and methodologies developed by the Urban Institute were also used. Urban Institute was
engaged in the expert committee as an expert. UI participated in the tender and was awarded an
international consultancy contract to prepare Performance Improvement Action Plans (PIAP) for
public utility enterprises in 11 towns of the Kyrgyz Republic. Seminars on legal and contractual
commitments between LSG and service providers were conducted with participation of the Urban
Institute. UI also facilitated elaboration of Town Development Strategies. In the course of project
implementation recommendations of the Urban Institute on interaction between LSG and service
providers were put in practice, including contractual responsibilities, accountability, ownership issues,
etc.
Consulting Company "Posch & Partners" prepared feasibility study and detailed designs for project
proposals of seven towns based on the adopted Town Development Strategies (TDS) to be financed in
the first year of project implementation. The prepared tender documentation was insufficient and
required further elaboration by the design organizations. All of these caused some difficulties and
delays during subprojects implementation.
For instance, treatment of drinking water in Cholpon-Ata was delayed and had costs increased
due to poor design of documentation of so called slow filters system (horizontal sedimentation pond,
gravel and sand filters) that was prepared in the first year of the project. Project turned to require
transfer of the construction site, additional investigations, construction of additional facilities, and
detail elaboration of the subproject. As a result, the subproject implementation was started in April
2008 and completed in September 2010 - the construction and installation works were extended for
more than 2 years. Besides, the tender documentation had a lot of technical mistakes that had to be
addressed. According to the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic, only licensed organizations can
provide services on designs and estimations. If the consultant does not have such a license, it is
impossible to organize expert review of the prepared design-estimate documentation although it is a
mandatory procedure. The lack of such an expertise prevents from obtaining permission for
construction works, without which performance of works is prohibited by law.
Consulting company "SEYAS" was weak in engineering of subprojects that caused problems
during subprojects implementation. Problems during preparation and implementation of contracts
were conditioned by delays in timely problem solving and weak interaction with the local authorities.
The comments after review of prepared design estimates for towns were not correct. For example,
during rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage in Talas engineers incorrectly designed two sewage
pumps with discharge of 100 m3/hour when it became necessary to have another pump with capacity
of 300 m3/hr installed. Errors were made in the designs of dams' mount and slopes' depth. All these
questions had to be addressed during rehabilitation of the facility, consequently, the time-frame and
costs of rehabilitation were adversely impacted.
39


﻿D. World Bank performance
The World Bank performance in terms of procurement during project preparation and
implementation can be evaluated as satisfactory. In the course of project preparation and
implementation the World Bank promptly reviewed the project progress and provided where needed
recommendations and comments on progress of works. The World Bank "No objection" was provided
in a timely manner. The World Bank timely influenced decision-making, and provided consulting
assistance. The World Bank staff oversaw the project implementation through supervision missions,
meetings with representatives of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, and through sites visit. The
World Bank review followed the procedures for preliminary and post review in accordance with the
approved procurement plan. The project implementation mechanism proposed by the Bank was well
thought out and conducive to further development of utility enterprises. These enterprises were
planned to become sustainable and profitable by improving access, quality and efficiency. For
example, as a result of the project, some enterprises have become functioning and profitable that
shows impact of the project and well developed strategy.
III. Performance evaluation

﻿Main project impact
The first target of the project impact was to improve the quality of drinking water, increase
water pressure in the water supply system and supply drinking water for more than 12 hours a day.
1.     Number of households with reduced distance from the house to the water standpipe
increased from 26% to 78%. This enabled significant savings in time for women and
children to get water. This was achieved by installing water taps and rehabilitation of
water mains.
2.     Number of households using water from open water sources (rivers, canals, wells) as
drinking water decreased from 64% to 49%, which significantly reduced the risk of
infectious diseases, especially among children.
3.     Number of households with drinking water supplied to the upper floors of buildings
increased from 48% to 92%. If previously they had water only on the 1 or 2 floors, now
with increased water pressure, the water is available to the upper floors as well (2nd and
above, for example, in Jalalabad, Tokmok, Kyzyl-Kiya).
4.     Number of households dissatisfied with the quality of water reduced significantly.
Reservation of drinking water has also reduced. This was achieved due to rehabilitation
of existing reservoirs and water towers, construction of new reservoirs that allowed utility
operators securing water at peak times, maintaining pressure in the system and saving
energy when pumps are off.
The second target of the project impact was to improve customer relations management system.
1.     Trainings were delivered for LSG employees on accounting of municipal property,
operation and use of pumps and electrical equipment, new technologies and possibility
of water purification and wastewater disinfection, management and maintenance of
pumping and electrical equipment.
The third target of the project impact was to improve the environmental situation especially of
water sources such as rivers. (ARIS to check)
The project indicators introduced into the matrix allowed reflecting the main project
outcomes as a whole. During discussions with the WB mission additional indicators were
included to fully cover the project benefits in certain areas of the project impact. For example, the
indicator "Collection rate before and after introducing the billing system", clearly reflects
improvement of water supply in small towns where works were carried out under the project. It
should be noted that benefits of the road construction in Tash-Kumyr under the subproject
"Rehabilitation of the 4 km road in Tash-Kumyr" were not fully evaluated since the subproject
was not included in the baseline survey, and later in the impact assessment. The project's impact
on utilities in terms of management efficiency was not fully evaluated. So, benefits were not
evaluated in areas not covered by the project, but the project had an indirect impact on
beneficiaries.
Some indicators were submitted and recommended by the World Bank to monitor the
Project activities after project implementation in July 2009, for example, the indicator "Number
of people in urban area who received access to "improved sanitation" under the project". At the
time of introduction of this indicator, the sewage system rehabilitation works in Talas, Naryn,
Mailuu-Suu, and Tash-Kumyr were completed. Therefore, to track the dynamics of other
subprojects in the sanitation sector, it is desirable to introduce additional indicators that would
clearly reflect the situation before and after project implementation.
IV. General evaluation and recommendations
43


﻿A. General assessment and lessons learnt
It is noteworthy that STICBP is one of the projects, where effective dialogue with LSG
was established, jointly with which various problems of municipal infrastructure were prioritized
and selected sub-projects were implemented.
However, one of the major problems encountered over the course of the project was
related to preparation of design and estimate documentation by the international consultant. Due
to the weakness of local contractors, they had to use the services of local design organizations for
detailed development and completion of project documentation. This has resulted in some delays
in the implementation of UII sub-projects. A striking example of this situation is the sub-project
in Talas.
Another problem related to the international consultant was the fact that for the state
expertise of the design and estimate documentation it is necessary to have licensed organization
to perform such works in the Kyrgyz Republic. Due to the absence of such a license serious
problems were faced in course of obtaining a permit for construction and assembly works. To
avoid such problems in future it is necessary to select those consultants who have or will have a
license for design in the Kyrgyz Republic by the contract commencement date. Another problem
was insufficient development and study of UII sub-projects both from the PMU and the project
management consultant (Seyas) side. Sub-projects in such cities as Mailuu-Suu, Cholpon-Ata,
and Talas illustrate the problem. To avoid such problems in the future it is necessary to study and
develop sub-projects in details including frequent site visits.
Conducting tenders, signing and implementation of contracts
The main problem in conducting tenders was the weakness of the contractors:
a.     They often did not include in their calculations all necessary expenses; consequently,
underestimated the contract value. In order not to lose the amount of the bid guarantee,
they signed the contract with the hope that in the course of the contract they could
somehow settle the problem. In the end, it was necessary to terminate the contract
delaying the subproject implementation (subprojects in Tokmok and Tash-Kumyr may be
an example). This problem has been solved during the project implementation.
b.     The contractors were often short of working capital - this delayed performance
guarantees and advance payment, which, in turn, delayed the contract implementation.
c.     Most of contractors have worn and small equipment pool, in view of this, they were
forced to rent equipment from third parties, which also was obsolete. In this connection
performance of work was delayed very often due to breakage of equipment, which
ultimately upset the schedule of works.
d.     Almost all the contractors had problems with delivery of equipment and materials. This is
due to poor planning of the production process: contractors remembered that they need
these or other materials or equipment, when time of their use/application came.
e.     Within the UII subprojects a lot of old wells had to be rehabilitated and new wells had to
be drilled. However, the number of specialized organizations that have the appropriate
license was very limited (one in the south, and three or four in the north). In this regard,
contractors were forced to stand in line to such organizations, which consequently
delayed the contract implementation.
f.     Another problem was lack of water-lifting pipes (for submersible pumps) in the Republic.
Contractors working under the STICBP were forced to cooperate in order to buy their
own pipes in Russia (suppliers refused to supply pipes in small batches).
44


﻿g.     Certain problems were related to insufficient development of the design documentation.
So, in Talas the sedimentation pond design had to be redone due to errors in the original
design, and measures to lower the groundwater level had to be taken.
Supervision
During the contract supervision the following main problems were faced:
a.     Failure of contractors to comply with safety regulations. Despite repeated comments,
safety regulations were often violated, that posed a threat to life and health of contractors'
employees.
b.     The contractors made very often an effort to apply used materials and equipment. All
these attempts were stopped and the contractors were forced to replace them with new
ones.
B. Challenges encountered and ways to deal with them
There were no problems during the project preparation and implementation. All questions
concerning subprojects preparation and implementation were solved by ARIS and LSG in due
course. The Government signed timely the Financing Agreement.
Despite the achievement of the project goals, there were problems that were beyond the
project mandate and that have arisen during the implementation of the project:
-   Poor condition of the main and distribution pipes. It was expected that rehabilitation of
drinking water supply facilities would improve functioning of the head water intakes,
repair and drilling of boreholes, construction of disinfection stations and reservoirs.
However, increased water and supply pressure in the water system has led to a
deterioration of the enough poor main and distributing pipes. Their poor condition has led
to frequent accidents in the water supply networks.
-   Poor condition of main and distribution networks. The networks for a long time were not
rehabilitated; pipes of different diameters and different materials were used, which does
not provide the proper pressure in homes and apartments.
-   Lack of drinking water meters leads to an inefficient and irrational use. The increased
drinking water supply has not led to its rational use, both by the utility operators and
beneficiaries. This deficiency has been caused by the absence of drinking water metering
devices. Installation of water meters would reduce the water losses, improve efficiency
and increase the collection of water consumption fee. It would also allow us to move
from the old water metering system, i.e. from the normative consumption to actual
consumption accounting. While consumers' behavior towards payment for drinking water
changed, the behavior towards careful attitude to the water has not changed.
-   The disadvantage is the lack of sedimentation ponds and filters for water treatment in
some cities, the required technical condition of the sedimentation ponds and filters is not
maintained. In some cities, the beneficiaries use drinking water from open sources. They
are not satisfied with the quality of water in the flood period, which has excessive
turbidity, silt and sand.
-   Ineffective management of utility operators has led to misbalanced provision and
consumption of water. Inefficient use of new and existing equipment leads to an
unjustified increase in water supply exceeding standards. These are losses both
commercial and technical, which ultimately lead to debts of the utility operators before
power supply companies. In this connection, the utility enterprises save energy by
45


﻿reducing the water supply to consumers. The companies are forced to introduce a water
supply schedule, and it reduces the effects of the project.
-   Shortage or sometimes lack of qualified professionals able to manage not only the high-
tech equipment and facilities, but also water and sewer networks remains an acute
problem. Without required maintenance on the part of skilled professionals, equipment,
facilities and networks may become worthlessness. Low qualification of experts,
operators of the billing system, and poor technical equipment can reduce quality of
services provided. Poor management leads to inadequate collection of payment for
services rendered. This will also make impossible new investments in fixed assets.
-   Passive participation of civil society (NGOs, condominiums, or partnerships) in
management and provision of quality infrastructure services is a drawback. The impact
assessment and baseline survey revealed that the LSGs and utility enterprises have
insufficient communications with the residents to increase awareness on operation of
sewerage and water systems, careful attitude to drinking water.
C. Recommendations
The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic would suggest the following steps to further
improve access to and quality of infrastructure services.
*      Condition of treatment plants and facilities for cleaning and decontamination of
wastewater became an acute issue for small towns in recent years. In Uzgen, Kara-Suu,
Nookat, Kerben, Isfana, Kok-Zhangak and Sulukta, where population tends to grow and
is at least 25 thousand people, wastewater treatment facilities virtually do not exist.
*      The second most important priority issue is availability of treatment facilities, lack of
which leads to environmental risks, outbreaks of epidemiological diseases among the
population.
*      The project has successfully solved the problems of urban wastewater in Talas, Tash-
Kumyr, and Mailuu-Suu. In these towns, a trans-boundary river flows, and there was a
chance of flowing of not disinfected runoff to neighboring states. At the same time, lack
of treatment plants forces people to use pit latrines and septic tanks. One of the project
approaches would be construction of treatment facilities for these towns using new
technology, not applied previously in the country. For example, construction of swap
treatment facilities that provide simple structures made of reinforced concrete details and
sand filter, using the already treated effluent for irrigation.
*      The project had provided full support to utility enterprises involved in solid waste
collection and disposal by providing special machinery for urban sanitation. Despite the
acute shortage of equipment LSG and service providers strive to maintain and improve
the ecological situation in towns. The project mandate was limited to investing in
material and technical base of service providers, and delivery of institutional support.
*      Problems of irrigation, towns' improvement, rehabilitation and reconstruction of the
landfills remained outside of the project. Up to now, the towns dispose waste irregularly
with periodic re-cultivation, the landfills do not meet sanitary standards, and waste is not
sorted and poses high risks to environmental safety. A comprehensive approach to
addressing sanitary and environmental problems in towns allows considering the
application of existing technologies for waste recycling, incineration, and segregation in
selected towns.
46


﻿An integrated approach to modernization and re-equipment of water distribution
networks requires investments in technology, purposeful introduction of programs to
eliminate losses and leakages in the networks, and accounting of actual water
consumption. Perhaps limiting the number of involved towns enablers to concentrate
investment opportunities for an integrated phased solution of not only infrastructure
problems, but also of issues related to service providers management improvement in
selected small towns.
*      In the area of institutional development it was suggested to help utility enterprises
improving management system, conducting seminars and trainings aimed at enhancing
the capacity of employees. Training is required to orient specialists from quantitative
indicators to quality indicators (achievement of outcomes, efficiency).
*      For subsequent works on implementation of the project components some amendments to
the section "Procurement management" of Operational manual are offered like increasing
the threshold amounts for applying methods of procurement of goods, works and
consulting services, as well as introducing application of direct contracts in exceptional
cases, upon agreement with the World Bank.
*      We consider it necessary to study the possibility to form supervisory boards, with the
participation of NGOs, condominiums, associations for management of municipal
utilities in order to ensure transparency, publicity and efficient use of money.
*      To improve the public utilities performance, it is necessary to reduce accounts payable
through effective management, establish a payment system (billing system) for provided
utility services.
*      Determine owners of utilities and complete the transfer of infrastructure facilities to the
respective organizations. It is necessary to create material, technical and institutional
prerequisites for sustainable development of utility enterprises as well as NGOs involved
in infrastructural problems, in terms of information support.
