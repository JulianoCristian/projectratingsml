2.     STICBP (P083377) was approved by the Board on December 14, 2004. It was
expanded by an ADDITIONAL FINANCING (AF) (P115460) which was approved on
April 2, 2009. The current Closing Date is June 30, 2011. Both operations are financed
through a blend of IDA Credits and IDA Grants.
3.      The Development Objective of STICBP (and STICBP AF) is `to improve the
availability, quality, and efficiency of the delivery of local infrastructure services to
the population of participating towns'. To date, six months before Closing, the
objective has been fully achieved. All works under the investment components of the
project have been completed or will be in the coming months. Total disbursements for
both Credit IDA 40160 and Grant IDA H1390 exceed 98%; while for AF Credit IDA
4556 is about 93% and for AF Grant IDA H4550 is about 9 %.
4.      Project implementation performance has been consistently rated' Satisfactory'
throughout the entire time of implementation. Originally the project was expected to be
completed by the end of 2010, six months ahead of Closing, but due to the political unrest
in the Kyrgyz in Spring and Summer of last year the pace of project implementation was
somewhat slower than anticipated. However, given the nature of activities to be
completed (essentially procurement of goods and consulting services) it can be safely
assumed that, barring any unforeseen political problems, the project will be fully
completed by the Closing Date of June 30, 2011.
5.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to, on one hand, fully use up the
credits/grant investment resources through the procurement of additional solid waste
collection equipment for six project towns, and, on the other hand, ensure the
completeness of final project impact evaluations and carry out audits as well as undertake
preliminary technical studies for the preparation of a follow up operation which is
currently under consideration and would be supported through an Additional Financing to
the ongoing Bishkek & Osh Urban Infrastructure Project (BOUIP).
6.    The proposed Reallocations have been officially requested by the Government of
the Kyrgyz Republic by letter from the Ministry of Finance (`the Recipient') dated
December                                  28,                                  2010
