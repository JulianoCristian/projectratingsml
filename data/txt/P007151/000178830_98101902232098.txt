REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR
FOR A SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
1 .       I submit the following report and recomrmendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$2.5 million and on a proposed development
credit for the equivalent of US$6.0 million to the Republic of El Salvador
to help finance a sites and services project.  lTe loan would have a term
of 30 years, including six years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per
annum. The development credit would be on standard IDA terms. The Govern-
ment would on-lend the loan and the credit to the Fundaci6n Salvadorena de
Desarrollo y Vivienda (FSVM) for a term of 30 years, including six years'
grace, rith interest a-t 8 percent per annum on the loan and 2 percent per
annum on the credit. FSVM's mortgage loans to households wculd be for 25
years at interest of at least 6 percent per annum. Construction ma-terials
loans would be for 15 years at interest of at least 8 percent per anrnumr,
and small industries loans would be for a maximum of five years with interest
of at least 8 and not more than 12 percent per annum,
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum entitled "Economic Memorandum on El Salvador" (No. 41i -Es)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 17, 1974. A country data
sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        As discussed in the economic memorandum, the economy expanded
rapidly in the 1960-67 period but slowed considerably during 1967-72. The
country's principal asset, a group of dy,rnamic entrepreneurs and a labor
force with a demonstrated ability to acquire skills rapidly, enabled the
economjy to expand its production of manufactures for the Central American
Common Market (CACM) and of cotton exports. GDP grew by about 6.5 percent
annually in real terms between 1960 and 1967.   Its human resources along with a
satisfactory transport network and electric power grid gave El 'Salvador's
industry a head start within the CACMo The contribution of manufacturing to
the gross domestic product increased from 14 percent to almost 18 percent during
the sixties. Nevertheless, the economy continued to depend heavily on coffee
and cotton as the major sources of domestic production and export earnings.
In 1967-69, as cotton prices fell and volume was reduced to half its 1965
peak level (because of disease and abandonment of marginal lands), growth
of export earnings fell to only 1-2 percent annually. The conflict with
Honduras in 1969 represented another setback for the economy. Exports to
the Common Market declined as the border with Honduras was shut off, and
expensive alternative arrangements had to be undertaken for shipments to
Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Continued low export growth and the CACM problems
led to sharp declines in domestic saving and private investment, and real
GDP growth averaged only about 4.1 percent annually during 1967-1972, which
is only slightly higher than the annual population growth rate of 3.3 percent.
14.      El Salvador already has one of the highest population densities in the
world, and rapid population growth is a basic obstacle to a more satisfactory
rate and pattern of development. The 1974 population of 3.9 million is expected



- 2 -
to double by 1990 unless the present growth rate can be lowered. Even assuming
a continued large migration to urban centers, the per capita availability
of cultivable land for the rural population would fall further from the pres-
ent 0.3 hectare. Moreover, the resource endowment is meager; known mineral
resources are scant and fishing in the Pacific is limited to the narrow con-
tinental shelf.
5.       At the same time the benefits of economic growth have remained un-
evenly distributed. Estimates for 1965-67 indicate that the top 10 percent
of income recipients received 42 percent of total income! 2 percent of land-
owners hold almost two-thirds of agricultural land; and, at the other end of the
scale, about 90 percent of farms are smaller than 2 hectares. Over half of
the labor potential in the rural sector (which accounts for 60 percent of
the working-age population) remains unemployed for a large part of the year,
while the abundant labor supply has kept agricultural wages at a subsistence
level over a long period. Most rural incomes are below $50 per capita per
annum compared with the national average of $340. Poor education, health,
nutrition and housing conditions further accentuate the difficult situation
in the rural sector and have stimulated migration to urban centers where
living conditions are marginally better. According to FAO, the average per
capita calorie and protein intake is among the lowest in Latin America. The
literacy rate of the adult population is almost oO percent in the cities but
only 40 percent in the rural areas.    It is clear that the long-tern viabil-
ity of the economy will depend on well-designed populatibn policies, a more
equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and better edu-
cation, health, nutritional and living standards for most of the population.
6.       The outlook for progress in tackling the country's main social
and economic problems has improved during the last three years. The Govern-
ment's policies through the sixties were geared almost exclusively to main-
taining price and balance-of-payments stability. The financial stability,
of course, permitted the private sector to take aclvantage of the opportuni-
ties offered by the creation of the Common Market and the cotton boom. But
a low level of tax effort (about 10 percent of GDP) and weak project pre-
paration limited severely the use of long-term foreign financing, and public
investment remained low.  Supported by a large majority in Congress, the
Administration which took office in July 1972 has introduced a number of
reforms and started implementing the 1973-77 National Development Plan. To
strengthen the institutional base necessary to implement the 1973-77 Plan,
the Government in 1973: (1) created the Agricultural Development Bank (whose
main function will be to improve the availability of credit for small farmers)
and a Housing Fund; (2) strengthened the Rural Colonization Institute's capacity
to support the settlement of landless farmers; and (3) placed directly under
the Office of the President the Community Development Organization (FOCCO). The
Government also approved a new forestry law which provides mechanisms to carry
out reforestation and soil conservation programs on public and private lands,
and is expected to approve this year an Export Development Law to promote exports
of non-traditional products to countries outside the CACM. In addition, some
public and private institutions have started to encourage family planning and
to provide advisory services in clinics. Also during 1973, a combination
of higher export prices and improved tax administration resulted in an increase in
Central Government revenues by an unprecedented 23 percent, or more than twice
the rate of growth of GDP. The improved revenue situation faciliated an increase
in capital expenditures, which rose from 2.3 percent to 3.6 percent of GDP
between 1971 and 1973; moreover, the level of capital expenditures achieved



in 1973 was in line with the investment targets of the Developnent Plan.
7.       The medium-term outlook is for an improvement in real economic growth
from a 4.1 percent annual average in 1967-72 to at least 6.5 percent in 1971h-76.
This gain will come mainly from the secotdary effects on the economy of the expect-
ted continuation of relatively strong international prices for the traditional ex-
port crops --coffee,cotton,sugar and nat. Expanding exports of non-traditional
products to markets outside the CACM remaixr acritical issue because or its
dual impcrtance for introducinga new outward-oriented industrial atrateg ynd
as a source of new jobs to alleviate thq serious unemployment problem. In
the longer term, scarcity of land and absence of other natural resources may
limit the growth potential, while prices for the major agricultural exports
Are expected to be somewhat less favorable. Nonetheless, there is scope for
considerable strengthening of the economy by developing industry and non-
traditional agriculture aimed at world markets. The recent rise in fuel prices
is expected to raise the share of petroleum in total imports from four to seven
percent in the coming years. However, as long as export prices remain high,
the pro,)ected resource gap should remain within manageable limits  over the
next two tc 1.hree years.
To achieve the main objectives of the 1973-77 Development Plan of
expanding and diversifying the economy while providing a more even distri-
button of bernefits will require a sharp increase in the level of public expen-
dituros. Central Government investment is expected to increase from 3 percent
of GDP in 196b-72 to about 6- percent in the late seventies. Total public
inveo,e ,iient expenditures are projected to more than double from 196o-72 to
1973-77. Agriculture (including irrigation schemes, marketing, credit pro-
grams and better extension services aimed at small snd mediwn farmers) accounts
for one-fifth of planned public investment expenditures; power, transport and
telecormunic!tions absorb an additional 37 percent of the total.
9.       To finance such 2 orogram, Centrel Government current revenues
would have to rise substantially from current levels. Nhile the measures
mentioned in paragraph 6 above should enable the Government tc achieve program
targets through 19Th, additional revenue measures are expected to be necessary
during the 1975-76 period.  Recognizing this, the Government is considering
the introduct,ion of new tnx measures such nas export duties on cotton and
sugar, on a progressive basis to vary according to the price on the interna-
tional market,, a sales tax that could eventually replace the present stamp tax,
and higher taxes on imported luxury goods.
Extermal financing
10.       The public external debt repayable in foreign currency amounted to
US$194 mi1lion at the end of 1973, Or US$41 million excluding undisbursed
commitments. El Salvador'a traditionally lqw debt-service ratio gives the
rovernment margin for borrowing abroad on conventional terms. Even assum-
ing that a portion of its external bo rrowing is obtained on such terms, the
debt-service ratio would remain below three percent through 1976.  In view,
however, of El Salvador's poverty and low per capita GNP (US$340 in 1972), the
serious imbalance between natural resources and population, and the uncertain
long-term prospects of its main exports, it will be desirable for El Salvador
to obtain part of the external financing required for the 1973-77 Development
Plan on soft terms. For the same reasonp it will be desirable for El Salvador
to obtain financing for some local costs of projects where the foreig exchange
costs are very low.



11.       Apart from the Bank, external financing has been principally pro-
vided by USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). IDB and CABEI funds have
carried ve2y soft terms and contained large components repayable in local
currency. The IDB has made loans for housing, water and sewerage, ports,
highways, agricultural credit, industry, higher education and municipal
markets. VJSAID has financed health centers, basic education, housing and
industry. CABEI has financed industry and also highway and teleconriunica-
tions projects of importance for the Central American network.    The
lending of these agencies from 1950 to the end of 1973 is summarized below:

1/ Includes US$35.1 million for a power loan for which the Borrower has
the option to repay in local or foreign currency.
PART II - BANK MROUP OPERATIONS
12.       El Salvador has to date received twelve Bank loans and two IDA
credits, totalling US$125.3 million net of cancellations.    The last opera-
tion, a loan for a second education project, amounting to US$17.0 million,
was signed on   June 194, 197T.    Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and TFC investments as of September 30, 1974
and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
13.       Bank Group disbursements as a percentage of the gross capital inflow
received by the public sector in El Salvador is expected to peak at about 26
percent in 1)i0 as compared with 24 percent in 1973.    The Bank Group's share
of total debt service is projected to decline slightly during the next two
years and then to rise again to a level of about 27 percent by 1980 -- the
same as that rrevailing in 1973.
1J.       In the past, the Bank Group assisted El Salvador in those areas
where it had special competence or where financing on softer terms from



- 5 -
other deveLopment agencies was unavailable. Thus, the Bank Group financed
infrastrucc-ure investment such as power, roads and telecammunications and,
to a lesser extent, education. Together with IDB and CABEI the Bank assisted
the develoJment of El Salvador's arterial highway system. A close relation-
ship betwemn the Bank and El Salvador's public power agency (CEL) helped the
latter to levelop into one of the most efficient power companies in Central
America. T'he Bank's efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity of the
national telecommunications agency (ANTEL) has facilitated the rapicd expan-
sion of that company's operations in the past three years.
15.       The Bank Group is planning to give increased emphasis in its
lending to El Salvador to high-priority fields in which other internation-
al agencies are not equipped or willing to operate, such as primary and
secondary education and sites and services for very low income housing.
In addition, the Bank Group would help in meeting the growing resource
requirements in power and telecommunications, possibly in joint operations
with other agencies,and in strengthening institutions, particularly ANTEL.
The possibility of Bank assistance to agriculture will be examined after
completion of a sectoral analysis currently in progress as part of
a joint IBRD, IDB, and AID agricultural and rural survey of the five Central
American countries. The Bank is also exploring the possibility of lending
for manufacturing industry and tourism through the Central American Bank
for Economic Integration (CABEI). El Salvador is regarded as marginally quali-
fied to receive some IDA ftlnancing, but tne bulk of Bank Group lending would
be on IBRD terms.
16.       IFC has made two investments in El Salvador.   The first, a $140,000
loan in 1959 to Industrias Textiles, S.A., has been completely repaid. The
second, a $233,000 equity investment and a $600,000 loan to Hoteles de Centro
America, S.A., in 1969, was for a hotel project that was completed in September
1972.
PART III - THE HOUSPIG SECTOR
17.       El Salvador is Central America's smallest and most densely settled
country with more than 176 persons per square kilometer. Although it has
only 4.5 percent of the Central American Common Market area, it contains
23.2 percent of the area's population. Nearly 40 percent of the population
lives in urban areas. Metropolitan San Salvador has 700,000 inhabitants or
18 percent of the country's total population. More than 8 percent live in
the four largest secondary cities: Santa Ana (110,000), San Miguel (90,000),
Sonsonate (60,000) and Usulutan (45,000). An unusually    high natural popula-
tion graoTth rate of 3. 3 percent p.a. together with migration from rural to
urban areas have resulted in annual population growth rates of 6-7 percent
in the capital and 4-5 percent in the secondary cities. If these growth
rates continue, the resulting population pressures will make critical an
already serious low-cost housing shortage, since urban population growth
has far outpaced the construction of low-cost housing and related infra-
structure.



- 6 -
18.       Statistics shoJw that from 1960 to 1970 public and private
housing production in El Salvador averaged only 2,600 units a year,
during which time 10,000 new households were formed annually in urban
areas. In 1971, preliminary national census figures estimated the urban
housing stock at about 270,000 units, nearly two-thirds of which were
in San Salvador and the four secondary cities of Santa Ana, San Miguel,
Sonsonate and Usulutan. At the same time, the urban housing deficit
was estimated at 147,000 units, representing about 55 percent of the
existing stock. About two-thirds of the deficit, or 96,000 units,
related to households earning less than US$100 per month. Although
most homes (90 percent) had electricity, 60 percent lacked individual water
supply and sewerage. The use of low quality materials and poor con-
struction methods have contributed to the rapid physical deterioration
of the housing stock.
19.       Approximately three-quarters of the population of metropoli-
tan San Salvador resides in either squatter invasions typically located
in public rights of way, unauthorized sub-divisions on privately owned
land, or in courtyard tenements (mesones) where densities may reach
1,200 persons/ha. Growth rates in these areas exceed those of the city
as a whole and may have reached 15-20 percent in certain locations.
Most unauthorized sub-divisions are without services because owners are
unable to obtain the necessary development permits required for electrical,
water and sewage connections.
Government and Private Housing Pro grams
20.       The Instituto de Vivienda Urbana (IVU) is an autonomous Govern-
ment agency created in 1951 to serve low-income households. Hlowever,
since tha-t time IVU has produced only 1,000 units per year at prices
(US$3,000-4,000) which 60 pereent of urban households cannot afford. Most
of the units built by IVU in metropolitan San Salvador are stark, four-
story walkups; the rest are single-level row- or semi-detached houses.
A number of IVU's apartments and houses staud empty because they are too
costly for the neediest segments of thie population and physically not
attractive enough for people with higher incomes. Gover.nent's annual
subsidies to IVU have averaged   US$2.0 million annually.  The Govern-
ment, however, has indicated that it intends to eliminate this subsidy
next year.
21e       The Financiera Nacional de la Vivienda (FNV) is an autonomous
Government agency designed to finance and supervise El Salvador's five
savings and loan associations. FNV makes short- and long-term loans to
the associations with home mortgages serving as collateral. In the past,
FAT provided financing for housing ir. the US$10,000 range. In 1973, however,
FNV's management changed its policy to begin catering to lower-income
needs, which has resulted in a marked increase of FNV's operations and a
decrease in the average house value financed to US$7,000.



- 7 -
22.       To provide adequate housing facilities for workers the Government
established in 1973 the National Housing Fund (Fondo Social parala Vivienda),
an autonomous government agency. All idegistered industrial and commercial
employees are by law members of the system but Government and agricultural
employees are not yet included. The two main resources of the Fund are a
025 million subsidy provided by the Government (to be disbursed over five
years) and a 505 percent payroll tax on the wages and salaries of employees
included in the social security system (the employer contributes 5 percent
and the employee o05 percent). The Fundts resources will primarily be
used to build houses for contributing workers. Hawever, the statutes of
the Fondo allows borrowed funds to be used for low-income persons who are
not regularly employed and therefore would not have contributed to the
Fund.
230       The only private organization actively involved in low cost
housing is the Fundacion Salvadorena de Desarrollo y Vivienda Minima (FSVM),
the executing agency of the proposed project. Its activities are described
below; (para. 37).
Urban Development and Planning
24.       Investments presently under way or planned by public agencies
and goveinment departments for the San Salvador metropolitan area are thus
far proceeding in a largely uncoordinated fashion and without reference to
the urban development plan for the city completed by the Government
in 1968 with assistance from USAID. The agencies which play varying,
often overlapping roles in urban planning in San Salvador are (i) the Urban
and Regional Department of the National Planning Council (CONAPLAN); (ii)
the Direccion de Urbanismo y Arquitectura (DUA) of the Ministry of Public
Works (MOP); and (iii) the Transport Department of the MOP. The Municipal
Government has no role in the planning or execution of the city's invest-
ment programs; it concentrates on providing basic city services.
25.       DUA is the government agency which by law has the major responsibi-
lity for controlling and supervising urban works program. It issues zoning
regulations and building permits and is responsible for restraining con-
struction in areas it feels should not be developed. It also performs an
operational role through the construction of storm water drainage systems and
the maintenance of urban roads and streets. The Government is particularly
concerned about proiferating illegal settlements comprised of shacks and sub-
divisions. It has not yet decided, however, on a policy to tackle the problem.
On the one hand it feels that no works should be executed which might encourage
the expansion of these settlements, yet it recognizes that about 50 percent
of San Salvador's inhabitants reside in such settlements and should be pro-
vided with services. The problem is made more difficult by the fact that
little reliable data are available upon which to determine an appropriate
course of action. The project, therefore, includes a study to be under-
taken by CONAPIAN which will focus on urban land-use problems, with special
emphasis on the problem of squatter settlements and illegal sub-divisions.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.      A report entitled  "Appraisal of a Sites and   Services Projecu in
El Salvador" (io. 473a-ES  dated SeptemberD r,1974) is being distributed
separately.  The main featuzres of the loan, the development credit and the
project are summarized in Annex III. The project was prepared by the Fun-
daci6n Salvadoreria de Desarrollo y  Vivienda Minima (FSVM) with occasional
assistance by Bank Group staff, and appraised in November 1973. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington in July 1974. The Republic of El Salvador
was represented by Dr. G. Hidalgo Quehl, Minister of Economy; Lic. A. Guzman
and Lic. R. Coto, National Planning Office; and Dr. 0. Miranda, Financiera
Nacional de la Vivienda. The Fundacion Salvadorenia de Desarrollo y Vivienda
Minima was represented by Arq. A. Harth Deneke, General Manager, and Dr. M.
Santamaria and Lic. F. de Sola, members of the Board.
Objectives
27-       The project is designed to demonstrate that a sites and services
program with partially-built units is a practical, more effective alter-
native to conventional fuilly-built Government housing programs, which! in
El Salvador have been beyond the means of nearly 60 pereent of urban house-
ciolds. While designed with   a view to its replicability throughout the
country,  the project itself will make a contribution to relieving the
severe snortage of low-cost urban shelter by providing about 7,000 units
affordable by families earning between US$40 and US$120 per month. The
fact that a private organization is acting as executing agency and providing
financial resources for the project should demonstrate the potential role
of the private sector in stimulating low-income housing, thereby easing the
burden on Government resources. A further objective of the project is to
encourage the provision of adequate community facilities and effective com-
munity development programs as an integral part of low-cost housing. Finally,
additional employment opportunities will be generated by labor-intensive con-
struction methods and organization of small commercial ventures.
Project Description
28.       The proposed project will provide:
(a) approximately 7,000 lots all of which will have a sanitary unit
and, for about 50 percent, a basic dwelling.   All lots will be
serviced with water, sewerage, storm water drainage, unpaved
streets, and optional electricity;
(b) water distribution and sewer mains and up-grading of access
roads;
(c) financing for a materials fund designed to facilitate self-
help extension of basic dwellings,and provision of a small
pilot loan fund for small in(ustries;
(d) related community facilities (5 health clinics, 10 multipurpose
community centers, 26 sportfields and 12 markets); six basic
schools on project sites are being financed under the BankTs
Second Education Project (Loan 1007-ES);



-9-
(e) technical assistance and training for FSVM staff, an urban land
use and squatter upgrading study and a study on the structure
of mortgage interest rates in El Salvador to be undertaken by
CONAPLAN, as well as project preparation for future sites and
services aand squatter -upgrading projects.
29.       The 7,000 serviced lots would be provided at 9 locations: five in
Metropolitan San Salvador (four sites in Soyapango and one in Apopa), and
one each in Santa Ana, San Miguel, Sonsonate and Usulutan. About 60 percent
of the lots would be located in Metropolitan San Salvador (MSS) where low
cost housing needs are most acute. The individual sites were chosen after
taking into account employment and transport linkages; construction suitabi-
lity with respect to topography, vegetation, soil and ground water conditions;
and availability of adjacent community facilities.
30,       The lots would offer two development options as starting points
for self-help expansion. All lots on each site will have an enclosed sanita-
ry unit containing a W.C., shower, an4 a wash basin (Level 1). One half of
the lots on a given site will also have a basic dwelling of about 17 rnm (Level 2).
This structure will consist of an asbestos cement roof, three walls, wooden
frame doors and windows, and a concrete floor.   The rear wall and interior
partititons will be built by self-help. The units are designed to be earth-
quake resistant, with reinforced concrete columns, bond beams and founda-
tions.  To facilitate extension of individual dwellings after the two
service levels have been constructed, loaps would be made available for the
purchase of materials for self-help extensLons. Loan funds in limited
amounts would also be made available as start-up capital for small business
cooper4tives on project sites.
31.       The availability of community facilities in areas adjacent to prort
sites was examined before including additional facilities in the project.
Each site will have at least one market, multipurpose community center and
sportsfield. The number of clinics was determined on the basis of the ability
of the Yinistry of Health to staff and maintain these facilities. Some
technical assistance for FSVM's staff is included in the project in order
to increase the agency's executing Qapacity in mortgage administration,
accounting, sociology and development of small industrial and commercial
enterprises.
Costs and Financing
32.      The total cost of the project including land acquisition is esti-
mated at US$15.5 million of which US$3.8 million, or 24 percent, represents the
foreign exchange costs. With the proposed credit of US$6.0 million and the loan
of US$2.5 million the Bank Group would finance 55 percent of total project
costs. The balance of the project costs will be borne by the FSVM which
will contribute US$3.8 million or 24 percent, and by the Government and
private power companies, which will contribute US$3.2 million, or 21 Percent.
Dhe Government also has agreed to cover, through grants arid/or loans to FSVM,
cost overruns that may be incurred on the project. Basic costs estimates are

in prices of Play 1974 and include the estimated effect of petroleum price
increases. The justification for some local expenditure financing in El Salvador
is referred to in paragraph 10. A breakdown of costs by major components of
the project would be as follows (in millions of US dollars);

Cost estimates are based on detailed engineering and design for the Soya-
pango site, preliminary design and engineering for the other project sites,
and on FSVM's construction experience in similar projects. Physical contin-
gencies vary between 5-15 percent of total project costs depending on the
stage of design and engineering. Price contingencies total 21 percent of
project costs and are based on an assumed rate of price increase of 20 per-
cent in 1975, declining to 6 percent in 1978. A comparison of development
costs of seven sites and services projects financed by the Bank Group shows
the costs of the proposed project to be among the lowest (see Annex IV).
33.       Government's share of total project costs would be financed through
the regular budgets of the Government agencies -- Ministry of Education,
Ministry of Health, the Community Development Agency (FOCCO), the Ministry
of Public Works (MOP), and the National WIter Authority (ANDA). Elect4ricity
costs would be borne by the Private Power Company of San Salvador (CAESS) as
well as some smaller power companies in the secondary cities. Costs would
be recovered through normal user charges levied by ANDA, the power companies
and the municipalities. The FSVM contribution will come from local bank
borrowing (US$2.0 million) and from its own resources (US$1.o million).
On-lending Arrangements
3h.       The Government would on-lend the IDA credit of US$6.0 million to
FSVM at 2 percent interest over 30 years including 6 years of grace. It
would on-lend the Bank loan of US$2.5 million to FSVM on the same terms as
received from the Bank, i.e., at o percent interest over 30 years including
6 years grace. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk related
to the credit and the loan. FSVM's mortgage terms to households would be at
least 6 percent per annum for 25 years. The 6 percent rate is the same rate
that other housing institutions (the Fondo Social de la Vivienda and IVU)
are charging for homeowners with income levels higher than those served by
FSVM. While this rate is low in relation to the recent rate of inflation
in El Salvador (19 percent in 1973), the historical rate of inflation (1965
through 1972) is less than 1 percent per year, and the Goverrment has tradi-
tionally followed monetary and fiscal policies oriented towards price stability.
35.      During negotiations it was agreed that, if prior to lot alloca-
tion the Fondo Social para la Vivienda and IVU should increase their ex-
isting minimum rate from 6 to 7 percent per annum, FSVM would increase the
rate of interest charged to households by the same amount. If Fondo's and
IVU's rate should exceed 7 percent FSVM will review with the Bank Group the
need for a further increase in FSVM's rate. Construction materials loans
would be amortized over 15 years at at least 8 percent per annum, and small
industries loans over a maximum period of 5 years at an interest rate of not
less than 8 percent and not more than 12 percent per annum. The interest
rate spread available to FSVM as a result of these financial arrangements



- 12  -
should be adequate to cover its technical assistance and training
expenses and possible defaults by homeowners. At the request of the
Government, payments by FSVM of principal and interest on the IDA funds
in excess of the amounts required to service the IDA credit will be credited
to a Special Government fund to be established in the Financiera Nacional
de la Vivienda (FNV). The proceeds of the Special Fund will be used
exclusively for the purpose of financing sites and services projects for
low income families.
Implementation Agencies
36.      The Executing Agency will be FSVM, which will be responsible for,
inter-alia, lot design, engineering, construction supervision, and the ad-
ministration of materials loans. Community facilities will be the respon-
sibility of the various Government agencies who will also prepare detailed
designs.  Schools will be constructed by the Ministry of Education's
Direccion de Arquitectura Educativa (DAE).   The Ministry of Health will be
responsiule f'or health clinics; FOCCO (the government community develop-
ment agency) for multipurpose comrnunity centers, markets and sportsfields;
and ANDA for all water and sewerage infrastructure including house connec-
tions.  Street lighting and individual electrical connections will be built
by CAESS and the other private power distribu-tion companies.
37.      To facilitate project execution, the Directorate of the National
Planning Council (CONAPLAN) has established a Project Coordinating Committee
composed of its own senior officials and representatives from the Ministry
of PLblic liorks. ANDA,FSVM and Financiera Nacional de la Vivienda (FNV).
Quarterly progress reports would be prepared by F'SVM and made available to
the Committee and the Bank Group.
38.      FSVM is a private, non-profit entity established in 1970 to improve
the living conditions of low-income people, especially those living in
squatter settlements.   Its aim is to provide shelter to households whose in-
comes are so low as to exclude them f'rom regular Government and private
sector housing projects.   FSVM's means of achieving this objective is through
self-help sites and services projects and related programs. It is a small
well-managed organization eqith a competent technical staff. To date it
has completed about 1,020 fully serviced lots with core houses primarily
in San Salvador costing an average of US$800 per unit. In order to execute
the proposed project, FSVM will need, however, to expand its staf'f. The
agency is administratively sound, and with the technical assistance provided
under the project, execution should proceed smoothly. Tne organization is
presently structur-d around three  divisions,  Technical, Social and Adminis-
trative. A fourth division would be established to handle mortgages, in-
cluding collection and legal matters which are currently handled by the
Accounting   Section of the Administrative  Division.   The Accounting Section
would retain responsibility for all other financial matters, including the
internal audit.

Project Beneficiaries and Terms of Participation
39.      Selection of lot beneficiaries would take place in the following
manner: the Social Department of FSVM will screen and evaluate applications,
excluding those with monthly household incomes exceeding US$120. At least
50 percent of lots will be reserved for households with monthly incomes of
less than US$70. Final selection of households will be made by lottery and
ratified by the FSVM Selection Committee. The allottee will be required to
sign his mortgage within four months of notification or his lot will be
re-allocated. Households will be required to make a down payment of 5 per-
cent of the sales price of the lot either in cash or through mutual help
labor credits which generally amount to 5 percent of the lot development
costs. FSVM has had considerable success in organizing project participants
into "mutual help" construction teams of 15-30 persons who assist in trench-
digging, pipe-laying, and construction of core units. The teams are trained
by a FSVM technical foreman and a social worker. Participants are paid
through labor credits registered with FSVM which are later applied toward
their lot development. Failure to make the required down payment within four
months after sigling the mortgage or toinitiate development within 24 months
will constitute abandonment, and result in reallocation of the lot. (Section
- of Schedule 2 to the Project Agreement.)
40O      Total montlJy mortgage payments by participant households for a
unit developed to the basic dwelling stage would range from /26.20 to
¢35.60 Assuming that low-income households should devote no more than
25 percent of their monthly incomes to housing and utilities payments,
families earning between US$40 and US$60 pnr month could, therefore, meet
the monthly payments. The serviced lots, therefore, would be affordable
by households as low as the 17th percentile on the urban income distribu-
tion curve.
41.      Loans of up to US$212 each would be made available, from the pro-
posed construction materials fund, to the 3,500 households which only have
a sanitary unit, to enable them to build the basic dwelling provided to
the other households under Level 2. In addition, all households with a
basic dwelling will be eligible to receive loans of up to US$344 to parti-
t'c;i and extend their basic dwellings to a structure of 25-30 m? (Section II
oL' Schedule 2 to the Project Agreement.)
42.       Households would pay ¢3.00 for water based on the current tariff
schedule. They would be required to pay a municipal tax based on lot size
but participants would be exempt from national property taxes since their
assets fall below the minimum of 025,000. Households would pay CAESS about
01.60 monthly for electricity.



Small Industries Loan
43.       Loan funds in limited amounts would be made available to small-scale
commercial enterprises in project sites to provide start-up finance, the lack
of which has Droven a major constraint to the growth of such enterprises. The
Fund is small (G.3 percent of total project costs) and will draw upon FSVM's
experience in it.s ongoing program of assistance to small business cooperatives.
The fund is intended to demonstrate the viability of small-scale cooperative
ventures with a view toward encouraging local financial institutions to make
credit available for such ventures (Section III of Schedule 2 to the Project
Agreement.)
Procurement and Disbursement
44.      The project would be carried out in three phases over four years
with expected completion in mid-1970.   FSVM would be responsible for pro-
curement of all on-site works except community facilities.    Off-site infra-
structure and community facilities would be contracted by the responsible
Ministries or Government agencies and by the private power companies.
Contracts would be tendered by FSVM according to the three phases with se-
parate contracts for each site. In order to facilitate participation by
small contractors in El Salvador, contracts will be split according to
on-site infrastructure and core unit development. Large contractors will
be able to bid for one or all of the contracts to be let in a given phase.
Prequalification will take place to assess the capability of firms con-
strulcting this type of project in Central America. Contracts for civil
works estimated to cost US$50,o00 or less but not in the aggregate exceeding
$45L,000, and contracts for construction materials estimated to cost $20,000
or less but not in the aggre,ate exceeding $200,000 may be procured in accord-
ance with FSWI's regular procurement procedures.   Contracts for all other
ci-il wcrks and ccnstruction materials would be awarded under international
competitive biddinrg in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.   However, El
Salvador has a competititve local construction industry and foreign contractors
are unlikely -to participate particularly because of the small size of the
contracts involved.   Invitations for civil works and construction materials
bids. would, therefore, only be advertised locally, but emnbassies woula be
notified so that foreign bidders could participate if they wished.    In
accordance with the Central American Agreement, suppliers from Central
American Common Market (CACM) countries would receive a margin of preler-
ence of 15 percent of the c.i.f. base price or 50 percent of the tariff
payable by non-CACM manufacturers, whichever is lower.
45.      Small portions of on-site civil works and community facilities
would be executed through mutual help, which the FSVM has successfully
utilized on previous projects. However, in order to maintain the con-
struction schedule, it may become necessary to employ contractors on all
aspects. Progress will be reviewed during supervision missions and the
need for contract labor assessed in consultation between the FSVM, Govern-
ment and the Bank Group.



- 15 -
46.      The credit would be disbursed in six years to mebt 100 percent
of the costs of on-site infrastructure and core unit development ( excluding
electrical installations), and technical assistance and training for FSVM
as well as 20 percent of construction materials. An amount of US$300,000
would be disbursed retroactively for expenditures incurred after January
1, 1974 to cover earthmoving and civil works on the Soyapango I and Santa
Ana sub-projects. The disbursement schedule for the proposed loan and
crectit is andLcated in Annex III.
Project Benefits
7.        It is difficult to quantify, accurately, the net economic benefits
which would result from the project and therefore to calculate a conventional
economic rate of return. The economic justification for the project rests
primarily on the fact that the houses which would be built under the project
would generate imputed rental values in excess of the cost incurred. The
costs include land, construction costs (labor and materials) for civil works
and core units, and project management and technical assistance for the staff
of FSVM. All on-site infrastructure costs are included. Off-site infra-
structure costs were excluded because the benefits accruing from this com-
ponent will serve many more households than the 7,000 in the project. The
self-help labor involved in the extension of basic dwellings after project
completion was "shadow-priced" at zero. On this basis, the internal rate
of return for the project averages about 20 percent.
ho.       In addition to the net benefits deriving from imputed rentals,
other benefits flowing directly to participating households include in-
creased employment opportunities brought about by improved public services
and, in some cases, economies in transport costs to and from places of employ-
ment because of locational advantages. Moreover, the project will have a
substantial redistribution effect in providing low-cost, serviced shelter
units to low-income households who are currently paying excessive prices for
unserviced subdivisions of land. In addition, there are net external economies
in that planned housing/community development projects will enable the Govern-
ment authorities to reduce uncontrolled urban growth, and the study component
in particular will help Government's urban planning functions. People other
than project participants will benefit from the off-site infrastructure, and
the self-help/mutual-help training will improve the chances of urban poor in
finding stable employment. In general, there will be an increase in the
quality of life for project households.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
L9.       The draft Loan Agreement and the draft Development Credit Agreement
between the Republic of El Salvador and, respectively, the Bank and the
Association; the draft Project Agreement between the Bank, the Association
and the Fundacion Salvadore?ia de Desarrollo y Vivienda Minima; the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, respectively; and the text of two resolutions,
respectively, approving the proposed loan and the proposed development credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan



Agreement, the draft Development Credit Agreement and the draft Project
Agreement generally conform to the normal pattern of loans and credits
for sites and services projects. Special features of the draft agree-
ments are noted in paragraphs 38, 40 and 42.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Associa-
tion.
PART VI - REOUMMENrATIONS
51.       I recommend that the Executive DirectorB approve the proposed
loan and development credit.

After some initial delays in procuremnent of project goods,
procurement has now been virtually completed. The project
is expected to be completed before t,he end of 1974.
Iin. 81     Second Teleconnunications Project: Us$9.5 millioln of

After some initial delays in procurement of project gooda
which might delay final completion of the project by 6 to
12 months, substantial progreos is now being made and
significant benefits will begin to be realized in early
1975 with the comrissioning of h,000 local automatic ex-
change lines. All long dista.nce equipment 8hould be in-
stalled by November 1975. The project is expected to be
con7p16ted between J'un  and Dcambor of 1976.
Ln. 889     Sixth Power Prc ect:  US 7.3 million sof pril 12,
1973. Closing ate     AplL301 1978.
Initial progress in construction of the two principal
works, the Ahuachapan geothermal plant and the Cerr6n
Grande hydroelectric facility, has been satisfactory.
However, difficulties in completion of the canal for
geothermal. effluent from the Ahuachapan plant may de-
lay its initial operation by six months and increase
its cost. Because of the effluent canal difficulties
and higher-than-expected construction costs of Cerr6n
Grande, the project is now estimated to cost about
8 percent more than its appraisal estimate of US$97.7
million. The Borrower?s request for approval of com-
mercial borrowing to cover the cost overrun is being
reviewed within the Bank. The Government-appointed
Relocation Commission has begun to determine policy
concerning relocation and employment of the popuLa-
tion affected by the Cerr6n Grande reservoir.

PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS:   The project would be carried out in three phases
over four years with expected completion in mid-
1978. FSVM would be responsible for procurement
of all on-site wurks except community facilities.
Off-site infrastructure and community facilities
would be contracted by the responsible Ministries
or Government agencies and by the private power
companies. Contracts would be tendered by FSVM
according to the three phases with separa-te contracts
for each site.  In order to facilitate participa-
tion by small contractors in El Salvador, contracts
will be split accorcling to on-site infrastructure
and superstructure development.  Large contractors
will be able to bid for onie or all of the contracts
to be let in a given phase. Prequalification will
take place to assess the capability of firms con-
structing this type of project in Central America.
Contracts for civil works estimated to cost US$50,000
or less but not in -the aggregate exceeding $450,000,
and contracts for construction materials estimated to
cost $20,000 or less but not in the aggregate exceed-
ing $200,000 would be procured in accordance with
FSVM's regular procurement procedures.  Contracts
for all other civil works and construction materials
would be awarded under international comopetitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
However, El Salvador has a competitive  local con-
struction industry and foreign contractors are un-
likely to participate particularly because of the
small size of the contracts involv-ed.  Invitations
for civil works and construction materials bids
would, therefore, only be advertised locally, but
embassies would be notified so that foreign bidders
could participate if they wished.  In accordance with-
the Central American Agreement, suppliers from Central
American Common Market (CACM) countries would receive
a margin of preference of 15 percent of the c.i.f.
base price or 50 percent of the tariff payable by non-
CACM manufacturers, whichever is lower.  An amount
of US$300,000 would be disbursed retroactively for
expenditures incurred after January 1, 1974 to cover
earthmoving and civil works on the Soyapango I and
Santa Ana sub-projects.
