{"cdata!": "The First Feeder Road Project, which is\n            designed to help establish an efficient institutional\n            framework for planning, executing and maintaining feeder\n            roads in support of agricultural development would include:\n            (a) a four-year program for the construction and improvement\n            of about 1,000 km of feeder roads; (b) technical assistance\n            to establish a Feeder Roads Unit within the Department of\n            Rural Works to implement the above program and train local\n            staff (87 man-months); and (c) a study of a follow-up feeder\n            road program (4 man-months). Some of the quantifiable\n            benefits expected to result from the road improvements are\n            reduced vehicle operating costs, reduced produce spoilage\n            and induced increases in agricultural production.\n            Institution building represents a major, if unquantifiable\n            benefit. About one-third of the benefits from increased cash\n            crop production are expected to accrue to farmers and the\n            Government while most benefits resulting from increased\n            foodcrop production will go to farmers. Benefits from\n            reduction in transport costs are expected to be shared by\n            transporters, traders and the local communities."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
