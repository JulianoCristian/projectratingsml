CURRENCY AND EQUIVALENT UNITS
Currency Unit = Cedi (¢)
In September 1986, the Government introduced a second-tier foreign exchange
auction system, and in February 1987 the official and auction rates were
unified at Cedis 150 per US dollar. Since then, the auction has proceeded
smoothly and the exchange rate has depreciated further to Cedis 235 per US
dollar (February 3, 1989). Initially, the auction was limited to producer
goods, but its coverage has expanded steadily, and by February 1988 all
imported goods were eligible for funds from the auction. A rate of US$1 =
0250 has been used for project analysis.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOHMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A PRIVATE SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 22.3 million (US$30
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit to help
finance a private small and medium enterprise development project would be
on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity.
2.        Background.  Manufacturing GDP in Ghana nearly tripled in real
terms between 1960 and 1970, partly due to government policies that
encouraged import substitution industries behind a wall of protection;
value added grew by 131 per annum on average; and employment doubled during
the same period. Real output remained stagnant between 1970 and 1977.
except for a decline between 1973 and 1974, and then declined sharply
between 1977 and 1980. Production and capacity utilization fell further
during the late 1970s and early 19809. The poor performance was to a large
extent attributable to distorted incentives and the overall decline in
economic activity. This trend continued until after the introduction of
the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1983. Major actions taken to
rationalize the incentive system have included: (a) introduction of
market-determined exchange rate; (b) abolition of import licensing; (c)
removal of price controls except for a limited number of commodities; (d)
rationalization of the tariff system and sales and excise taxes; (e)
removal of ceilings on interest rates; (f) simplification of some export
procedures; and (g) increased flexibility in the use of exporters'
retention accounts. The Government has also taken steps to reverse the
negative effects of its past actions on the business environment and to
establish a more positive political climate for private entrepreneurs to
respond positively to improved incentives. Recently a major reform of the
financial sector has been launched. Its main objectives are enhanced
soundness of banking institutions, improved deposit mobilization and
increased efficiency in credit allocation, and the development of money and
securities markets.
3.        The above and other reforms supported by the Industrial Sector
Adjustment Credit, Structural Adjustment Credit I and the Financial Sector
Adjustment Project have set the stage for the development of a more
internationally competitive industrial sector with closer links to domestic
resources. The second Structural Adjustment Credit will continue to
support ongoing reforms and key sectoral strategies, including industry,
and specific actions for private sector development, as well as a program
of action to mitigate the social costs of adjustment. The industrial
sector is responding to the changes in relative prices, which emphasize the
growth of local resource-based industries for exports and efficient import
substitution. Significant increases in capacity utilization have occurred,
especially in agro-based industries, wood processing, tobacco, beverages,
chemicals, and non-metallic mineral subsectors. Manufacturing registered
estimated growth rates of 11? in 1984, 252 in 1985, 102 in 1986 and perhaps
5Z in 1987. Notwithstanding this slackening of the average growth for the



- 2 -
sector as a whole, some industries have continued to erjoy strong
expansion. Meanwhile, excessively import dependent and inefficient firms
may be faced with restructuring/rehabilitating or winding up their
operations. To facilitate the adjustment process, there is now a need to
identify and assist entrepreneurs in such industries, and to provide
investment resources for rehabilitation, working capital and expansion of
existing enterprises which are potentially viable in the new environment.
In this context the Government has attached priority to the development of
small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in the private productive sectors
as potential sources of increased broad-based investment and a sustained
supply response consistent with Ghana's resource endowments. The Bank
Group has to date made three loans/credits for industrial finance; the
first two were satisfactorily completed, and the most recent credit is
under implementation. Industry has also benefitted from other multi-sector
credits. Lessons learned from these operations have been taken into
account in designing the proposed project.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  To sustain the recent reforms,
there is a need to combine the ongoing adjustment process with growth
promoting programs to facilitate a supply response and generate efficient
employment in the Frivate productive sectors. The proposed Project is an
integral part of IDA's lending strategy for Ghana which, inter alia, calls
for industrial growth in line with Ghana's long run comparative advantage,
financial sector reforms to improve efficiency, alleviation of unemployment
and poverty and strengthening of institutional capabilities. SMEs
generally create employment at low investment costs with quick paybacks,
promote regional seed-beds for developmert of entrepreneurial talent and
industrial capabilities, and have the potential to establish productive
linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and larger industrial
enterprises. They also offer exceptional opportunity for developing the
potential of women entrepreneurs in productive activities. But the limited
availability of term resources and equity financing, insufficient working
capital, severe credit restraints as well as weaknesses in the
institutional support system constrain the development of SMEs. There are
market imperfections which also discriminate against SMEs including poor
access to information, inadequate collateral and high transaction costs. A
comprehensive program of assistance to SMEs is, therefore, important to
support growth and employment generation in tandem with the ongoing
economic reforms. The proposed project would address these constraints,
complement policy reforms and provide credit and technical support for the
overall development of SMEs in the private sector.
5.        ProJect ObJectives.  The main project objectives are to:  (a)
expand production and employment in private productive activities in all
sectors except agriculture, trading and real estate by supporting
financially and economically viable new or expansion projects, as well as
restructuring viable existing enterprises, and service activities; (b)
develop an efficient apex institution capable of promoting within the
banking system term lending to SMEs and microenterprises through training
and ongoing supervision; (c) strengthen the capability of private and
public commercial, merchant and development banks to provide long-term
credit to SMEs, including women entrepreneurs and enterprises in the rural
areas; (d) provide SMEs with an alternative, flexible source of long-term
financing for equipment and machinery through equipment leasing; (e)
support a program of assistance for microenterprises; (f) improve the



availability of technical assistance and training to smaller enterprises
and women entrepreneurs to help them prepare projects for financing under
this project and develop better local self-help capacity to enhance longer
term entrepreneurial growth; and, (g) improve the policy and institutional
support framework for private sector SME development.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project includes:  (a) a line
of credit component (U.S$25 million) to finance, through the banking system,
the fixed asset and working capital needs of existing and new private
sector SMEs. Under the project, SMEs eligible for financing would be those
with total assets (excluding land) plus investment under the project not
exceeding US$2.0 million equivalent. To benefit a reasonable number of
small scale and microenterprises, US$2 million out of the total line of
credit would be earmarked for financing enterprises with assets below
US$100,000; (b) an equipment lease financing component (US$2.5 million) to
provide an alternative and flexible source of long-term financing to SMEs;
(c) a pilot mutualist credit guarantee scheme to be developed for
microenterprises to provide them access to institutional credit through
collaboration with selected NGOs; (d) technical assistance for the BOG
(US$0.7 million) tot establish the apex facility (FUSMED), provide expert
assistance to build FUSMED's technical and institutional capabilities for
administering the credit components, assist in training PFIs in project
analysis and term financing, and develop the mutualist credit guarantee
scheme; (e) technical assistance for SMEs, GOs and NGOs (US$1.3 million)
for (i) establishing a pilot Studies Fund for sharing the cost of
feasibility studies; (ii) setting up pilot small business advisory centers,
a business growth center, and incubators; (iii) strengthening the NBSSI
through training, assisting it to carry on the Entrepreneurship Development
Program, improving its operational capabilities with the support of a
small-scale industry expert to assist SSEs more effectively; (iv) training
and support for NGO assisting women entrepreneurs and for training
institutions; and (v) studies on the equipment leasing industry, technology
development, the potential for free trade zones for export promotion and
the regulatory and incentive environment for private sector and SSE
development.
7.        The project is estimated to .ost US$57.4 million equivalent with
a foreign exchange component of US$35.3 million (61Z). Cofinancing of
US$6.3 million is being sought under the project for both the credit and
technical assistance components. On the basis of contacts made, it is
expected that the target amount for cofinancing should be achieved. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7440-GH dated March 6, 1989, is also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions:  The Government has agreed on the following:  (a)
onlending arrangements for the SME credit components; eligibility criteria
for PFIs, beneficiary enterprises and subprojects; onlending terms and
conditions; and subloan processing procedures; (b) establishment of the
pilot Studies Fund by September 30, 1989, and the formulation of
implementation procedures for the pilot mutualist credit guarantee scheme
by December 31, 1989; and (c) implementation schedules and arrangements for



-  4  -
technical assistance and training activities and studies to be financed
under the project. The SME apex facility (FUSKED) has been established by
the BOG to administer and manage the project. The BOG is recruiting
banking/SME credit advisors to build FUSMED's technical and institutional
capabilities, and assist in the administration and operation of the credit
components. Also, the Government has established the SME Policy Committee
and Secretariat to oversee project implementation and ensure effective
coordination. Conditions of credit effectiveness are: (i) signing of the
Subsidiary Administration Agreement between the Government and BOG for
channeling the IDA Credit with satisfactory terms and conditions; (ii)
preparation of acceptable statements of FUSMED's operational policies and
procedures; (iii) issuance by the BOG of an acceptable circular to the
banking system outlining the conditions and procedures for the utilization
of funds under the credit components; and (iv) signing of acceptable
participation agreements between BOG and at least two PFIs for the credit
components. Specific conditions of disbursement are: (i) appointment of a
technical advisor to assist NZSSI in the implementation of its technical
assistance components; (ii) preparation of satisfactory implementation
procedures for the mutualist credit guarantee scheme; and (iii) issuance by
BOG of a satisfactory circular to the banking system outlining the terms,
conditions and procedures for use of the pilot Studies Fund.
9.        Benefits.  The Project would provide important support to the
Government's efforts in stimulating productive activity in the private
sector and generating a sustained supply response by assisting SMEs through
an integrated package of institutional and financial measures. The Project
would also help sustain growth and generate employment and thus partially
alleviate the severe unemployment problem in Ghana. The project would
improve the quality and range of financial services available to the SME
sector through strengthening the capability of the BOG as well as the
banking system to provide long-term credit and equipment lease financing to
SMEs, and the pilot mutualist credit guarantee scheme for microenterprises.
It would also help develop of an appropriate policy and regulatory
framework for the equipment leasing industry in Ghana. Small scale
entrepreneurs would receive assistance from the pilot Studies Fund for
obtaining consultancy services of their choice for feasibility studies,
thus making the provision of technical assistance demand driven as well as
help develop tt. local consulting industry.  The provision of technical
assistance and training for BOG, PFIs, NBSSI and other GOs and NGOs would
enhance their capacity to develop and implement more effectively support
programs for SMEs and women entrepreneurs.
10.       Risks.  The possible reluctance of the banking system to engage
in term financing for SMEs is a major risk of the credit. Term financing
is perceived generally as more risky than traditional commercial financing,
and this could result in a slow disbursement of the loan. This risk has
been minimized as the PFIs will be free to determine the final onlending
rates to beneficiary SMEs. The PFI's ability to contribute to subproject
costs from their own resources could be affected by credit ceiling
constraints. Their expected contribution has, however, been kept to the
minimum necessary to ensure their commitment. The effectiveness of the new
apex facility in channeling credits to the banking system particularly in
rural areas is another possible risk. This would be minimized by the
provision of appropriate expertise and training. The high interest rates
in Ghana may also dampen investment demand. The conservative demand



- 5 -
estimates on which the overall size of the credit components are based, in
part mitigates this risk. The participation of the entire banking system
with extensive branch networks would extend the outreach of the project in
all parts of the country, and the pilot Studies Fund, which would also help
generate a significant pipeline of bankable SME subprojects, would further
mitigate this risk. There is also the risk of Government bureaucracy
slowing down project implementation, particularly in view of the multi-
component nature of the Project. To mitigate this risk, the Project telies
largely on the banking system which is generally more efficient than
Government departments or agencies and which is being improved through the
Financial Sector Adjustment Project.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
