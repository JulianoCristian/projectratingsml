The SME\n            Project was designed to: (a) assist in financing private\n            productive activities, facilities and resources to enable\n            enterprises to contribute to the economic and social\n            development of the country; (b) revive production and\n            improve the economic viability of private SMEs and enable\n            them to become more competitive; (c) develop an effective\n            mechanism to foster participation of banks to provide\n            long-term financing to SMEs; (d) support a program of\n            assistance to micro-enterprises (ME); (e) improve the\n            availability of technical assistance , extension services\n            and entrepreneurial training for small-scale enterprises\n            (SSE) and women entrepreneurs; and (f) improve the policy\n            and. institutional support framework for SME development.\n            The Project had four key components to support these\n            objectives: (a) a line of credit, (b) equipment leasing, (c)\n            pilot mutualist credit guarantee scheme for MEs, and (d) TA\n            to build up the capacity of an apex organization and provide\n            a range of business advisory services to SMEs and women\n            entrepreneurs. The objectives of the project were partially\n            achieved. The Bank performance was satisfactory especially\n            in terms of supervision. Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons are: (i) financial\n            intermediary loans should focus heavily on developing the\n            capacity to mobilize long term funds domestically; (ii)\n            accrediting PFIs should be carried out by technically\n            trained staff at the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) at\n            appraisal and periodically re-examined throughout project\n            implementations o that PFIs are strengthened rather than\n            undermined by their participation; (iii) apex arrangements\n            with narrow administrative functions and located within\n            central banks or government entities are best in\n            environments with sufficiently large numbers of both\n            institutionally strong participating financial institutions\n            and expected sub-borrowers that are good credit risks; (iv)\n            microenterprises require different financial products and\n            delivery mechanisms compared to the traditional lines of\n            credit targeted for small- and medium scale enterprises; The\n            availability of equity funds may have more far reaching\n            effects on the development and growth of SMEs than credit\n            for undeveloped SMEs; and (v) the development of affordable,\n            effective, efficient, and sustainable capacity building\n            services to SMEs should remain a priority to realize\n            private-sector led growth in the real sector."}, "docdt": "1997-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
