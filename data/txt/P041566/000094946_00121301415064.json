Fund Project will\n            support capacity building for poor communities, to\n            effectively manage their development resources, and,\n            economic, and social services, based on the following\n            project components. 1) Communities, in particular vulnerable\n            groups, will have improved access to basic social services,\n            and infrastructure, through sustainable processes. From the\n            demand perspective, the component will support subprojects\n            aiming at developing structures that improve access to basic\n            social services by the community, such as a micro-project\n            promoting the use of technology to preserve milk, enabling\n            its transportation for market sale. On the supply side, the\n            aim is to attract social services providers, such as funding\n            a micro-project for the promotion of a youth-run\n            Information/Education/Communication campaign. The objectives\n            will be phased by setting institutional arrangements,\n            monitoring and evaluation, and scaling up implementation\n            through communal participatory poverty assessments. 2) The\n            micro-finance component will extend financial services\n            focusing on social intermediation, facilitating the creation\n            of savings and credit associations. 3) The capacity building\n            component will organize the most vulnerable groups, through\n            an institutional development phase to set up their\n            operational capacity, financial, and project management\n            abilities. 4) A baseline data and information system will be\n            developed to trace poverty alleviation programs for\n            executing agencies, social fund Boards, Ministries, and\n            donors, and, institutional systems will be created for\n            integration of social funds, within community-based mechanisms."}, "docdt": "2000-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
