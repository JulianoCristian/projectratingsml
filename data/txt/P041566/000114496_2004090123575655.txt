shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of SDR 3,000,000. 
2.

such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)    (i)
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Association requests for 
deposits into the 
Special Account at such intervals as the Association shall specify.

Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Association the documents 
and other evidence 
required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in 
respect 
of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each
