Development Fund\n            (SDF) Project for Senegal were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory; and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the use of an effective project management structure for\n            piloting innovative approaches. In this case, the\n            semi-autonomous structure of the SDF agency balanced with\n            its placement in the social development ministry and\n            overseen by a multi-sectoral Board allowed for the\n            establishment of a high caliber team and integration with\n            broader poverty reduction and sectoral policies. This\n            ability to adapt was critical in developing more cost\n            effective capacity building strategies and in capturing\n            opportunities in the poverty monitoring component, like\n            funding Senegal's development gateway. Building on the\n            strengths of civic engagement and civil society to overcome\n            capacity constraints on the public sector side in reaching\n            the poorest communities and in developing ownership and\n            self-help spirit that drove positive outcomes at the\n            community level.
