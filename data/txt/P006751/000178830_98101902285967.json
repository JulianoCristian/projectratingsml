and to strengthen the\n            Government's nutrition program. Within project areas, a\n            community based health service system would be established\n            and nutrition education would be provided for 1.8 million\n            people mostly among the poorest 30% of the population.\n            Potable water supply systems and latrines would be installed\n            for a portion of beneficiaries, while 20,000 families would\n            receive technical and material assistance for home garden\n            production of nutritious foods. At the national level, the\n            project would develop new food technology, improve quality\n            control of processed foods, strengthen project management\n            and monitor and evaluate the overall program. The project\n            would result in increased work and schooling efficiency,\n            reduced infant mortality, increased vegetable production and\n            improved efficiency in the processing and preservation of food."}, "docdt": "1977-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
