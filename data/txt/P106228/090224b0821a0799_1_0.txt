                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the outcomes of the October 28, 2013 implementation support mission which sought to propose concrete actions to accelerate implementation progress in view of
                         the closing date of January 7, 2014, and to start preparation for the Implementation Completion and Results Report. The overall progress towards the development objectives related
                         to promoting nutrition interventions (Growth Monitoring and Promotion sessions and exclusive breast feeding for children under 6 months) and increasing utilization of key
                         micronutrients, e.g., Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets for pregnant women and Vitamin A capsule for children aged 6-59 months is satisfactory. The Monthly CBN monitoring data
                         collected by Health Extensions Workers (HEWs) suggests that the overall under-two children Growth Monitoring and Promotion (GMP) participation rates are 46%, exceeding the
                         target of 40%. However, there are regional variations with Oromia, Amhara and Tigray, reporting coverage ranging from 20% to 50%, while the SNNPR reaching almost 80%. Most

                         recent national data show 52% of infants 0-5 months are exclusively breastfed, 41% of pregnant women received IFA tablets, and 94% of under-5 children received two doses of
                         vitamin A capsules. All Intermediate Results indicators showed satisfactory progress towards the planned targets, including: percent of salt iodized at the production site (95%);
                         number of health staff who received Masters of Science (MSc) in nutrition degrees (30); percent of CBN woredas providing monthly GMP data to the Federal level (87.6%);

                         Since the last mission, disbursement of the IDA grant has increased from 60 to 81 percent. One major remaining component of disbursement is the outstanding procurement of IFA
                         tablets (US$3.3 million). An extension of the project closing date has been requested to accommodate this outstanding procurement.

                         The JSDF grant, piloting Community based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) (TF 93946) implemented by Concern Worldwide, is scheduled to close on January 7, 2014.
                         The implementation has improved significantly in the last six months, with a strong focus on community level innovative approaches with potential to be scaled up across the health
                         system. The average Therapeutic Feeding Program score for all health facilities covered by the project increased from 58% in 2010 to 74% in 2013. The Infant and Young Child
                         Feeding (IYCF) training was provided to Health Workers (HWs), Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and Health Development Armies (HDAs). Enhanced IYCF-CMAM trainersâ€™ guides
                         and job aids were developed. A Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) storage assessment was finalized and RUTF cabinets were distributed to 90 health posts and additional 89
                         cabinets are being manufactured and will be distributed by end of the year. Concern Worldwide had obtained an approval for a no cost extension until 7 January 2014 (current closing
                         date) to finalize and disseminate an operational research report, after delays in release by the Tigray Regional Health Bureau. Two operational research studies on the project were
                         completed by five national universities and will be ready for dissemination. The evaluation of the JSDF project is underway with the draft report likely to be completed by mid-
                         December 2013.
