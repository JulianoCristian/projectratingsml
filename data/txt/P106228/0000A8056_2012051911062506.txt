                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards the achievement of the project development objective remains satisfactory. Since the last ISR in March 2012, further progress has been made in Community Based
                         Nutrition with the Health Extension Program Integrated Refresher Training on Module II, which includes nutrition, being close to completion. Plans are also in place to carry out a
                         baseline survey of the new 115 woredas to be rolled out this year. EHNRI is continuing to make good progress in carrying out project-related surveys and operational research, with a
                         dissemination workshop for the food consumption survey report expected to take place in the middle of 2012. Regarding procurement, motorbikes to the value of USD $3 million have
                         been procured in order to improve the supervision capability of Health Extension Worker (HEW) supervisors, and procurement of bicycles for HEWs and vehicles to improve service
                         delivery and supervision is underway.

                         Furthermore, a level two project restructuring has taken place, which was approved by the Country Director on April 11, 2012. The restructuring was done to change one PDO
                         indicator, update the baseline values of PDO indicators using more recent nationally representative data and change the endline targets accordingly, and revise intermediate results
                         indicators to ensure they are logically linked to the PDO and can be monitored more frequently (every 6 or 12 months). Overall these changes will enable more rigorous monitoring of
