                         HEWs in the project area covering 238 woredas in Oromia, Amhara, SNNPR and Tigrey received this training. Also, the FMOH has initiated a baseline survey in 115 woredas where
                         the CBN activities will be rolled out and this survey is expected to be completed by December 31, 2012. Five Operational Research (OR) studies are in progress through an academic
