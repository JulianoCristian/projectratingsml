This restructuring paper seeks the\n            approval of the Country Director to introduce changes to the\n            Project. The current results framework of the Project is\n            inadequate to monitor progress towards achievement of the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO). The changes are as\n            follows: (a) changing one of the PDO indicators; (b)\n            updating baseline and end line values of PDO indicators; and\n            (c) revising intermediate results indicators to ensure they\n            are technically sound, follow a logical sequence, and use\n            available data sources to allow more frequent monitoring of progress."}, "docdt": "2012-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
