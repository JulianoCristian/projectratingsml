                            RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1. This restructuring paper seeks the approval of the Country Director to introduce
   changes to the Ethiopia Nutrition Project (H0376-ET). The current results framework
   of the Project is inadequate to monitor progress towards achievement of the Project
   Development Objective (PDO). The proposed changes are as follows: (a) changing
   one of the PDO indicators; (b) updating baseline and endline values of PDO
   indicators; and (c) revising intermediate results indicators to ensure they are
   technically sound, follow a logical sequence, and use available data sources to allow
   more frequent monitoring of progress. No changes are proposed to the PDO, project
   components, institutional arrangements, or project closing date.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. The PDO is to improve child and maternal care behavior and increase utilization of
   key micronutrients in order to contribute to nutritional status of vulnerable groups.
   The project, with an IDA allocation of US $30 million, was approved on 29 April
   2008, became effective on 10 September 2008, and has a closing date of 7 January
   2014. The project has been performing well. The MTR showed that the prevalence of
   malnutrition (underweight) in children under the age of two who participated in the
   project decreased from 31% to 14%. Over half of the funds (52%) have been
   disbursed, which is reasonable given that the project just crossed its mid-point. The
   project continues to be well managed by the Federal Ministry of Health. While
   progress toward achieving the PDO is satisfactory and disbursements are steadily
   increasing, there is a need to review the Results Framework.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

3. Changing one of the PDO indicators: Because there is a limited link between the
   project inputs and salt iodization, Universal Salt Iodization (USI) coverage is not a
   good PDO indicator. This indicator would be replaced by the percentage of children
   0-23 months participating in monthly growth monitoring and promotion (GMP)
   sessions. This indictor reflects the importance of Community-based Nutrition (CBN)
   in changing maternal/child care behaviors, and is also useful because it can be
   monitored on a six-month basis through routine monitoring data.

4. Updating of baseline values: The baseline values of the PDO indicators will be
   updated using more recent nationally representative data, the National Nutrition

                                           4
   Survey (NNS), which was carried out in 2009 by the Ethiopia Health and Nutrition
   Research Institute (EHNRI). These values will replace the 2005 Demographic and
   Health Survey (DHS) data, and the endline target values will be updated accordingly.
   The EHNRI will repeat the NNS at the end of 2013.

5. Revising intermediate results indicators: The intermediate results indicators will be
   revised to ensure they are logically linked to the PDO and can be monitored more
   frequently. The revised intermediate indicators can be updated semiannually or
   annually either from routine monitoring data or the project reports prepared by the
   implementing agency. The proposed changes are detailed in Annex 1. The proposed
   results framework is provided in Annex 2 (Table 2), with details on data collection
   (Table 3).
