H. Restructuring (if any)

The project was restructured on April 2, 2012 to refine the Results Framework, some
Indicators, and baselines. It was restructured again December 16, 2013, to extend the
Grant Closing Date by 5 months from January 07, 2014 to May 31, 2014.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal in 2008, Ethiopia had GDP growth averaging an impressive
6.4% annually, however further growth was held back by a number of important
bottlenecks. As an economy significantly dependent on the agriculture sector, high
population growth rates contributed to a decline in farm sizes, with climate variability in
rainfall correlated to lower household income and consumption (Poverty Assessment,
World Bank, 2005). Health risks - including malaria and HIV/AIDS - exacerbated the
vulnerability of the poor, driving thousands into poverty traps.

An underlying problem in Ethiopia was the high rate of malnutrition, with
micronutrient deficiencies some of the most prevalent disorders. As correctly
identified in the PAD, high prevalence of malnutrition, referring to under-nutrition, or
deficiency of nutrition (as opposed to over-nutrition), was a key problem. The 2005 DHS
data at the time found that alongside unacceptable maternal and child mortality rates,
Ethiopia had the second highest rate of malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa, with about
47% of children under 5 stunted, 11% wasted, 38% underweight and 27% of women
chronically malnourished, with a Body Mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. About half of
all child deaths were estimated to have arisen from malnutrition (Central Statistical
Agency 2005). A key form of malnutrition were micronutrient deficiencies, specifically,
iron deficiency anemia (IDA), vitamin A deficiency (VAD), and iodine deficiency
disorder (IDD). IDA was recognized as having affected 54% of children under 5 and
27% of women (Central Statistical Agency 2005). As to breastfeeding, only one in three
children aged 4-5 months was exclusively breastfed, and many children aged 6-9 months
not breastfed at all resulting in an estimated 18% of all infant deaths, and 7.5 % of under
5 mortality, annually, caused by poor breastfeeding behavior.

The PAD rightfully linked the high levels of malnutrition as a threat to national
health objectives and economic growth. Nutrition is one of the key determinants of
health, with malnutrition increasing the susceptibility and vulnerability of individuals to
disease (WHO 2002; Barros et al, 2010). Furthermore, globally there is a well-
established link between health, nutrition and education and economic growth .Whereas
economic growth can help lift people out of poverty and improve their access to some of
the determinants of health and nutrition, inadequate health and nutrition have been
closely linked globally to deterioration of individual cognitive ability, productivity and
labor market outcomes, and ultimately economic growth. At the time of project appraisal,
it was estimated that Ethiopia would lose approximately 2.5% of GDP between 2006 and
2016 in the absence of interventions to remedy stunting and iron deficiency (Rajkumar et
al, 2012).

The Bank Project tapped into strong political commitment and a corresponding
policy cycle that aimed to address malnutrition in Ethiopia. Following the
formulation of a National Nutrition Strategy (NNS) in 2005, the government launched the



                                             1
Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP) Plan (2005-2010)
which called for the implementation of a multi-sectoral nutrition strategy to achieve the
MDG 1 goal of halving poverty and hunger by 2015 (Taylor 2012). This was followed by
the launch of the National Nutrition Program (NNP) in 2008, with the aim of
harmonizing and implementing multi-sectoral nutrition interventions and strengthening
service delivery and institutions for nutrition during 2008 - 2013 (FMOH 2008). The
Government's commitment to accelerating progress in nutrition was furthermore reflected
in its major development plans including the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) and
fourth Health Sector Development Program (HSDP IV). In line with these planning
documents, the PAD rightfully argued that the high prevalence of malnutrition was seen
as a key contributor to high infant and maternal mortality rates and considered a threat to
the achievement of MDGs and maintenance of sustained economic growth in Ethiopia.

The Bank project positioned itself as a self-contained project focusing on more
narrow nutrition objectives within the wider multi-sectoral National Nutrition
Program (2008-2013). By 2007, a draft “Detailed Program Proposal” of the NNP existed
and served as the base document for developing the World Bank project design, including
implementation and financing plans. In consultation with the government and partners,
the agreed upon objective of the Bank Project was to "improve child and maternal care
behaviour, and increase utilization of key micronutrients, in order to contribute to
improving the nutritional status of vulnerable groups". Higher level objectives that the
project was hoped to contribute to included improvement of the nutritional status of
vulnerable groups, especially young children and pregnant women, as well as overall
maternal and child health outcomes, and ultimately removal of important barriers to
overall economic growth.

The project was designed to support a combination of community and national level
interventions to achieve its objectives. A primary focus was on funding interventions
and activities that would bring nutrition services closer to the community, largely by
strengthening community capacity and integrating nutrition interventions into the
government’s existing flagship Health Extension Program (HEP), a community level
health service delivery model, heavily supported and funded by the government, intended
to reach remote populations across Ethiopia. By 2008, this innovative and much lauded
program had already trained and deployed up to 30,000 female health extension workers
(HEWs) to deliver basic preventive and curative health services at health post level
across remote communities in Ethiopia. However, nutrition related competencies
remained underdeveloped (for more information on the HEP, read Bilal et al, 2011). In
addition to supporting community based nutrition (CBN) in 4 regions across Ethiopia,
including the provision of micronutrients, the project also intended to (and managed to)
leverage interest and funding from other donors for nutrition and nationwide scale up,
and strengthen coordination, implementation and research capacity on nutrition at various
levels.

Overall project implementation was led by the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH)
and by extension, the Pharmaceuticals Fund and Supply Agency (PFSA), the key
procurement entity. Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI), an



                                            2
autonomous agency, was responsible to implement the project financed research related
activities. There was no Project Implementation Unit (PIU); however focused technical
assistance (TA) was provided in conjunction with short to long term capacity building
efforts in the health sector to build project management capacity. At the sub-national
level, the implementation was led by the Regional Health Bureaus (with support from
regional NNP coordinators financed under the project) as well as the District Health
Offices (Called Woreda Health Offices), and as the project progressed, by health sector
staff trained in two-year sandwich Masters Course in nutrition (financed by the project).
At the level of service delivery, implementation was led by HEWs (initially supported in
their nutrition tasks by volunteer community health workers (VCHWs), and subsequently
the Health Development Army (HDA)) under the government’s flagship Health
Extension Program (HEP). More detail on these service delivery agents is provided
throughout the report below.

The rationale for the Bank to support Ethiopia on nutrition was high. The Bank was
engaged in the formulation of the National Nutrition Plan, responding to requests from
the Government for technical assistance and financial resources. Moreover, the Bank was
involved in a wide range of activities, multi-donor operations, and sectors (agriculture,
water, education), much of it over an extended period, and had demonstrated leadership
in important and complex productive safety nets such as the Productive Safety Net
Program (PSNP) and in providing basic services, as well as its involvement with the
Ethiopia International Health Partnership Compact (August 2008). Its engagement was
seen as needed by both the Government and development partners (DPs). Many DPs saw
the Bank as a catalyst for their participation, and as providing greater assurance of the
likelihood the harmonizing and integrated approach put forward by the NNP
implementation, would be carried forward. The Bank’s Nutrition Project, fully aligned
with the national plan, constituted a major contribution to the NNP.

The project remained fully relevant with the most recent Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS 2012-2017) which emphasized increasing resilience and reducing
vulnerability. The CPS is well tied to the Government's Growth and Transformation
Plan and particularly in areas of strong Government ownership. Pillar Two of the CPS
aims to enhance resilience and reduce vulnerabilities by improving delivery of social
services and developing a comprehensive approach to social protection and risk
management. An important outcome sought by the CPS is increasing access to quality
health and education services, and these are closely linked to nutrition. The objective of
the Nutrition Project was consistent with good governance in that it focused on improved
public service management and responsiveness; enhanced community participation; and
better public service (health sector) financial and procurement management, and
accountability.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to "improve child and maternal care
behavior, and increase utilization of key micronutrients, in order to contribute to
improving the nutritional status of vulnerable groups". This was to be primarily achieved
by equipping and supervising front line Health Extension Workers (HEWs), already


                                            3
deployed throughout Ethiopia, with new nutrition outreach skills and competencies, and
mobilize Volunteer Community Health Workers (VCHWs), done specifically under the
project, to support HEWs in their nutrition outreach activities. These Community Based
Nutrition (CBN) interventions (carried out, incrementally, in 4 regions), which also
focused on distributing key micronutrients, would be complemented by supporting social
advocacy and communications campaigns on nutrition (through community
conversations carried out by HEWs and VCHWs)-, as well as strengthening overall
coordination, management and research capacity on nutrition more generally at various
levels. The support provided under the project was expected to leverage additional donor
support (and that from other sectors) towards the NNP and lead to improvements in a
number of intermediary and project outcome indicators (Table 1), in addition to higher
level nutrition objectives discussed below.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

Whilst the PDO was not changed, the project indicators were revised during the
project duration to be more logically linked to the PDO and allow more rigorous and
timely monitoring of the project. The June 2011 supervision mission reviewed the
original indicators and assessed available data sources. During the Mid-Term Review
(MTR) mission (November 21-29, 2011) a review of the proposed revised results
framework was done and finalized1. The project was formally restructured in 2012 to
respond to a GOE request to revise the indicators going forward. One new PDO indicator




                                                      4
was added (GMP sessions) with the existing iodized salt indicator removed2, with other
PDO indicators definitions refined. As for the Intermediary Indicators, two new
indicators were included (health personnel receiving training in CBN and masters level
training in nutrition) and others were refined in their specificity (see datasheet comments
for details). For all indicators, where possible, values were updated using more recent
nationally representative data, data from the 2009 National Nutrition Survey. Table 2
provides details on the indicators following restructuring.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The primary target beneficiaries were under-5 children and pregnant and lactating
women principally in food insecure regions with high malnutrition rates, with
particular emphasis on improvements in MDGs 1 (eradicate extreme poverty and
hunger), MDG 4 (reduce Child Mortality), and MDG 5 (reduce Maternal Mortality). The
Community Based Nutrition aspect of the project was designed to target beneficiaries in a
phased approach in four diverse and highly food insecure regions (Amhara, Oromia,
SNNPR, Tigray) before going nationally. Secondary beneficiaries were institutions
involved in the implementation of the project and wider nutrition agenda whose capacity
was built to help reach the primary targets. They included FMOH, EHNRI, Regional
Health Bureaus, Woreda Health Offices and at the level of service delivery, HEWs under
the government’s flagship HEP, whose competencies in implementing and monitoring
CBN activities were upgraded.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

 This was done because there was a limited link between project inputs and salt iodization and thus
"Universal Salt Iodization coverage" was not considered a good PDO indicator.


                                                    5
The project development objective and related indicators were expected to be achieved
through the implementation of activities specified in 2 components, summarized as:

Component 1: Supporting Service Delivery (US$14m IDA and US$4.3 from GOE).
This component provided support to i) strengthen CBN and wider health services under
the HEP outreach program, through capacity enhancement of HEWs and their
supervisors, and mobilization of Volunteer Community Health Workers (VCHWs) to
support them in nutrition related outreach activities, and ii) provision of micronutrients to
the target population through regulatory interventions and support towards procurement,
delivery and utilization of key micronutrients, especially iodine, iron, zinc, and vitamin
A.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$16m and $4.3
from GOE). This second component provided support to i) strengthen coordination and
capacity for nutrition, in particular the setting up of a national coordination mechanisms
for nutrition; strengthening human resources for nutrition including researchers and
nutrition managers at various levels, and supporting capacity building of institutions to
implement nutrition interventions; ; ii) support national advocacy and social mobilization
messages on nutrition to a) build country ownership around nutrition and b) disseminate
nutrition messages in the media, and c) complement practices of HEWs and VCHWs in
promoting caring practices. Finally iii) support towards operational research, surveillance
and monitoring on nutrition, including building on existing data structures, overall
monitoring and evaluation for the NNP and relevant operational research for the NNP.

The causal linkages between components and the intermediary, PDO and higher
level indicators are illustrated in table 3 below, reflecting the results framework with
the post 2012 restructured indicators.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

There was intensive and high quality technical preparation of the project, both on
the Government's side with EHNRI nutrition research coupled with Bank supported
detailed analysis, and significant interaction in terms of developing the NNP.
The preparation of the Bank project was closely linked to preparation of the wider
NNP. Project identification and preparation, which began in earnest following the project
concept note review held in September 2007, was informed and benefitted from a wider
government and multi-partner team formed that same year to determine national level
nutrition objectives, components and activities, financing priorities and implementation
arrangements. Many of the specific details of the proposed structure of the wider
Ethiopia NNP and alongside it, the fully consistent Bank project, were established during
a Joint Partner Pre-Appraisal Mission held in October 2007 (Aide Memoire, 8-31
October, 2007).
The project preparation was swift, and whilst there was no formal Quality- at –
Entry Review, the technical design was endorsed at the decision meeting held in
February 2008. Throughout the preparation and appraisal period until board approval on
April 29, 2008, the Bank team continued to consult and benefit from global expertise and
a new found momentum to tackle nutrition in Ethiopia, exemplified for example by a


                                                   7
high level nutrition workshop held in 2008 linked to the Lancet journal series on nutrition
(Ethiopia was chosen as one of five countries in which the series was launched).
The project was largely designed around a solid evidence base on the status and
causes of malnutrition. Much of the evidence base was informed by an earlier
unpublished version of a nutrition study task led by the then Project TTL (eventually
published as Rajkumar et al 2011). As such, the determinants of malnutrition were
correctly recognized to be multi- sectoral in nature, linked to factors beyond food
security. Whilst the PAD drew on a solid external evidence base (including the numerous
documents that informed the NNP and NNS), it could nevertheless have benefited from
showing how the more narrow interventions that were to be supported and funded under
the project were anchored into the overall determinants and parallel interventions
impacting (mal) nutrition in Ethiopia. Not doing this may have contributed to the
selection of a set of indicators that had to be revised during subsequent restructuring
(largely to better capture impact, as discussed below), and has made it more difficult to
make the clear attribution of funded project interventions from interventions funded by
others.

The selected interventions supported under the project were generally based on
global best practice. Embedding micronutrient supplementation within an integrative
public health and nutrition strategy at community level, for example, is known to
maximize the potential for success (Thompson and Amoroso 2011). And recent reviews
on the impact of broader demand and supply side interventions at the community and
individual level have shown them to be successful, when they are coupled with wider
regulatory interventions, social advocacy and mobilization, and reinforced by
complementary capacity building interventions at all levels (see UNICEF 2014; IEG
2010). These best practices were largely adopted in project design.

Project design focused on entry points and best practices associated with targeting
the poor. Whereas the PAD could have benefited from a brief review of the evidence of
social determinants of malnutrition inequities in Ethiopia, to more systematically identify
and target nutrition inequalities, pro-poor design features included 1) a focus on high
risk and vulnerable groups (mothers and children), 2) prioritizing diseases of the poor
(the poor are disproportionately affected by malnutrition), 3) strengthening individuals
(the project promoted knowledge on nutritional practice), 4) strengthening communities
(the project used community level actors to strengthen social cohesion), 5) improving
living and working conditions (the project improved access to better nutrition care), 6)
complementing individual level interventions with macro level policies (the project
supported regulatory interventions on micronutrients), and 7) deploying or improving
services where the poor live (the project focused on poor regions) and 8) employing
appropriate delivery channels” (the project made use of health extension workers at
community level) (Whitehead 2007; Barros et al, 2010).

Additional notable strengths of project design included: i) drawing on strong political
and partner commitment for nutrition and community based service delivery; ii) logical
organization into two simple components, and a results chain with indicators plausibly
connecting the development objective with the planned activities/inputs, outputs,


                                             8
processes, and outcomes (albeit this was improved significantly after restructuring in
2012); iii) embedding the CBN activities of the project within an existing, innovative
community level service delivery program (i.e. the community level Health Extension
Program); iv) the use of existing institutions, and flexibility to accommodate new
structures for implementation at community, kebele, woreda and federal levels; v) roll
out of the CBN interventions in a phased approach in diverse and highly food insecure
rural districts within four regions (Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, Tigray); vi) utilizing
strong partnerships (and collaboration) with other development partners engaged in
Ethiopian nutrition efforts, particularly with UNICEF; vii) developing a sound Project
Implementation Manual, with support of an external consultant hired with a PHRD grant,
which provided a good basis for project execution and was used extensively throughout.

The design, moreover, anticipated and identified mitigation towards potential risks
that could negatively impact project outcomes. The emphasis was crucially placed on
coordination and implementation requirements, identified to be as particular risks to the
achievement of the development objectives, if the appropriate mitigation measures were
not implemented. They included:

(a) Inter-Ministerial commitment, linkages and coordination- Nutrition requires effective
links with sectors that affect or are affected by nutrition. The principal mitigation
measure was the commitment to establish and support a high-level national coordinating
body, to be actively supported by Ministries beyond just MOH.

(b)Intra-health sector coordination-There are numerous units and agencies within the
FMOH, with different program specific objectives other than nutrition. To overcome
possible difficulties, the project would look to active engagement of the Minister, to
whom the units and agencies are accountable, and Ministerial commitment to play a
strong supervisory and coordination role.

(c)Need for reporting from multiple implementers-Concerns were expressed that
reporting from various implementers, at the various levels, would not be timely,
complete, and relevant. The primary mitigating measure was to task EHNRI with overall
responsibility for monitoring and evaluation of the NNP and Bank project.

(d)Donor coordination -With multiple development partners engaged in nutrition,
harmonization and coordination issues are challenging. Mitigation measures were to look
to the FMOH to proactively coordinate donor participation and response for activities
related to the NNP, including the Bank project.

Some of the design shortcomings at entry, which affected implementation and were
partly rectified after restructuring in 2012 included: insufficient awareness in the
initial design on the complexity involved in iodized salt production, particularly with
regard to its political economy, in addition to quality and the difficulty in assuring
standardized iodine dosage with small producers (hence the subsequent removal of
associated indicators during restructuring). More scrutiny could have been placed on the
development of the results framework more generally: Project restructuring in 2012 had



                                            9
to be carried out to better link PDIs with IOIs, in addition to building on better data
sources. Perhaps a key weakness at appraisal was insufficient identification of weak
fiduciary and M&E capacity as a key risk. The fact that the PAD did not sufficiently flag
such risks could be linked to the fact that from the outset, what was not well defined was
where to house the program and responsibility for its implementation, with ultimately
much later agreement that it should be the FMOH. In any case, greater analysis and
assessment of risks and identification of solid mitigation of challenges early would have
improved project execution.

2.2 Implementation

The project was financed by an IDA grant of SDR 18.8 million (US$ 30 million
equivalent) with a Government contribution of US$9.6million. Over the course of the
project two Trust Fund grants were linked to the project, a US$ 1.81million recipient
executed Japanese Social Development Fund Grant, and a US$ 650,000 grant towards the
Rapid Social Response Multi-Donor Trust Fund (RSD MDTF). Their role in contributing
towards the PDO is discussed in section 3.2 of this ICR.

The project was approved by the Board in April 2008 and became effective in
September 2008 with conditions of effectiveness and dated covenants largely achieved
as planned. Conditions of effectiveness included assignment of a financial specialist for
the FMOH, adoption of a Program Implementation Manual, and project procurement
specialists for the PFSA and EHNRI. Dated covenants included establishment by July
2009 of a National Nutrition Coordinating Body, recruitment by October 2008 of an
external auditor for the Project, evidence of adoption and implementation of universal
salt iodization regulations by July 2010, and registration of zinc as an essential drug by
July 2010.

Despite effectiveness declared in September 2008, the actual launch of the project
was delayed significantly due to factors extrinsic to the project itself. The project
launch did not occur until 9 months later until June 2009, which was largely attributed to
the Ethiopian Government-wide “Business Process Reform” process, a wide ranging
public sector reform effort designed to bring about efficiencies in the public sector over
an extensive period, which affected and delayed many parts of the government and the
Bank portfolio. The BPR affected project launch because it was hard to secure the
presence of higher level government officials during this period and because it involved
restructuring of relevant structures and responsibilities of certain agencies within the
government (e.g. EHNRI, FMOH). Whilst the project launch was put on hold during this
process, the project team continued to benefit from donor support towards the
development and refinement of the PIM and of the broader NNP (in which the Bank
project was anchored), initiation of the baseline survey process, and key steps were taken
to enhance project execution readiness, including for example the selection of operational
research topics to be supported under the project. Thus, the principal cause of the delay in
Bank project start-up was extrinsic to the project itself, while the Government and other
DPs proceeded with the execution of the NNP.




                                            10
Furthermore, an issue extraneous to the nutrition project, namely the existence of
unaccounted advances in other projects in the Ethiopia portfolio, meant that the initial,
agreed Withdrawal Application disbursement for the project Special Account was
delayed for several months, hamstringing project start up and impacting performance.

Following launch in June 2009, the first phase of service delivery to 238 woredas
proceeded largely as designed3. Project-financed training and procurement for CBN
under the NNP was linked to complementary UNICEF-financed technical assistance to
FMOH in the development of training materials and training of master trainers for
cascading training to community level and UNICEF procurement of items known to be
complicated to procure (e.g. weighing scales). In this initial implementation phase,
VCHWs and HEWs in project areas received CBN specific training and refresher training
under the project (VCHWs were originally assigned under the project to work with
HEWs to deliver two major activities under CBN notably GMP and Community
Conversations (CC), each responsible for 30-50 households – under HEW’s supervision).
From the end of 2010 onwards, the project experienced disruptions and delays in
carrying out CBN activities due to a training-related policy shift, again extrinsic to
the project itself. The FMOH dropped CBN specific training and instead developed
Integrated Refresher Training (IRT) for HEWs, which included 4 broader modules one of
which included CBN. Consequently, HEW refresher training was disrupted and with it
project implementation. Around the same time, a second policy shift affected CBN
activities, as FMOH national policy replaced the VCHW with “Health Development
Army (HDA)” volunteers, who were assigned to carry out mobilization and promotional
activities within the community (not specific to nutrition), with GMP and CC transferred
fully to the HEW. Training of the new HDAs was less focused on nutrition, and CBN
service delivery, specifically GMP and CC, were severely affected in some areas where
the transition from VCHW to HAD and HEW took longer than expected4. These policy
changes slowed and disrupted implementation.
Other challenges during implementation could be linked more directly to the
project, and related to some of the intended micronutrient interventions, also under
component 1. During the first phase of implementation, it became evident that the
targeted levels of household provision of adequately iodized salt was an unrealistic goal,
given the nature of the Ethiopian salt industry with many small producers in a politically
complex region with extreme weather, poor infrastructure (water, electricity, roads), and
the absence of a means to assure compliance to centrally mandated legislation. While



3
  By June 2011, 11,900 Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and 90,000 Voluntary Community Health
Workers (VCHWs) were trained on CBN, (GMP) coverage increased to 60% with 1.08 million out of 1.8
million under-2 children participating in GMP sessions, and 65% of VCHWs were submitting monthly
CBN reports to HEWs
4
  Moving to an HDA system took time to establish with some regions doing so quickly and others not.
Furthermore, the HDA were trained in an integrated package that diluted the nutrition messaging.
Combined with the shifting of responsibilities to HEWs, this reduced the “dose” of n utrition activities at
community level.



                                                    11
efforts continued to build on the approved salt iodization policy and pursue increases in
quality salt iodization (reflected in new intermediary indicators added after 2012), it was
evident early on that household coverage of iodized salt was beyond the project to
achieve given the financed activities (and the original PDO indicator on that was
dropped). Implementation of other aspects of micronutrient interventions in this
component were successful, as the targets for community-based Vitamin A
Supplementation were routinely exceeded and uptake of IFA among pregnant women
increased over the project period.

A particular concern, moreover, were FM issues and procurement delays
particularly with the FMOH and by extension with a key procurement entity, the
Pharmaceuticals Fund and Supply Agency (PFSA) and to some degree with ENHRI.
Procurement processes were cumbersome, took time to complete, and resulted in delays
in getting goods to the end-users, such as iron folate or vehicles, or selecting institutions
to produce studies. A procurement plan had been adopted but the implementing entities,
namely PFSA, EHNRI, and FMOH had limited experience with Bank procurement
procedures, and were slow in processing procurement requests despite additional
technical assistance to facilitate. With respect to financial management, in the first phase
of the project, there were key budgeting, internal controls and financial reporting and
external auditing issues that were identified as warranting improvement, with an action
plan for improvement developed in 2011 (during the MTR). Funds flow was slow, with
delays and or lags in disbursement.

A Joint Mid-Term Review in November 2011 sought to identify and address a
number of challenges, including: weaknesses in federal and regional level staff
particularly with regards to financial management and procurement (development of an
FM action plan with agreed actions contained in the Annex of the MTR); strengthening
integrated refresher training (IRT) in light of the policy shift on training5, responding
to/mitigating the adverse effects as a result of replacement of VCHW by a new Health
Development Army cadre on CBN nutrition services6; revising the results framework to
align it more closely with project activities, including elimination of the universal salt
iodization objective as unrealistic; speed up progress in implementing M&E activities;
foster recognition of the need for, and recommendations to generate multi-sectoral
commitment, including Ministry commitment to their respective roles in stunting
reduction (given the slow advancements in that regard of the multi-sectoral nutrition
coordination committee), and in particular MOA/FMOH collaboration at national and
community/kebele level. All in all, the interim report at the time of Mid-Term Review



5
  Critical to the success of the approach was HEW and VCHW competency and quality of counseling,
which was dependent on training, refresher training, and supervision. After VCHWs were replaced by
HAD, the HEWs training became even more critical, but CBN was integrated into HEW IRT, with limited
time devoted to it. Recognition of the need to improve skill levels was raised by a Bank financed EHNRI
study which did a candid analysis of pre- and post-refresher training skills, and resulted in an ongoing
effort to develop "Blended Training Materials for Nutrition" which remains a work in progress.
6
  While each HDA was assigned to mobilize 5 households, they were not given permission to deliver any
service. Instead, HEWs were asked to carry out GMP which added significantly to their workload.


                                                  12
provided information for both NNP revision and project restructuring, and led to an
action plan to address them.

The task team and the FMOH were proactive in addressing the challenges
experienced during the first half of the project, particularly after the MTR. Formally
restructuring the project in 2012 helped to more logically link and redefine project and
intermediary indicators and targets, and improved the data available for decision-making.
With regards to procurement, notable steps were taken including: carrying out continuous
revisions of procurement plans, procurement training for PFSA staff; and implementation
of recommendations to hire a procurement officer in the FMOH (eventually done post
2012). To improve financial management, the FMOH hired nutrition coordinators to
work at regional level in project regions; financial capacity building was completed at the
woreda level (training for financial managers in 144 woredas); Federal level accountant
training was also undertaken to cascade training to woreda accountants; and TA was
recruited to support FM.

Following the MTR and subsequent restructuring, there was progress with
implementation of components and procurement of some activities improved.
Financial management also improved reflected in the quick settlement of SOEs, including
outstanding balances at regions and implementing agencies. Disbursement shows a slow
start with improvements only beginning in the first quarter of 2011, increasing from 10%
($3 million) in December 2009, to 50% ($15 million) by March 2012. The disbursement
pattern, which improved more significantly only in 2011 following the MTR, reflects the
above discussed extrinsic and intrinsic factors which hampered early implementation
progress. Whilst overall implementation and disbursement improved after 2011, the
procurement of some micronutrients, and in particular iron folate tablets remained
problematic throughout project execution, primarily due to delays within PFSA, as there
are additional registration processes required for “medical” suppliers, and FMOH
determined that IFA supplements be treated as medical supplies. By the time the project
closed, SDR 17.3 million was disbursed (92% of the original allocation of SDR 18.8
million).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project was formally restructured on April 11, 2012. Design and implementation
issues resulted in the need to change one Project Development Objective (PDO)
indicator, update baseline values of the PDO indicators (with data from the NP-financed
NNP baseline survey, accordingly changing end-line targets), and fine tune some IOIs to
more logically link them to the PDO, and permit their regular and more targeted
monitoring. At restructuring, one PDO indicator was dropped (salt iodization) and one
added (GMP). As for the Intermediary Indicators, 2 new indicators were added, 5
indicators made more specific, and 3 indicators remained the same. The indicators were
fine-tuned with the wider government and multi-partner discussions during preparation
and subsequent implementation, with the revision aligned with the revised NNP
framework.




                                            13
Project monitoring, which relied largely on the HMIS system, was initially
challenging but improved significantly as the project progressed. The monitoring and
evaluation data used by the project to monitor and evaluate progress depended on two
major systems: 1) the national Health Monitoring Information System (HMIS) which did
not initially include nutrition indicators but was revised under the project to include
Growth Monitoring and Promotion; and 2) CBN data collection carried out at woreda
level on a monthly basis flowing to Regional Health Bureaus (RHB) and national level.
Initial challenges to obtain woreda level nutrition data at the federal level (in the HMIS)
were addressed during restructuring in 2012, which added an intermediary indicator to
ensure woredas were providing monthly nutrition data to the federal level. By the end of
the project, the flow of nutrition data from the woredas to the national level, as well as
perceived quality of this data, improved significantly, with over 80% of woredas
providing monthly nutrition data to the MOH.

The project also supported an independent impact evaluation of CBN activities in
collaboration with UNICEF. Surveys were carried out by local partners Addis
Continental and Mela, with analyses conducted by Tulane University. This was a
unique feature supported by the project in collaboration with UNICEF. The report,
finalized in September 2012 was disseminated also via a BBL at the Bank, and the
assessment showed impressive progress towards improved nutrition outcomes in the 4
target regions where CBN was supported, and in particular the reduction of stunting. The
key findings of this study are highlighted below, in section 3.2 of this ICR.

In addition, the project provided support towards EHNRI under component 2
towards operational research studies on nutrition. A multi-stakeholder consultative
workshop held in 2009 identified twelve potential thematic areas for operational research,
later reduced to six thematic areas. Eight out of the originally planned 10 studies were
carried out during the project (the initial 10 study target had been reduced to 8 by
EHNRI), with findings used by the government to understand and discuss project
performance, guide implementation and inform the new NNP. For example, a study of
iron supplementation coverage at health centers and health posts showed very low
coverage, and led to subsequent remedial action, the review of IRT identified gaps in
HEW training on nutrition and identified priority areas for revision.

Finally, EHNRI (now EPHI) was responsible for the baseline, midline, and end-line
survey. The baseline and midline studies were done (and results disseminated through
national workshops); however the endline survey has not been completed. It was agreed
the endline survey would become part of a broader micronutrient survey financed by DPs
(primarily UNICEF). While plans for the survey were completed well within the
anticipated closing date of the project, procurement constraints beyond the control of
EPHI and the FMOH, prevented commencement of the MN survey. UNICEF has
acknowledged that the delay has been with their procurement of a number of supplies,
including data collection supplies, which were to be provided by UNICEF. The end-line
survey was to be in lieu of a separate Bank financed end-line survey for project
purposes, which would have been repetitive and costly to have done as a stand-alone
effort. Resolution of procurement items between EPHI and UNICEF sooner could have



                                            14
resulted in timely completion of the micronutrient survey and better assessment of project
performance (end-line results reporting).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards: The project was classified as a Category C project and no negative
environmental impact was either identified or occurred during project implementation.

Financial management and disbursement: Project appraisal had identified low fiduciary
capacity as one potential risk to the achievement of proposed development objective.

Whilst initial fiduciary compliance was problematic, there are indications that this
improved during the latter half of the project. In the first phase of the project, there
were key budgeting, internal controls and financial reporting and external auditing issues
that were identified as warranting improvement, with an action plan for improvement
developed in 2011 (contained in the Annex of the MTR). Many of the recommendations
were adopted including the use of project financing to enhance training of regional
financial officers and woreda project accountants. Other recommendations, including
improving the quality of regional and sub-regional budget monitoring and reporting, and
internal audit unit capacity, will require continuous future attention. An in-depth
Financial Management Supervision Report in March 20147 provided assurance of
adequate financial management under the project. The report focused on assessing the
status and adequacy of the Project's financial management arrangements and compliance
with legal covenants related to financial management. The mission reviewed budgeting,
accounting, internal controls, funds flow, financial reporting, and external auditing. It
concluded that there was reasonable adequacy that the FM system in place provided the
necessary assurance that Bank grant proceeds were used for the intended purposes and
reports produced can be relied on to have monitored Project activities.

As identified previously, disbursement was slow during the first 2 years of the
project, and at least partly attributed to procurement related challenges. Despite
some improvements after 2011, procurement was a major issue throughout the project
life. A recommendation to recruit a procurement officer to handle and oversee
procurement activities of the project was pursued after considerable delay and located at
the FMOH. Procurement plans were developed and continuously revised for goods
(micronutrients, vehicles and motorcycles, furniture, educational materials, laboratory
equipment, printing of manuals and workshop training materials, IT equipment), as well
as multiple consultancy service assignments and positions for FMOH and EHNRI, but
remained a major constraint for proper implementation of the project.

The project was instrumental in triggering donor attention to nutrition and as a
result leveraged interest and additional resources to support the implementation of
the NNP. Throughout the project duration, the Bank provided overall leadership in the
national scaling up of nutrition movement amongst donors, and played a key role in
strengthening nutrition coordination partnerships including via carrying out bi-annual
NNP joint supervision missions. The Bank team was also actively involved in supporting
the government to implement nutrition interventions not directly linked to the project
(that would nonetheless impact higher level project objectives), including the roll out of
the national food fortification program.

Building on the work done under the project and the NNP, the Government's next
Health Sector Development Program (V) will have nutrition indicators, with the
likely inclusion of stunting, breast feeding and complementary feeding, GMP,
micronutrient supplementation, management of acute malnutrition. Currently the HMIS
collects data on under 3 year old children while the focus of the SUN approach and CBN
is on children under age 2 years; how this disparity will be dealt with, either by
modification of the HMIS or separate but complementary nutrition data collection, is not
determined.

The Government partners are continuing to support the NNP, continuously refining
the mechanisms, training materials, and modus operandi. The second phase of the
national nutrition program is detailed in a 2013 FMOH document “National Nutrition
Program, June 2013-June 2015”8. Part of the NNP continues to be supported under the
Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) and the Health Millennium Development Goals
Program-for-Results Project (Health PforR), with significant resources bearing on
nutrition related interventions in both projects.

Moving forward, the Bank is supportive of continued support for nutrition activities in
the country and is discussing the possibility of additional financing (AF) for the Health
Millennium Development Goals Program-for-Results Project (Health PforR). The
additional financing could build on this first nutrition operation with focus on high
impact targeted nutrition specific interventions and significantly enhance HSDP IV’s
maternal and child health results. In the meantime, the Bank team will continue engaging
the Government on nutrition issues through analytical work based on the latest DHS data
and other data sources, focusing on the sizeable nutrition outcome gaps between different
income groups.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: The relevance of the project’s development objective, design and
implementation is substantial.

The relevance of the objectives: The PDO remains extremely relevant for Ethiopia,
in that malnutrition continues to be a key bottleneck to economic growth and prosperity.
It remains relevant for Ethiopia, fully supporting (and in line with) the NNS and both the
first and second phases of NNP with the aim to shift the country from a focus on
emergency response to an evidence-based preventive/promotive approach to improving
nutrition, and harmonize various independent nutrition programs, interventions and
activities, into one integrated program overseen by the Government. The NNS and NNP
remain highly relevant to Ethiopia’s efforts to reduce poverty, improve nutrition and
health, and remove bottlenecks to economic growth. The PDO also remains relevant to
Bank priorities and development objectives including progressing towards the twin goals
of the World Bank Group, and contribute to 1) end extreme poverty and 2) promote
shared prosperity of the bottom 40%. The PDO is in alignment with the basic objectives
of the PRSP and the Country Partnership Strategy.

The relevance of the design: The design of the project continues to be relevant to
achieving Ethiopia’s development objectives, and the Bank’s mandate to support poverty
reduction and foster economic growth. Despite the early design issues addressed during
the 2012 MTR, overall, the project design focused on a number of good practices that
continue to be relevant today (and to the achievement of the objective). These include: i)
drawing on global expertise and a solid evidence base to develop technical interventions;
ii) focusing on the vulnerable and entry points associated with reaching the poor; iii)
drawing on strong political and partner commitment; iv) embedding the project within an
existing national nutrition program and a functioning well designed community level
service delivery program; v) using existing institutions, and flexibility to accommodate
new structures for implementation at community, kebele, woreda and federal levels; vi)
focusing on a combination of community level with higher level interventions; and vii)
roll out some of the CBN interventions in a phased approach. The relevance of these
strong features were fully recognized by the Lancet Series on Maternal and Child
Nutrition of June 6, 2013.

The relevance of implementation: The project was implemented overall by the FMOH,
and by extension, the Pharmaceutical Fund and Supply Agency (PHSA) and the
Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI). Per best practice and the
decentralized institutional arrangement of the health system, at the sub-national level
implementation was led by the Regional Health Bureaus as well as Woreda Health
Offices and at the level of service delivery by health extension workers (HEWs), the
health development army (following on from the VCHWs), and supervisors - under the
government’s flagship Health Extension Program (HEP). The capacities of all these
bodies, which implemented the project according to good practice from the community
level upwards, were reinforced throughout the duration of the project. Implementation of


                                            17
the research activities by the national research organization EHNRI remained relevant. At
the same time, disbursement was relatively slow during the first two years of the project,
reflecting implementation challenges as well as the lack of experience, and bureaucratic
processes, related to procurement and FM, which particularly occurred early on during
the project. Issues with M&E also characterized the first phase of the project. Much was
addressed prior to and during the MTR, and subsequent restructuring, however
challenges remained particularly on procurement.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Project efficacy is rated substantial.

The PDO which was to “improve child and maternal care behavior and increase
utilization of key micronutrients, in order to contribute to improving the nutritional status
of vulnerable groups” is rated substantial overall, as measured against the original targets
and those following project restructuring in 2012. The project has made an impressive
contribution towards improving child and maternal care behavior and increasing the
utilization of key micronutrients and improving the nutritional status of vulnerable
groups. In addition, the project has contributed to strengthening institutional capacity to
support delivery of improved nutritional services and towards boosting research and
knowledge generation on nutrition in Ethiopia. Aside from achieving most of the PDO
and intermediary indicators, some higher level nutrition and health objectives also
improved during the duration of the project. The efficacy rating is based on the following
main results outlined below.

3.2.1 Evidence on the Achievements of the Project Development Objective

   a) Improvements in Child and Maternal Care Practices and Increased Utilization
      of key Micronutrients:

This is particularly reflected in the impressive achievement of the PDO indicators added
after restructuring in 2012 (to better capture results of project activities). Improvements
in these indicators (often exceeding the target values) show that today more than 55m
people have access to a basic package of nutrition services (up from 0 persons prior to the
project) and 42 % of children 0-23 months being routinely weighed and monitored, by
Health Extension Workers (HEWs), a starting point to engage the community in actions
that promote child growth including optimal breastfeeding and complementary feeding.
In addition, 2 million more children receive a dose of vitamin A every 6 months, and the
same amount are screened quarterly for acute malnutrition through community health
days. The percentage of pregnant women receiving iron and folate supplementation
increased from 17% to 89% during the project duration, and the percentage of infants
exclusively breastfed increased by about 1% over the duration of the Project (albeit this
indicator reflects national level data – an external evaluation carried out by Tulane in
CBN woredas only, which received much of the focus of this project and is discussed
below– revealed much better improvements). Addressing household provision of
adequately iodized salt (an indicator dropped in 2012) was an unrealistic goal, given the


                                             18
nature of the salt industry with many small producers and the absence of a means to
assure compliance. Instead, headway was made related to the approved salt iodization
policy and overall increases in quality salt iodization (reflected in the intermediary
indicators).

The impressive national level results are reinforced by the findings of an impact
evaluation of the CBN interventions in the four target regions a few years into the
project. The impact evaluation, which was coordinated by Tulane and jointly funded by
the project and UNICEF, carried out four evaluation sample surveys of CBN between
2009 and 2011 in Tranches 2 and 3 of successive scale up of the CBN interventions. The
surveys covered about 120 randomly selected clusters each in the four target regions, and
had re-sampling of households from the same clusters at endline. Findings from the
surveys reported significant increases in households reporting receiving nutrition
information from HEW or VCHWs and participating in community-based nutrition
activities such as Community Conversations and child weighing. The evaluation found
significant changes in maternal and child nutrition care practices targeted by the project,
including infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices (using WHO indicators):
Exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, already high in CBN woredas, increased in
tranche 2 to nearly 90% (an increase much higher than observed at national level increase

  This indicator reflects national level data only – an external evaluation 2 years into the project, carried out
by Tulane in CBN woredas only, which received much of the focus of this project and is discussed below–
revealed much better improvements

above). Dietary diversity at 6-23 months increased significantly, as did the minimal
acceptable diet-reaching around 40-50%. Poor dietary practices, such as providing less
food to children with diarrhea and eating less during pregnancy, were also significantly
reduced. Use of antenatal care increased as did women taking iron-folate during
pregnancy from 30 to 50%.

        b) Improvements in Nutritional Status of Vulnerable Groups10:

During the duration of the project, two important higher level Protein Energy
Malnutrition (PEM) outcome indicators at national level improved: stunting and
underweight (an MDG indicator). National level data compiled from the Central
Statistical Agency (DHS 2014) reported that the percentage of children underweight in
Ethiopia was reduced from 33% in 2005 to 29% in 2011 and 25% in 2014. Equally, the
percentage of children that are stunted was reduced from 51% in 2005 to 44% in 2011
and 40% in 2014 (Table 6). These are significant improvements and the extent to which
the project may have contributed towards these improvements can be debated. What we
do know is that the project activities focused on several interventions identified in the
Lancet Nutrition Series as having high impact on nutrition and focused on the
populations (pregnant women and under-two children) expected to contribute most to
nutrition impact. CBN activities covered more than half the country’s woredas by 2014,
and the CBN program was shown to improve nutrition behaviors and to plausibly
improve stunting in the subset of the woredas where a quasi-experimental evaluation was
conducted (Mason and White, 2012).A 2014 study on the factors associated with stunting
in a district in Southern Ethiopia found that although factors such as larger families and
women in working professions were associated with higher levels of stunting in children,
so was inadequate breastfeeding, (Fikadu et al 2014) which was specifically addressed by
the project, and which improved significantly in the 4 target regions (albeit less so
nationally). And a study on the determinants of underweight children in Western Ethiopia
identified key factors to be weight at birth, breastfeeding frequency, provision of health
information (Hailemariam 2014), all of which were addressed by the project. Whilst the
project may well have impacted many of these determinants, what is also clear is that
trends in improvements in both stunting and underweight indicators were already
observed prior to the project implementation, so other factors (for example, economic
growth and increasing prosperity discussed below) may have also played a role.

  The project seems to equate vulnerable groups with the target population (i.e. mothers and children in
remote parts of Ethiopia). Of note is that the 2014 mini DHS did not produce evidence on nutrition
outcomes of mothers, nor did it disaggregate nutrition outcomes by income quintiles or rural/urban location
which would provide for a more comprehensive definition and identification of vulnerable groups.

The extent to which improvements in underweight children under 2 years of age
could have been attributed by the project is better indicated in the early impact
evaluation of CBN in the 4 project target regions in Ethiopia. Routine data from GMP
was transmitted to national level from villages and health posts starting in 2010, and
suggested that the trend in the first 1-2 years after CBN launch was an improvement of
about 15 percentage points in underweight prevalence, among participants. The
participation rate was estimated at about 30% (see Fig 1, below). Whereas the PAD
acknowledged that factors outside the project interventions would influence these
indicators (World Bank 2008), the joint 2012 WB/UNICEF funded external impact
evaluation, did plausibly attribute improvements of these indicators to CBN supported
under the project (Mason and White 2012).

Finally, Maternal and Child Health indicators, indirectly targeted by the project,
also improved during the project duration (table 7). Under 5 child mortality, which the
project indirectly aimed to address at the higher level, saw a reduction from 76 per 1000
in 2010 to 64/1000 in 2013. Similarly, maternal mortality in Ethiopia was reduced from
500 in 2010 to 420 in 2013. Nutrition is only one of the many determinants of maternal
and child health, so the project and the wider community based nutrition interventions in
Ethiopia can only be partially linked to any improvements in these MDGs (which was
acknowledged in the PAD). Nonetheless, it is a powerful one, and nutrition globally is
widely linked to population health (De Onis et al 2004). Empirical evidence has
demonstrated the link between nutrition and health outcomes (WHO 2002; Barros et al
2010); 15% of the global disease burden attributed to the combined effect of
micronutrient deficiencies in children and underweights of mothers (Black et al. 2003),
between 20% of all deaths of those under 5 years of age attributed to malnutrition (Black

3.2.2 Key factors that help explain the achieved impacts

The achievement of the PDO and related indicators can be attributed to the
successful implementation and relevant achievement in the following: 1)
Improvement in Community Based Nutrition and supply of key micronutrients (as
reflected in component 1), and 2) Strengthened institutional capacity to support delivery
of improved nutritional services (as reflected in component 2), and 3) factors external to
the project itself. The following discusses each in greater detail.

       a) Improvement in Community Based Nutrition and Supply of key
       Micronutrients (through activities funded under component 1)

The project succeeded in bringing nutrition to the community level by integrating
nutrition into the service delivery package of HEP. The project was instrumental in
funding the CBN activities, which was one of the 4 objectives of NNP. The CBN
program administrative design matched that of the wider HEP, and set up so that overall
responsibility for CBN lies with the Woreda (district) Health Office who is tasked to
provide supportive supervision and technical support to implementation (with support
from Zonal and regional Health Bureau). Under the Woreda Health office, two HEWs per
Kebele (sub-district) were tasked to provide critical nutrition services to the community.
They were supported by 10-12 VCHWs – subsequently replaced by HDA, tasked with 1)
monthly community conversations (CC) to improve feeding and other caring practices,
hygiene and sanitation, 2) home visits to follow up growth faltering of malnourished
children, 3) referral of malnourished and sick children to nearby health post for treatment,
and 4) carry out informal continuous contacts with the community. With the introduction
of the HAD (and removal of VCHWs), these tasks were fully shifted to the HEW.

Despite some delays prior to restructuring (see earlier discussion), and with TA
support from UNICEF, Community based Nutrition was successfully rolled out and
implemented in the regions with the combination of high population and high food
insecurity, namely Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, and Tigray. Within these regions, the
program rolled out in tranches that varied in timing and size, starting with 39 pilot
woredas (districts) in 2008 (tranche 1), and subsequently 54 (tranche 2), 77 (tranche 3),
and 58 (tranche 4) more woredas in 2009, 2010, and 2011 respectively. By the time of
restructuring (2012), 238 woredas were covered by CBN, including training of 12000
HEWs and 119 000 VCHWs. By the end of the project, an impressive 80% (24000) of

HEWs were trained in the CBN curriculum (an intermediary indicator of the project),
which was only slightly below the envisioned target of 85%.

The nutrition training package for HEW which the project supported under CBN and
designed initially as stand-alone training (pre-and in-service) and later as part of an
integrated package of training) included: promoting improved caring practices for
children and women to prevent malnutrition (including breastfeeding); provision of
micronutrients, referral linkages to relevant child health and nutrition services, growth
monitoring, and other linkages to address the non-health causes of child malnutrition.

In order to strengthen supervision of CBN moreover, the project funded transport for
supervisors to enable them to make more frequent and timely visits to health posts. And
to strengthen the outreach needs, which was identified as an important need following
transition from VCHW to HDA, the project procured more than 28,750 bicycles and
1,600 motorcycles to provide HEWs with greater mobility and health centers access to
health posts to mitigate reduction in volunteer-provided nutrition services. In addition,
regional nutrition coordinators were recruited to strengthen overall capacity at that level.
Finally, a strong advocacy and communications strategy to support CBN activities was
developed and rolled out to reach areas beyond just the CBN target regions (e.g. for
Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) and exclusive breastfeeding).

Financial and policy level support to facilitate procurement and supply of key
micronutrients contributed to the success of PDO indicators. These activities
significantly benefited both the CBN interventions supported at the community level in
the four target regions (distributed via the HEW and the VCHW and later HDAs), as well
as in other regions across the country. Aside from funding the procurement of key
micronutrients (procurement and distribution of IFA tables to pregnant women), already
the first phase of project implementation saw the adoption of legislation related to salt
iodization (adoption of salt iodization legislation was a dated covenant established by
July 2010), as well as registration of Zinc as an essential drug (another dated covenant
achieved by July 2010) both of which were hailed as a major success towards improving
micronutrient availability at all levels of the health system in Ethiopia. In the second
phase of the project, after restructuring, a number of indicators were added to help
monitor and capture outcomes related to these achievements.

The original indicators which sought an increase in the percentage of households
using iodized salt were not achieved due to the challenges discussed above (and
identified through Bank-financed analytical work) and dropped in 2012. Instead, the
project drew on the success of the adopted salt iodization legislation, and captured in the
indicators after restructuring the percentage of salt that was iodized, which showed
improvements from 0-90% (exceeding the target of 50%). Whilst this is a significant
achievement, the quality of the salt iodization has not been assessed in the absence of
independent survey data. The GOE recognizes quality to be a potential issue, and is
addressing this with various regulatory tools (with support, such as the development of a
Universal Salt Iodization Action plan etc.).

       b) Strengthened Institutional Capacity to Support Delivery of Improved
       Nutritional Services (as per the activities funded in component 2)

The project provided some support towards strengthening national level
coordination on nutrition, although inter-sectoral collaboration remained
problematic. With regards to coordination, during the first phase of implementation,
prior to restructuring, the project reflected success in establishing the national level inter-
sectoral nutrition coordination body. This was a dated covenant achieved in time by July
2009. The NNCB is composed of state ministries of the nine government NNP
implementing sectors, donors, partners, civil society organizations, academia, and the
private sector representatives. It provides policy/strategic decisions related to NNP,
allocates and approves budget for the implementation of NNP, and monitors the
implementation of NNP with key indicators and provides guidance. A National Nutrition
Technical Committee and joint FMOH and MOA technical committees were formed to
deal with technical issues such as reviewing the Health Development Army (HDA)
Agents pre-service and in-service training curriculum on nutrition, and to promote further
coordination at community level between HEWs and DAs.

Whilst the development of this coordination body was an achievement in itself, and the
objective to link the various relevant sectors and their cadres, both in terms of policies as
well as projects at community level, noble, early functioning of this body remained
somewhat challenging as the “how to” of muti-sectoral collaboration between sectors had
been inadequately defined and the Bank-financed NP was focused on the Health sector.
Multi-sectoral linkages to nutrition remained somewhat problematic as a result, and
following extensive advocacy this was ultimately addressed in a revised National
Nutrition Plan (2013-2015) which more clearly identified and spelled out the role of the
coordination body and specific responsibilities of relevant sectors/ministries.

The project made impressive gains in building nation-wide capacity to better
develop, implement and monitor nutrition interventions. Critical achievements of the
project included the training of more than 13,000 health personnel from the health center
level to the federal level in CBN, exceeding the original target of 12,000 set by the
project. In addition, and to address remaining capacity constraints related to procurement
issues, the project trained four regional finance officers and 144 project accountants at
woreda level to strengthen their skills, respectively. Federal accountant training was also
undertaken so that those trained could train woreda accountants, primarily to reduce
delays in processing funds and SOEs. The project also carried out activities originally not
tracked in the results framework, with indicators added after restructuring to better
capture achievements. This included supporting master’s level nutrition training with the
project playing a key role in 80 nutrition masters graduating by project end. In that
regard, the project assisted universities in MPH curriculum revision to make it more
nutrition friendly, and supplied text books to libraries to these universities, and financed
30 MPH candidates selected from the health sector. In addition, critical capacity building
support was provided to strengthen data collection on nutrition at the woreda level and
ensure that this was regularly transmitted to the federal level (working closely with
UNICEF). This had been somewhat of a constraint early on during implementation. At



                                              24
project end, over 80% of woredas were providing monthly nutrition data to the FMOH
(30% more than originally planned), significantly boosting the planning and monitoring
capacity on nutrition across the country.

The project contributed towards further achievements in significantly boosting
research and knowledge generation on nutrition in Ethiopia. Such knowledge is
critical for the evidence based implementation, revision and monitoring of nutrition
interventions. Early on during implementation, a multi-stakeholder consultative
workshop in 2009 identified twelve potential thematic areas for operational research,
later reduced to 6 thematic areas, which helped kick start the operational research topics
to be funded under the project (accompanied by capacity building of the research
institutions (Universities and EHNRI). The process of determining which DP would
finance which study, and the outsourcing of selected studies involving both international
and national applicants, resulted in the Bank resources eventually financing ten studies in
lieu of the eight originally planned. Five of the ten were carried out entirely by EPHI, 5
by Ethiopian Universities, in some instances requiring EPHI direct support to complete
the work.

         c) The Contribution of factors external to the project

The PDO benefited from the government’s contribution and its focus on the Health
Extension Program. The government invested much of its own funding into the
development of the Health Extension Work Program (into which CBN was integrated),



                                                   25
and led the policy development on micronutrients. Government contribution towards the
components of the project covered all aspects related to the HEP and capacity building, in
particular salaries of health extension workers and human resources more generally. The
distribution of insecticide mosquito nets to the community by health extension workers is
often directly linked to improvements in under 5 mortality (Bilal et al, 2012). And the
improvements in maternal mortality is often linked to improved maternal health services.
The percentage of women for example, who received antenatal care increased from 28%
in 2005 to 34% in 2011 and 40% in 2014 (EMDHS, 2014).
Government Programs outside of health are also likely to have contributed towards
observed nutrition outcomes. Despite the challenges of engaging some of the non-
health actors (discussed before) of the state to contribute towards nutrition, some none-
health programs also could have contributed towards the observed nutrition
improvements. Notable programs were the Agricultural Extension Program (which
improved agricultural production in communities), and on the education side the National
School Health and Nutrition Strategy which promoted better nutrition practices (SHN)
(FMOH 2013). The latest 2014 DHS results moreover suggest that overall improvement
in education, for example, is an extremely important determinant of nutrition outcomes.

The PDO, moreover, benefited from parallel investments that impacted nutrition by
donors. The Bank’s SDR 18.8 m funding was always expected to be initial seed money
and spur investments from other donors. Indeed, complementary investments from
partners such as UNICEF, JICA, DFID, WFP, USAID, and CIDA (now DFATD), all
provided different levels of support to the Ethiopian health sector and its nutrition
agenda. In fact, UNICEF in particular was a key partner, which, in collaboration with the
Health Bureaus at all levels, took a leading role in launching the CBN program and in
training and providing supplies. Specifically, UNICEF provided technical assistance to
the FMOH in the areas of masters training, cascading of the training down to the kebele
level and M&E, with special reference to CBN routine data collection and processing.

Bank support linked to the IDA project in the form of a number of grants is also
likely to have contributed towards the achievement of results. One example is the
World Bank JSDF grant from 2009-2013 (US$1.8m), which was implemented as a pilot
in one region of Ethiopia, Tigray, to support the government’s effort in moving the
treatment of child severe acute malnutrition from health centers to health posts, in line
with the health extension worker program. The pilot, which produced guidance through
for example a Capacity Assessment of Health Facility Staff study, and papers on the need
for storage of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) at health posts), as well as training
materials (for health extension workers), led to the shift of therapeutic feeding from the
health center to the health posts (carried out by health extension workers), which is likely
to have contributed towards improvement of key nutrition indicators. Another example is
a US$ 650,000 million Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery funded
initiative (of which just over US$622,000 was disbursed) to support the rapid Social
Response Multi-Donor Trust Fund (RSD MDTF) which during the project duration
supported the improvement of the national nutrition information system and promoted
domestic production of products to treat malnutrition.




                                            26
Finally, on a much broader level, and perhaps contributing towards the impressive
improvements in stunting and underweight, and maternal and child health
outcomes, was Ethiopia’s impressive economic performance. Throughout the first
decade of the new millennium, the government implemented an impressive fiscal policy,
that resulted in an annual growth rate of 11 percent since 2003, and a decline in poverty
from 49.5% in 2004 to 29.2 % in 2010 (FMOH 2013), which likely further helps explain
the broader nutrition and health improvements observed.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: The Efficiency of the Project is rated Substantial both in terms of technical
design, unit ratio and cost benefit ratio, with only limited shortcomings in design and
implementation (mainly fiduciary) taken into account.
The project was characterized by strong technical efficiency. The project supported
community based interventions, coupled with a number of higher level interventions
(including policy change) that are among the most cost-effective interventions to improve
nutrition outcomes, with some of the highest cost-benefit ratios in terms of poverty
reduction and economic development.11 Critical high impact interventions were
implemented at sub-national levels, with community members securing access to those
interventions in a culturally and socially sensitive manner. The provision of transport for
supervisors (bicycles, motorcycles and vehicles procured by the project) to enable them
to make more frequent and timely visits to health posts, was a means to enhance
efficiency of community-based nutrition (CBN) services.
Nutrition activities were integrated into the work of those responsible for the
broader sub-national development, health and nutrition efforts. Existing federal and
regional management structures were utilized, and where expanded, were done with the
objective of keeping staffing at the minimum needed to achieve project objectives.
Taking into account the multi-sectoral nature of nutrition, sectoral partnerships were
fostered at policy and operational levels to strengthen cooperation between health and
agricultural staff, resulting in closer cooperation at reaching target groups in
communities. However, efforts to link projects of health, agriculture, education, water
and sanitation sectors at community level had limited traction, mostly done with small-
scale projects.
Efforts were made to engage the private sector, for example, with respect to policy
discussion and production goals for quality salt iodization, a key nutritional benefit,
following mandatory salt iodization legal covenant (IR indicator #2) . The Bank’s
Economic and Sector Work had estimated the benefits of salt iodization to be more than
80 times the costs, and was ranked as one of the three highest global interventions by the
Copenhagen Convention. The technical design was not sufficient in analyzing the salt
industry, however. While quantitative production targets were reached (at 90%
exceeding the target of 50%), quality assurance of the proper level of salt iodization was


 See Lancet Series Maternal and Child Undernutrition (2008); “Repositioning Nutrition as Central to
11

Development”, World Bank 2006


                                                  27
not. The inclusion of a PDO indicator on household salt iodization in the initial results
framework was based on a superficial understanding of the structure of the salt industry
in Ethiopia, which has both large, but also many small salt producers, the latter who are
very difficult to regulate. 12
A particularly important efficiency measure is the percentage of project funds used
and whether there was a need for an extension of the closing date. Despite an
extension from January 17, 2014 to May 31, 2014, some major end-of-project
procurement items for IFA tablets remained outstanding and unresolved. Out of a total
contract amount of close to US$3m for 18 containers of IFA tablets, the supplier only
managed to ship 12 out of the 18 within the project extension time frame, with
approximately 1/3 of the total IFA quantity (6 containers) cancelled. All in all, at the end
of the project, SDR 17.3 million was actually disbursed, representing 92% of the IDA
committed funds of SDR 18.8 million. In addition, roughly another US$ 2.4million was
disbursed in linked Trust Fund grants.

With regards to the cost benefit assessment, the Project exhibited substantial
positive returns on benefit-cost (B/C) ratio and net present value (NPV), as well as
high economic rate of return. The PAD provided economic and social justifications for
a significant response to under-nutrition in the most affected areas of the country. A
benefit-cost analysis was undertaken prior to appraisal for several nutritional-related
interventions in Ethiopia as part of economic and sector work done by the World Bank. 13
It computed three main types of benefits associated with nutrition interventions, namely:
i) benefits from reducing child and maternal mortality; ii) benefits from increased
economic productivity; and iii) benefits from enhancing child ability. Each of the
interventions selected at appraisal had a benefit-cost ratio above one. The ex-ante
analysis in the PAD cited these main benefits expected from the Project, but it did not
calculate an NPV.
In the ex-post analysis, when monetized benefits for the project (under the form of saved
child and maternal lives and increased lifetime earnings from reduced stunting, anemia,
low birth weight, reduced vitamin A deficiency, and exclusive breastfeeding) are
compared to the costs for the project’s beneficiaries, the benefit to cost ratio was found to
be 4.65. In other words, for every 1$ invested by the project, $4.65 in long term
economic benefits from the project’s nutritional interventions (growth monitoring and
promotion sessions, exclusive breast feeding for children under 6 months, and increasing
utilization of key micronutrients such as vitamin A and iron and folate) can be expected
(see Annex 4). With a 5% discount rate, the net present value of the project was estimated
to be about US$ 80 million. At conventional values for the refinancing and reinvestment



12
   The GOE recognizes this as a constraint and is addressing this with: a) a Universal Salt Iodization Action
Plan; b) an update Iodine Deficiency Disorder communication strategy; c) EPHI will undertake quality
control interventions at the federal level and conducting studies of households using iodized salt.

rates, the project also displayed a large modified internal rate of return (MIRR), namely
38 percent (see Annex 4).
The robustness of the results was tested at a higher social discount rate (10%), for
different estimates of program coverage, different fractions of the benefits attributable to
the Bank project (rather than to projects supported by partner organizations, such as
UNICEF), as well as by providing a range for the size of the impact of different
nutritional interventions on mortality and lifetime earnings suggested by the evidence.
Even under the most conservative assumptions, the values for the B/C ratio and the NPV
were 3, and US$ 44 million, respectively (see Annex 4).
The ex-post overall project B/C ratio is lower than the intervention-specific B/C ratios
cited by the PAD.14 Key contributors to the difference likely include the measurement of
benefits in the ex-post analysis.
Whereas the B/C ratios cited in the ex-ante analysis are for more narrowly targeted
nutrition-related programs, the Ethiopia Nutrition ICRR project was comprised of a
broader package of interventions (possibly interacting with one another), and had a strong
capacity building and strengthening component not present in the programs cited by the
PAD.
The ex-post results may underestimate the real benefit and efficiency of the project for
three reasons. First, even for the baseline benefit cost analysis calculations, conservative
assumptions were chosen when the evidence or project data presented a range. Second,
the analysis did not include the benefits of nutritional interventions that were likely part
of the project, but for which sufficient information to estimate program coverage was not
available. The benefits of programs that provide key micronutrients such as iodine for
pregnant women and children, or zinc and iron for children under two are likely to be
substantial, however, and could possibly even exceed the benefits of the project as
currently measured.15 Third, the analysis did not include benefits that cannot be easily
translated to monetary values, e.g. system efficiency. A program implemented by the
Bank in Ghana, focusing on similar nutritional interventions and also having a strong
institutional strengthening component had a much more similar B/C ratio (2.8) to that of
the Ethiopia Nutrition ICRR.
Although the project benefits considered in the ex-post analysis may not be
comprehensive and may not fairly represent all benefits generated by the project, they do
give a good approximation of some of the benefits that are likely to have occurred. The
results suggest that the monetized benefits greatly exceed the costs of the project,
and that, all else being considered, the Government of Ethiopia and the World Bank
are receiving positive returns on the funds invested in this project.



14
   For instance, the BCR for vitamin A supplementation in Rajkumar et al. (2012) is 12.5 and that for iron
and folate supplementation in pregnant women is 8.1.
15
   For instance, Rajkumar et al. (2012) estimate the benefit-cost ratios of providing iron-folate and zinc to
children between 6 and 24 months of age to be 23.79 and 2.85 respectively, and that of providing iodated
oil to pregnant women and children between 6 and 24 months to be 109.68.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

IDA has been the lead agency for nutrition in Ethiopia over more than a decade and has
demonstrated leadership in the sector by: (a) fostering partnerships that have developed
around the national nutrition program, b) mobilizing and leveraging partner support and
TA for scaling up, and c) strengthening the inter-sectoral platform for collaboration with
other sectors on nutrition.
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

During the project period, Ethiopia experienced a decline in poverty. Although the
overall improved economic performance is likely to have been the biggest factor in this,
the project did prioritize diseases of the poor (malnutrition is widely associated with
poverty) and targeted the most vulnerable - under-5 children and pregnant and lactating
women principally in poor regions with high nutritional insecurity- through the use of
pro-poor community level service delivery channels. Women’s improved access to health
care and nutrition services through the project also contributes to narrowing the gender
gap in health outcomes. Between 2010 and 2013, maternal mortality improved from 500
to 420 deaths per 100,000 population.
The interventions supported under the project and the wider NNP are likely to have
an impact on poverty reduction and social development way into the future.
Nutrition inadequacy can affect the cognitive development in particular of children
(Ezzati et al. 2002; Kabubo-Mariara et al. 2009) with implications for earning potential
and thus poverty in adult life - as captured by various life course approach theories (van
de Mheen et al 1998). Targeting malnutrition early, of the mother and of children under 5
(as done by the project) is important not just from a gender and health stance, but also
from a poverty reduction and development stance.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project has significantly contributed towards institutional strengthening and
capacity building at both the national and sub-national levels, including:
strengthening multisectoral coordination of the national nutrition agenda through the


                                              30
establishment of a national nutrition coordination body, co-chaired by FMOH and
FMOA. EPHI research capacity was strengthened with critical laboratory equipment and
financial management capacity to handle research and evaluation tasks. Health personnel
across all levels were trained in nutrition, and MA level graduates produced with
Nutrition MAs. Within the FMOH, procurement and financial management capacity was
strengthened by funding both training and individuals. At the sub-national woreda level,
Nutrition information/surveillance, monitoring and evaluation was strengthened, as well
as capacity to carry out supervisory activities over service delivery (training supervisors).
Furthermore, the nutrition training of HEW was institutionalized (with training materials
produced), and the Bank team further provided input to the creation of Health
Development Army (to replace the CHWVs) to extend the reach of the HEW into the
community and replace the Volunteer Community Health Workers. All these institutional
strengthening activities signify the ambitions of achieving high levels of sustainability.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Recent evidence suggests that health inequalities among part of the target
population, children under 5, may have actually increased during the project
period. Whilst the project may well have contributed towards overall improvements in
health and nutrition outcomes (a randomized controlled evaluation would have been
useful to generate solid results), and many of the features of the project are positively
associated with being pro-poor16, social determinants of nutrition inequalities were not
analyzed by the project, and the monitoring framework used by the project to analyze
impact, was not developed from an equity perspective as such.
Whilst the health extension worker program (into which the nutrition project was
integrated) is often associated with improvements in maternal and particularly child
health outcomes of the poor (Bilal et al 2011; Admassie et al 2009; Karim et al 2013;
Medhanyie et al 2012), research by Skaftun et al (2014) which assessed changes in
inequality between 2000 and 2011 using DHS data, found that pro-rich and regional
inequalities remained for a majority of health related indicators (albeit not nutrition
related indicators per se). By decomposing concentration indices, the research found that
while overall health outcomes increased between 2000 and 2011, socio economic
inequalities actually increased for under-five and neonatal deaths (albeit no data was
provided on under-nutrition as such).
Despite the unlikely link of the project itself in widening inequality, it is useful to
note that the wider literature on equity in health or nutrition suggests that some of
the interventions supported by the project can lead to an increase in inequalities. A
WB review of 46 recent evaluations on the impact of nutrition projects since 2000 (IEG
2010) found that while a wide range measured a positive impact on maternal and child
nutrition indicators, the review found that in many instances, mothers and children who
are better off disproportionately benefited the most. Evident was that many of these

  Including at community level through the mobilization activities; in the community-based approach that
sought to train community volunteers to mitigate inequities related to poor access to health services; and as
well as in the selection of the most food insecure woredas in the 4 large regions


                                                     31
interventions placed great emphasis on “downstream interventions” at community level
including health promotion and advocacy. The literature says that whilst such
downstream interventions have the potential to bring about overall improvements in
health, they may be less effective at addressing inequities than so called “upstream”
interventions (Franks and Fiscella 2008; Macintyre et al 2006). Whether the downstream
interventions supported under the WB nutrition project will exacerbate inequalities in
nutrition in the longer run, or whether the upstream interventions will help address
inequities, can only be evaluated by a rigorous assessment.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A beneficiary survey was not conducted, but operational research was conducted by
EHNRI to assess the delivery of CBN (prior to the Mid Term Review), which included
qualitative assessments in CBN communities, including both participants and non-
participants, VCHWs, and HEWs. The assessments contributed to subsequent decisions
to conduct operational research on the quality of IRT, the implementation of CBN
following IRT, and on factors contributing to IFA compliance. Initially, annual CBN
review meetings were conducted at regional levels with nutrition stakeholders (with
support from the NP, as well as from UNICEF, and from the RSR trust fund), typically
from within the health sector but also included stakeholders from the Disaster Risk
Management Sector. These review meetings were particularly to improve the quality of
CBN service delivery, to review the data quality and the use of data from CBN, and to
build capacity to use these data for decision making. By the end of the project, as
coverage of CBN increased, these CBN review meetings were integrated into the routine
Regional Health Bureau annual meetings.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: The Risk to Development Outcome is rated as Moderate

There are strong indications that the Government is continuing to seek to improve
capacity to deliver nutrition services to vulnerable populations, integrating nutrition
in other related and complementary programs, and investing in supplies and service
provider support. The Government and its DPs continue to support the NNP which the
government fully owns, and refining the mechanisms, training materials, and modus
operandi of the program. In addition to partner support, the World Bank, through its
support under the PSNP and Health MDG Program for Results, as well as proposed
follow up projects, is complementing those efforts with significant resources bearing on
nutritional status of young children, pregnant and lactating women, and adolescent girls.

The commitment of the government and partners towards the national nutrition
agenda is fuelled by significant analytical work and evidence on nutrition. The trends
in children's nutrition status reflected in the 2014 mini-DHS survey is recognized as
underscoring the worth of nutrition investments. A comprehensive micronutrient survey
to be completed later in 2015 is expected to strengthen the evidence base for nutrition
decision making. This will generate and fuel discussion around nutrition and stimulate
support.


                                            32
On a technical level, one risk is linked to the new community level service delivery
extension model. Despite the extensive HEW presence throughout the country, and
inclusion of nutrition among the 16 HEW health packages, effectiveness of nutrition
interventions reaching the poor will nevertheless depend on how competent the new
Health Development Army cadre is in providing quality nutrition information and
support at community level. In addition, more research is needed to understand the
impact and integration of the nutrition tasks originally assigned to VCHWs onto the
already heavy workload of the HEWs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank team was comprised of staff with a range of skills and knowledge,
operational experience, nutrition technical expertise and country specific
knowledge. The development of the project benefited from the multi-partner
development of the national nutrition agenda in Ethiopia, and effectively capitalized on
the relevant knowledge and lessons learned at the time, as well as research done prior to
project finalization. The Bank team entered into discussions with the relevant
stakeholders at all levels (in particular UNICEF), had a sound relationship with the
FMOH. Overall, the Bank team took advantage of the window of opportunity to support
GOE interest in an ambitious effort, and was an important catalyst in guiding, gaining
attention and incremental resources to the National Nutrition Plan (further supporting
overall development objectives). The Bank moved swiftly and alongside the country
process from identification to development.
At the same time, a QER was not conducted for this project which could have
identified some of the initial shortcomings. A more in-depth analysis of the factors
which could influence the success of PDO objectives, and a more detailed gauge of
quantitative outcomes, would have been desirable, reducing the need for restructuring
after the mid-term review. Overall, the team could have been more aware of the difficulty
in carrying through and measuring some of the selected interventions (in particular the
poor linkage between project activities and the salt iodization PDO indicator), the range
of factors influencing timely provision of key nutrition services, service provider and
supervisory capacity gaps, monitoring and reporting, and could have carried out a more
thorough risk assessment of procurement and financial management capacity constraints,
the latter weaknesses foreseeable with significant repercussions for project performance.
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was supervised during the tenure of two Country Directors and two
Task Team Leaders. During both project execution phases, the task teams used


                                            33
supervisory resources to great effect, including proactively accessing trust funds from
different resources (JSDF, RSR, and a GFDRR). Moreover, there were strong personal
relationships between the FMOH decision makers and the Bank team, which included
familiarity with Ethiopian Government processes, language, and local contexts, and
mutual technical respect.
Through regular supervision missions (often jointly carried out with partners) and
reliance on specialists based in the country office, the team was able to provide
guidance and inputs to the Government, and maintain ongoing dialogue with external
stakeholders. For example, revitalization of the FMOH-led nutrition technical working
group and various sub-groups to work on specific technical issues, led to complementary
evidence-based research and other undertakings supported by the Government and DPs
early on and throughout the project duration.

The task team carried out an important MTR in 2011, where some of the key
bottlenecks to implementation were adequately identified. The interim report at the
time of Mid-Term Review provided information for both NNP revision and project
restructuring, to address a number of technical and capacity related challenges and better
monitoring arrangements, all of which, after following up on these recommendations,
significantly improved implementation and disbursement thereafter.
Following the MTR and restructuring, in 2012, continuous Task Team supervision
and the addition of fiduciary staff meant that there were intensive efforts to expedite
implementation, particularly with respect to procurement. Despite almost daily contacts
and monthly follow-up meetings in the second half of the project, there were procurement
procedural matters which were not resolved in a timely manner, resulting in some IDA
(SDR 1.5 m) not disbursed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

With both quality at entry rated as moderately satisfactory and supervision as
satisfactory, therefore the overall Bank performance rating is moderately satisfactory
(taking into account the overall challenges prevalent, particularly until the MTR).

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government involvement and political commitment to the project was extremely
good during preparations and after approval. Conditions of effectiveness and dated
covenants (including critical policy changes) were met in a timely manner (aside from
FM), and the Government Maternal and Child Health team put in place mechanisms for
technical and management reviews, and undertook significant efforts to speed
procurement and disbursement, and strengthen accountability.
Despite the delay in the initial project advance, the FMOH was proactive in
planning and implementing the project, including designing baseline surveys, key


                                            34
stakeholder workshops, and efforts to put in place the necessary M and E systems. This
commitment and ownership continued throughout the project life, reflected in increased
FMOH staffing at national level, appointment of regional nutrition coordinators in the
four project regions, and their active ownership and involvement.
A major problem which affected implementation across the components was
resolving procurement and FM issues hindering implementation such as the supply of
commodities identified, getting studies underway and completed, and getting financial
reports done in a timely manner. Some of these elements improved in the second phase of
the project, but procurement issues were never completely overcome. On the whole,
however, integration of the project with national strategies and other partner efforts,
development of CBN modules, operational knowledge, and monitoring systems,
contributed significantly to the national response to nutrition for children, pregnant and
lactating women and successful outcomes of the project.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Federal Ministry of Health was charged with coordinating the implementation
of the project (as it was also the lead agency for the National Nutrition Plan). It was
anticipated that the FMOH could engage the services of other agencies with specific
expertise, such as the Emergency Nutrition Coordination Unit for Emergency
Surveillance activities and the Central Statistical Agency for statistics or survey related
activities. While technical support was provided to the FMOH and by extension to PFSA,
a key procurement entity, they continued to struggle with procurement related issues and
delayed completion of procurement packages during implementation. This was the
primary cause for a project extension request, and ultimately did not result in some IFA
procurement before the closing date.
EHNRI (now EPHI) was responsible for the operational studies and the baseline,
midline, and endline. Five of the 10 studies were carried out entirely by EPHI, 5 by
Ethiopian universities, in some instances requiring EPHI direct support to complete the
work. The baseline and midline studies were done; however the endline survey has not
been completed. It was agreed the endline survey would become part of a broader
micronutrient survey financed by the Bank and other DPs. While plans for the survey
were completed well within the anticipated closing date of the project, procurement
constraints beyond the control of EPHI and the FMOH, prevented commencement of the
MN survey. Resolution of the procurement items between EPHI and UNICEF sooner
could have resulted in timely completion of the micronutrient survey and better
assessment of project performance.
At the sub-national level, the project was implemented using existing structures at
level of the community and health centers, as well as woreda and regional
authorities. Performance at woreda level and below benefited from regular review
meetings with Woreda Health Officers, regular supervision from the Bank/government
project team, as well as from the presence of partner organizations (such as UNICEF).



                                            35
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Both government and implementing agency performance is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory, therefore the overall rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Strong Country Ownership and integration of interventions into an existing and wider
multi-sectoral agenda on nutrition and multi-partner investment strategy was key to the
success of the project. The commitment of the Government of Ethiopia to a multi-
sectoral National Nutrition Strategy and National Nutrition Plan (NNP), which it
coordinated and brought DPs into the technical and implementation aspects of the NNP,
meant there was active engagement by the key stakeholders at national level, and
financing from external sources. The project, moreover, representing the first donor
contribution in funding towards the implementation of the national plan, acted as a
catalyst to leverage funding from other sources (both the government and other donors),
particularly for CBN activities. It is important for the lead sector, in this case the Federal
Ministry of Health, to make extra effort to assure active engagement of other donors, and
for the Bank team to encourage this.

The existence of an existing institutionalized community level service delivery model,
quite unique to Ethiopia, was instrumental to the success of the project at the
community level. Ethiopia is one of the few countries globally that has developed a solid,
community level service delivery model through the development of its Health Extension
Program, which relies on Health Extension Workers (trained over a period of one year),
deployed at the health post level, to work closely with community level lay workers to
deliver basic services to the community. Unlike in many other countries, the Health
Extension workers in Ethiopia are fully integrated into the civil service, are remunerated
by the state, and part and parcel of the health service delivery model in Ethiopia. This
project benefited heavily from this existing service delivery model (implemented in the
years prior to the project and supported by various other donors), and the existing
government and donor commitment on nutrition created a perfect entry point for nutrition
support under this project. These existing structures and conditions in place during the
development and implementation thus were fairly unique, and contributed toward success
of the project. Thus, a key lesson is that even with limited funds, a project can achieve
good results when adequately linked to an existing service delivery structure and
leveraging support from partners.

Multi-sectoral coordination on nutrition is difficult, yet critical to the achievement of
the wider nutrition agenda of countries. The role of multiple sectors in addressing
malnutrition was duly recognized in the Ethiopian National Nutrition Strategy of 2008 as
well as the first National Nutrition Program (2008-2013). A national multi-sectoral
coordination body was created under the project, however seemed to have faced
difficulties in generating commitment from other Ministries. The first NNP program was
criticized for falling short of stating specific actions expected from each sector. This,
among others, led to the development of the revised NNP (2013-2015) which listed out


                                             36
roles and responsibilities of relevant ministries/sectors and elicited signatures from each
sector to enhance accountability. Improvements in education for example are a particular
strong determinant of nutrition outcomes. Accordingly, the signatories of the revised
NNP are Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of
Trade, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Ministry of Women, Children and Youth
Affairs, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Water and Energy and Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development. To what extent mutisectoral commitment translates into action
in Ethiopia will have to be closely monitored.

Based on the experience with the Ethiopia project, nutrition project design should
follow a number of best practices: Project design should ensure that it i) is anchored in
appropriate pro-poor, nutrition insecure choices of interventions based on sound technical
priorities fully consistent with global recommendations for scaling up nutrition and its
application to the country situation; ii) is characterized by a strong results chain; iii)
considers analyzing, addressing and tracking determinants of nutrition inequality, taking
into account that some interventions considered pro-poor can sometimes exacerbate
inequality, iv) it recognizes the importance of operational research which can be
instrumental in shaping an overall nutrition agenda, v) anticipates and ensures ability to
mitigate exogenous factors, such as new policies, restructuring or reforms which could
potentially interfere with implementation and the results chain, as well as weak fiduciary
capacity. On the latter, leaving the decision as to who will implement a project to the last
moment (as was done in this project) can be a bottleneck to this. Finally, as with any
project, Bank quality assurance and supervision tools should be utilized as best as
possible: a QER and well executed MTR (and basic restructuring) can be extremely
helpful in minimizing problems during implementation.

Finally, in moving forward, the recognition that nutrition interventions in the health
sector can address just one of the many determinants of improved nutrition outcomes
requires a coordinated effort between the CMU and various GPs (in particular
education, agriculture and health) to carry out joint planning and coordination of
complementary interventions implemented across sectors that can support the
government further improve nutrition outcomes in Ethiopia.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


a. Economic Analysis

The purpose of the Ethiopia Nutrition ICRR Project was to support the Government's
National Nutrition Strategy and Program by promoting critical cost-effective, technically
sound, nutritional interventions to children and women of child-bearing age, including
growth monitoring and promotion sessions, promoting exclusive breast feeding for
children under 6 months, and increasing utilization of key micronutrients such as vitamin
A and iron and folate.

Cost-benefit analysis provides a basis for assessing project efficiency by comparing the
total expected cost of each option against the total expected benefits, and examining
whether the benefits outweigh the costs, and by how much. Cost-benefit analysis,
however, may not capture all aspects of the potential development impact related to a
project because some of them cannot be easily translated to monetary values given
constrains of existing data and methodology, e.g., efficiency improvement and equity
improvement.

In order to assess project efficiency in a comprehensive manner, this economic and
financial analysis therefore both assesses overall project development impact, as well as
undertakes a cost-benefit analysis for the main nutritional-related interventions supported
by the project.

Project Development Impact

The returns to investing in nutrition are very high. Malnutrition slows economic growth
and perpetuates poverty through three main routes---direct losses in productivity from
poor physical status, indirect losses from poor cognitive function and deficits in
schooling, and losses from direct health care costs. An analysis of several countries
indicates that the overall economic costs of malnutrition run to as high as 2 to 3% of the
growth of GDP of developing countries.

The project has contributed to Ethiopia’s development through the following pathways.

First, it contributed to improving child survival and other health outcomes by
decreasing the incidence of stunting, anemia, vitamin A deficiency, and promotion of
exclusive breastfeeding for children under 6 months of age. According to WHO,
malnutrition is the underlying contributing factor in about 45 percent of all child deaths
and this can be prevented through improved nutrition practices.

Second, it generated long-term economic benefits by increasing the size of the active
and productive labor force who can potentially contribute to economic growth and
poverty elimination. With improved nutritional status, more children will survive into
adulthood and the labor force will work more productively as a result of enhanced



                                             41
cognitive development. The most recent empirical estimates of the negative effects of
stunting on worker productivity and adult earnings range from about 10 percent a year to
as high as 20 percent per year.17 Anemia is associated with between 2.5 to 5 percent of
reduction in wages.18 Productivity losses at the individual level are estimated to be more
than 10 percent of life time earnings, which at the macro level can lead to a 2-3 percent
loss in GDP. According to estimates by Rajkumar et al. (2012), Ethiopia was estimated to
lose 3%, and respectively 2.5% of GDP between 2006 and 2016 in the absence of
interventions to remedy stunting and iron deficiency.

Third, the project significantly contributed towards institutional strengthening and
capacity building at both the national and sub-national levels. Although not quantified,
this greatly helps the country’s capacity in making evidence-based decisions and
realizing potential efficiency gains.

Fourth, the project was also associated with other benefits such as prevented
downstream losses from high use of health resources and required extra care for people
with less cognitive development as a result of childhood stunting.

The case for public intervention

Working with the public sector through this project was economically justified because:

The project focused on high impact and cost-effective nutrition interventions which are
a public good (as opposed to a private good), yielding benefits for everyone in society.
Thus, the project enabled a better use of finite resources.

The presence of positive externalities from nutritional investments through the
consumption and/or production of goods and services that would otherwise not have been
consumed. For instance, better nutrition can increase educational attainment, reduce the
spread of contagious diseases, and increase the national productivity as described above.

Addressing market failures such as undeveloped financial markets and informational
asymmetries. Although the private returns of improved nutrition are high, the constraints
imposed by poverty on poor families inhibit them from investing more resources in
children---an investment whose pay-off cannot be seen until 10 or 20 years into the future.
In addition, addressing malnutrition is often hampered by two main types of information
asymmetries: (i) mothers cannot tell when their children are becoming malnourished,
until malnutrition is severe and it might be too late (ii) good nutrition is not intuitive and
providers do not always know what food or feeding practices are best for their children or
for themselves. As a result of these information gaps, even in the absence of income
constraints children’s nutrition does not automatically improve. Given the high economic
benefits and redistributive effects of investing in nutrition, there is thus an argument for
public intervention for families and parents to get the information they need to bridge

these gaps.

Cost-Benefit Analysis

Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic process where costs and benefits of a
program are identified, measured, and compared in monetary terms. By valuing both
costs and benefits in the same monetary terms, they can be directly compared to
determine net economic impact of a program.

The project’s population coverage provides the basis for calculating the economic
benefits arising from the nutrition-related project investments. The benefits estimated for
the CBA analysis include increased lifetime earnings, and are estimated to accrue to three
main groups of beneficiaries: children under 2 and 5 years of age benefiting from reduced
stunting, and from vitamin A deficiency, respectively; children under 6 months of age
benefiting from exclusive breastfeeding; and pregnant women and streams of newborns
benefiting from iron and folate supplementation (and thus from reduced anemia, reduced
maternal mortality, and reduced prevalence of low-birth weight). The benefits arise from
improved access to and utilization of key micronutrients such as vitamin A for children
and iron and folate for pregnant women, as well as from an increased participation in
growth monitoring and promotion sessions, and a focus on priority behaviors such as
exclusive breastfeeding for six months and adequate complementary feeding starting at 6
months with continued breastfeeding for 24 months.

When monetized, the benefits from these services were estimated to exceed the costs,
showing that the project is a sound economic investment. The analysis concludes that, at
a 5% discount rate, the net present value (NPV) of the project investments is estimated at
about US$80 million with a high B/C ratio of 4.6 (See Table A4.1). At conventional
values for the refinancing and reinvestment rates, the project also displayed a large
modified internal rate of return (MIRR), namely 38 percent.19

  The internal rate of return (IRR) for the Ethiopia Nutrition project is also large, exceeding 25. The IRR
calculation, however, implicitly assumes that the IRR is both the cost of financing the project, as well as
that all the benefits from the project can be re-invested at the rate of the IRR, yielding further benefits in the
next period. By contrast, the MIRR adjusts the IRR to account for the difference between re-investment
rate and investment return. Since the benefits from nutrition projects, for instance under the form of health
improvements, may not necessarily be re-investible, or are re-investible typically at a lower rate than the
IRR, the IRR will tend to overstate the true rate of return, and the MIRR will give a better estimate of
project profitability. The MIRR of 38 percent assumes that benefits are re-investible at 5 percent, and that
the refinancing rate is 8 percent (which was Ethiopia’s lending rate in 2008 as measured by the WDI). If
benefits are assumed to not be re-investible, the MIRR for the Ethiopia Nutrition Project at 8% and
respectively a 5% financing rates is 36, and respectively 33 percent.

Methodology and Assumptions of the Cost-Benefit Analysis

The methodology used in this project analysis is the standard World Bank methods for
evaluating projects where investment costs of resources used are compared with the
stream of economic benefits. This is the standard cost-benefit analysis, in which the
stream of benefits and costs are discounted to present values using a discount rate to
represent the opportunity cost of capital in the country. By investing $24.2 million in
nutrition interventions, the country did not have that amount to spend on other programs,
and thus there is an additional opportunity cost that should be recognized in the analysis.
The money spent could have been invested to earn returns. The present value of a dollar
to be received in the future is always less than 100 cents (Rhoads, 1980). In order to
incorporate this concept of time value of money, this CBA analysis uses a 5% discount
rate to convert all monetary values to their equivalent value at the beginning of the
project in 2008. The NPV is then expressed in current millions of US dollars.

Beneficiary population of the project. The incremental beneficiaries of the project are
estimated from project indicator data and include: the number of children participating in
GMP sessions (and benefiting from stunting reductions); the additional (compared to the
baseline) number of children between 6 and 59 months receiving a dose of vitamin A
every six months; the additional number of children under 6 months being exclusively
breastfed; and the additional number of pregnant women receiving iron and folate
supplementation under the project.

Benefits from increased lifetime earnings from reduced stunting. The current evidence
indicates that young children under the age of 24 months who suffer from chronic
malnutrition and are stunted (two or more standard deviations below median international
standard) would earn significantly lower incomes throughout their economically active
lives. Given that stunting is irreversible beyond the age of 2, the prevention of chronic
malnutrition increases the individual’s potential income earning capability relative to
what it would have been had she or he not suffered malnutrition at early childhood.20 For

 children who are stunted before age of 24 months, some catch up may take place, but
 most stunted children will remain stunted throughout adulthood.21 Therefore, benefits of
 reducing chronic malnutrition in the project areas is measured by the increased income
 earning capacity of the persons whose nutritional status was improved by the project. The
 most recent empirical estimates of the negative effects of stunting on worker productivity
 and adult earnings range from about 10% to as high as 20%.22

 The percentage of children stunted showed significant improvement during the project
 period, declining from 51% in 2005, to 44% in 2011 and 40% in 2014. However, some of
 these improvements had already started when the project was first implemented in 2008.
 According to a joint 2012 WB/UNICEF report that attempted to separate the contribution
 to the decline in stunting of the Community Based Nutrition (CBN) program supported
 under the project from that of other factors (including prior trends), the reduction in
 stunting attributable to the project was between by 3 to 5 percentage points each year.23

 Benefits from increased lifetime earnings of lives saved from reduced vitamin A
 deficiency and exclusive breastfeeding. The benefits from increased utilization of key
 micronutrients such as vitamin A are large. According to the current evidence, vitamin A
 supplementation reduces under 5 mortality by 20 to 24 percent. 24 For purposes of the
 cost-benefit analysis, we estimate the benefits using a human capital methodology, where
 benefits include the discounted future income flow received by the proportion of these
 children whose lives are saved through the project investment, as they are expected
 eventually to become part of the economically active population.25

 A similar approach is used in the case of breastfeeding.26 The scientific literature has
 confirmed the extensive nutritional benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for infants less
 than 6 months old. Depending on whether exclusive breastfeeding is timely initiated on
 the first day of birth, the magnitude of its negative impact on under five mortality varies
 from 7.6 to 13 percent.27

 Benefits from lives saved and increased lifetime earnings from iron and folate
 supplementation. According to the evidence, benefits from iron and folate
 supplementation are threefold: increased lifetime earnings stemming from increased
 productivity; reduced maternal mortality; and increased lifetime earnings from reduced

      Human capital methodology is commonly used to estimate economic benefit related to human
   development. Although there are concerns about whether all saved lives will have been employed, it is
   worth noting that children saved through these program investments will enter the labor market in the
   future, when job market prospects might be better given the current growth of the economy in Africa.
   Furthermore, average wages also reflect unemployment, which further lessens this concern.
   26
      Another potential benefit of exclusive breastfeeding is the economic value of the breast milk produced
   by lactating mothers. However, exclusive breastfeeding is also associated with increased nutritional intake
   for the mother, and data was not available for a detailed quantification of the corresponding net benefits.

     prevalence of low birth weight.

     A similar approach to that used to estimate the benefits from stunting is used in the case
     of productivity benefits from reduced anemia. Iron supplementation on anemic adults was
     estimated to increase blue collar labor productivity by 5% and heavy manual labor
     productivity by an additional 12% controlling for other factors.28 Scientific research
     shows that there is at least 1.5% reduction in productivity for each 1% drop in iron status
     below standard.29Among pregnant women, iron and folate supplementation has been
     shown to reduce anemia at term by as much as 66%.30 In addition, the evidence shows
     that the iron and folate supplementation decreases the prevalence of low birth weight by
     13 to 20%, and that low birth weight decreases adult earnings by as much as 7.5%.31
     Evidence from elsewhere (India, Philippines, Nicaragua) indicates that the productivity of
     physical labor declines by 1.4% for every 1% reduction in height.32

     Finally, the evidence shows that iron fortification reduces maternal mortality by 22%, and
     for the purpose of this analysis we estimate these benefits from reduced maternal
     mortality by using a human capital methodology, where benefits include the discounted
     future income flow received by the proportion of these mothers (assumed to be 25 years
     of age) whose lives are saved through the project investment.

     For purposes of the CBA analysis, the following key assumptions were made:
      An earnings premium of roughly 10% (for stunting avoidance), 5% (for anemia
        avoidance), and 7.5 % (for low birth weight avoidance) was applied as the effect of
        increased productivity.
      Future wages are discounted at a relatively high discount rate of 5% per year, after
        adjusting for normal mortality at each year of life. Each year of productive life is
        valued as the real per capita gross domestic product (GDP, estimated to be US$222 in
        2008), remaining constant throughout the benefit accrual period. Following Rajkumar
        et al. (2012), the productive lifespan is defined as lasting from 15 until 53 years of
        age. With this formula, the lifetime income stream of a two year old child is valued at
        US$1,803, and that of a 25 year old mother is valued at $2,918.
      The impact of the nutritional interventions under the project was assumed to be as
        follows:
       o Following Mason and White (2012), 4 percentage points reduction in stunting each
            year beginning in 2009, from a baseline stunting prevalence of 50.5%.
       o 24 % reduction in mortality of children between 1 and 59 months old from reduced
            vitamin A deficiency. As per Ethiopia’s WHO profile, the mortality for children
            between 1 month and 59 months of age was assumed to be 57% of Ethiopia’s
            under 5 infant mortality rate in each year.
       o 7.5% reduction in under five mortality rates each year from exclusive

        decline in the prevalence of low birth weight from iron and folate supplementation.
        Only non-mild anemia (amounting to 45% of anemia cases) was assumed to have
        negative productivity effects. The baseline anemia prevalence among pregnant
        women was assumed to be 28% based on WDI data, and the baseline low birth
        weight prevalence was assumed to be 13.5% based on Rajkumar et al. (2012)

Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis describes the process of establishing the extent to which the outcome
of the cost benefit analysis is sensitive to changes in the values of the input variables. It
involves recalculating the NPV based on changes made to key variables and assumptions.
To verify the robustness of the results, an uncertainty analysis was carried out to test
some key assumptions using different variable values (see Table A4.2).
 Discount rate. The typical discount rate used for health program investments ranges
    from 1.75-to 5%33, and to be conservative the present CBA analysis uses a 5%
    discount rate. However, since recent studies suggest that discounts rates as high as
    10% might be appropriate for investment programs in developing countries, the
    robustness of the results was also tested using a 10% discount rate.
 Statistical uncertainty. To check the robustness of the results to changes in the
    magnitude of the assumed impact of the various nutritional interventions, the analysis
    was also performed on the basis of the 95% confidence interval values for the size of
    the impact provided in a comprehensive review of child and maternal nutritional
    interventions.34 In this review, the effects of iron folate supplementation on maternal
    mortality and that of breastfeeding on under five mortality were statistically
    insignificant (i.e. indistinguishable from a zero effect), so in the sensitivity analysis
    the magnitude of these impacts was assumed to be 0. An analysis was also performed
    assuming the magnitude of the impact of the different nutritional value was equal to
    the lower bound values for all the interventions where these values were available,
    and zero if the effect was statistically insignificant.
 Program coverage. Analyses using alternative measures of program coverage for
    children benefiting from reduced stunting based on the percentage of population with
    access to a basic package of nutrition services or on the basis of funds disbursed
    produced similar results.
 Benefit apportionment. The results were also robust (in the sense of positive returns)
    to apportioning only half of the benefits from stunting and breastfeeding to the Bank

I. BACKGROUND

The National Nutrition Strategy (NNS) (2008-2013) acknowledged that under-nutrition is
a multi-sectoral issue, and highlighted the need for a longer-term approach with equal
weight on food, health and care. Analyses by the World Bank (WB) and others showed
that stunting rates are high among all wealth quintiles. Furthermore, stunting and wasting
rates were similar in both food secure and food insecure woredas This underscored the
need to invest in multi-sectoral approaches to address under-nutrition, including non-food
interventions such as breastfeeding practices; infant feeding and child care practices;
hygiene, water, and sanitation; improved health services; and the status of women in
society. The NNS brought various uncoordinated nutrition programs into one
comprehensive framework.

The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) is committed to accelerating progress in nutrition,
which is reflected in the Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty
(PASDEP) and also in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) 2010/11 – 2014/15,
which has replaced the PASDEP as Ethiopia’s poverty reduction strategy. PASDEP
called for the implementation of the NNS, which led to the design and implementation of
the National Nutrition Program (NNP), officially launched in 2009.

The NNP, particularly through the Health Extension Program (HEP) of the Federal
Ministry of Health (FMoH) has harmonized relevant nutrition interventions targeted to
young children and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). The NNP was intended to
cover five years (2008-2013), but is currently being revised by the GoE to run until 2015
to bring it in line with the GTP, Health Sector Development Program (HSDP), and other
rolling health and development policies. The revised NNP will incorporate two recent
GOE strategies that were formulated in 2011: Strategy for Accelerated Stunting
Reduction and Strategy for Management of Moderate Malnutrition, and will seek to
catalyze multi-sectoral action and increase the focus on maternal nutrition issues.

Project Rationale: Nutrition is multi-sectoral and multidimensional in nature, is
affected by interventions and programs in several agencies and ministries in Ethiopia,
which the NNP seeks to harmonize. The Ethiopia Nutrition Project (NP) is financed by
a grant obtained from IDA and focuses on subset of nutrition activities in support of the
NNP. The total project cost for the five years project life is USD 30 million. The project
was effected in September 2008 but officially launched on June 22, 2009, commencing
with twenty-five woreds.

The NP is in line with the WB’s Ethiopia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which
highlights nutrition as a key element of support, due to its impact on productivity,
human development and health. The NP has been used to leverage support of other
donors for NNP implementation. The success of the NP is expected to lay the
foundation for implementation of the rest of the NNP.




                                            54
Implementation Arrangements

The FMoH is the lead implementing agency, particularly of CBN, which is an integrated
component of HEP. The Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI), an
autonomous agency under FMoH, is responsible for implementation of activities,
including operational research and monitoring and evaluation.
The NNP brought several existing nutrition projects under one framework to increase
coordination and facilitate scale-up. The NNP aligns donor support in nutrition from
several development partners (DPs), including UNICEF, USAID, Irish Aid, JICA, DFID,
CIDA, the Government of Spain, WFP, MI, and the WB. The WB is extending support to
areas that are not covered by others through the NP; therefore, complementing DPs’
support to the NNP.

III. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The community based nutrition (CBN) program activities were identified based on the
first component of the NNP, namely Supporting Service Delivery. At the time, CBN had
several activities within it, including, (i) monthly growth monitoring and promotion
(GMP) of children under-2; (ii) monthly community conversations and discussions on
health issues; (iii) referral linkages to health facility based services; (iv) micronutrient
deficiency control through Vitamin A supplementation and deworming; (v) IFA and
routine nutrition counselling for pregnant and pre-pregnant women; (vi) quarterly
screening for acute malnutrition at Community Health Days (CHDs);

These activities/ interventions were at the time most appropriate to overcome both acute
& chronic under-nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies amongst children under five and
(PLW) mothers. The package of interventions, even currently, are appropriate as these
address the 1000 days period. In addition, the positive aspects of implementation of the
NP was two-fold: a) system strengthening – as it was being implemented using the HEP
platform, it help build capacity/ skills of the HEW, b) this and the community
conversation also improved service coverage and assured sustainability.

During the preparation of the PIM, stakeholders were involved, such as government and
non-governmental organizations. Furthermore the local literature and necessary steps
were taken to identify evidence – based package of interventions described above. To this
end, the PIM was deemed sufficient enough which led to a successful launch. In addition,
the PIM has served as a reference document throughout the project period.

The PDOs and project components, in a way, still fit to the recently launched NNP as
well as the globally recognized 1000 days/ SUN/ 2013 Lancet Nutrition Series. Hence,
the package of interventions, mainly within component one were/ are suitable to Ethiopia.
Furthermore, some activities, such as the CHDs, have been adopted throughout the
country and are now being delivered integrated into the routine service at woreda and
community levels.



                                             55
Some selected indicators from the project were adopted with minor modifications and
included with the HMIS.

Approaches have been changed as strategies, etc. were revised – for example the use of
VCHW was stopped and GMP is being done by HEWs; new objectives/ indicators were
added when deemed necessary – e.g. Training of regional and federal level mid-level
nutrition managers.

The implementation arrangements of both components were reasonable. Community
based nutrition and micronutrient interventions were delivered through the existing
Health system. At community level, the HEP platform was used, as nutrition was one of
the 16 packages of HEWs. This has strengthened the health system as well as the delivery
of nutrition services at community level.

Institutional strengthening – HR deployment at FMOH and RHBs to support NNP has
facilitated the implementation of the NP.

Capacity Building – there have been many in-service and pre-service trainings and
research conducted through the NP. These included CBN training for health workers and
HEWs; training of VCHW (at the beginning); training on M & E and financial
management; and Master’s level training for MOH and RHB staff.

All these have been well incorporated in existing systems and therefore have contributed
to the sustainability of the Nutrition program in Ethiopia.

Achievements of Project Development Objectives

Currently, CBN activities are implemented in 372 woredas. Mothers/caregivers with
children under two years of age are monthly weighed and counseled based on the
children nutritional status by HEWs. In March 2013, a total of 919,409 children were
weighed with an average participation rate of 44.1% and an underweight prevalence of
7%. In March 2014, there was an increase in the number of children weighed (1,144,348)
as well as in the participation rate (49.0%), with a decrease in underweight prevalence
(5%). The program has shown a consistent downward trend in underweight prevalence
over the years in CBN implementing woredas (Figure 1). This was one of the higher level
objectives of the project.

The Research topics supported under the project were selected by policy & strategy
developing institution (FMOH), the research institute (EPHI/ EHNRI) and academia.
Therefore, almost all topics were targeted to address new/ old strategies, on-going
interventions as well as delivery platforms. Hence the research sub-section of the
institutional capacity building component of the NP has contributed to improving our
program(s) and interventions.

Key observations related to Implementation

On procurement

Nutrition supplies and other logistics procurements in Ethiopia have been conducted
through different channels, including both through the government procurement
mechanisms (PFSA) and from the Nutrition development partners especially UNICEF.
The quantification exercise identifies the target groups for nutrition; the type of nutrition
supplies to be forecasted, budget source for each procurement items have been identified
every year. Based on the quantification shipment order has been conducted by dividing
the quantity based on the quarterly needs. During the procurement of the above logistics
specifically related with the project, sometimes there were delays due to many reasons,
such as no objection needed from the Bank; international bidding taking longer than
anticipated, inadequate follow up from the concerned body etc. Due to the delay on
procurement the project in general was not significantly affected(CBN),but there was an
incident on Albendazole procurement delay for one year for one round (2004 EFY)
which resulted in coverage drop to 19 % nationally.

There have been logistic supply delays due to various reasons. The suppliers who want to
participate in the bidding process are required to register with Food Medicine Health
Care Administration and Control Agency (FMHACA). The requirement being this, some
suppliers apply to participate in the bid process without getting registered. The regulation
stipulates that anyone who wants to supply medicine to the country has to registered and
get acceptance by the captioned agency. The registration process also takes some time as
there are number of suppliers waiting to register. As the screening process adds up on the
time already consumed in the process mentioned above it contributes for the delay in the
procurement process. The problem arises further when a supplier does not have agent


                                                                                                                                                                    57
here in Ethiopia, in this case the supplier has to send someone to process the registration.
The absence of an agent for a particular supplier has another delaying effect as well, it
creates a communication barrier. When there is something which has to be done through
agents like issuing warranty it may take some time. The process which is followed by the
Bank also contributes to the delay in the procurement process.

On development of Training materials for CBN

The training materials developed (for CBN plus micronutrient interventions) were well
suited for the targeted group as this enabled effective implementation of the intended
project activities. For this purpose, the materials have been modified and included within
the IRT modules for HEWs in 2012/13, hence ensuring sustainability of use and scale up.

Every two years though IRT all health extension workers were trained on nutrition which
brings major changes on health extension workers to deliver the complete packages of
community based nutrition which includes:

a) Monthly growth monitoring and promotion of under-2 children by Health extension
Workers (HEWs) to assess growth adequacy, provide nutrition education to caregivers
and identify children whose growth is faltering. This growth monitoring is intended to be
a starting point to engage the community in actions that promote child growth, including
optimal breastfeeding and complementary feeding, hand washing, hygiene, sanitation,
appropriate management of sick children, and increased use of other health services as
needed;

b) Monthly community conversations (facilitated by health development army (HDAs
and Health Extension Workers (HEWs)), which use growth monitoring results to
mobilize communities to take actions that support child growth.

c) Referral linkages: Referral of those children with severe underweight to health facility
for further check-up and response as per existing protocols (i.e. therapeutic feeding,
targeted supplementary feeding and/or treatment of health problems).

d) Micronutrient deficiency control: biannual vitamin A supplementation, de-worming,
and quarterly screening for acute malnutrition through community health days.

On Implementation Performance of different actors

The Government of Ethiopia has demonstrated its policy commitment to nutrition by
developing standalone National nutrition strategy (NNS) and its five year National
nutrition program (NNP) in 2008 and relevant guidelines, and incorporated nutrition,
especially stunting into its five year Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). There are
also sectoral strategies and programs which create a good opportunity to mainstream
nutrition into responsible sectors, and put legislations or legal frameworks to enforce
some key nutrition interventions.

Among these the most notable ones are: Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP),
National food security strategy, the National health sector policy and its HSDP, and the
National School Health and Nutrition strategy and its ESDP. Thus, it is the responsibility
of the line ministries or sectors to effectively mainstream the National Nutrition Strategy
and Program in their sectoral policy and programs; and implement the nutrition
interventions/programs which it is mandated in the strategies mentioned above.

The Government of Ethiopia, in collaboration with nutrition development partners, has
shown its commitment to reducing stunting at a faster rate, and signed the commitment
for food and nutrition security at the G8 meeting in 2012. Vital to the attainment of those
plans are the systems and structures to reach communities and households.

Community based service delivery platforms have been made available in health sector to
ensure decentralized and democratized public services. The Health Extension Program
(HEP) that aims at creating healthy environment as well as healthy living in an innovative
community based health care delivery system includes 16 packages where nutrition is one
of them focusing primarily on changing the behavior of the community in child feeding
and care; promotion of growth of children; screening for malnutrition and 6-59 month
children vitamin A supplementation.

The Health Extension Program (HEP) deploys two health extension workers per health
post, who together reach a population of roughly 5,000. To strengthen and accelerate
social and behavioral changes and the overall wellbeing of the population, a community
level Health development army has been established using a “one-to-five network,”
wherein out of every six households one person takes a leading role, functioning as a key
link with both health and agriculture extension workers. Five such leaders comprise a
development team. Each development team looks after 25 to 30 households. This
arrangement is contributing to Ethiopia’s sprint toward the achievement of MDGs as we
approach 2015 (MOH, 2011).

On the Coordination of FMOH of stakeholders

The FMOH, as indicated in the NNS, has been housing and managing the organizational
and management structure of NNP. However, in order to have viable linkages and
harmonization with the relevant sectors, the NNP implementation and coordination
framework has multi-sectoral implementation and coordination arrangements at the
policy and implementation level in all the decentralized administration and service
delivery levels of the country. Thus, the NNP proposes a four-tiered coordination
mechanism that is in line with the decentralized administration structure of the
government; and requires a considerable support of the partners, private sectors and
academia.

A National Nutrition Coordination Body (NNCB) and National Nutrition Technical
Committee (NNTC) were established at the Federal level to ensure effective coordination
and linkages at the national level. There has been established a similar arrangement at the
regional level with some adaptation based on the existing situation of the regions. As the



                                            59
existing woreda and Keble level administrations arrangement are multi-sectoral in nature,
the opportunity will be used to address nutrition with the leadership of the woredas health
office.

During the implementation period of the project at the beginning, NNP coordination
efforts were little due to existing changes within the public sector. In 2011/ 12, both
multi-sectoral coordination and that of Development Partners started taking shape. These
coordination systems have since been getting stronger and stronger as well as effective in
scaling up nutrition interventions. In addition, decentralization to Regional, zonal and
woreda levels has/ is taking place.

Currently, Decision makers and nutrition actors recognize that malnutrition was not
simply a health problem but was also inextricably linked to actions and conditions across
many sectors, including food and agriculture, education, economics, and environment.
They also realized that reducing malnutrition required not only dealing with proximate
causes but with underlying causes as well where the role and responsibility of other
sectors become pretty clear. The institutional and operational environment for working
multi-sectorally seems getting more promising than before. One might argue, then, that
success in working multi-sectorally in nutrition now depends more on creating a vision
and managing innovatively and on changing ways of thinking and acting across a
complex institutional landscape than on not having the basics in terms of human,
financial, technical, or even conceptual resources.

The role of multiple sectors in addressing malnutrition was duly recognized in the
Ethiopian National Nutrition Strategy of 2008 as well as the first National Nutrition
Program (2008-2013). However, the program was criticized for falling short of stating
specific actions expected from each sector. This, among others, led to the development of
the revised NNP (2013-2015) which listed out roles and responsibilities of relevant
ministries/sectors and elicited signatures from each sector to enhance accountability. The
signatories of the revised NNP are Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Ministry of
Agriculture, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Ministry of
Women, Children and Youth Affairs, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Water and Energy
and Ministry of Finance and Economic Development.

There are two nutrition coordination committes at federal level; the national nutrition
coordinating body (NNCB) is the higher NNP decision making body. NNCB is
composed of state ministries of the nine government NNP implementing sectors, donors,
partners, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector representatives.
NNCB provides policy/strategic decision related to NNP, allocate and approve budget for
the implementation of NNP, and monitor the implementation of NNP with key indicator
and provide guidance.

For the year 2006 EFY the NNCB develop TOR, annual work plan and implement the
specified activities accordingly, they meet twice a year and decide and give guidance to
the technical committees. In addition to the NNCB which mainly deals with policy issue,
there is also a National Multi-sectoral Nutrition Technical Committee that operates under



                                            60
the auspices of the NNCB. This committee was established from each sector and
organization of the NNCB. The main responsibilities of the committee are handling the
overall technical work related to the federal level NNP coordination. The technical
committee develops TOR and Annual work plan, conducts capacity building, meets more
than eight times and supports the regional committee establishments.

Similar to the national structure, all regions established RNCB and RNTC committees
after rolling out the program, some of them cascade the coordination to zonal and
woredas levels.

On Key Lessons Learned

It is possible to deliver nutrition interventions (at scale) using front-line HEWs or the
existing system, at community and all levels. This has, indirectly, strengthened the health
system. Moreover, capacity building efforts done at various levels and through-out the
country have impacted on the sustainability of the project activities. Key challenges that
were identified were: Use of volunteers to perform GMP and report data, which might
have resulted in modest attendance rate of GMP sessions in some areas, and Low Multi-
sectoral linkages to nutrition sensitive activities within community.
