                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is an update following a last update on January 3, 2013 and a supervision mission conducted during February 16-22, 2013.

                         The overall progress towards the development objectives is satisfactory. Growth Monitoring and Promotion (GMP) participation rates are 42%, exceeding the target of 40%; 40% of
                         pregnant women received IFA tablets, and 94% of under-5 children received two doses of vitamin A capsules. The Implementation Progress (IP) indicators that already achieved
                         targets and show impressive improvement include: percent of salt iodized at the production site, 80%; number of health staff received MSc in nutrition, 30; and percent of woredas
                         providing monthly GMP data to Federal level, 87.6%. Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) is currently completing baseline survey to roll out CBN in 170 new woredas. Ethiopian Health

                         and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI) and five national universities have signed memorandum of understanding to conduct collaborative operational research in five topics.
                         EHNRI, in collaboration with Development Partners including Center for Disease Control (CDC), finalized the design of the Ethiopia National Micronutrient Survey. This survey will be
                         completed by the end of December 2013, and will provide most recent data for all PDO and IP indicators included in the results framework. FMOH intensified efforts to increase
                         coverage of nutrition commodities and completed the procurement and distribution of Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets, dispersible zinc tablets and Albendazole tablets, worth US$4

                         million, US$0.57 million, and US$0.34 million, respectively. In addition, a special commitment has already been issued for procurement of zinc tablets worth US$2.4 million. A US
                         $0.24 contract has also been awarded for the procurement of Albendazole tablets. Health Extension Workers received training in 238 CBN woredas to increase uptake of the nutrition
                         commodities.

                         The project disbursed 63.5% of the total allocation. An additional 15% of the allocation has been committed to the procurement of bicycles and zinc tablets making the total
                         percentage of disbursement and commitment 78.7%. Another 12%, 2% and 1% will be committed to the procurement of Iron folate and Albendazole tablets and vehicles,
                         respectively, by July 2013. It will increase the total disbursement and commitment to 93% by July 2013. The remaining 7% will be disbursed directly by the Ministry by the end of
                         December 2013 through on-going CBN activities (review meetings, supervision and sensitization) in the four regions. The project is expected to close on time, on January 7, 2014.

                         The JSDF grant piloting Community based Management of Acute Malnutrition (TF 93946), implemented by Concern Worldwide, is scheduled to close on 14-Aug-2013 and it was
                         agreed that the closing date will be extended until 30-June-2014 to compensate for initial delays in project start-up due to long delays in signing the agreement with the Regional
                         Government and to allow for completion of some of the knowledge management products by the project such as IEC/BCC materials and their publication. The grant recipient,
                         Concern Worldwide has sent an official request to the Country Director to extend the project. A restructuring paper to extend the closing date is under preparation by the Bank.
