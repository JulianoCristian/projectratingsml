                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project which was restructured in April 2012 is coming to a close on May 31, 2014. There has been a significant increase in service delivery related to child and maternal care
                         behavior and utilization of key micronutrients. As evidenced by the most recent data, four out of the five project development objective (PDO) indicators, which were modified at mid-
                         term to better link interventions with the PDO, have surpassed their targets namely: (i) percentage of children 0-23 months participating in monthly growth monitoring and promotion
                         (GMP) sessions (42% exceeding the end target of 40%); (ii) percentage of pregnant women receiving iron and folate supplementation (89% exceeding by three times the end target
                         of 25%); (iii) number of people with access to a basic package of community-based nutrition services (CBN) (55,800, 000 exceeding the end target of 44,125,000); and (iv) number of
                         children 6-59 months receiving a dose of vitamin A every 6 months (12,159, 933 exceeding the end target of 11, 300, 000). The fifth PDO indicator, percentage of infants 0-5 months

                         exclusively breast fed, showed last May 2013 a slight increase from 51% (baseline) to 52% based on the last DHS data (EDHS 2011); the updated status on this indicator, not yet
                         available, is awaiting compilation of the data from the currently underway mini DHS survey which is expected in August/September 2014. Similarly, all Intermediate Results indicators
                         showed satisfactory progress towards the planned targets.

                         Although disbursement of the IDA grant (83% rate) has not significantly increased since the last ISR, 13% of project funds that are currently under special commitment will be fully
                         disbursed within one month from the project closing date bringing the total disbursement to 96%. An additional 4% will also be disbursed by the end of June 2014 through the
                         delivery of vehicles that are currently under shopping, payment of incidental costs of delivering IFA tablets, vehicles and Albendazole, and settlement of outstanding balances by
                         regions. This will bring the total disbursement to about 100% (barring any foreign exchange variances).

                         The JSDF grant, piloting Community based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) (TF 93946) implemented by Concern Worldwide, closed on January 7, 2014. Despite
                         challenges, much progress has been seen in the intervention woredas in Tigrey region. When the intervention started, the control woredas had 1.3 to 1.5 times higher Community-
                         based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) coverage than the two intervention woredas. After two years, the trend has been reversed and the intervention woredas at this
                         time have 1.5 to 2 times better CMAM coverage than the control woreda. Hence, Concernâ€™s activities in the intervention woredas have helped to improve accessibility and utilization
                         of CMAM services. It also contributed to Health Extension Worker (HEW) and community capacity development to manage severe to moderate acute malnutrition. The project
                         disbursed 100% of the grant amount.

                         Final Reporting: The Bank's initial mission for the Project Implementation Completion Results Report was conducted from May 6-12, 2014 and an initial complete draft is expected by
                         the end of July 2014.
