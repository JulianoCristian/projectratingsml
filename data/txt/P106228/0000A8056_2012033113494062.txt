                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following the project's mid-term review (MTR) in November 2011, progress towards the achievement of the project development objective remains satisfactory.
                         Component 1: First, Community Based Nutrition (CBN) activities, currently undertaken in 238 woredas, are being rolled out in a further 115 woredas during 2012. Second, an
                         assessment of the impact of CBN through analysis of the routine monitoring data from 93 woredas suggests a significant reduction in underweight among children under-2 who
                         participate in CBN. Averaging the 4 CBN intervention regions, the change is from about 30% in Jan 2009 to 20% in March 2011, transcending the positive improvement across the
                         country that was reported by the Demographic and Health Surveys 2005 (31%) and 2011 (26%). Third, master training for the new Integrated Refresher Training (IRT) has been
                         completed with training for Health Extension Workers (HEWs) on Module II, which includes nutrition, currently being rolled out in CBN woredas. Fourth, 100% of the children aged 2-5

                         years old are currently being dewormed, which will be maintained in CBN woredas through the supply of already procured deworming tablets. Fifth, iron-folate tablets and associated
                         education materials have been distributed to all health posts in CBN woredas, targeted to pregnant and lactating mothers. Finally, the first batch of dispersible zinc tablets (270,000
                         packs, 10x10 units) is also being distributed to selected health posts with the second batch of 536,000 packs being shipped.

                         Component 2: First, the recruitment of the four Regional Nutrition coordinators has improved the government ownership, supervision and coordination of nutrition activities at all
                         levels. Nutrition capacity at regional and district levels will be strengthened further upon graduation of the thirty health-sector staff pursuing a Masters in Applied Community Nutrition
                         at Gondar University, financed by the nutrition project. Second, the Ethiopian Heath and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI), through a committee of international experts, reviewed
                         the Expressions of Interest for five operational research studies with full proposals now being developed by selected organizations. Outcomes of these studies are expected to be
                         available by end of 2012. Third, EHNRI has completed a qualitative study, the results of which formed part of the mid-term evaluation of CBN. Furthermore, they have completed the
                         fieldwork of the national food consumption survey and the preliminary findings were shared at a food fortification workshop held in Addis Ababa on February 7-8, 2012. Laboratory
                         equipment for EHNRI and nutrition textbooks for universities will be delivered shortly.
