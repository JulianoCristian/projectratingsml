The project focuses on core institution building\n            activities that include the financing of equipment and\n            technical assistance. Its four components are: 1) the\n            standards enquiry point; 2) standards harmonization; 3)\n            certification and accreditation; and 4) a project\n            preparation and implementation unit (PPIU)."}, "docdt": "1995-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
