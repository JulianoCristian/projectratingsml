A new paragraph (b) is added to Section 1.02, and the remaining paragraphs are

acting in accordance with its Charter.”

with due diligence and efficiency 
and in conformity with 
appropriate administrative and financial 
practices, and shall 
provide, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, 
services and 
other resources required for the Project.
(b) Until completion of the Project, the Borrower shall 
maintain Interstandard, a Project Preparation and Implementation 
Unit (PPIU),
