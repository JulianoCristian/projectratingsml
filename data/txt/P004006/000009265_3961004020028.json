The project will lead to improved rural\n            access to the main economic centers in the largely\n            agriculture dependent kabupatens in Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara,\n            and Irian Jaya that are among the poorest provinces of\n            Indonesia. The project includes the following main\n            components: (a) a road network improvement component,\n            subdivided into three subcomponents: (i) road works and\n            supervision for the maintenance of an increasing share of\n            the maintainable part of the kabupaten road network as well\n            as rehabilitation of selected roads in project kabupatens\n            over three years starting in 1993/94; (ii) workshops and\n            laboratories upgrading and equipping; (iii) provision of\n            equipment, spare parts and supplies; (b) a training\n            component, including development and implementation of\n            priority parts of a nationwide training program for\n            kabupaten road staff; and (c) technical assistance and\n            studies for strengthening systems and procedures for\n            planning, environmental analysis, adaption and dissemination\n            of better road works technologies, and for helping GOI\n            agencies in the implementation and monitoring of the project."}, "docdt": "1993-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
