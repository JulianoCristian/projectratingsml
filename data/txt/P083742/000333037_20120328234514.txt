                AND INFORMATION (FEATI)

                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER

   A. SUMMARY

1. The proposed restructuring of FEATI responds to recommendations made by the Mid-Term
Review mission (March 2010) followed by two supervision missions, the last of which was
conducted in September/October 2011. A formal request for restructuring was received from the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) on October 25, 2010, followed by a request from the Ministry
of Finance on August 2011 and submission by the Ministry of Agriculture to the Bank of a
satisfactory financing and action plans to support the project’s extension. The restructuring is
intended to reflect the necessary changes during implementation, harmonize the various
documentations compared to the original PAD, and simplify procedures. These would help
accelerate implementation and disbursement, improve project performance and achieve the
project development objectives. This is a second order restructuring and the major modifications
being proposed are: (a) revision of the design of farmer-managed grants (FMA) related activities
under Component 1 to simplify the implementation procedures; (b) cancellation of selected
activities under Component 2 and 5; (c) decrease in the number of participating districts from 71
to 68 (as a result of 3 districts being dropped), and the number of participating villages from
3,230 to 3,060; (d) modification of Key Performance Indicators and Results Framework; (e) a six
months extension of the closing date from June 30th 2012 to December 31st 2012.

   B. PROJECT STATUS

2. FEATI was approved in February 13, 2007, declared effective in June 28, 2007 and its
implementation began in early November 2007. It’s financed by IDA credit of XDR 39.9 million
(equivalent to USD 61.34 million) and IBRD loan of USD 32.8 million. As of May 30th, 2011,
about USD 64.29 million out of the total Bank financing of USD 94.14 million equivalent has
been disbursed (68%).

3. Overall, the project implementation progress is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
implementation of the Farmer-Managed Activities (FMAs) under component 1, in spite of the
achievements in terms of the implementation of village-level FMA, has not been able to make
progress towards their scaling-up at the district and provincial level. Partly, this has been caused
by delays in issuing the revised guidelines incorporating the orientation toward agribusiness and
by budget constraints during the previous years of implementation. The challenges include
making extension and R&D institutions more efficient and relevant for farmers, creating effective
linkages with the private sector and supporting the development of agro-enterprises. The project
is now making progress towards seeking a reorientation of FMAs to facilitate partnerships with
agribusinesses. The institutional strengthening and capacity building of extension services
(component 2) has progressed satisfactorily as well as the strengthening of the research-extension
linkages (component 3). Regarding knowledge and information services (component 4), the
project has finally made good progress in operationalizing the e-Petani platform. Overall project
management has been marginally unsatisfactory, although it has recently become more
responsive in addressing the project gaps, including the M&E system whose status has been
assessed as unsatisfactory. The National Center for Agricultural Education and Development
(NCAED of AAEHRD) has agreed to monitor the progress of FMA implementation regularly
using the data submitted to CPMU to ensure that the FMA is properly managed. The Bank has
received from the CPMU an action plan to complete the project and from Ministry of Finance a
                                                 4
request to extend the project closing date by one year. The Bank has reviewed the action plan and
has found it supportive of the goal of increasing the project’s chances to achieve its PDO. The
Team recommends extending the project closing date by six months, from June 30 th 2012 to
December 31st 2012.


   C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Results framework and performance indicators

4. The key performance indicators are proposed to be fine-tuned so that the relevant outcomes are
more measurable and can be directly attributable to the project interventions. These changes
include a) revision of target values of two PDO level indicators - to be measured in absolute
values, not in percentage terms, and b) revision in the definition and elimination of some
intermediate outcome indicators and inclusion of new ones. A new project development outcome
indicator - number and types of services provided to FO members – shown in the legal documents
but absent from the main text of the PAD - has been added with minor modifications to the
Results Framework. Nested indicators are separated into single indicators to make reporting on
their progress clearer. These changes are intended to improve the overall clarity of the Results
Framework, to better focus it on the key outcomes that the project intends to cause and to sharpen
the correlation between outcomes and project implementation. The revised Results Framework
can be found in Annex 1.

Components

5. The changes to components are summarized below, which do not have substantive implications
to the PDO.

6. Component 1: Strengthening Farmer-Driven Extension: While the overall objective of this
component remains unchanged, the design of the activities specified in sub-component (ii) –
Farmer-Managed Grants (FMA) – has been revised to facilitate the scaling up of FMAs at the
district and provincial levels to accelerate implementation. The revised guidelines for the
implementation of the scaled-up FMAs (2010 version) are being updated by the CPMU for
submission to the Bank for clearance. Accordingly, the District Project Implementation Units
(DPIUs), will establish District and Provincial Farmer Organization Forums (replacing the
District and Provincial Agribusiness Councils defined in Annex 16 of the PAD) to select the
FMA proposals submitted by district farmer organizations. Similarly, at provincial level, the
PPMUs will establish Provincial Farmer Organization Forum to select the FMA proposals
submitted by provincial farmer organizations. No amendments are required to the legal
agreements as a result of the proposed changes in Component 1.

7. Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building: Three activities under
sub-component (iii) Strengthening agri-business training centers (ATCs) and Agricultural In-
Service Institutes (AISIs) will be cancelled since they have been deemed not to be a priority by
AAEHRD since the MTR in 2010. They include: (i) the development of a strategic framework for
the overall functioning and mandate of AISIs; (ii) conduct of feasibility study to strengthen
capacity and improve training programs of agribusiness training centers; and (iii) developing an
agribusiness data base. The relevant funds will be reallocated to improve the capacity and skills
of extension managers and of field extension staff and to finalize the civil works undertaken to
construct and rehabilitate Agricultural Extension Offices at sub-district level under Components
B1 and B2, respectively. No amendments are required to the legal agreements as a result of the
proposed changes in Component 2.
                                                5
8. Component 5: Extension Policy and Management Support: Sub-component 5.1 (Policy
Support to assist the implementation of the new Extension Law) will be cancelled, following the
agreement reached at the MTR in 2010. Activities under this sub-component have been
implemented only to a limited extent during the first two years of the project and had been found
not relevant anymore at the time of the MTR. Consequently the intermediate result indicator 5.1
has been dropped from the project’s Results Framework.

Financing

9. Due to the actual spending between components, the proposed reallocation by component
and/or activity is shown in the summary table. This table replaces annex 5 of the PAD. The
detailed costs by Bank financing and GOI financing are indicated in Annex 2.

Project Costs

10. There are no changes to the total project costs or to the total costs of each component and
subcomponent.

Financing Plan

11. No changes are proposed with regard to the overall project Financing Plan. See Annex 2 for a
more detailed breakdown of the financing plan.

Financing Plan: (US$’000)
      Sources                  Total                  Percent

Reallocations

12. Part of the project budget originally allocated to component 3 (Enhancing Technology
Assessment and Dissemination) and component 4 (Provision of Knowledge and Information
Services) and part of the unallocated budget will be reallocated to finance training, workshops,
goods and incremental operating costs to strengthen the capacity and skills of extension staff and
local officers and improve extension facilities and services. Components 3 and 4 have progressed
well and are expected to reach their objectives with less resources of what originally planned.
While there is scope to further progress in component 2 (Institutional Strengthening and Capacity
Building), allocating additional funds to component 1 (Strengthening Farmer-Driven Extension)
is unlikely to bring additional benefits mainly due to absorption difficulties given the limited time
horizon left to the project and the challenges of the FMA scaling up, which are eminently of
management and planning nature.

Financial Management

13. The Financial Management Manual has been revised based on the MTR findings, which has
been submitted to the Bank and found acceptable to the Bank.

14. The FY 2010 audit report of FEATI was received timely and the auditor provided unqualified
opinion. Request for follow up action was sent to the CPMU, whose response was received on
February 29, 2012. The FY 2011 audit report is due for submission to the Bank by June 30, 2012.

Procurement

15. An updated procurement plan including updated cost estimates and time schedules has been
submitted to the Bank following the MTR of March 2010. The updated procurement plan has
been found acceptable to the Bank

Extension of the Project Closing Date

16. As mentioned above, there was an implementation delay during the initial phase of the
project. Thus government and the implementing agency have proposed in August 2011 a one year
extension of the project closing date from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to complete the
remaining activities. The processing of this request has been made conditional by the Bank team
on the submission from the Ministry of Agriculture of a budget and action plan that would be
consistent with the requested extension and supportive of increasing the likelihood of achieving
the project’s Project Development Objective. The Ministry of Agriculture has submitted the
requested budget and action plan on January 17, 2012 and further clarifications have been
received on February 9, 2012. The Bank team has reviewed the budget and action plan and finds
it acceptable. It ensures the provision of sufficient counterpart funding to support project
implementation. Implementation of the action plan will increase the project’s likelihood of
achieving the PDO and of completing the remaining activities by the revised closing date.

Implementation Schedule

17. Based on the restructuring plan and the proposed extension, a revised implementation
schedule has been submitted to the Bank. It includes the latest cost estimate, start/finish dates,
Bank financing estimates and counterpart financing estimates. The Bank has reviewed it and finds
it acceptable.

Geographic coverage

18. The number of districts is now 68 (original 71) and the participating villages will
consequently be reduced from 3,230 to 3,060. The dropped districts are Gowa and Enrekang (in
the province of S. Sulawesi) and Tapanuli Selatan in the province of N. Sumatra. These districts
were dropped due to the failure of the district governments in meeting the criteria for
participating in the project. However it is not expected that this will affect the achievement of the
PDO.

       D. Appraisal Summary

19. There are no changes in the economic and financial analyses, technical, social, environment,
or exceptions to Bank Policy from the original Appraisal Summary of the PAD.
