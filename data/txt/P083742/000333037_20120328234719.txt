7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall development objective of the project is to develop a demand-driven, market oriented
agricultural services system, based on partnerships between farmer groups, public agencies and private
sector enterprises at all levels. The outcome of increased accountability and effectiveness of public service
provision in support of diversified farmer incomes would be achieved through: Emphasis on improved
governance of the process for award of grants for activities by farmer groups to ensure that the process of
prioritization at village, district and provincial levels is farmer driven and agro-ecologically relevant whilst
the institutional capacity of extension and research services are strengthened to provide necessary support
services to farmers organizations. Emphasis on making larger partnerships work in practice through:
district and provincial level funds to scale up successful village-level farmer-managed grants for extension
activities (FMAs), and implement supporting district and provincial planning and technical support
activities.
