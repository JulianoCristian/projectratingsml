1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Sector Background: Agriculture is the main source of income for the vast majority of
poor rural households in Indonesia. At the time of the preparation of the FEATI Project it
employed 45% of the total labor force and contributed to 17% of growth in GDP. With an
average annual rate of growth of 3.6%, the sector performance in 2006-09 was relatively
satisfactory. Rice continued to represent a major staple crop and receive a substantial share of the
budget spent on agriculture. Nevertheless, the structure of agriculture has been transforming
rapidly with the number of farmers engaged in horticulture nearly doubling to 38% between 1996
and 2002. At the same time, export cash-crops such as cocoa and oil palm were rapidly expanding.
A slowdown in agricultural productivity growth had been observed since the mid ‘90s, driven
mainly by the limited budget allocated to extension and R&D. Only 0.3% of agricultural GDP
was on average invested in R&D, one of the lowest efforts in Asia. Furthermore, the Indonesian
agricultural R&D system was highly fragmented as linkages with international R&D agencies and
local universities and private centers were minimal. The extension system had also entered in a
period of declining effectiveness as a result of declining budget and the decentralization of
services to local governments, who had become responsible for staff recruitment, training, and
funding.

In view of such trends, the revitalization of the agricultural sector ( Revitalisasi Pertanian,
Perikanan dan Kehutanan, or RPPK) became a high a priority for the GOI. The RPPK
emphasized the development of human resources and the empowerment of farmers. This was to
be achieved, among other, through the development of extension service capacity and improved
service delivery; improved access to information; increased investment in long-term
technological research; and stronger linkages between R&E and extension.
The enactment of Law 16 2006 reforming the system of extension in the agricultural, forestry and
fisheries sector was important in creating an enabling policy framework for the Project. The
complementary role of private extension agents was recognized. The participatory process in the
prioritization of extension planning at the district and provincial level was supported through the
creation of the District and Provincial Extension Committees (DEC and PEC, respectively). The
inter-ministerial decree with the related implementing rules and regulations has not been
promulgated yet.

1.1.2 Rationale for Bank Assistance: The Bank’s engagement in Indonesia’s research and
extension sector has been quite extensive and it included two Agricultural Management Projects
(ARMP and ARMP II, 1995-2002), both of which focused on institutional and management
reforms to improve research towards a demand-driven and “farmer first” strategy; and the
Decentralized Agricultural and Forestry Extension Project (DAFEP, 2000-05), which had piloted
a shift from top-down to participatory approaches, consistent with the institutional shift from
centrally managed to decentralized extension services and supportive of the reform promoted
through Law 16, 2006. The key innovation introduced by DAFEP consisted in broadening the
sources of technical providers that farmers could access, mainly at the village level. FEATI
offered the opportunity to scale-up the access to technical services at the district level.
Furthermore, the Project would also broaden the access to marketing services for the development
of small scale agro-enterprises. The Bank could count on its global expertise in the extension
sector and its consistent support to participatory and inclusive approaches.



                                                 1
FEATI supported the CAS FY 2004-2007 in three key areas: (i) Improving the Investment
Climate; (ii) Making Service delivery Responsive to the Needs of the Poor; (iii) Improving
Governance. The Project’s focus was in fact on improving the delivery of extension and research
services at the district and provincial level. Through the establishment of competitive learning
grants (i.e. FMA grants), FEATI supported increased accountability and effectiveness of public
provision of extension and research services. Governance would be strengthened by making FOs
capable and responsible for the use of the FMA grants provided under the Project and by
strengthening in a transparent manner their linkages with private providers of extension and
research services.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The Development Objective of the Project is to develop a demand-driven, market-oriented
agricultural services system, based on partnerships between farmer groups, public agencies and
private sector enterprises at all levels.
The Project's original key performance indicators were: (i) the number and types of services
provided to FO members (to be assessed through beneficiary surveys); (ii) percentage of
members of participating FOs with improved household expenditure rates (to be assessed through
beneficiary surveys); (iii) number of technology packages developed by AIATs that are used in
FMAs; (iv) number of farmers benefiting from e-Petani and other information and
communication technology (ICT) services (to be assessed through beneficiary surveys); (v)
increased skills and capacity of farmer organizations and agribusiness development (measured by
number of joint activities/ventures).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised.

Following the Mid-Term Review (2010), a number of PDO and intermediate level indicators
were revised, but did not formally become effective until approval of the restructuring in March
2012. The details of dropped, revised, and new indicators are shown in the matrix at the end of
Annex 2. Key changes to the formally designated KPIs included:

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the extension and research components were identified as an estimated
380,000 households of the members of Farmer Organizations, who directly benefited from the
FMA grants. Indirect beneficiaries were assumed to include those farm households whose
members would learn from the direct project beneficiaries. Altogether, it was assumed that the
Project would benefit about 760,000 households (equivalent to 3.8 million people). FMA grants
were expected to be allocated to around 19,000 FOs in around 3,200 villages (assuming on
average 6 benefiting FOs per village and 20 members per FO) across 18 provinces. As discussed
below, the adoption by MOA of the one-village-one-product policy limited the number of FOs
receiving the FMA grants. The policy, limited the number of FOS that could compete for the
FMA grants to those cultivating the crop supported by the application of the policy at the village
level.

1.5 Original Components

The original project components were described in the PAD, as follows:

Component 1: Strengthening Farmer-driven Extension Services (USD 40.3 million). This
component was intended to empower farmers to drive the agricultural extension agenda and to
improve their capacity to: (a) adopt new technology to better respond to market demand; (b)
develop agribusiness management skills; and (c) engage in public-private partnerships (PPP) at
the village, district, and provincial levels. Those outcomes would be achieved by: (i)
strengthening farmer capacity to become organized and accountable at all levels; (ii) facilitate
productive public private partnerships with multiple service providers through the FMA grants;
and (iii) develop public and private extension capacity to facilitate farmers’ access to technology,
markets, and knowledge. Activities included organizational support, monitoring and training of
producer organizations’ leaders and members, at village, district, and national/regional levels.
Personnel from extension, research, and private sector would also be trained to help them work
with producer groups and their leaders.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (USD 33.7 million): This
component was intended to facilitate the development of a demand-driven sustainable extension
system, with public and private extension service providers (including farmers) cooperating with
farmer groups and private enterprises for the mutual benefit of all parties. This would be achieved
through the training of extension worker, the improvement of extension facilities at the sub-
district level (BPPs), and the strengthening of the Agricultural Training Centers (ATCs) and
Agricultural In-Service Institutes (AIS) to make them more responsive to farmers’ needs.

Component 3: Enhancing Technology Assessment and Dissemination (USD 9.6 million): This
component was intended to facilitate an uptake in the usage of farmer and market demand-driven
technologies and to improve the capacities of the Assessment Institutes of Agricultural
Technology (AIATs) to enable them to function more effectively. This would be achieved
through the formulation of an innovative program to upgrade the AIATs (human resource
development, facilities, and mobility improvement) and by improving research quality and
relevance through more effective linkages between private sector, NGOs, universities, farmer
partners, and traditional extension services. Improved coordination between the AIATs would be
supported strengthening the coordinating agency ICATAD. Provision of management and
implementation support for this component under ICATAD’s responsibility was also included.


                                                 3
Component 4: Provision of Knowledge and Information Services (USD 3.0 million): This
component was intended to address the issue of the lack of access to knowledge related to
agricultural technologies and the lack of linkages amongst service providers and between service
providers and the user community (farmers, traders, and entrepreneurs). FEATI would strengthen:
(i) a web-based Advice Online application (e-Petani) for individualized technical and market
assistance, which would be queried by users through SMS on their mobile phones and GPRS
devices; (ii) local commodity price and market information; (iii) a portal providing buyer-seller
matching. The activities supported under this component included training, enabling the posting
of project information on-line, including details on the process of award and implementation of
the FMA grants, experiment, and the implementation of the project’s M&E system. Provision of
management and implementation support for this component under CADI’s responsibility was
also included.

Component 5: Extension Policy and Project Management Support (USD 24.2 million): This
component was intended to support the drafting of the implementing rules and regulations of the
proposed Law on decentralized agricultural systems through multiple service providers. Provision
of management and implementation support for the Project was also included in this component.

1.6 Revised Components

As requested by the Borrower in a letter dated January 5, 2011, after the mid-term, the main

The revised main activities formally became effective on March 27, 2012, though for practical
purposes the dropped activities had already been discontinued more than a year earlier.

1.7 Other significant changes

In addition to changes to key performance indicators and main activities, as indicated in section
1.2 and 1.5, the Project revised the EOP target for some key performance indicators and
intermediate outcome indicators, as indicated in the Data Sheet as part of the first restructuring
(second-order). The Project was also extended twice for a total of one year through the first and
second restructuring (the latter, also of second order). Finally a total of $4 million was cancelled
upon request of the GOI with the third restructuring (also, second order).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Soundness of the Background Analysis: Substantial field work was conducted at the
initial stages of project preparation, mainly through focus group discussions with farmer
communities and other stakeholders. Although ideally the results of this background analysis
should have been made available at an earlier stage of the Project's preparation, substantial inputs
could be drawn from the experience developed through the satisfactory implementation of the
DAFEP, ARMP, and ARMP II Projects. Besides DAFEP, the design of the mechanisms
regulating the use of the learning grants by the beneficiary FOs could also draw from the
experience developed through the PNPM program, where community organizations could
procure directly services and goods responding to their development needs.

FEATI’s support to the development of small scale agro-enterprises managed by farmer
organizations (FOs) through the scaling-up of the FMAs to the district and provincial level
represented a discontinuity with respect to DAFEP. Under DAFEP the FMAs were at the village
level and mainly focused on technology transfer for productivity improvement. In designing
FMA to better respond to the challenge of developing agro-enterprises the Bank could have relied
more explicitly on its global experience in projects supporting the development of small scale
agro-enterprises in partnership with the private sector. This would have allowed better
appreciating the constraints that the design of the FMA grants under FEATI represented for those
FOs wishing to expand the scale of their business activities. The grants in fact had to be annually
planned and disbursed and were earmarked exclusively for learning activities rather than for the
purchase of productive assets to be owned by the FOs. Finally, their disbursement was not
conditioned to the submission of a thoroughly elaborated business plan that could be developed
over a period of time covering for instance three or more years.

2.1.2   Assessment of the Project Design:

Project Development Objective

In its formulation, the PDO addressed an important developmental constraint in the area of food
security and inclusive growth that clearly corresponded to the borrower’s relevant sectoral
priorities as confirmed by the President’s RPKK and the promulgation of Law n. 16, 2006. It was
also consistent with CAS’s objectives (see section 1.1.2 above) in its effort to improve
governance, accountability, and service delivery to the poor. Nonetheless, the PDO was ambitious


                                                  5
given its focus on transforming the broader system of agricultural services rather than on
changing behavioral outcomes of a set of well identified beneficiaries.

Only a subset of the Project’s components strictly aimed at producing impacts at the systemic
level (i.e. beyond the targeted beneficiaries and/or the scope of targeted districts). These included
component 2.iii (strengthening ATCs and AISs: $1.2 million); component 3.iii (coordination and
management support of ICATAD: $1.7 million); and component 5.i (policy support: $0.1
million), for a total investment of $3 million, or 2.5% of the overall investment effort. The
remaining effort was directed to well-identified villages, district extension services, and
provincial AIATs. The Project’s objective was therefore to develop the processes and the capacity
of the public sector to provide extension and research services and assist Farmer Organizations in
their effort to commercialize, ultimately leading to a paradigm shift that could be translated into a
policy reform and mainstreamed programs.

Project components

Component 1 (strengthening farmer-driven extension) had a prominent role in the Project’s
objective to support the development of agribusiness partnerships with the private sector and the
adoption of agricultural technologies through farmer-driven and participatory approaches in
extension and research service delivery. The FMA grants ($24.8 million) represented 61% of the
component’s investment effort and amounted on average to nearly $8,300 per targeted village
over the five year implementation period or $137 per beneficiary farm (assuming 180,000
beneficiary farms). This amount seemed reasonable to support FMAs focusing on learning
activities. The development of village-level agro-enterprises, let alone their scaled-up versions at
the district and provincial level, could not be reasonably supported with that level of funding;
loans or a contribution from a private sector counterpart would have been required. With the aim
of developing agribusiness farmer managed agro-enterprises and improving FMA proposal
selectivity, the design of the FMA grants could have included as a condition for disbursement a
requirement to prove the availability of counterpart funding in the form of a loan approved by a
bank or a contribution from a private partner. In the absence of such type of restrictions,
incentives would have favored FMAs focusing mainly on technology adoption, particularly in
consideration of the fact that FMA grants were expected to be awarded each year to a different
farmer group within a village, to maximize the number of beneficiaries, particularly among
women and poor farmers. At least 20% of the FMA fund was reserved to finance women’s group
proposals.

Almost 76% of the investment effort under Component 2 (institutional strengthening and capacity
building: $33.7 million) was allocated to the improvement of extension facilities (Sub-component
2.ii: $25.9 million). While this was consistent with the goal of improving the extension services’
outreach and capacity at the sub-district level, no funding was provided to support activities that
would use such facilities for activities aimed at connecting farmers and private sector, such as
demonstration activities, matching of buyers and sellers, etc. The training of extension managers
and field extension staff under Sub-component 2.1 ($6.6 million) was included to improve the
skills of the extension services involved in the implementation of Component 1.

Research-extension linkages would be strengthened under Component 3 (Improved
Research/Extension/Agribusiness/Farmer Linkages: $9.6 million). Its design coherently included
incentives to improve the outreach of AIATs research and extension staff as well as support to
their field work and ICATAD’s capacity development. On the other hand, the allocated



                                                 6
investment effort was small relative to critical role this component could have played in achieving
the Project’s objective.

Component 4 supported the provision of knowledge and information services, either through
access to computers located in the agricultural extension centers or through a mobile application.
MOA had been investing in developing the e-Petani system, a web-based agricultural information
and learning system. Given the high rates of penetration and usage of cellular phones in
Indonesia’s rural areas, the inclusion of Component 4 was in one way timely. Yet, it was also to
some extent redundant: its exclusion would have not impaired to a significant extent the
achievement of the Project’s objectives.

Project management and implementation support under Component 5 was allocated $24.2
million, or 20% of the overall investment effort. With an allocation of $24.1 million, project
management and coordination appeared as being excessively funded. The remaining 0.1$ million
was allocated to policy studies supporting the development of rules and regulations for the
implementation of Law n. 16.

Implementation arrangements

Implementation arrangements were complex, with three separate executing agencies involved at
the national level: (i) the Agency for Agricultural Human Resource Development; (ii) ICATAD;
and (iii) CADI/Office of the Secretary General. The geographic coverage of the Project was also
challenging, involving nearly 3,000 villages in 68 participating districts in 18 provinces. To
address the latter concern, the Project design assigned an important role to provincial and district
governments, in line with the new institutions introduced by Law n. 16, 2006.

The Provincial Extension Commissions (PEC), created under Law n. 16 of 2006 with the
participation of governmental and non-governmental institutions, were tasked with the
identification and evaluation of provincial-level agricultural priorities and with the management
of the allocation of provincial-level FMA grants. The criteria regulating the functioning of the
PECs were delegated to the Project Management Manual. Their funding was delegated to the
competent provincial governments. No funding was allocated under the Project to develop their
capacity. The newly established provincial extension agencies (Bakorluh) were responsible only
for the establishment of Provincial Project Implementation Units (PPIUs) tasked with the
collection, monitoring, and evaluation of data for the purpose of preparing and submitting the
required reports to the CPMU and the sub-PMU at ICATAD. Similar arrangements, and
limitations, determined the establishment and development of the District Extension
Commissions (DECs) under the Project. District Project Implementation Units were created by
the district extension agencies (Bappeluh) with similar tasks to those of the PPIUs.

Extension workers at the sub-district (BPP) and village (VEMU) level were responsible for the
implementation at the local level. Together with the district extension workers, BPP staff and
VEMUs played a particularly important role in the identification, review, and selection of the
FMA proposals submitted by the village farmer groups.

2.1.3 Adequacy of the Government's Commitment: During the Project's preparation and design
stages, the level of commitment of the central and local governments was variable, resulting in
significant delays, with this period lasting for 38 months (2004-07). The length of the preparation
period was also partly attributable to the change in the management of the MOA in 2005.
Increased emphasis was placed by MOA on investments to strengthen the public extension

                                                 7
service. The weight initially given to supporting the development and strengthening of extension-
research linkages was contextually reduced, as noted above. As described in the QEA, the
negotiations followed the “country management’s admonition not to practice brinkmanship,”
leading to a compromise whereby $25.9 million were allocated under Component 2.ii to support
the improvement of extension facilities, about 30% of what the Minister had originally wanted,
while funding for research outreach under Component 3 amounted to $9.6 million.

2.1.4 Assessment of Risks: The Project’s Overall Risk was rated as substantial. Four risks were
identified: (i) a continued centralistic and paternalistic attitude of MOA resulting in distrust of
working with the private sector; (ii) weak linkages between research and extension establishment
leading to component C being implemented separately from the remaining ones; (iii) elite capture
of the resources allocated through the FMA grants; (iv) weak compliance with financial
management and procurement procedures leading to misuse of funds.

Excluding from the Project’s scope the capacity development of the newly formed PECs and
DECs undermined the effectiveness of the identified mitigating measures. PECs and DECs were
supposed to play an important role in mitigating risks (i), (ii), and (iii). They were regarded as an
important opportunity for the private and public sectors to learn to work together. Under Law
n.16, 2006, they were created precisely to strengthen the research-extension linkages at the local
level. They were also supposed to ensure that the FMA grants would be awarded to support
meritorious proposals. Leaving to district and provincial governments the responsibility to fund
the DECs and PECs, respectively, raised the risk that these could not be placed in a condition to
function properly, particularly in view of the well-appreciated history of under-funding of
extension activities by local governments.

2.1.5 Quality at Entry: The operation underwent a Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA8) on
February 13, , 2007 and received an overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory. In particular,
Fiduciary Aspects and Risk Assessment were rated as Satisfactory; Strategic Relevance and
Approach, Technical, Financial and Economic Aspects, Poverty, Gender and Social
Development, Environmental Aspects, Policy and Institutional Aspects, and Implementation
Arrangements as Moderately Satisfactory; ICT was rated as Moderately Satisfactory; and TA and
Training was rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory; Bank Inputs and Processes were rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

A number of factors influenced the implementation of the Project. The most relevant were the
following:

Rice self-sufficient vs diversification goals The Project was implemented at a time in which the
international grains markets had become volatile, particularly the one for rice. While Indonesia
had been relatively successful in managing the international rice price shock of 2007-08, it was
not able to avert a dramatic increase in the domestic price of rice in 2010, following a drought
that affected almost 300,000 hectares of rice fields. Self-sufficiency in rice and the stabilization of
domestic rice prices had become a major priority for the GOI and MOA was given the mandate to
achieve significant increases in the productivity of food crops, including rice, corn, soybeans,
sugarcane, and beef. In such context, the diversification agenda originally underlying the design
of the FMA grants had lost somewhat traction, with local extension agencies prioritizing support
to rice and the other food crops.

Crop prioritization policy (One Village, One Product) versus customized targeting. During
the first years of implementation, the policy of one-village-one-product was adopted and
increasingly implemented by MOA. The policy objective was to maximize the impact of MOA’s
interventions by focusing resources on a single crop rather than dispersing them across several
crops. The policy diminished the Project’s ability to benefit more than one farmer group within
each village by rotating the FMA grants across different crops. Instead, different activities related
to the selected crop were supported each year.. Learning programs became focused on a single
crop, although there was an effort to change the thematic focus of each program from year to
year. Unfortunately the M&E system did not allow assessing the extent to which the number of
beneficiaries fell short of the estimated target of 180,000 farm households.

High turnover of project staff. The effectiveness of the DPIUs was affected by a high staff
turnover, which undermined continuity and consistency in program implementation at the local
level. The CPMU was not in a condition to control the turnover given the limited legal influence
that central agencies have over local agencies. Retraining by the CPMU of newly appointed staff
could only have a limited effect. On the other hand, no incentives were provided to extension
agencies that would successfully minimize the turnover of the staff assigned to the DPIUs.

Mid-Term Review / Restructuring. During the Mid-Term Review (MTR) several crucial tasks
were identified with the CPMU responsible for the follow-up, among which: (i) development of a
sound strategy for the scaling-up of the FMAs; (ii) preparation of an evaluation of the
effectiveness of training programs; (iii) preparation of a business plan for the development of a e-
Petani mobile application; and (iv) improvement of the M&E tools (i.e. survey design and data
management) and arrangements. Failure to follow-up was attributed by the CPMU and CADI to
limited availability of staff and budget allocations.

Following the MTR, upon request of the Borrower, Sub-component 2.iii (Strengthening of the
ATCs and AICs) and Sub-component 5.i (Policy Support) were dropped. Sub-component 2.iii
had lost relevance to the Borrower. On the other hand, while the development of the guidelines
for the implementation of Law n. 16, 2006 continued to be relevant, the Borrower opted for
funding the activity directly.

The weakness of local extension staff in marketing and agro-enterprise development had become
clearly a constraint to the development of agribusiness partnerships under Component 1, retarding
the scaling up of village FMAs. While a consultant firm was hired to work together with the
DPIUs to assist qualified FOs, the quality of services rendered was sub-optimal.

Given the CPMU’s effort to make progress on the implementation of Component 1 and the
availability of a shortfall in the disbursement of FMA funds motivated the request to extend the
Project’s closing date by one year. With the first restructuring it was agreed that a one year
extension in the closing date would have been granted conditional on progress at the end of the
first six months. The CPMU recruited seven specialists in agribusiness to assist the DPIU with
the development of district FMAs in thirteen pilot districts. To support the CPMU’s effort the
Bank mobilized a consultant to assist in the preparation of a manual on support to agro-enterprise
development, which NCAE has subsequently published and adopted. In view of the progress
observed in implementation the second six months extension was approved. Further progress in
the scaling-up effort however failed to materialize. The specialists hired by the CPMU received
only limited coordination and supervision from the DPIUs and the CPMU, particularly during the
second extension.



                                                 9
Besides the changes in the Project’s components note above and the Project’s first six-month
extension, the first restructuring included also adjustments to the results framework (see section
2.3.1 below). The second extension of Project motivated the second restructuring. Finally, a
partial cancellation of the loan in the amount of $ 4 million, was approved with the third
restructuring of the Project on November 3, 2013. All of the three restructuring required approval
at the level of the Country Director.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 M&E Design:

The term “agricultural service system” in the PDO was too broad a definition, making it difficult
to measure progress towards the achievement of this objective. A clearer results framework
would have helped to better monitor the achievement of the PDO. The original PDO indicators
were poorly defined: (i) changes in household expenditure rates was not a meaningful indicator
given the PDO and the notorious difficulty of measuring it through surveys whose design falls
short of the LSMS standards, which, if adopted, would make the survey itself very difficult and
costly to implement; (ii) while the use of e-Petani and ICT services among farmers was measured
in terms of beneficiary farmers in the results framework, it was measured in percent of farmers in
the monitoring arrangements table in the PAD. During the first restructuring of the Project some
changes were introduced to the set of PDO indicators, as indicated in Section 1.2. A fifth
indicator measuring the number of services received by the beneficiary farmers through their
groups was included upon request of the Borrower.

End of Project targets were set in the PAD without a clear rationale and intermediate targets were
not specified except for the first PDO indicator (increase in household expenditure). The PAD
does not clarify which tools would be used to monitor each of the PDO indicators. However, four
main tools were used: (i) an annual Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) survey; (ii) village-
level FMA data collected across all villages regularly during the year; (iii) the ICATAD M&E
system to monitor progress in the implementation of Component 3; and (iv) the survey
administered annually by CADI to monitor progress on Component 4.

The design of the M&E system suffered from a number of methodological shortcomings,
including: (i) the system did not identify the members of the farmer groups receiving the FMA
grants. As a result of the one-village-one-product policy, it was often the case that the same
groups received the FMA grants year after year, limiting the inclusion of other farm households
in the Project; (ii) although an explicit goal of the Project was to ensure the inclusion of poor
farmers in the FMAs, no methodology was established to identify these farmers; (iii) there were
no incentives for the DPIUs to provide M&E data to the CPMU in a timely manner, making the
consolidation of data problematic; (iv) no funds were allocated to facilitate a random control by
the CPMU of the quality of the data provided by DPIUs; (v) the survey administered by CADI
was carried out among farmers that had received training on the use of e-Petani, resulting in a
biased result on the use of the application by farmers in the villages included in the Project.

2.3.2   M&E Implementation

The M&E system and the management information system (MIS) were not established from the
commencement of the Project, which had a detrimental impact on the measurement of progress
towards the achievement of the Project's objectives. The implementation of the M&E system
suffered from weak coordination between the central project management units (CPMU and Sub-
PMUs), as evidenced by some duplication of M&E activities (e.g. ICATAD’s surveys collecting

                                               10
similar data as the BIA surveys). As determined during the Bank-executed M&E assessment, the
FEATI Indonesia database was not accessed by the CPMU due to a lack of coordination with
CADI, in spite of the fact that the same database was regularly updated with data sent from the
DPIUs through the PPIUs. Hence, for its consolidation, data would be transmitted to the CPMU
in excel format, rather than through the MIS established for the Project, raising concerns
regarding the integrity of the data used for reporting purposes.

The implementation of the Baseline Survey conducted in 2008 deviated substantially from the
TORs prepared at the design stage. Similarly, the data collected in 2009, 2010, and 2011 as part
of the Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) surveys, mainly used to track progress in terms of
the achievement of the Project's key indicators, was of limited and of questionable quality and
remained unused. The 2012 BIA survey was conducted in collaboration with local universities at
the provincial level rather than being contracted to a consulting firm, and is of much better quality.

An Independent External Evaluation of the Project was conducted during the MTR (2010), but
this evaluation failed to meet its objective and has remained unused. An Impact Study was
conducted in 2013. The final report, not available to the Mission at the time of the ICR mission, is
mainly descriptive and with its findings and conclusions not supported by reliable quantitative
data and evidence.

Given the shortcomings affecting the M&E system the Bank carried out an M&E Assessment in
February 2012, which resulted in an M&E Action Plan. As a result of its implementation by the
CPMU, the FEATI Indonesia database was unlocked and became accessible. Routines for the
analysis of data and automatic preparation of report tables were developed, while data review and
consolidation meetings were organized more frequently. Missing entries in the database were
correctly identified as such, rather than appearing as zero values, which had distorted averages.
Data was checked for consistency before being accepted in the system. The implementation of the
2012 BIA survey was satisfactory.

2.3.2   M&E Utilization

With some exceptions, the quality of the reports submitted to the Bank was poor, with many
reports being submitted late. Most of the M&E reports focused on fund disbursements and project
inputs, rather than on providing meaningful analysis of outcomes, limiting the usefulness of the
M&E for project management.

Information on disbursement and project inputs was indeed relied upon by the CPMU to manage
the Project. On the other hand, neither the outcome indicators monitored through the M&E and
nor the compliance of the DPIUs in their monitoring responsibilities were used by the CPMU or
AAEHRD to sharpen the Project’s implementation strategy. The Bank’s recommendation to
adjust the funding of the FMA grants on the basis of districts’ performance and DPIUs
compliance was not given follow-up.

At Project closure, NCAE has taken the lead in migrating the FEATI Project databases into the
current MoA M&E system (in AAEHRD/NCAE for extension). NCAE also plans to use the BIA
survey to track the outputs and outcomes of its institutional activities. In spite of these positive
plans, the prospects for the full integration of the FEATI M&E system with the NCAE’s core
M&E system remain uncertain. While the NCAE management is fully aware of the benefits of
such integration, the overall organizational culture at the MOA continues to be oriented towards


                                                 11
the reporting of data related to financial and physical progress, rather than to program
performance.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(a)      Safeguards: The “B” category for environmental assessment risk still applies. Safeguard
issues were well articulated in the Project document including safeguard instruments and actions
to be taken by the project i.e. (i) environmental screening criteria and negative list; (ii) basic
environmental management criteria for pesticide use; (iii) recruitment of Sr. Environmental
Specialist; and (iv) Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). Safeguard
supervision was started only in the later stages of project implementation i.e the fifth supervision
mission. In early 2012 a Sr. Environmental Specialist was recruited by the project with the
following outputs : (i) FEATI Project Environmental Guide Book; (ii) negative lists to screen
FMA activities; and (iii) an environmental training manual. The implementation of an
environmental management and mitigation plan, as recommended in the QAG assessment, began
late, as noted by the sixth and seventh supervision missions. During this period, the plan to
develop a Pest Management Plan was dropped, with environmental measures such as the
provision of training on integrated pest management and the dissemination of the Environmental
Guide Book to ensure that pesticides included on a negative list were not utilized by FOs being
implemented as an alternative. ESMF was not explicitly defined in the project manual.
Nevertheless, the project had efforts on the inclusion of women and the poor in the farmer’s
managed extension activities.

Despite the delay in the safeguard supervision and shortcomings at the beginning of the project
implementation, at ICR the mission found no evidence of major, sensitive or critical issues related
to environmental impacts resulting from the implementation of the FEATI Project. The “B”
category for environmental assessment risk is consistent throughout the FMA activities observed
during implementation missions because all project activities engaged in limited area of impact
and the magnitude of the impacts are also not significant and are manageable. Some good
practices implemented to ensure environmental safety were included in learning discussions
involving FMAs. For example, cattle manure handling, cattle cage location adjacent to water
source, used chemical container handling, used syringe disposal, the use of fertilizer/pesticide,
housekeeping and occupational and heath safety aspect. However, good and bad practices of
environmental management were not well monitored and documented by the project which could
generate lessons learned from the FEATI Project, useful in the training of farmers and extension
workers. Safeguard instruments used during project implementation such as FEATI
environmental guide book, the negative list, environmental training materials and the recruitment
of environmental safeguard specialist were available and implemented during the missions.
However, the project was only able to train extension staff and farmers in eight out of 68 districts
due to limited budget allocation. The rating of Moderately Satisfactory during supervision
missions was realistic as some shortcomings at the early project implementation were able to be
addressed at the project closure.

(b)     Procurement: Overall, procurement processes were implemented in compliance with
Bank procurement policies and with agreed upon procedures. However, there were some
shortcomings including (i) improper budget allocation for BPP construction resulting in delays to
the maintenance period beyond the end of the Government's fiscal year ; (ii) inadequate capacity
of project staff resulting in poor record keeping; and (iii) a lack of understanding of the
procurement committees regarding the application of qualification requirements in the evaluation



                                                12
and disqualification process. To address this issue, the Bank provided in house training attended
by project procurement staff at all levels.

 (c)     Financial Management. An assessment at entry point indicated a relatively high level of
risk due to the geographical extent of the Project and the high proportion of soft expenditures that
it involved. Measures to mitigate these risks were agreed upon and implemented by CPMU, with
these measures including the recruitment of financial management consultants, the formulation of
a project management manual, which was approved by the Bank, and the implementation of
internal and external audits over the Project.

In terms of financial management, the performance of the Project improved after 2010, when
oversight of this aspect of project implementation was intensified through increased activity by
CPMU staff, consultants, DPIU finance staff, and staff of public works agencies, particularly in
the area of the monitoring of the construction of facilities for the BPPs. A simple financial
management monitoring checklist was developed as a tool to implement oversight at the farmer
group level. Reports of audits of the Project's financial statements audits were consistently
submitted on time, with all reports being accepted with unqualified opinion. Internal audits of the
Project were also conducted annually by IG of MoA. By the end of the Project (EOP), all
backlogs had been resolved, with most of the necessary follow-ups to audit findings having been
completed.

By EOP, some financial management issues had still not been fully resolved, including identified
weaknesses in the financial management of agribusiness operations of the FOs. While farmer
groups generally had the capacity to manage block grants, requirements became more complex
for more advanced FOs and in higher level FMAs implemented by district and provincial FOs
that received larger block grants. On the other hand, the extension workers had limited capacity to
assist FO members in matters related to financial management. Another outstanding issue related
to the turnover of 25 completed BPP facilities to the local governments. The BPP facilities were
not listed as local government assets, meaning that local governments are unable to provide
budget allocations (APBD) to support the maintenance of the new facilities.

(d) Governance and Anti-Corruption: Prior to negotiation, a mitigation plan containing a set of
measures to address these risks was agreed upon. The formulation of an Anti-Corruption Action
Plan (ACAP) was prepared by the Project covering measures to mitigate fraud and collusion risks
in procurement process; information about the Project disseminated through various media
channels. A guideline on complaints handling mechanism was prepared in June 2010. Despite
this delay, at the beginning of the project implementation, the project implementers at all levels
publicized the project activities and budget in the website of Ministry of Agriculture, and local
newspaper. Shortlists for major contracts were posted on the website. Most complaints were
received through SMS centers and were recorded at the CPMU office. Over the period of the
Project implementation the level of awareness and understanding of the ACAP and related issues
was high amongst CPMU staff, this was not the case amongst staff of the implementing units at
the provincial and district levels.

At EOP, success had been achieved in facilitating external oversight through: (i) the participation
of representatives of CSOs and media organizations at bid opening sessions; and (ii) the
implementation of third-party evaluations by local university and extension committees.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1. Transition Arrangements: The MOA/AAEHRD did not submit a Plan for Future
Operations of the FEATI Project formally, as required in Section 3.03 of the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA), which mandates the formulation of a plan to ensure the continued
achievement of the objectives of the Project following its completion. However, based on the
discussion with the Director of NCAE, the following arrangement has been made:

Central level arrangements: The responsibility for continuing the project activities related to
strengthening farmer organizations and enterprise development was transferred to a division
under NCAE called “Kelembagan Petani dan Usahatani” or Division of Farmer Organization and
Enterprise Development which was established in 2011. This division prepared a program and
allocated budget for 2014 including (i) strengthening and improving the sustainability of
established FOs to become viable commercial enterprises; and (ii) strengthening the capacities of
trained farmer facilitators through newly established Village Extension Centers. Monitoring and
evaluation was transferred to NCAE's Sub-division for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.

In addition, technology dissemination approaches developed under Component C were adopted
by ICATAD of IAARD under a new program called “Model Pengembangan Pertanian
Perdesaan Melalui Innovasi – m-P3MI” or Model of Rural Agricultural development through
Innovation intended to strengthen the capacity to conduct participatory research and to develop
and to disseminate best practice technologies for improved agricultural productivity, profitability,
and sustainability. This model was included as one sub-component of the recently approved
Bank-funded Sustainable Management of Agricultural Research and Technology Dissemination
(SMARTD) Project.

District and provincial level arrangements: At Project closure, the DPIUs ( at district) and
PPMUs (at provincee) were disbanded. No staff was appointed within the local extension
agencies (Bapeluh and Bakorluh) responsible for the FEATI Project’s follow-on activities.
Despite this, in 2013, some FEATI districts allocated funds to support the operations and
maintenance (O&M) of BPPs constructed by FEATI. A significant majority of local legislatures
and district officials (Bupati and Bappeda Heads) have indicated their ongoing support for the
institutional development of FOs and the local extension agencies created under the Project, a
sign of the positive reception for the innovative approach to the provision of extension services
introduced by the FEATI project. The ICR Mission noted examples of local government
allocations in 2013 and 2014 to support follow-on project activities and the limited scaling-up of
village-level approaches within and outside the Project areas.

2.5.2 Performance Indicators to Monitor the Project: A number of key indicators developed
for the FEATI Project could be used to monitor follow-on activities. The original targets could be
used as a benchmark for monitoring the outcomes of these activities. The design of on line FMA
databases developed by the Project (www.featiindonesia.com) could be adopted to better enable
the tracking of the outputs and outcomes of farmers' activities as well as public extension
services.

 2.5.3 Recommended Follow-up by the Bank: The Government has shown interest in further
scaling-up the Project to additional districts and provinces. During initial discussions, the Bank
indicated its support for scaling-up the Project not only in terms of expanded geographical
coverage (horizontal), with the inclusion of new districts, but through innovations and
improvements to the FEATI design on the basis of lessons learned through the implementation of

                                                14
that project (vertical). A follow-up project would facilitate the completion of the institutional
reforms that were initiated under the original Project and scale up the successful approaches
developed under this Project to empower farmers and farmer’s organizations. A critical
assessment of the approaches and innovations promoted by the Project should be conducted to
serve as input for the design of a new follow-on project. Since no reliable impact study was
conducted at the close of the FEATI Project, an impact evaluation should be carried out between
2014 and 2015, in synchronization with the preparation for a follow-on project. The results could
also be used as a benchmark for this project.
Under the new project, the integration of fishery and forestry, which were not included in the
original design of the FEATI Project, should be seriously considered. With the inclusion of
fishery and forestry, the new project could be a vehicle to initiate the implementation of Law No.
19, 2013 on Farmers Protection and Empowerment, which is complementary to the Extension
Law 16, 2006 that was supported by the Project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The FEATI PDO remains highly relevant to the GOI's National Medium Term Development Plan
(RPJMN) for 2010-2014, which envisions to support creative, innovative, and independent
farmers who are able to utilize science and technology and local resources to produce highly
competitive agricultural products; to promote healthy, honest, and fair business partnerships; and
to improve the quality of services and the level of professionalism of government employees in
the agricultural sector. FEATI’s farmer-driven approach has been successful also in improving
rice productivity, particularly in marginal areas. Hence, MOA’s increased focus on rice self-
sufficiency since 2008 did not result in the FEATI objectives becoming irrelevant. The Law on
Farmer Empowerment and Protection promulgated in May 2013 in fact further reasserts and
supports these objectives.

The FY 2013-2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Indonesia emphasizes the need to
revitalize agriculture as a pro-poor strategy and foresees a greater level of engagement by the
Bank in this area. The Bank’s Public Expenditure Review for Indonesia’s agricultural sector
(2010) recommended GOI to reallocate its sectoral expenditure from input subsidies to public
goods, such as extension, R&D, and irrigation services. It also supported the use of grant
mechanism to empower farmers in driving the demand for such services, provided appropriate
monitoring of their use is ensured. The SMARTD and WISMP Projects are supportive of the
prioritization of linkages between extension and R&D and of farmer organizations’ capacity
development and empowerment in agricultural sector development strategy.

The Project’s design needs to improve to be made consistent with the objectives, particularly in
some key aspects:

(a)     To support the scaling up of successful FMAs into agro-enterprises beyond the village
boundaries, learning plans and capacity building of the managing farmer organization under
Component 1 should be allowed to progress into a grant-based support to the implementation of a
multi-year business plan that allows for the acquisition of those assets and equipment that are
necessary for the agro-enterprise itself. Requiring counterpart equity by the beneficiary in the
form of cash and/or by a private sector counterpart would provide strong incentives towards the
selection of agro-enterprises with a high potential for sustainability, particularly whenever a bank


                                                15
loan is used to co-finance the investment. The Bank’s experience in a number of Productive
Partnership and Rural Alliance models should be considered in this regard;
(b)      Capacity building and institutional strengthening under Component 2 should not be
limited to the public extension agencies, but should embrace a system perspective. Supporting the
capacity of DECs and PECs to provide strategic guidance on local extension priorities can be an
effective way to promote the development of partnerships between private and public sectors and
farmers at the institutional and operational level. Similarly, under Component 3 support should be
provided to develop the capacity of the Provincial Technology Commissions (PTCs), which have
the function to identify opportunities for strengthening the research-extension linkages involving
the AIATs, the private sector, and farmer organizations;
(c)      A support to the development of ICT for farmers focused exclusively on the public sector
does not serve the purpose. A clear role for PPPs should be explicitly envisioned in the design of
Component 4;
(d)      For M&E to become an effective tool to promote governance and efficient program
management, the involvement of independent third parties in the collection, analysis, and
verification of Project information is essential. This concerns the assessment of the level of
satisfaction of farmers with the services received from both public and private sources, as well as
to measuring the contribution of extension services to household income and farm productivity.

Implementation arrangements need to include a system of incentives that would improve the
commitment of district governments to the project, for instance by reducing the staff turnover at
the DPIU level and by ensuring a satisfactory and timely collection of data. For example,
prioritization of grant fund allocations across districts could be based on a set of clear and
transparent evaluation criteria tied to performance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

By EOP, only two of the five defined objectives had been fully achieved; two objectives were not
achieved, while evidence for a fifth one was inconclusive due to the lack of appropriate data.

Despite a failure in achieving the project indicators, the PDO had been in achieved to a
significant extent. Through the implementation of FMA, a top – down agricultural service system
was gradually transformed to demand – driven agricultural service system. The training provided
to farmer group leaders enabled them to better lead their groups in learning activities as well as
developing their enterprises. The trained FOs were able to identify, decide, and implement their
needs on services to develop their agro-enterprises. The establishment of trained Farmer’s
Council under the project helped farmers in consolidating their learning needs, and linking with
non-public service providers to be supported by FMA grants. Through the FMA implementation,
AIATs could directly link and collaborate with BPPs in providing information and technologies
as demanded by farmers. This led to a wider coverage of technology dissemination. Improved
capacity of AIATs’ researchers enabled them to better serve field extension workers and farmers
in providing demand – driven technologies. In some provinces, AIATs also facilitated FOs to link
with market and product registration.

With FMA, FOs improved their services to support enterprises development of their members by
providing among other establishing partnership with private sectors on marketing, external
service providers on technology and information. Monitoring on its progress was continued by
NCAE. Diagram 1 and 2 below indicates the changes in agricultural service system before and
after the project.

The achievement of the PDO was measured by the following indicators :

(i)      The M&E system did not collect reliable data to measure the indicator “ Percentage of
members of participating FOs with improved household expenditures,” for which evidence is
therefore inconclusive. As noted above (Section 2.3.1) the QEA noted serious theoretical and
empirical issues associated with the use and measurement of such an indicator.
(ii)     The indicator “Number of technology packages developed by AIATs that are used in the
FMAs” was meant to track the extent to which the AIATs were able to develop agricultural
technologies meeting the farmers’ needs and interest, given the market and agro-ecological
conditions under which they operated. Through the FMAs, participating AIATs were able to
better target the dissemination of the technologies as requested by farmers. Technologies were not
only used, but also fine-tuned in a participatory way by AIATs researchers and farmers. AIATs,
contextually, improved their capacity to collaborate with other research institutions (private
sector, universities, NGOs, and local government) in the development and dissemination of
technology. This benefitted more farmers previously unreachable by AIATs. While the
participating AIATs innovated on their processes, the quality of the research output developed by
the Indonesian Agricultural R&D system – and which the AIATs are supposed to assess at the
local level - had yet to follow.
(iii)    The indicator “Percentage of participating farmers benefiting from e-Petani and other
information communication technologies” was intended as a part of agricultural services to assist
farmers in accessing various information provided by the e-Petani application (managed by
MOA) and by other sources through the use of computers and cell-phones. However, the project
was not able to develop a mobile platform allowing the majority of farmers access the
information through their mobile phones.
(iv)     The indicator “Number of joint activities/ventures with private sector established by
FOs” was meant to assess the Project’s achievement in developing agribusiness partnerships
between FOs with the private sector. Only towards the end of the Project it was agreed that joint
activities and ventures should be formalized through a contract to count for M&E purposes.
Based on that distinction, only 1,288 partnerships involved written agreements, while 4,400
involved unwritten agreements. The EOP target was underachieved by 46%. The indicator from
Component 1 “Percentage of FMAs where experts from external providers (universities, research
organizations, NGOs, experienced farmers, and private sector) participate as a resource person
exceeded EOP by 214%. This suggests that while the FMAs were an effective approach to
stimulate a diversification in the access to information and technology by farmers, they were less
successful in the case of agribusiness partnerships where the private sector counterpart’s
commitment goes beyond that of a resource person. It should also be considered that typically a
contract would materialize at the end of a process in which farmers are able to demonstrate their
capacity to comply with the requirements of the buyer. Furthermore, within the limits of a village,
the size of the market does not justify the use of contracts.
(v)      The indicator “Number of services provided to FO members by their organization”
measured the extent to which farmer organizations and/or groups had become a conduit for the
delivery of services requested by their members. Such services could be provided either by the
public extension agencies, by the private sector (including NGOs and universities) and/or other
farmers (farmer to farmer extension). The range of services included provision of information,
technology, counselling, capital, production inputs, and utilization of natural resouces (land and
water management). The EOP target was exceeded by slightly more than 100%. The satisfactory
achievement in this indicator is also consistent with the measurement of farmer satisfaction with
the services received from the extension agents under Component 2 (“Percent farmers report
benefiting from improved skills and services of extension staff:” EOP target exceeded by 12.5%)
as well as that related to the performance of the AIATs note above.


                                                18
The achievement was on balance moderately satisfactory, as the Project failed to achieve the EOP
target in terms of three out of total nine indicators. Among four components, only Component B
fully achieved its EOP target. For Component A, the indicator Percentage of FOs with sound
financial and procurement management practices under-achieved the EOP by 34%: the majority
of FOs under the Project were newly established and therefore had limited management skills. As
noted above, the intermediate indicator of Satisfaction levels of beneficiaries regarding improved
R&D services under Component C was not fully achieved. Component D failed to achieve its
EOP target due to the failure of CADI to develop a mobile platform for the e-Petani application,
which would have enabled a far higher level of access by farmers to the information in the
database.

3.3 Efficiency

At appraisal, an estimate of the economic rate of return (ERR) or net present value (NPV) was not
provided, due to the demand-driven nature of the Project. NPV and cost-benefit ratios computed
from a small sample of FMAs supported under DAFEP provided an indication of sizeable
benefits from implementation of Component A (approximately 38% of the overall investment
effort). A recalculation of NPV or cost-benefit ratios was therefore impossible. Unfortunately,
data limitations did not allow for the estimation of ex-post indicators of financial and economic
performance of the FMAs.

Complementary evidence from other sources is also scant and somehow weakened by
methodological shortcomings. Two studies, from the University of Brawijaya and PT Intersys (a
Consulting Company), used data from a limited sample of FMAs. They both did not account for
biases in the selection process driving inclusion and exclusion in/from the Project. The impact
study report of PT Intersys hints at an overall positive impact on farmers’ incomes, depending on
the crop being considered, with less satisfactory results being recorded for crops including rice
and chilies. Based on a non-representative sample of 59 participating and 22 non-participating
farmers in three districts in East Java, the Brawijaya University study concludes that revenues of
participating farmers have increased throughout the Project period at double the rate of those of
non-participating farmers. Overall, these findings are consistent with those from the DAFEP
impact evaluation.

A more specific analysis of the FMAs that have been scaled-up to district agro-enterprises under
FEATI was undertaken during the preparation of the ICR. The analysis, based on a very small
sample and therefore only indicative, shows that the learning grants invested in the development
of agro-enterprises such as cattle fattening and mushroom and shallot cultivation have increased
revenues significantly, ranging between 25 % (rice) and 700 % (goat). The details of the analysis
are in Annex 3. The results suggest that as the support to the development of the agro-enterprise
started only too late into Project implementation, most of the agro-enterprises were yet suffering
from an unclear legal status and that their members had yet to contribute to the development of
the enterprise by re-investing a part of their earnings. Few enterprises had borrowed from banks.
The most successful enterprises are those that consistently receive FMA learning grants in the
same thematic area (i.e. commodity or livelihood), while annual learning grants or changes in
learning topics led to less sustainable outcomes.

With regard to Component C, a rigorous assessment was carried out by ICATAD in 2011. The
estimated rate of return from the adoption of the technology packages disseminated by the
participating AIATs and fine-tuned with farmers through the FMAs indicated a rate of return of
in the range of 25 % (rice) – 120 % (sheep).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The PDO was consistent with the GOI’s sectoral priorities and with the Bank's sectoral strategy
both at entry and at end of Project. The design and implementation arrangements could have been
improved to ensure a satisfactory achievement of the Project’s objectives. Weaknesses in the
design and implementation arrangements noted at entry undermined the full and efficient
achievement of the Project’s objectives.

The Project only partially achieved the PDO of developing a demand-driven, market oriented
agricultural services system, based on partnerships between farmer groups, public agencies, and
private sector enterprises at all levels. While the Project was successful in moving towards a
farmer-driven approach to the delivery of extension services fell short though of achieving the
scaling-up of village FMAs into district and provincial-level agro-enterprises capable of linking
smallholders to markets in their efforts to commercialize their production. The skill mix of
extension services is mainly oriented towards technical and crop-specific subject matters rather
than agribusiness and organizational capacity development. Furthermore, the policy environment
was overall attaching more importance to achieving increases in farm productivity rather than
farmer income. Furthermore, provincial extension agencies had a marginal role in the
implementation of the Project; no explicit allocation had been made from the start to grants to
support district-wide and/or provincial-wide FMAs. This resulted in the Project successfully
disbursing its funds for most of its implementation period to support village-level FMA, mostly
oriented towards the transfer of technology or production innovations and with which extension
services were most confident given their skill mix. Only a minor share of the funds for FMA
grants had been allocated to district and provincial FMAs in support of agro-enterprise
development, and then only too late to result into a clearly discernible sustainable impact (see
section 3.3 above).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts: Although the FEATI Project Results Framework included indicators intended
to measure the Project's level of outreach to poor farmers, the relevant indicator under
Component 1 mixed 'women and the poor' under a single category. While, the Project’s M&E
guidelines did not provide criteria for the identification of poor households at the community
level it should be noted that using the BIAs to identify poor households would have met the same
complications note for the measurement of the PDO indicator related to changes in household
expenditure levels.

Gender Aspects: Results of the 2012 BIA survey showed that 36.6% of those participating in the
Project's planning and decision-making meetings were women, a level higher than originally
targeted. During field visits, it was observed that the level of participation of women varied
significantly, being highest in FOs involved in post-harvest food processing activities (often
above 80.0%) and in the raising of cattle and milk production (approximately 50%). A
particularly unsatisfactory result is that only 4.0% of the total value of grants disbursed under the
Project was awarded to women-led FMAs, well below the EOP target of 20.0%.



                                                 20
Social Development: The Project was partly successful in empowering farmers to better manage
their productive resources, although it fell short of supporting the establishment of agro-
enterprises as originally envisioned. The extensive capacity building of FO managers and
members supported by the Project benefited large numbers of women and men farmers in the
approximately 3,000 target villages, although data shortcoming do not allow to determine
whether the effective number of beneficiaries corresponded to the 180,000 originally estimated.
As traditional farmers' groups transformed themselves to become productive economic units,
members of these FOs have benefited from an improved ability to produce quality products and
to better access markets and directly contribute to the local economy. Some FOs also began
operating lending and savings schemes.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Although the focus of institutional reforms under the FEATI Project was on the establishment of
unified extension institutions in 68 districts in 18 provinces, many other provinces and districts
across the country also established similar extension institutions, as mandated by Extension Law
No. 16, 2006. More provinces and districts have developed such institutions since the start of the
Project. The AAEHRD, and with it MOA, has learned from the implementation of the FEATI
Project and is intent in up-scaling the Project’s approach based on the FMAs to a national
program level. The recent promulgation of the Law on Farmer Empowerment and Protection is a
good indicator of the success achieved in this regard.

Although the Project design attempted to involve the PECs and DECs through the awarding of
the FMA grants, in fact their role proved to be very marginal. No support to developing their
capacity was included under the Project as district and provincial governments were assumed to
provide their own funding. Moreover, district and provincial-level FMA grants were considered
only towards the end of the Project, making the involvement of these institutions inessential from
the very start.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Some basic principles introduced by the project were used as inputs to the formulation of a new
Law no 19, 2013 on Farmer’s Protection and Empowerment including strategy on farmer’s
empowerment and roles of extension workers in facilitating farmers.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not Applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

The FEATI Project was partially successful in achieving its development objective of establishing
a demand-driven agricultural services system by using a farmer-managed extension activities
(FMA) approach to allow farmers to determine their own extension activities (FMAs), to access
the grants and to implement them, and to build partnerships with private sector enterprises. At a
higher policy level, a key risk to the PDO is created by the goal of achieving self-sufficiency in
all staple crops, rather than resilience in food security. The self-sufficiency approach orients
agricultural agencies towards the achievement of quantitative production targets, rather than
prioritizing improvements to farmers’ incomes and living standards, which may entail

                                               21
diversification. It de-emphasizes the use of value chain development as an approach to
strengthening market linkages and the retooling of extension agencies to promote their role as
brokers of services by facilitating linkages and interactions among farmers, private sector firms,
and non-public providers of business development services within a systems approach that
promotes the development and adoption of innovations. In terms of risks to the achievement of
sustainability of the project results and outcomes of the Project, the following aspects need to be
considered :

4.1. Sustainability of Farmer Organizations: Of the 872 newly FOs established under the
FEATI Project, only a third, those that were established as formal legal enterprises and/or
commercial entities, have the potential to become sustainable. These enterprises would require
ongoing support and guidance from both public and private service providers. Many of the FOs
has already developed partnerships with private sector enterprises to support the FOs' marketing
programs. With the enactment of a new Law on Farmer’s Protection and Empowerment, no 19,
2013, the probability of supporting the established FOs is high.

4.2. Continuation of the Extension Institutional Reforms: Integrated provincial and district
extension institutions have been successfully established in the Project locations with variations
in the structures of these institutions. The pending enactment of the Presidential Decree on
Extension Institutions might have an impact on the stability and sustainability of the existing
extension institutions at district and provincial level.

4.3. Improving the Capacity of Extension Workers and Farmer Facilitators: As already
stated, the level of capacity of the staff of the public agricultural extension system remains weak,
mainly due to their lack of specialist knowledge and experience in areas such as agribusiness
development, marketing, entrepreneurship, and value chain management. Targeted training
programs originally planned under the Project could help address these gaps. Farmer facilitators
(one woman and one man per village) were trained by the Project in 3,000 target villagers. Using
more effective methods such as learning-by-doing, participative training approaches, internships
and coaching could help sustain the Project outcomes.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project was prepared based on a solid assessment carried out by international and national
consultant team recruited by the government, and evaluation by the Bank’s team on the previous
DAFEP. The Bank mobilized a technical assistance to strengthen the project design, particularly
on farmer organization and agricultural extension. Prior to the project launch, the Bank ensured
the capacity of the project staff at central level on fiduciary related aspects by organizing in house
training on procurement and financial management, and providing guidance on preparing ACAP.
The implementing agency and the Bank overestimated the capacity of former DAFEP districts in
implementing the Project, as the majority of the project staff were new and had no experience in
DAFEP. This resulted in a poor quality of the project implementation. The PDO and key
performance indicators and targets were also discussed with the implementing agencies.
However, a Bank’s support on monitoring and evaluation to assist the project was not effective in
ensuring that the project staff understood about the linkages between PDO and the indicators as
well as the data collection allowing the project to set up a proper monitoring and evaluation

                                                 22
system. Safeguard requirement was not clearly addressed leading to delay in the implementation
of Environmental Management Plan. The inclusion of women and the poor in the project
activities were not clearly defined leading to multi interpretation among project implementers.
The working mechanism between three central management units i.e. CPMU at NCAE, sub-
CPMU at CADI, and sub CPMU at ICATAD to ensure proper linkages among components under
each central management unit was addressed and agreed on by these three implementing
agencies. However, due to its autonomy of each implementing agency, its implementation was
not effective.

The above assessment was similar with a Quality at Entry Review (QER) conducted by the Bank
in February 2007, identifying shortcomings in the Project design that would subsequently prove
to hinder the implementation of the Project : (i) an unclear rationale for the selection of the targets
in the results framework; (ii) the lack of a TA grant to support the implementation of the Project,
which prevented the Project from benefiting from exposure to international best practices; (iii) the
lack of clearly identified strategies for the inclusion of women and poor farmers; (iv) the weak
arrangements for the development of ICT software and hardware; (v) the need to proceed to a full
disclosure of the Environmental Management Plan at the very start of the Project and to prepare a
Pest Management Plan; (vi) a lack of analysis of the structure of incentives for stakeholders
involved in the Project; and (vii) the inclusion of an indicator related to changes in household
expenditures, an indicator notoriously difficult to measure and subject to influences from a
multitude of factors outside of the Project's control.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Supervision during the first two years of implementation was limited to one mission per year. A
Mid-Term Review was conducted in 2010, as a result of which 128 recommendations were
agreed upon. As a follow up of Mid-Term Review, AAEHRD as the leading project
implementing agency proposed a restructuring the project in October 25, 2010 which was
approved in March 27, 2012. This long period of restructuring was due to issues being
restructured were very critical in ensuring the project on the right track and this required intensive
discussions with the government.         The Project experienced three times of changes in the
leadership.      Despite a high turn of the Bank’s Task Team Leader (TTL), the Task Team
followed up commitments agreed by previous TTLs, and new TTLs provided different angles on
how to move forward on the project implementation. Some unidentified issues from the previous
Task team were able to be addressed by a new TTL including safeguard and the farmer’s owned
enterprise establishment. The Task Team was consistently engaged in a number of technical
assistance activities to support CPMU in the implementation of the restructured project including
the following: (i) the preparation and implementation of an M&E Action Plan; (ii) preparation of
a draft operations manual to support the development of farmer-managed agro-enterprises
(January 2013); and (iii) preparation the follow up actions to ensure that the recommendations
were workable by the CPMU. The Task Team monitored the progress of the agreed action plans
by attending several quarterly project consolidation meetings, and discussed critical issues in the
project implementation and how to address it. However, the agreed action plans were not able to
be fully implemented due to an interpretation gap among the project implementers, particularly at
district and provincial levels. The Task Team recommended the CPMU to summarize and
translate from English to Bahasa Indonesia critical action plans and followed by a simple
guideline to allow common understanding among the project implementers. The Task Team was
not able to provide assistance directly to all participating districts and provinces due to huge
number of locations as opposed to the availability of the Task Team.


                                                  23
Supervision of Fiduciary aspects was regularly facilitated by the Bank, with the Task Team's
procurement and FM specialists conducting regular missions at different times of the year, the
results of which have been summarized in clear and exhaustive reports. Despite the delay in
conducting safeguard supervision which was only started in the forth year of the project, a
safeguard team provided intensive guidance to the project and came up with four
recommendations which were met by the CPMU during the rest of the project life including
formulation and utilization of Project Environmental Guide Book, negative lists to screen FMA
activities and the delivery environmental training for extension staff and farmers in eight out 68
districts. The Task Team recommended the CPMU to train staff and farmers in other districts, but
no follow action was taken.

Unfortunately, there was no such assessment from the Bank whether all supports and
recommendations provided by the Task Team addressed the identified issues in the project
implementation, so early remedy / improvement could be taken by the Task Team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

In view of the above ratings regarding the Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry and
quality of supervision, the overall performance of the Bank is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Since one rating is MU and the other MU, the overall rating for Bank performance is considered
MU because the project’s overall outcome rating is MU.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government of Indonesia, through the Ministry of Finance (MoF), MoA and Bappenas,
supported the preparation and implementation of the FEATI Project and ensured that sufficient
government counterpart funds were allocated annually. Prior to the start-up of the Project, the
central government ensured that all requirements for project implementation were met, including
the production of a project management manual acceptable to the Bank; the establishment of an
inter-agency National Steering Committee under MoA’s Secretary General’s Office and a
National Technical Committee under AAEHRD to provide policy and technical guidance; and the
deployment of designated and trained staff responsible for project management at AAEHRD,
ICATAD and CADI.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Central level project implementation: The AAEHRD and its units were the lead implementing
agency, with the participation of the newly established extension institutions at the district and
provincial level. Prior to the initiation of the Project, the AAEHRD established the CPMU, while
ICATAD and CADI established Sub-PMUs in their respective agencies. CPMU made efforts to
set up monitoring and evaluation system using various tools including on line data base.

Weaknesses identified at the central project management level included: (i) AAEHRD was not
able to set up a systematic and sustainable coordination mechanism between the CPMU and the
Sub-PMUs, creating some disconnect in project planning, monitoring and reporting.; (ii) in

sufficient managerial training to the CPMU staff; (iii) the delay in replacing some sub-qualified
consultants. For example, it took almost a year to decide to discontinue the contract of a sub-
standard consulting firm and to replace it with individual consultants; (iv) the Project M&E
system was suffered at the design and implementation stages. In spite of the importance of
capacity building in the Project and the willingness of AAEHRD to make budget allocations for
this purpose, no assessment of training needs was conducted for the participating extension
institutions, resulting in the absence of well-defined training plans.

Because of decentralization polices, the AAEHRD did not have the authority to make changes in
project staffing at the DPIUs, thereby impeding a satisfactory solution to the high rate of turnover
of project staff noted during several supervision missions. Despite these shortcomings, the
AAEHRD has committed to continuing to implement the approaches introduced by the FEATI
Project as part of the implementation of new Extension Law no 16, 2006 leading to the
implementation of the new Law No. 19, 2013 on Farmer Protection and Empowerment. The
Agency has just published the manual on developing farmer’s own enterprises, with assistance
provided by the Bank, and has allocated funds under its budget for FY 2014 to strengthen the FOs
established under the FEATI Project.

Decentralized level project implementations: At the beginning of the project, the implementing
units at the provincial and district levels namely the provincial Extension Coordinating Bodies
(Bakorluh) and the district Extension Implementing Units (Bapeluh) committed in fulfilling the
project requirement such as establishing project management units, deployed project staff and
allocated operational budgets. The construction of new BPPs and renovation of existing BPPs as
a home base of field extension workers was completed before the Project closing. Some districts
allocated funds for additional BPPs building with similar design, and have begun to replicate
successful village FMA in villages not previously included in the Project.

The Project staff received training in areas related to project management and were provided with
TA support by the Project under the coordination of the CPMU. However, the high rate of
rotation of local staff made repeated training necessary and reduced its effectiveness.
Coordination between the CPMU and the PPMUs and DPIUs took place mainly through quarterly
meetings, which also provided a venue for the sharing of experiences and the discussion of
project management issues. The AIAT staff also participated in these meetings, leading to the
development of a closer working relationship between researchers and extension workers.
However, for some reasons these meetings were not effective to improve the project
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The government is committed to reform the research and extension agenda through the
implementation of new Extension Law no 16, 2006. However, the implementing agencies at
various level had no sufficient efforts to improve the project implementation and its impact to the
future of the extension reformation. The changes in the leadership of the implementing agencies
affected in the high turn of the trained project staff promoted to other offices.

6. Lessons Learned

The FMA approach continues to represent an innovative approach to the objective of
developing farmer-driven and market oriented extension services. It provided FOs with the
opportunity to improve their capacity in achieving their goals based on market and agro-
ecological conditions within which they operate. Training provided to farmers and the first-hand
experience of FO members in participatory planning, proposal preparation, FMA implementation,
simple monitoring, and the financial management of grant funds gave them confidence and the
incentive to manage their own learning activities and business enterprises more effectively.

The scaling-up of FMAs into district and provincial-level agro-enterprises should have been
prepared early-on in the Project, and not towards its end. By the time the Bank provided the
technical assistance on how to operationalize the scaling-up it was too late. Most of the farmer
groups were just beginning to show good progress as revealed during the preparation of this ICR,
yet they lacked proper legal business development assistance. With more time and improved
assistance from the Project, they could have represented a successful learning experience for
MOA. However, the conclusion to be drawn is not that MOA should avoid investing in the
development of agro-enterprises managed by FG. Rather, the field work suggests that this is an
area where substantial progress can be made provided that the support from local extension
agencies is integrated with that of other services in the local agricultural units at the district and
provincial level. Benefits could also be generated through the further establishment of
partnerships with the private sector at the institutional and business development level, in
alignment with the FEATI PDO. In this regard, the failure to support the capacity development of
PECs and DECs through the Project represented an important missed opportunity.

The design of FMA needs to be refined to achieve the scaling up of FOs into viable agro-
enterprises able to achieve economies of scale and strengthen the linkage of smallholders to
markets. Extending the planning horizon beyond the current yearly one, scaling-up the grants to
FOs and tying them to contributions from other value chain actors (e.g. banks, private
commercial sector, etc.) against professionally developed business plans are all ideas that GOI
could explore in refining the FMA design as it starts articulating the guidelines of the recently
approved Farmer Empowerment and Protection Law, No 19, 2013. The Bank’s experience in
linking smallholders to competitive value chains across Latin America, Africa, and Asia could be
tapped for the purpose. In such an approach learning and business development should be
integrated in the FMAs. MOA could then consider integrating the FEATI program with a
redesigned and revitalized PUAP program.

Strong linkages between farmers, researchers and extension workers facilitate an effective
dissemination and adoption of improved technologies. Under the Project, the successful
dissemination of technology depended on strong collaboration between farmers, researchers and
field extension workers, using participatory, learning-by-doing dissemination approaches and
involving the provision of intensive research support by scientists who developed the
technologies. A lesson from the FEATI Project and from experience elsewhere is that farmers
will adopt improved technologies faster if they participate in the field assessment and in the fine-
tuning of the technologies through farmer-managed demonstrations, farmer research trials, field
days, multi-media information campaigns, and other similar activities. In the Project, early
technology adopters included the farmer cooperators and technology demonstrators involved in
these activities.




                                                 26
The development of ICT for farmers needs to be based on PPP. A business development plan
that began outlining a PPP strategy was prepared but not followed-up to. Instead, a MOA-focused
strategy was pursued without a clear and systematic approach to the inclusion of the private
sector being considered. The involvement of ISP and mobile phone companies can only work if a
business case can be identified in the first place, followed by a longer-term engagement in which
the public sector takes on the responsibility for controlling the quality of the information provided
through the system. It could also lead in the preparation of specific applications either at the
corporate level (e.g. e-Petani) or in collaboration with the private sector. Finally, an ICT strategy
should recognize that the extension worker has still a key role to play in helping farmers
understand the content and implications of the information received through the internet. Hence,
ICTs cannot completely substitute for an effective extension service at the local level. In this
regard, extension workers need to be part of an effective ICT strategy.

In the context of extensive decentralization, effective project management requires a system
of incentives being established by the implementing agencies to strengthen the CPMU’s
coordination role. The high staff turnover at the DPIU was a major challenge for the CPMU to
handle and undermined the Project’s effectiveness in building project management capacity at the
district level. The training of newly hired DPIU staff could only be a limited solution and a more
powered system of incentives is needed. Possible solutions include: (i) inclusion of a core team of
consultants at the DPIU level directly hired by the CPMU; (ii) the stronger involvement of
Provincial extension agencies, as they are able to interface more effectively with both the CPMU
and the DPIUs; or (iii) determining the district allocation of FMA grant funds using a set of
parameters that include the performance of the DPIUs. Performance in the collection and
consolidation of M&E data could also be included as a parameter.

While the sub district extension centers (BPPs) established under the Project improved the
extension workers’ outreach, the BPPs could be further developed into centers for
agribusiness development. With assistance from the central government, local extension
agencies should consider using the BPPs as a space where to favor matching of demand and
supply for agricultural services involving bot the private and the public sector. The demonstration
plots organized within BPP’s complex could be used by farmers and the private sector to conduct
adaptive trials of technologies demanded by markets. It would entail the use of BPPs to organize
events through which successful collaborations between the private sector and farmers could be
brought to the attention of other farmers. The use of BPPs could be quite important in developing
a mindset of local extension agencies in working as “broker of services” in the interest of farmers
and in promoting partnerships as an effective vehicle of agribusiness development.

Gender-sensitive strategies are needed to ensure a higher participation of women and the
poor, and should be encouraged in a follow-up project given the positive results on the
ground. The Project’s success in promoting women’s participation as stakeholders, decision-
makers and beneficiaries relied on a number of important provisions: (i) the identification of
specific training targets for the poor and both mixed men and women and women-only groups,
with many of the latter involved in food processing activities; (ii) the requirement that there
should be at least one female elected officer for each farmer group or farmer organization
involved in the Project; (iii) the requirement that one of the two village facilitators to be trained
by the Project is a woman; (iii) the inclusion in the Project’s results framework of the indicator
tracking the level of participation of women in project activities; and (iv) a M&E system that
collects, analyzes, and reports gender disaggregated data related to project activities.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The GOI recognizes that at Project entry there were diverse interpretations among the Project
implementers due to the lack of clarity in the logical framework. In addition, the devolution of
agricultural services to local governments had an impact on implementation due to different
priorities among districts beyond the control of the central Implementing Agencies (i.e.
AAEHRD, ICATAD, and CADI). Nevertheless, the Implementing Agencies indicated a change
direction on the agricultural extension services from production oriented to market demand
oriented can overall be appreciated in most of the BPPs in 40 of the districts included under
FEATI. Field extension workers have facilitated FOs in establishing partnership with private
sectors on marketing and technical assistance in developing their own enterprises. However, this
was not reported regularly and comprehensively by the DPIUs to the CPMU and it has become
evident after Project closure during the preparation of the Project Completion Report.

Lessons learned from the Project as stated in the ICR Report would be utilized for the future
operation by NCAE, particularly on strengthening existing FOs to be more viable enterprises. For
this purpose, Ministry of Agriculture has signed a MoU with the Ministry of Cooperative and
Small-Medium Enterprises in January 2011 on strengthening farmer federations towards
becoming cooperatives. This was followed-on by NCAE developing an implementation manual
on the “Empowerment of Farmer’s Economic.Institutions”.

Overall, the GoI claims that the Project has contributed to the transformation of the agricultural
extension and research system in the country towards becoming farmer driven and market
oriented. The GOI has also continued monitoring the progress of the Project towards the
achievement of its targets beyond EOP. The number of written (i.e. formal) partnerships – one of
the outcome indicators found to be not achieved in this ICR – measured as of November 2013,
amounts to 2,460 against an EOP target of 2,400. This is well above the number of 1,288
recorded at EOP, which in turn was based on data measured during the first quarter of 2013.
Hence, in view of the above circumstances the GOI proposes that the achievement of the
Project’s outcome to be rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The project was designed with five components, and the following are the summary of outputs by
components:
Component 1: Strengthening Farmer-driven Extension Services. This component was intended
to empower farmers to drive the agricultural extension agenda and to improve their capacity to:
(a) adopt new technology to better respond to market demand; (b) develop agribusiness
management skills; and (c) engage in public-private partnerships (PPP) at the village, district, and
provincial levels. The outputs of this component included number of participating farmers in
learning activities (FMA) are 623,169, and 344,874 of which or 55.3 percent implementing the
technology introduced in FMA. The project also provided training to 3,780 male farmer group
leaders from 128 male groups, and 3,810 female group leaders from 125 groups at village level
on organizational skills and leadership. At the project closure the number of village level groups
organized as farmer’s own enterprises were 872, and 98 of which were registered as legal entity
(having notary act). These village level groups were direct beneficiaries of village FMA grants.
The scale-up of FMA at district level was begun in 2012 and only piloted in 16 districts and
implemented by 45 district level farmer organizations which majority were newly established.
While scale-up at provincial level was only pilot in two provinces (Central Java and West Nusa
Tenggara) begun in 2013 involving two existing agricultural enterprises. During ICR mission,
these provincial FMAs were just started, and no outcome could be seen yet. The implementation
of district and provincial FMAs were supposed to be started prior mid-term and started in 13
former DAFEP districts, and five provinces. This target was not able to be achieved due to the
weak capacity of the project implementers in a new approach of scaled-up village FMA. The
main crops included in the FMA covered (i) food crops – mainly rice, and followed by maize,
cassava, and sweet potatoes; (ii) horticultures ( chili and vegetables); (iii) animal husbandry
(cattle, sheep/goat, poultry); (iv) estate crops (cocoa, coffee, and rubber). In addition, food
processing technology was dominated by women participants. FMA grants also promoted organic
farming and zero waste technology in crops and animal husbandry. The establishment of farmer’s
own enterprises at village was due to a requirement in marketing resulting in the development of
partnership between farmers and buyers. The number partnership established at village level was
1,288 written / signed contract. Some of the contracts were renewed annually, and some were
terminated due to some reasons. This data was generated from a monitoring data available in
www.featiindonesia.com set up during the project life. The agreement stated in the contract was
mainly related to the volume / quantity and quality to be produced, while prices were negotiated
at the time of delivery.

The allocation of village FMA grants is presented in Table 1.
Table 1. Number of proposals approved and budget allocation for village FMA by years in IDR.




By managing FMA grants, farmers / farmer organizations were able to determine their own
learning needs and identify service providers to address their own learning needs. Hence, field

                                                30
extension workers were no longer as the sole service provider available to farmers. However,
based on a BIA survey in conducted in 2012, the existence of field extension workers as
facilitators in farmer’s learning was still high (77.93 percent), followed by experienced farmers
(66.46 percent). In each learning activity, farmers were facilitated by more than one facilitator.
To allow extension workers be able to facilitate farmers in FMA implementation, the project
trained 159 field extension workers (permanent/government employees) located in FEATI
villages comprising 123 males and 36 females on FMA facilitation methods and process. While
contracted/temporary extension workers located in FEATI villages were trained in house by
trained permanent field extension workers. However, the project did not monitor the number of
trained contracted extension workers.
Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building : This component was
intended to facilitate the development of a demand-driven sustainable extension system, with
public and private extension service providers (including farmers) cooperating with farmer
groups and private enterprises for the mutual benefit of all parties. The training provided by the
project included : (i) farmer organization development participated by 30 provincial staff from 18
provinces; (ii) value chain workshop attended by 59 extension workers from 16 pilot districts
implementing district FMA focusing on the main commodities including animal husbandry, food
crops, and horticulture; (iii) agribusiness management for 25 provincial facilitators (TOM) from
nine Agricultural Training Centers, who later trained 2040 field extension workers ; (iv)
agribusiness practice in house learning at 707 BPPs participated by field extension workers ; (v)
overseas comparative studies for FEATI Project Managers and extension managers to India (10
participants); Korea (16 participants), and China (17 participants). In addition, each FEATI
district organized specific locally training on various technologies for field extension workers.
However, the project had no data on the total number of the trained extension workers.
The project improved the extension facilities including construction of 589 new BPPs, and
renovated 200 existing BPPs. These BPPs were equipped with office furniture, computers, and
soil testers. Each Bapeluh and Bakorluh were also provided a set of computer
Component 3: Enhancing Technology Assessment and Dissemination. This component was
intended to facilitate an uptake in the usage of farmer and market demand-driven technologies
and to improve the capacities of the Assessment Institutes of Agricultural Technology (AIATs) to
enable them to function more effectively. The outputs of this component included :
a.       Strengthening the capacity of AIATs was achieved by provision of trainings to : (i) 37
trained researchers (25 males, and 12 females) on Farming System Analysis (FSA); (ii) 32 trained
AIATs’ staff (16 males, and 16 females) from 17 provinces on Value Chain Analysis; (iii) 37
trained AIATs’ staff ( 19 males, and 18 females) on capacity enhancement for farmer
empowerment; (iv) 40 trained AIATs’ staff ( 20 males, 20 females) on scientific training; (v) 40
trained AIATs’ staff (36 males, 4 females) on audio visual aids; (vi) 44 trained librarian from 18
AIATs (26 males, 18 females); and (vii) 35 trained staff from 18 AIATs on e-information.
b.       Improving the linkages between researchers – extension workers – and farmers was
achieved by the conduct of (i) 192 FSAs were organized in 18 AIATs to field test 54 technologies
involving 218 farmer learning groups consisting 3,359 male and 1,222 female farmers, 298 male
and 141 female extension workers, and 177 researchers; (ii) 133 ARF workshop involving 1,374
farmer learning groups consisting 2,606 male and 650 female farmers, 952 male and 33 female
extension workers, 170 researchers and 118 extension agents of AIATs, and four research
centers; (iii) 230 demonstrations/ field trials involving 378 farmer learning groups consisting
4,031 male and 1,222 female farmers, 323 male and 90 female extension workers; 335
researchers and 181 extension agents of AIATs, and 108 researchers from research centers; (iv)
125 technology workshop involving 1,860 farmer groups comprising 3,040 males and 737 female
farmers; 2,070 male and 705 female extension workers, 351 researchers and 232 extension agents
of AIATs, and 15 researchers from research centers;


                                               31
c.       Developing linkages between researchers, extension workers, farmers and private sectors
was achieved by the conduct of : (i) 18 application technology meetings; (ii) 19 meetings on
agricultural technology information; (iii) 30 business meetings, and (iv) 85 field days.
d.       Technology dissemination was improved by an increase in number and improve quality
of media produced by AIATs. During the project life, there were 136,610 leaflets/folders, 16,003
posters, 28,215 brochures, 15,937 pocket books, 1,990 newsletters/magazines, 6,218 bulletins,
4,970 VCDs, and 89 other forms of media produced by AIATs and circulated to farmers and field
extension workers.
Component 4: Provision of Knowledge and Information Services: This component was intended
to address the issue of the lack of access to knowledge related to agricultural technologies and the
lack of linkages amongst service providers and between service providers and the user
community (farmers, traders, and entrepreneurs). The outputs of this component included : (i)
establishment of web base e Petani. This portal was utilized mainly by field extension workers to
share experiences and information regarding technology as well as consultation. However, this
portal was not effectively yet for individualized technical and market assistance. CADI as the
implementing agency of this component was failure to bring service providers to collaborate in e-
Petani utilization through SMS on mobile phones and GPRS devices; (ii) training on the use of e-
Petani was provided to extension workers and farmers representatives in 18 pilot districts ( total
number of trained participants was not available). Total users of e Petani as recorded up to 2012
including 1,900 extension workers; 1,350 farmers, and 5,123,558 other visitors which might visit
more than once.
Component 5: Extension Policy and Project Management Support: This component was
intended to support the drafting of the implementing rules and regulations of the proposed Law
on decentralized agricultural systems through multiple service providers, and provision of
management and implementation support for the project was also included in this component.
When the project was commenced, the proposed extension Law No. 16, 2006 was enacted. The
government allocated special government budget on drafting of the implementing rules and
regulations of the new Extension Law. Hence, no draft implementing rules and regulations
supported by the project.
To improve the capacity of the project implementers, the project trained 522 project staff
including project managers, financial officers, procurement officers, treasurer, and monitoring
and evaluation officers from 68 DPIUs, 18 PPMUs, and 18 PPIUs (AIATs). In addition, the
project produced project manuals and posters to disseminate information about FEATI at various
levels (central up to village).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic and Financial Appraisal of Farmer Organizations receiving FMA learning grants
within Component A

1.    Introduction

A field mission was conducted as part of the FEATI Project’s economic and financial assessment
from October 19 to 22. It collected data from a range of agro-enterprises (referred to as
enterprises in the text below) managed by farmer groups (FG) involved in the Project in four
districts. Representatives from the FEATI CPUM and MoA participated to the mission together
with representatives from the Bapeluh in each of the involved district, sub-district and village.

 The findings on the current status and future possible success of each enterprise are presented.
The two main components of the assessment are firstly the nature of the enterprise and its
participation such as production, value addition and marketing in one or more commodities, and
secondly a financial analysis of the outcomes from FEATI support. While the enterprises visited
are only a small number of all the enterprises supported under FEATI, findings are considered
good indications of pros and cons as outcomes from FEATI support, and highlight future
considerations useful to the design of a possible follow-up project .

2.    Methodology for enterprise appraisal

2.1   Net Present Value calculation

A NPV was calculated for four enterprises for which data is available. It is the actual IDR and US
dollar (USD) amount by which the enterprise’s current wealth is expected to increase if the
enterprise is carried out. The implicit counterfactual scenario is that no enterprise would have
developed without the support of a FMA grant from the FEATI project. While some farmer
groups (FG) engaged in bank loans, these were mostly via individuals although in either situation
the field mission did not have access to all financial information for the enterprise being assessed
or the loans or contributions by members, or time to verify all possible scenarios of bank lending
and repayment by the FG or individuals, and there were no precise record keeping by the
involved FG or FG individual members.

The discount rate takes into account the timing of the future cash flows that are available from an
investment. The longer it takes to receive a cash flow (often the reality in agribusiness), the lower
the value investors place on that cash flow. The greater the risk associated with receiving a future
cash flow, the lower the value investors place on that cash flow. Net cash flows of an enterprise
are estimated as End-of-Year (EOY). On the other hand, capital outlays are considered to occur
during the first and second Start-of-Year (SOY), depending on circumstances specific to each
enterprise. The discount rate used is 10.0% per annum, as this reflects the GoI government bond
rate average interest during the FEATI interval. The exchange rate used in the analysis is IDR
10,000 to US$1.00, as this more closely represents its commercial value during the life of the
Project.

2.2   Gross margin analysis and farmer group gross margin income

The field visits to enterprises reflect activities conducted by the FG as outcomes from the FEATI
project:


                                                 35
(a)      Capital outlays for the enterprise were considered to occur during the first and second
successive years, or combining the most reliable two years. The FMA learning grants were the
main source of capital outlays. The grants included some funding (no more than 30% as per
FEATI guidelines) for the purchase of equipment and productive assets. After reviewing possible
NPV outcomes, this was often not a reliable tool to assess the enterprise sustainability as the
capital outlays were either not quantifiable with precision or where they were actually spent on
was not entirely apparent. In some cases, FMA learning grants not entirely aligned with their
business objectives, or learning grants were terminated too early and before the enterprise had
reached the stage of being confirmed as sustainable. Many enterprises had yet to be legally
established; where they were, income is still derived by individual member households as no
accumulation of earnings by the legal entity is still taking place. Most of the enterprises are
evolving from a FG where farmers come together for sharing learning activities or access inputs
through other government programs. This is a consequence of the fact that most enterprises have
been established towards the end of the Project. Therefore these were still in their initial
development phase at the time the current field work was undertaken.
(b)      A more useful approach to assess as a ‘barometer’ of success has been a current gross
margin analysis. When divided among known FG members this would yield their potential
additional monthly or annual income as a result of FEATI activities. The information from all
enterprises assessed was generic. Not all income, direct or overhead costs were known. Net cash
flows of an enterprise are estimated from the net gross margin on sales from the enterprise being
assessed. The net gross margins are taken for the most reliable income years considered as most
reliable and representative of the activities performed by the enterprise. This is either for the
interval 2010, 2011, and 2012. 2013 was sometimes excluded as the assessment was completed
during October and three months of the 2013 calendar year remain. Where data exists and is
considered to reflect relatively accurately the enterprise’s business, data from 2011, 2012 and
2013 was included.

3.        Analysis of selected FEATI farmer groups and enterprises

A summary presentation of the analysis is presented in this section. For more details, a project
paper has been prepared and archived in the Project’s database.

The field visit was over four days to four differing districts, and included enterprises involved in
producing annual crops (rice, chili, shallot onions, seed and ware potato, mushrooms), livestock
(cattle, chickens, goats), and in food processing (cassava and mocaf based products), summarized
in Table 1 below.

Overall, the following considerations can be drawn with regard to the sustainability of the
enterprises supported with the FMA grants.

4.     Conclusions

The analysis conducted on the small number of enterprises reviewed for the ICR does not allow
drawing general conclusions. Nevertheless, it enables drawing some preliminary insights to better
assess the Project’s outcomes in the specific area of support to agro-enterprise development:
(i)      Support to the development of the agro-enterprises was provided too late to ensure
sustainable outcomes while the legal status of these agro-enterprises was yet to be defined;
(ii)     Although the grants resulted in additional income to FGs or individual HHs, this is often
not reflected back into the enterprise per se, as sales were mainly carried out individually by FG
members, indicating that managers do not yet understand how best to use the legal entity;

  The analysis should be understood as provisional as it based on the field survey conducted during the preparation of
the ICR. More in-depth analysis would require sharing the results with involved beneficiaries to further confirm the
findings, something that was not allowed by the timeframe within which the ICR had to be prepared.


                                                           38
(iii)    The most successful enterprises are those that consistently receive FMA learning grants
in the same thematic area (i.e. commodity or livelihood), while annual learning grants or changes
in learning topics led to less sustainable outcomes;
(iv)     In one circumstance, FMA grants were provided to a farmer organization that had been
established for several years. While the FMA grants helped further sharpening the business model
of that farmer organization, it seems that FMA grants would be best allocated to support the
development of newly formed organizations rather than well-established ones. Perhaps a higher
counterpart equity could be requested from the latter;
(v)      Some of the learning grants were used as capital inputs, although in combination with
learning activities;
(vi)     Few enterprises borrowed from banks, although some individual farmer group members
did take out such loans, mainly for seasonal finance, and some for capital expenditure. However,
enterprises showed increasing levels of confidence once they realized that they were able to
service loans. Some members of farmer group contributed to enterprises, with these contributions
effectively becoming ‘beneficiary matching grants.’

Support to enterprise development should have been conceptualized from the commencement of
the Project, and not near its end. Most of the farmer groups were just beginning to show good
progress at the time of the survey, making the transition from informal individual farmer groups
into FMA learning groups first and then into agro-enterprises established as legal entities. A
follow-up project should first conceptualize the grant type and purpose, encouraging matching
equity from the beneficiaries using training, enterprise development or value chain grants. A
proportional shift from Project grants towards farmer equity before project closure should be
encouraged to avoid creating dependency on external grants.

Corroborated by the results of field visits during supervision, these findings indicate that Project
funds could have been used more efficiently by focusing on the development of agro-enterprises
at an early stage of the Project rather than continuing with the less risky approach already piloted
under DAFEP.
However, the conclusion to be drawn is not that MOA should avoid investing in the development
of agro-enterprises managed by FG. Rather, the field work suggests that this is an area where
substantial progress can be made provided that the support from local extension agencies is
integrated with that of other services in the local agricultural units at the district and provincial
level. Benefits could also be generated through by the contracting of private business
development service providers or by developing partnerships with private commercial sector
involved in the processing, trading, or retailing of the FGs’ production.

In that regard clear shortcoming in the design of FEATI’s support to agro-enterprise development
is that for a majority of FG there was sole reliance on FMA grants to finance capital or
commercial input expenditures. There was no concept of matching grants by beneficiaries (except
in the form of labor inputs, which is a rather weak requirement, and then only in the measure of
10% of the value of the grant), or sliding scale to proportionally reduce FMA grants and increase
matching grants by beneficiaries during the life of the Project, on what effectively were value
chain or training or enterprise development grants. The selection of FGs for support could also
be improved by introducing a competitive selection process based on the preparation of business,
rather than learning, plans. In this regard, Indonesia can learn from the substantial experience
accumulated in the development of productive partnerships and rural alliances in a number of
other countries.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A.      Summary of Borrower’s ICR

The Borrower prepared the project completion report, and was reviewed and provided comments
by the Task Team for an improvement of the project completion report and lessons learned for
future operation of similar projects. The report was revised and submitted to the Task Team.
However, the report did not clearly explain issues as outlined in the Bank’s ICR Guideline. Here
is the summary :

Assessment of the operation’s objective, design, implementation and operational experience:

(a)     Agricultural extension has a very strategic position in agricultural development to
        facilitate farmers to help and organize themselves in accessing market information,
        technology, capital in improving farm productivity and efficiency in managing their farm
        business;
(b)     The Project design was relevant with the new Extension Law no 16, 2006 in building a
        market agribusiness oriented service system;
(c)     FMA approach introduced by the Project provided opportunities to farmer groups to be
        farmer’s own economic institutions which was previously oriented on agricultural
        production
(d)     The Project provided a new insight to the project staff on developing farmer’s own
        enterprises, and scaled-up beyond village level;
(e)     The Project introduced an integrated approach in addressing issues limiting farmers to
        access information and development resources.

Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives:

(a)     The implementation of FMA addressed farmer’s empowerment; agribusiness
        development, strengthening the approach of farmer to farmer extension, and the
        establishment of farmer’s own enterprises. District and provincial FMA should have led
        village level FOs to tap wider market beyond village level;
(b)     The improved skills and services of extension staff should have been followed with a
        transformation on their roles from production oriented service provider to knowledge
        broker on market and enterprise development;

Evaluation of the borrower’s own performance – focusing on lessons learned for future operation.

(a)     Incentive system for board members of farmer’s management unit. The selected board
        members were expected to dedicate their time to manage FMA. As a consequence, they
        many times left their farm activities to hired farms labors which increased their
        production cost. Because of this issue, some of FMA management units were not
        working well or re-elected. This would have been effective if the project allowed to
        provide incentive to board members as a compensation of their time dedicated to the
        project;




                                               45
(b)    Intensive supports to trained farmer’s facilitators. Despite the training provision from the
       project, intensive guidance to newly appointed farmer’s facilitators need to be well
       planned by Bapeluh as a future operation of FEATI;
(c)    High turn over of the project staff at central, provincial and district had a major impact on
       the performance of the project implementation. However, the central project
       management unit had no authority to keep the project staff for the whole project life;
(d)    The performance of monitoring and evaluation teams at various levels were improved
       gradually over the project life. The project was able to develop an on line monitoring for
       FMA implementation. Some districts have utilized this data for decision making in the
       allocation of FMA grant for each village, while some were ignorant on the important of
       the monitoring data.
(e)    The project established a Complaint Handling Unit at DG of AAEHRD recording all
       complaints about the project activities and was responded by a team set up by the DG
       AAEHRD. Various channels such as meetings, newspaper, leaflet, posters and web site
       were utilized to introduce and disseminate about the project activities and achievement at
       all central, provincial, and district levels. Since 2010 there were an increased in the
       number of districts receiving complaints as follows in 2010 – 5 districts, 2011 – 15
       districts; 2012 – 55 districts. This indicated that the project promoted awareness on
       governance and transparency to the public surrounding the project area ;
(f)    Safeguard issues were addressed by the project since the start of the project activities
       through the promotion of organic farming in the farmer’s learning activities supported by
       FMA grants. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) had been promoted in the majority of
       agricultural areas in Indonesia. However, in some horticulture producing areas the
       application of pesticides was still high, and land conservation was not well managed.
       Since, the size of the farming activities under the project was small, no significant impact
       on environment was found. The project with an assistance from an Environmental
       Specialist produced : (i) Training manuals on environment management; (ii)
       Environmental Management Manual; (iii) video on technical management for farm
       impacts; and (iv) leaflets on environmental impact management.

Evaluation of the performance of the Bank.

(a)    The Borrower indicated that clearance from the Bank on the required documents for
       project effectiveness was provided in timely manner.
(b)    The project implementers received guidance from the Task Team through regular
       supervisions. Recommendations provided by the missions were monitored by the Task
       Team. In addition, Task Team members participate in the project quarterly meeting and
       provided guidance on technical implementation of the project activities, procurement,
       financial, and monitoring and evaluation aspects.
(c)    The Task Team identified weakness of the project implementation, and provided
       technical supports to the project management : (i) in February 2012 the project was
       provided international Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant to improve the project data
       collection ensuring the project indicators were properly measured, and (ii) mobilization
       of international Agribusiness Consultant to review and improve the implementation of
       scale-up FMA from village level to district level. In addition, the Task Team assisted
       CPMU to link with an external service provider – REKADESA, to assess and facilitate
       early stage of farmer’s owned enterprises established under the project.


                                                46
(d)     There were weakness identified by the Borrower : (i) a gap in understanding the project
        documents by the project implementers and the Task Team leading to a different the
        evaluation of the project performance; (ii) a communication gap between the project
        managers and the Task Team Leader resulting in difficulties on the discussions of the
        project related issues, in particular during Bank’s missions; and (iii) the PAD was not
        meticulously assessed ensuring its consistency between sections. Hence, revisions of the
        PAD could have been avoided.

Description of the proposed arrangement for future operation of the project :

a)     The management of e Petani implementation had been handed over to NCAE which was
       integrated as part of Cyber Extension developed by NCAE. A content provider team was
       established in NCAE responsible to update the content of e Petani;
b)     The follow up on strengthening of established farmer’s own enterprises was handed over
       to an NCAE division of Farmer’s Institution and Enterprise Development.

partnerships involved written agreement. The EOP        attached empirical data that automatically corrected
target was the establishment of 2400 ventures and       the bank’s re-computation from
joint activities formalized through a contract          www.featiindonesia.com and it is proven that the
                                                        indicator was achieved.

Despite failure to achieve the PDO, the project         Considering the FEATI project has achieved 3 out of
experiences were recognized by the MoA as a             5 key indicators, and given impact to social

                                                        production orientation to a market orientation, the
                                                        achievement of the PDO should be considered as
                                                        Moderately satisfactory

3.4. Justification to overall outcome rating :        The project provided training on Agribusiness
                                                      Management to extension staff. The trained
                                                      extension worker developed manual to facilitate
                                                      farmers on marketing and enterprise management.
                                                      The project promoted brokerage role to extension
                                                      workers. Some BPPs in 40 districts facilitated FOs to
                                                      link with private sectors. This led to the achievement
                                                      of PDO.

3.5. Overreaching Themes, Other Outcome and           Development of farmers enterprises that initiated by
Impacts                                               FEATI already strengthened by MOA policy to
                                                      encourage formation and development of farmer’s
                                                      own enterprises. This reflected in the issuance of
                                                      Pedoman Pengembangan Kelembagaan Ekonomi

                                                      Enterprises) in 2012 which is followed up by the
                                                      issuance of Law No.19/2013 on Farmer Protection

                                          Based on the above arguments, it is proper and
                                          reasonable if we propose that the overall rating of
                                          FEATI be Moderately Satisfactory.
