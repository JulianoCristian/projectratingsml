                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank and borrower have agreed to restructure some project activities and outcome indicators to improve both achievement and measurement of development outcomes, and to
                         extend the project closing date by six months. Besides the results framework, the main agreed changes include: (i) canceling the activities related to the strengthening of the
                         agribusiness training centers and the agriculture in-service institutes (component 2); (ii) the cancellation of sub-component 5.1 (policy support to assist the implementation of the
                         extension Law); (iii) the substitution of District and Provincial Agribusiness Councils with District and Provincial Farmers Forums, respectively (component 1).
