A formal request for\n            restructuring was received from the Project Implementation\n            Unit (PIU) on October 25, 2010, followed by a request from\n            the Ministry of Finance on August 2011 and submission by the\n            Ministry of Agriculture to the Bank of a satisfactory\n            financing and action plans to support the project's\n            extension. The restructuring is intended to reflect the\n            necessary changes during implementation, harmonize the\n            various documentations compared to the original project\n            appraisal document (PAD), and simplify procedures. These\n            will help accelerate implementation and disbursement,\n            improve project performance and achieve the project\n            development objectives. This is a second order restructuring\n            and the major modifications being proposed are: (a) revision\n            of the design of farmer-managed grants (FMA) related\n            activities under component one to simplify the\n            implementation procedures; (b) cancellation of selected\n            activities under Component two and five; (c) decrease in the\n            number of participating districts from 71 to 68 (as a result\n            of 3 districts being dropped), and the number of\n            participating villages from 3,230 to 3,060; (d) modification\n            of key performance indicators and results framework; and (e)\n            a six months extension of the closing date from June 30th\n            2012 to December 31st 2012."}, "docdt": "2012-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
