The closing date for the project\n            will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June 30,\n            2013.The project has supported learning activities in nearly\n            3,000 villages to help empower farmers, commercialize\n            village production, strengthen interactions between key\n            stakeholders, and support farmers' agricultural\n            marketing and production initiatives. About 589 new rural\n            extension centers have been built and 200 existing ones\n            renovated. A key focus now is to scale up Farmer Managed\n            Activities to the district and provincial levels. The\n            closing date extension is necessary to: (i) strengthen\n            agricultural extension management and coordination and\n            improve the capacity of extension workers to facilitate\n            agribusiness development managed by farmers; (ii) implement\n            the plan for the scaling up of Farmer Managed Activities\n            grants from village to district and provincial level; (iii)\n            strengthen extension institutions in providing services to\n            farmers and farmer organizations; (iv) improve the\n            documentation and dissemination of the lessons learnt under\n            FEATI. This will be the second extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
