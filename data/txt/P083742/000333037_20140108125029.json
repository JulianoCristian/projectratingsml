Empowerment\n            through Agriculture Technology and Information Project\n            (FEATI) for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it\n            provided Farmer Organization or FOs with the opportunity to\n            improve their capacity in achieving their goals based on\n            market and agro-ecological conditions within which they\n            operate. Training provided to farmers and the first-hand\n            experience of FO members in participatory planning, proposal\n            preparation, Farmer-managed extension activity, or FMA\n            implementation, simple monitoring, and the financial\n            management of grant funds gave them confidence and the\n            incentive to manage their own learning activities and\n            business enterprises more effectively. Under the project,\n            the successful dissemination of technology depended on\n            strong collaboration between farmers, researchers and field\n            extension workers, using participatory, learning-by-doing\n            dissemination approaches and involving the provision of\n            intensive research support by scientists who developed the\n            technologies. A lesson from the FEATI Project and from\n            experience elsewhere is that farmers will adopt improved\n            technologies faster if they participate in the field\n            assessment and in the fine tuning of the technologies\n            through farmer-managed demonstrations, farmer research\n            trials, field days, multi-media information campaigns, and\n            other similar activities. In the project, early technology\n            adopters included the farmer cooperators and technology\n            demonstrators involved in these activities."}, "docdt": "2013-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
