                                  Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for the Indonesia Farmer Empowerment through Agricultural
   Technology and Information Project (Credit No.4260-IND and Loan No.7427-IND),
   will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013.

2.       The implementation of the project has recently improved as documented during
the sixth supervision mission (June 2012). The IP and PDO ratings have both been
revised from MU to MS between the fifth and sixth supervision missions. The project has
supported learning activities in nearly 3,000 villages to help empower farmers,
commercialize village production, strengthen interactions between key stakeholders, and
support farmers’ agricultural marketing and production initiatives. About 589 new rural
extension centers have been built and 200 existing ones renovated. A key focus now is to
scale up Farmer Managed Activities to the district and provincial levels. Efforts are also
underway to (a) strengthen linkages between research, extension services, and farmers,
(b) promote access to real-time supply chain and market information, and (c) disseminate
innovative rice crop management tools. The closing date was recently extended to
December 30, 2012, and the possibility of an additional six-month extension has been
discussed with the Ministry of Finance, BAPPENAS, and the Ministry of Agriculture
based on: (a) the Bank’s willingness to consider a further request for extension after
review of the progress of the Project together with the Borrower, noted in the Bank’s
letter to the Ministry of Finance dated May 2, 2012 (Letter No. CD-133/FEATI/V/2012);
and (b) the improvement in project performance assessed during the sixth supervision
mission (June 2012).

3.       The proposed closing date extension is necessary to: (i) strengthen agricultural
extension management and coordination and improve the capacity of extension workers
to facilitate agribusiness development managed by farmers; (ii) implement the plan for
the scaling up of Farmer Managed Activities grants from village to district and provincial
level; (iii) strengthen extension institutions in providing services to farmers and farmer
organizations; (iv) improve the documentation and dissemination of the lessons learnt
under FEATI. The Borrower has presented an action plan to complete the project along
the lines indicated above which has been reviewed by the Task Team and is acceptable. A
copy of the plan is attached to this paper.

4.     This will be the second extension of the project. The previous extension was
approved by the Bank in May 2012. The project closing date was extended by six
months. Cumulatively, the first extension and the one currently requested would amount
to 12 months.

5.     There are no outstanding audits at the time of the submission of this Restructuring
Paper. The latest audit was rendered as unqualified.
