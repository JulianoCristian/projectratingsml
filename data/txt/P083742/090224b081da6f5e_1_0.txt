                         The overall development objective of the project is to develop a demand-driven, market oriented agricultural services system, basedon partnerships between farmer
                         groups, public agencies and private sector enterprises at all levels.

                         The project has helped establish better extension and research and development (R&D) linkages between the public sector, private sector, and farmers in almost 3,000 villages

                         across Indonesia. Giving greater voice to farmers and involving private-sector stakeholders helped make extension services and R&D investments more responsive to the farmers'
                         needs and more relevant to market demands. The project developed a system through which financing was provided for more than 37,000 learning grants based on proposals made
                         by farmer groups, and that facilitated provision of other services by farmer organizations (FOs) to their members. More than 90% of beneficiaries were satisfied with the extension
                         services provided under the project, and 61% were satisfied with improvements in R&D. However, although overall the outcomes were satisfactory they were not as strong and the

                         evidence not as clear as anticipated. Some data on project outcomes, such as household expenditures, is still weak or inconclusive. On the number of services provided from farmer
                         organizations to their members only an indirect assessment is possible. While in some types of activities the involvement of the private sector, universities, NGOs, and local
                         government exceeded the project's goals, the number of formal joint activities and agro-enterprise ventures between FOs and the private sector fell substantially short of
                         expectations. In addition, farmers' uptake of information and communications technology applications developed under the project was very low, partly due to the lag in making the
                         systems operational. Finally, the 2006 Extension Reform Law remain incomplete as the associated implementation rules and regulations have so far not been issued. Furthermore, it
                         is not clear whether the FEATI program will receive enough support to remain viable in the short term.
