the Enterprise and Financial\n            Sector Adjustment Loan Project for Algeria were as follows:\n            outcomes were deficient, project sustainability was\n            uncertain, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the government's objective of moving towards\n            a market economy was unlikely to be realized without a\n            commitment to shrink the size and favored status of the\n            public enterprises sector. The general question is whether\n            the Bank should support a reform program that it feels is\n            unlikely to meet its stated objectives with the measures\n            proposed, yet has enough important elements, such as trade\n            and price liberalization and audits of economic agents, that\n            need to be carried out in any event. The best solution is\n            probably to be more realistic, and therefore more modest, in\n            establishing the objectives of the reform program to fit the\n            measures that the government is willing to undertake.\n            Second, legal reforms are easily undermined by failure to\n            promulgate implementing decrees or by other regulations or\n            practices that counter the spirit of the reform. While it is\n            difficult to ensure that this will not happen, Bank staff\n            should be aware of this risk and attempt to protect against\n            it to the extent practical, by specifying, for example,\n            legal requirements on implementing decrees and institutions."}, "docdt": "1996-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
