Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project consists of an enterprise component\n            interlinked with a financial sector component, accompanied\n            by supportive macroeconomic, legal and institutional\n            measures.  For the enterprise sector, the program supports\n            reforms in five key areas.  First, the rapid introduction of\n            competition through the use of market based pricing and\n            allocation systems. Second, a proactive approach to the\n            development of the private sector.  Third, the\n            implementation of the process of \"corporatization\"\n            for public enterprises aimed at separating the roles of the\n            State as owner and as regulator of economic activity.\n            Fourth, initiating the process of restructuring of public\n            enterprises, with a special focus on the largest loss-making\n            public enterprises, and fifth, developing a program to\n            mitigate the social costs of enterprise restructuring.  In\n            the financial sector, the loan will support reforms in four\n            areas.  First, limiting the role of the Treasury as an agent\n            for financial intermediation and reforming its relationship\n            with the Central Bank.  Second, rationalizing interest rate\n            and credit policies.  Third, establishing a prudential,\n            regulatory and accounting framework for the banking system\n            together with a strengthening of the Central Bank, and\n            fourth, starting a multi-year program to restructure the\n            portfolio of existing banks."}, "docdt": "1991-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
