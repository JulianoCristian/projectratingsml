To achieve this, the project\n            will strengthen the capacity of the Department of Fisheries\n            (DOF) of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) for\n            managing the sub-sector focusing on: formulation of policy\n            and management plans and their implementation: monitoring,\n            control, surveillance and enforcement; and the promotion of\n            the development of inland fisheries. This will require\n            strengthening of the DOF through reorganization and staff\n            training; stock assessment, and preparation and\n            implementation of management plans for the marine and inland\n            fisheries; improvement of extension and aquaculture\n            including the use of improved quality fingerlings;\n            establishment of a Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance\n            (MCS) system for marine and inland fisheries; and reform of\n            the policy, legal and regulatory framework in the sub-sector\n            to improve management, enhance private investment, and\n            promote sustainable catches of fish."}, "docdt": "1995-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
