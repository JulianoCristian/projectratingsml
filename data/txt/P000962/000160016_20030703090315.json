FISHERIES PROJECT AND\n            GENERAL SECTOR WORKS", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated as\n            satisfactory. Overall, the project has created a public\n            awareness of the critical state of fisheries resources, and\n            at the community level has empowered those stakeholders to\n            organize and take legal action to protect the limited\n            natural resources. The project established the legal,\n            administrative, and institutional basis, and laid the\n            foundation for further investment in the sub-sector.\n            However, sustainability is rated as unlikely under the\n            current circumstances. Lack of political will to enforce\n            regulations and remedial measures, the weak leadership\n            provided by the Department of Fisheries (DoF) and the\n            problems of collaboration, unless resolved, will continue to\n            hamper reforms and limit achievements of future operations.\n            Consequently, the project can be considered to constitute a\n            first phase of a longer-term effort in the sub-sector. The\n            overall performance of both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            evaluated as satisfactory.  Lessons learned included the\n            following:   1) Success in formation of the Community-Based\n            fisheries Management Committees (CBFMCs) depended on whether\n            the communities were established or transient, and on the\n            degree of collaboration and cooperation between DoF, the\n            Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA), and the district\n            assemblies (DAs) in lending support to the communities to\n            formulate management committees. 2) Although the limited\n            capacity of the DoF was correctly ascertained at appraisal,\n            the project designed was still complex, large and contained\n            too many activities. 3)  The aquaculture pilot component was\n            begun too late in the project to enable experience to be\n            accumulated and reviewed. Technical, economic, commercial\n            and socio-cultural data to support its development needed to\n            be done before, not during, project implementation. An\n            analysis will need to be done to determine the pilot\n            centers' environmental impact and potential for\n            attracting private sector investment before determining if\n            they should move beyond the pilot scheme status. 4)\n            Mitigation measures should have been more strongly built\n            into project design and adjusted during implementation in a\n            more forceful manner to offset the main risks to anticipated\n            benefits which were institutional, financial, and\n            biological. 5) An efficient monitoring and evaluation system\n            as well as earlier implementation of the fisheries\n            management plans would have benefited the project's\n            outcome and improved its impact.. 6) The critical role that\n            fisheries research plays in the management of limited\n            resources suggests that it could have received more support\n            for development and expansion under the project. In the\n            future, more consideration will need to be given to how the\n            various segments of the fishing sector could contribute to\n            funding and monitoring of fisheries research. 7)\n            Institutional strengthening and developing the capacity to\n            manage natural resources are long-term objectives. Although\n            the project laid the groundwork for these goals to be met,\n            continued efforts will need to be made over the longer term\n            beyond the project implementation period."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
