Project will establish the long-term sustainability\n            of the fisheries resource and thereby maximize its\n            contribution to the economy. To achieve this, the project\n            will strengthen the capacity of the Department of Fisheries\n            (DOF) of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) for\n            managing the sub-sector focusing on: formulation of policy\n            and management plans and their implementation: monitoring,\n            control, surveillance and enforcement; and the promotion of\n            the development of inland fisheries. This will require\n            strengthening of the DOF through reorganization and staff\n            training; stock assessment, and preparation and\n            implementation of management plans for the marine and inland\n            fisheries; improvement of extension and aquaculture\n            including the use of improved quality fingerlings;\n            establishment of a Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance\n            (MCS) system for marine and inland fisheries; and reform of\n            the policy, legal and regulatory framework in the sub-sector\n            to improve management, enhance private investment, and\n            promote sustainable catches of fish."}, "docdt": "1995-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
