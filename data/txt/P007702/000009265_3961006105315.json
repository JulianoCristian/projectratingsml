The project will continue efforts initiated\n            under the first Decentralized and Regional Development (DRD)\n            project to strengthen the participation of poor, rural\n            communities in local government investment planning and\n            implementation and to strengthen the institutional capacity\n            of state and local governments to support rural development\n            efforts. The project will thus: (a) improve basic\n            infrastructure and support income-generating investments in\n            poor rural areas of the eight states; (b) strengthen\n            institutional mechanisms and capacity at the federal and\n            state levels to plan, supervise, monitor, and evaluate rural\n            water supply, rural roads and other rural development\n            strategies with the participation of municipalities and\n            beneficiary communities; and (c) strengthen the capacity of\n            rural and semi-rural municipalities to finance, plan,\n            implement, and operate rural infrastructure investments,\n            using appropriate technologies and participation of affected\n            communities.
