Lessons\n            indicate that follow-up operations are usually successful,\n            as in this case, where the success of the Municipal Funds\n            Program, paved the way for the continuation, and expansion\n            of the Government's decentralization strategy. However,\n            unforeseen changes in the external environment may require\n            modifications to the project's operational\n            arrangements, when a flexible implementation approach,\n            supported by strong Bank's management commitment, may\n            prod success. But, the absence of careful supervision, and\n            institutional strength in project planning, and in the\n            decentralization of rural development resources, may\n            jeopardize the returns on community investments, with uneven\n            results in the coverage, and quality of infrastructure\n            services to be delivered. It is emphasized that simple\n            project design, and the promotion of a participatory\n            approach in the delivery of basic infrastructure, will\n            contribute to greater benefits, enhanced maintenance, and\n            sustainability of investments. Although municipalities, and\n            state governments demonstrated their ability to proceed with\n            project implementation without federal support, the\n            monitoring, and evaluation functions were largely lost from\n            the federal perspective, due to the absence of central\n            coordination. A joint effort by the federal government, and\n            the Bank is suggested, to review local legislation, and\n            institutional capacities in accessing relevant international\n            financing for decentralized programs."}, "docdt": "2000-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
