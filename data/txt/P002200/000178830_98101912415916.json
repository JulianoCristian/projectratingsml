project area, (b) make a\n            rational and more intensive use of available resources, (c)\n            improve farming and ranching techniques, and (d) integrate\n            the project into the local administration. The project would\n            comprise two major sub-projects, a \"Paysannat\"\n            sub-project and a Group Ranch sub-project, to develop\n            improved extension service for crops and livestock, improved\n            veterinary and animal production services, and technical and\n            social services. The project would utilize fully the\n            infrastructure built and expand the extension and destocking\n            programs started under the first phase project."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
