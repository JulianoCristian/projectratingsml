MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDk 34.4 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CRAD
FOR A ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a   proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Chad for SDR34.4 million (US$47.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would
be on standard 'DA terms with 40 years maturity and would finance a road
reconstruction project.
2.        Background: As  a result  of the  1978-1982 war,  most of  Chad's
modest  classified  road  network  of   about  7,300  km  suffered   severe
deterioration through lack of maintenance. At present, only about 30 km of
the 300 km of paved roads that existed before the conflict are still in
fair condition. The deterioration of the road network has resulted in the
complete isolation of economically important regions during the wet season
and rapidly increasing transport costs during the dry season when road
access is  possible.   As political  stability  was restored  and  economic
activity began to resume, the lack of good roads became an obstacle to
redevelopment of agricultural and  commercial activity countrywide.   Rapid
rehabilitation of the essential parts of the road network is a compelling
necessity and among the highest priorities of the Government.
3.        At  a  UNDP-sponsored  donors'  conference  in  1985,  the  donor
community pledged support for the implementation of a first coordinated
program of rehabilitation works on about 2000 kms of Chad's 3800 km
priority road network. According to initial schedules, this emergency
program was  expected  to be  completed  by the  end  of 1988.   All  roads
included in the program were to be rehabilitated to gravel road standard.
As work progressed, it became evident that preparatory studies had
underestimated  both  the  cost  of   reconstruction  and  the  level   and
composition of traffic, of which about 50Z are heavy trucks. The results
were excessively high maintenance needs on some of the roads rehabilitated
earlier,  and  a  cutback   on  the  overall   programmed  mileage  to   be
rehabilitated.
4.        Two important trunk roads  that were part of  the pre-war 300  km
paved road  system are  critically  affected by  the above  problems.   The
N'Djamena-Djermaya road (30  km) is a  key link in  the country's  northern
road system.   It was  originally paved  in 1969  and vas  among the  first
sections  to  be  rehabilitated  to  gravel  road  standards  with   French
Government  Aid  Agency   (FAC)  financing  in   1985.   However,  it   has
deteriorated rapidly again, due mainly to the r'avy traffic and poor soil
conditions. The second link connects N'Djamena to Guelengdeng (146 km),
which is the first leg of the N'Djamena-Guelengdeng-Sarh axis (535 km)
connecting the capital with the centers of industrial and agricultural
production in the southern zone. Initially paved in 1970, this section vas
expected to be reconstructed to gravel road standards as part of the
N'Djamena-Guelengdeng-Sarh  project  funded  (8.8  million  ECUs)  by   the
European Development Fund (EDF). Higher than anticipated reconstruction
costs limited rehabilitation to the Guelengdeng-Sarh section, leaving the



- 2 -
most heavily travelled portion of the road in such a seriously deteriorated
state that even intensive maintenance efforts ensure at best difficult
travel conidit;ons in the dry season. Bot1s roads are so broken up that it
is frequently necessary for traffie to leave the roadway and drive on the
shoulders or in the ditches or alternatively, to undertake lengthy and
costly detours through neighboring Cameroon.
5.        Rationale for IDA involvement:  None of the other donors involved
in financing the 2000 km priority road network rehabilitation are able to
fund the project works. IDA financing would pave these two roads, bringing
them up to a maintainable condition and a standard consistent with present
and fut-ure traffic estimates, after which they would fall under the
compr4hensive routine maintenance plan being developed under the ongoing
IDA Highway Maintenance Project.   To salvage at least  some of the  recent
improvements to the road base of the two roads and to prevent even further
deterioration, it is essential to start the works before the 1988 rainy
season.   This  will  result  in  considerable  savings  in  the  costs  of
reconstruction.
6.        In addition, the proposed project would support the  Government's
strategy for  the transport  sector as  a whole.   With IDA  assistance,  a
sector strategy paper and a six-year investment program have been prepared
and were presented to the donor community in February 1988. This strategy
focuses on (a) completion of the rehabilitation and maintenance of the high
priority road network; (b) improvement of air transport services; (c)
strengthening of planning and management capacity of both public and
private sector institutions involved in transport infrastructure and
services; (d) improvement of road maintenance financing and cost recovery;
and (e)  liberalization  of  transport tariffs  and  promotion  of  private
participation in the sector. Considerable progress has been made under the
ongoing  Highway   Maintenance  Project   in  strengthening   weak   sector
institutions, particularly those dealing with road maintenance.
7.        Project  Objectives:    The  proposed   project  would   complete
rehabilitation of the 2000 km of high priority roads identified by
Governinent and the donor community as essential for the resumption of
normal economic activity. It would also complement IDA's ongoing Highway
Maintenance Project (Credit 1728-CD).
8.        Project    Description:        The    project      would      finance
(a) reconstruction  to  paved  standards  of  the  N'Djamena-Djermaya   and
N'Djamena-Guelengdeng  roads  (176  km)  and  (b)  consulting  services  to
supervise   construction.    Total   project   costs   are   estimated   at
US$49.5 million equivalent  excluding taxes,  with a  foreign component  of
US$37.9 million  equivalent (76Z).   The government  contribution would  be
limited to 5Z of project costs, because the Government has extremely
limited financial resources to allocate among competing priorities.
Moreover, under the Government's integrated rehabilitation and maintenance
program for the priority road network, the emphasis has been on developing
Government capacity to finance routine maintenance out of fiscal revenues
on a permanent basis. Its contribution to road maintenance financing
amounted to CFAF 800 million in 1987. Various measures are being studied
to increase this amount up to CFAF 1,800 million in 1993, to cover the
routine maintenance  of the  whale 3800  km of  priority road  network.   A



tLealNadown ot costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements as well as the estimated IDA
dishursement schedule  are  shown in  Schedule  B.  The  timetable  of  key
pr(oject processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Chad
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No 7065-CD dated January 12, 1988 is also attached.
9.        Agreed Actions: During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following: (a) the Government will submit to IDA for approval by December
31, 1988 an Action Plan with an implementation schedule to carry out the
policy reforms and the investment program set out in the Sector Strategy;
and (b) Government would ensure proper routine and periodic maintenance of
the project roads in accordance with agreed maintenance standards and
submit annually to IDA for approval, not later than June 30, a maintenance
program. A condition of credit effectiveness would be that government has
made arrangements satisfactory to the Association for the operation of the
oountry's main quarry located at Mani.
10.       Benefits: Economic  benefits  under the  proposed  project  would
result from (a) reductions in the operating costs of traffic that continues
to use the roads; (b) significant reductions in operating costs resulting
from the rerouting of the traffic between N'Djamena and the southern part
of the country which currently detours through Cameroon at considerable
extra cost and inconvenience; and (c) the traffic growth generated by the
improved quality of the roads. The estimated rates of return are about 48Z
for N'Djamena-Djermaya and 36Z for N'Djamena-Guelengdeng. The overall ERR
is about 42Z. Non quantifiable benefits are the resumption of irrigated
agriculture and reforestation activities in the regions served by the
roads.
11.       Risks: There is some risk that traffic may not grow as  expected,
but the economy is showing signs of recovery and the levels of traffic
assumed in the ERR calculations are comparable with those existing before
the war. The risk that the roads would not be adequately maintained will
be minimized by the ongoing IDA and USAID projects which were specifically
designed to develop maintenance capacity. There is also a slight risk of a
renewed outbreak of hostilities in the north or at the borders in the
country, which would not make it impossible to complete the project.
Another drought would not affect the viability of the proposed investments,
as the transport cost savings associated with the delivery of external
emergency assistance would exceed the transport costs savings associated
with domestic trade flows.

12.       Recommendation:  I am  satisfied that the  proposed credit  would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association anci recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
