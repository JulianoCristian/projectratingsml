MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Chad
Road Reconstruction Proiect (Credit 1901-CD)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Chad -- Road
Reconstruction Project (Credit 1901-CD)".   Part II contains the Borrower's
observations.  The Credit (SDR 34.4 million; US$47.0 million equivalent) was
approved in April 1988, and the Project was completed, with one and a half year's
delay, in December 1991.
The Project aimed to finance the reconstruction of two road sections
(with a combined length of 176 km) that were identified under the 1986 Highway
Maintenance Project, and to reduce future maintenance and transport costs. In
November 1988, USAID provided a US$5.5 million grant with the understanding that
the project would incorporate a 66 km road which had been designed with USAID
financing.
The PCR describes how the project strengthened road rehabilitation
and maintenance capacity, how it contributed to the preparation of a
comprehensive Transport Sector Adjustment/Investment Project; and how it is
generating a sustainable flow of benefits.
The Project is rated as satisfactory and its sustainability as
likely. However, information is not sufficient to make a judgment concerning the
project's contribution to institutional development.
The project may be audited along with the Highway Maintenance Project
(Credit 1728-CD).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBIUC OF CHAD
ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
CREDIT 1901-CD
PREFACE
i.           This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Road Reconstruction Project for
which Credit 1901-CD in the amount of SDR 34.4 million (US$47.0 million equivalent) was approved
on April 26, 1988. The final disbursement was made on November 18, 1991 and the undisbursed balance
of SDR 17.93 was canceled.
ii.          The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the Sahelian
Department, Africa Regional Office. The PCR was based on the Memorandum and Recommendations
of the President (MRP), the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement, supervision reports, the
correspondence files and interviews with IDA staff. The Government telexed its comments to the Bank
on October 23, 1991; they are included in Part II of this report.
iii.         Shortly after the Credit became effective, the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) participated in the project through a Grant to the Borrower of US$5.5 million to
finance the construction of the Project roads, including one additional road.  IDA acted as an
Administrator of Funds on behalf of USAID. The USAID Grant Agreement between the Republic of
Chad and IDA was signed on March 21, 1989, and was fully disbursed. The last disbursement was made
on July 18, 1991.

REPUBLIC OF CHAD
ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
CREDIT 1901-CD
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
i.           The objectives of the Project were: (a) to ensure timely completion of the agreed high
priority program by reconstructing two formerly paved roads to re-establish urgently needed all-weather
access and unimpeded flow of goods and passengers on the main North-South corridor of the country's
road network; and (b) to reduce substantially future maintenance and transport costs (para. S).
Im=lementation Expeiec
ii.          The Project was prepared under Credit 1728-CD, which was a two year emergency road
rehabilitation program to reconstruct 2000 Ikm of high priority roads. Because of the higher than
anticipated cost of the program, IDA contemplated a supplementary Credit to cover the cost of the Project
roads but later decided to include them in a separate project financed by Credit 1901-CD (paras. 7 and
8).
iW.          The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended to include the rehabilitation of a third
road the financing of which was provided by USAID (para. 14).
iv.          Procurement was carefully supervised by the Bank. On April 24, 1988 a contract was
awarded for the entire reconstruction work to one contractor; however, a contract was not signed until
November 12 because of the delay in effectiveness of the Credit (paras. 15-16).
v.           Project works were satisfactorily completed by the end of 1991, one year later than
forecasted at appraisal (para. 18).
Resullts
vi.          The Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 1728-CD) and the subject Project were
designed to help the Government carry out its post-war reconstruction effort and strengthen its road
rehabilitation and maintenance capability. While focused on short-term needs, the two projects also
provided the Government and the Association with an opporunity to prepare a comprehensive Transport
Sector Adjustment/Investment Project consisting of an investment plan for the period 1988-93 and a
package of major policy reforms. Execution is progressing well and the project is about 30 percent
completed (para. 23).
vii.         The combined economic rate of return (ERR) of the two roads is 20 percent as compared
to the appraisal estimate of 42 percent (para. 25).



iii
Sustainabilitv
viii.         The project is considered sustainable (para. 27).
Findings and Lessons Learned
ix.           Given the difficulty of estimating costs, and Chad's precarious financial situation, delaying
the presentation of the Credit to IDA's Board until bids had been opened and costs re-evaluated was a
sound procedure (para. 10).
x.            The condition that the only quarry available to the project be placed under private control
was a wise move, given its low productivity under Government management (para. 11).
xi.           The Project, along with Credit 1728-CD, gave IDA the opportunity to prepare a detailed
strategy for the transport sector which formed the basis of a follow-on project (paras. 23 and 30).
xii.          As the Project was an extension of the on-going road rehabilitation works started under
Credit 1728-CD, the lessons learned on this project were applicable to the subject Project. Both projects
demonstrated that multi-component road projects can be successfully executed by a relatively
inexperienced but cooperative Borrower, if they were well prepared and closely monitored (para. 28).
xiii.         The Project (as well as Credit 1728-CD) was closely coordinated with other donors, both
in Chad and at donor headquarters, by IDA supervision staff (para. 29).

PART I. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Project Identity
Name:              Road Reconstruction Project
Credit Number:     Credit 1901-CD
RVP Unit:           Africa, Sahelian Department,
Infrastructure Operations Division
Country:            Republic of Chad
Sector:            Transportation
B.    Project Background
1.    As a result of the 1979-1982 civil war, most of Chad's small classified road network of 7300 km
suffered severe deterioration through lack of maintenance. The collapse of the road network resulted in
the complete isolation of economically important regions during the wet season and rapidly increasing
transport costs during the dry season when road access was possible. As political stability was restored
and economic activity began to resume, the lack of good roads became an obstacle to redevelopment of
agricultural and commercial activity countrywide.
2.    At a Round Table Conference in 1985 sponsored by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), the donor community pledged support for the implementation of a first coordinated program
of rehabilitation works on about 2000 km of Chad's 3800 km priority road network. According to initial
schedules, this emergency program, which included an IDA financed Highway Maintenance Project
(Credit 1728-CD, July 29, 1986, US$20.0 million equivalent), was expected to be completed by the end
of 1988. All roads included in the emergency program were to be rehabilitated to gravel road standard.
As work progressed, it became evident that preparatory studies had underestimated both the cost of
reconstruction and the level and composition of traffic, of which about 50 percent were heavy trucks.
The results were excessively high maintenance needs on some of the roads rehabilitated earlier, and a
cutback on the overall programmed mileage to be rehabilitated.
3.    Two important trunk roads that were part of the pre-war 300 Ikm paved road system were
critically affected by the above problems. The N'Djamena-Djermaya road (30 kIm) was a key link in the
country's northern road system. It was among the first sections to be rehabilitated to gravel road
standards with French Government Aid Agency (FAC) financing in 1985. However, it had deteriorated
rapidly again, due mainly to the heavy traffic and poor soil conditions. The second link connects
N'Djamena to Guelengdeng (146 km), which was the first leg of the N'Djamena-Guelengdeng-Sarh axis
(535 km) connecting the capital with the centers of industrial and agricultura production in the southern
zone. This section was expected to be reconstructed to gravel road standards as part of the N'Djamena-
Guelengdeng-Sarh project funded (8.8 million ECU's) by the European Development Fund (EDF).
Higher than anticipated reconstruction costs limited rehabilitation to the Guelengdeng-Sarh section,
leaving the most heavily travelled portion of the road in such a seriously deteriorated state that even



2
intensive maintenance efforts ensured at best difficult travel conditions in the dry season. Both roads
were so broken up that it was frequently necessary for traffic to leave the roadway and drive on the
shoulders or in the ditches or alternatively, to undertake lengthy and costly detours.
4.    According to the Memorandum and Report of the President (MP), the Project would complete
rehabilitation of the 2000 km of high priority roads identified by Government and the donor community
as essential for the resumption of normal economic activity. It would also complement IDA's ongoing
Highway Maintenance Project (para 2). This project had been designed as a short term emergency
project to strengthen weak sector institutions, particularly those dealing with road maintenance. The
project was satisfactorily completed in 1990 and is the subject of a PCR scheduled to be submitted to
OED by the end of 1991.
C.    Project Objectives and Description
5.    prjec Obiectives. The specific objectives of the project were:
(a)   to ensure timely completion of the agreed high priority program by reconstructing two
formerly paved roads to re-establish urgently needed all-weather access and unimpeded
flow of goods and passengers on the main north-outh corridor of the
country's road network; and
(b)   to reduce substantially future maintenance and transport costs.
6.    Proiect Descption. The project provided financial asistance for:
(a)   the reconstruction to paved standards of the N'Djamena-Djermaya road (30 kIm) and the
N'Djamena-Guelengdeng road (146 kim); and
(b)    consultant services to supervise the civil works.
D.    Project Design and Ornization
7.    The preliminary studies and detailed engineering of the two project roads were financed under
Credit 1728-CD. The geology of Chad makes seection of basic standards for road construction
particularly difficult as the country is flat and a large part of its area is exposed to frequent flooding. In
the south, the frequent and heavy rains entailed costly drainage systems, as well as the changing
hydrology of the Chari and Beoue rivers and Lake Chad. Lateritic soils suitable for road reconstruction
are found only in the south and east of the country. Even with generally low volumes of traffic, heavy
vehicles made up a sizable proportion and were commonly overloaded, which hastened road deterioration.
8.    In order to asses the standards to be adopted for road construction and mainternace under such
unfavorable road conditions, a specific study under Credit 1728-CD was made to determine the design
standards that would ensure all-weather trafficability while keeping maintenance costs within reasonable
limits. The detailed engineering of both N'Djamena-Djermaya and N'Djamena-Guelengdeng roads were
carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the design standards study. At one time, IDA
considered a supplement to Credit 1728-D as a means of financing the construction of the two roads.



3
However, in view of the time needed to carry out the detailed engineering, it was finally decided to
prepare a separate project '. ..
9.    Both roads were located in a region of silty soil, where the soil studies showed that gravel
surfaces were not appropriate because the rains caused leaching and subsequent washout of the road bed,
which necessitated extensive rehabilitation or reconstruction after each rainy season. It was concluded
that the roads should be paved and built on the existing alignments which were adequate. As these were
in flat to rolling terrain, only limited earthworks were required, and no major bridges were needed.
10.   Both the study and the detailed engineering were financed under Credit 1728-CD. Completion
of detailed engineering was a condition of negotiations of the Project. In October 1987, a pre-appraisal
mission went to Chad to expedite the processing of bidding and award of a contract for the detailed
engineering. Given the uncertainty over costs because of the infant natlure of the local construction
industry, doubts over the interest of outside bidders, and the severe financial constraints of the
Government, IDA held up presentation of the Project to the Board until bids from prequalified contractors
had been evaluated and contractor selection was underway.
11.   The only quarry where adequate road material was available was located at Mani 93 km north
of N'Djamena. In 1988 this quarry was operated by an autonomous public agency Office National des
Carribres (OFCA) and its productivity was low. The sector strategy adopted by the Government in
February 1988 included the privatization of OFCA. Because efficient quarry opention was essential to
ensure timely availability of least cost materials for road construction, a condition of credit effectiveness
was that the Government enter into satisfactory arrangements with one or several private partners to
operate the Mani quarry. This condition delayed effectiveness of the Credit, but was an appropriate
requirement under the circumstances.
12.   The organization of the Project was relatively simple. The civil works was carried out under
contracts awarded through ICB, and execution was supervised by the same consultants who carried out
the design. The Project, as was the case for the on-going project financed under Credit 1728-CD, was
designed to complement the efforts of other donors in the sector including the European Development
Fund (EDF), FAC, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Republic of West
Germany and Italy.
E.    Project ImDlementation
13.   Credit Effetveness. Credit 1901-CD was appraised in July 1987, negotiated in Chad Febniary
3-5, 1988, approved on April 26, signed on July 5, and became effective on November 4, 1988. The
Region proposed that IDA finance 100 percent of the costs of the Project in view of the serious financial
constraints being experienced by Chad. However senior management believed that in line with Bank
policy, Chad should make some contribution up to a minimum of 5 percent of the total cost. The
financing plan was accordingly revised to include Government financing of US$2.5 million. The Project
was executed under the responsibility of the Directorate of Public Works (DTP).

p         4
14.   In November 1988, USAID and IDA signed an agreement whereby USAID provides IDA with
a Grant of US$5.6 million to be used to reconstruct the project roads. A condition of the Grant was the
inclusion of the gravel surfaced Djermaya-Dandi road (66 km), which had already been designed with
USAID financing, as part of the Project. IDA was authorized by USAID to administer the Grant. This
arrangement was confirmed in a USAID Grant Agreement signed on March 21, 1989 by USAID and
IDA, in which the Djermaya-Dandi road was added to the Project description as Part C of Schedule 2
of the Credit Agreement. The Agreement for Credit 1901-CD was accordingly amended as of April 7,
1989.
15.   Procurement. Bank procurement procedures were followed in selecting a contractor for the four
lots (one of the two IDA financed roads was divided into 2 lots) of civil works including the USAID
financed road. Ten contractors were qualified out of twenty-five candidates as having the financial
capacity, experienced staff and specialized equipment to carry out the combined work 2. Following
prequalifications, bidders were asked to bid on two basic but equal technical designs relating to the type
of road base and surface. After bid analysis, the Government recommended an award that would have
shared the work between the two lowest bidders with one following the first design for lots 1 and 2 and
a second contractor following the second design for lots 3 and 4. However, the Association concluded
that bids had been called for two equal solutions, and thus the contractor submitting the lowest total bid
should be awarded the contract 3. After some delay, the Association's proposal was accepted by the
Government.
16.   The lowest evaluated bidder was awarded the contract for the civil works on April 24, 1988.
However, the contract was not signed until November 12, 1988, a few days after the Credit became
effective. Mobilization of the contractor was delayed because of difficulties in obtaining customs
clearances of the contractor's equipment into Chad and delays in obtaining bitumin through Nigeria.
These were resolved and work got underway on April 12, 1989. The same consultant who carried out
the design, was awarded a contract for supervision. The National Laboratory of Public Works and
Housing (NNBTB), which has been established under Credit 1728-CD, assisted the consultants. Two
Chad engineers were assigned as counterparts to be trained by the supervision team and gain on-the-job
experience.
17.   Execution.  The original design of the Djermaya-Dandi road called for a gravel surface.
However, after further soils studies, it was agreed by IDA and the Borrower that in view of the poor road
base materials available, the road should be paved with a single surface dressing. The contract was
accordingly arnended. In view of the extra cost of the paved surface, IDA agreed to finance it with
surplus funds available in Credits 1901-CD and 2007-CD.
18.   By January 1990, work was progressing satisfactorily and about one-third of the contract had been
completed. By mid 1990, about 50 percent of the work had been completed and the Project was expected
to be completed by February 1991. Construction was delayed by a few months because of a coup in
December 1990. The work was completed near the end of 1991, 18 months later than forecasted at
appraisal because of additional works completed within the framework of the appraisal cost estimate.

21.   Project Costs, 'he Project was completed within the original cost estimate as shown in Table
D.
F.    Project ResultL
22.   The Project was an extension of the Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 1728-CD). It was
necessitated by the more rapid deterioration of the high priority road network due to heavier truck traffic
than originally anticipated, thus raising the costs substantially of Chad's road reconstruction effort
following the war.
23.   The Highway Maintenance Project and the Road Reconstruction Project were designed to help
the Government carry out its post-war reconstruction effort and strengthen its road rehabilitation and
maintenance capability. While focused on short-term needs, these two projects also provided the
Government and the Association with an opportunity to discuss major policy issues and longer-term
options, which in turn led to the preparation of a comprehensive Transport Sector Adjustment/Investment
Project (TSAID) consisting of an investment plan for the period 1988-93 and a package of major policy
reforms. This strategy focuses on completing the rehabilitation and securing the maintenance of the
priority road network, strengthening the planning and management capacity of sector institutions,
improving road maintenance financing, promoting private participation in the sector, and liberalizing road
transport activities. This project (Credit 2007-CD, US$60.0 million equivalent, June 21, 1989) is about
70 percent completed. Execution is progressing well.
24.   Economic Results. The Project represented a continuation of Chad's post-war reconstruction
effort began under Credit 1728-CD by providing for the rehabilitation of three important roads.
25.   The combined economic rate of return (ERR) of the two original roads in the project was 42
percent. Following completion of the two roads, the re-evaluated ERR was 20 percent according to the
consultants. Traffic on the N'Djamena road has risen from 150 vehides/day (vpd) in 1987 to 380 vpd
in 1991. On the N'Djamena-Guelengdeng road section, traffic rose only from 120 vpd to 151 vpd in
1991, because of the poor state of the Guelengdeng-Sarb and Guelengdeng-Moundou roads. While the
latter two roads are regularly maintained to earth road standards, they have somewhat restricted the
development of traffic on the project roads.
26.   As the Djermaya-Dandi Road was added to the Project l    it was appraised (pra 14) no
estimate of its ERR at the time of preparation is available. However, it served as the northern extension
of two IDA financed roads. It provided access to the Mani quarry through a potentially productive region
to the shores of Lake Chad.
G.    Project Sustainabiliq
27.   The project would appear to be sustainable given the good progress being made on the follow-up
project which is concentrated on insuring adequate maintenance of the priority road network (para. 23).

H.  IDA Pefrman
28.   IDA performed well in broadening the coverage of the rehabilitation works under Credit 1728-
CD, when it became evident that this project could not finance all the roads in the high priority program.
Nevertheless, the additional roads were studied and designed under Credit 1728-CD. Thus, they were
readily incorporated in the follow-on road reconstruction project so that the two projects were
complementary. Both projects demonstrated that multi-component road projects can be successfully
executed by a relatively inexperienced but cooperative Borrower, if they are well prepared and closely
supervised. Use of IDA resources is given in Table F. The goal of both projects to strengthen Chad's
road rehabilitation and maintenance capability was achieved.
29.   The close coordination with other donors, both in Chad and at donor headquarters, initiated by
IDA under Credit 1728-CD continued under the present Project.
30.   Procurement under the Project was satisfactorily carried out and construction was adequately
supervised by IDA staff familiar with both 1728-CD and 1901-CD. While these projects were underway
as an emergency post-war reconstruction effort, IDA took the opportunity to prepare a longer term
comprehensive Strategy Paper as outlined in para 23. Works outlined in this Paper formed the basis for
the on-going project being carried out under Credit 2007-CD.
I.    Borrower Performance
31.   Borrower performance, which was good under Credit 1728-CD, continued to be satisfactory
under the Project. The annual audits revealed that the project accounts were generally satisfactory.
L.    Project Documentation
32.   The Project is well documented in the MRP, the SAR and the Credit Agreement. However, the
correspondence files do not contain a Project Brief, Issues Paper or Decision Memorandum. The Project
was originally considered for financing as a supplement to Credit 1728-CD and processed a such up to
the RVP level including a 'Draft Memo for the President to the Board of Execudve Directors". Thus
it was not considered necessary to repeat the preparatory stages which had already been covered in the
documentation of Credit 1728-CD '. The Project correspondence fias contain a substandal number of
misfiled documents relating to the preparation and execution of Credit 2007-CD, a follow-on project.

PART II. PRQJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Performance of the Bank
,,essons learned
1.    This being the first large investment credit for road infrastructure in over ten years, we think that
the Bank's support, through all staff having participated in the Project, was particularly efficient and
beneficial.
2.    From identification through completion of the Project, which formed an essential component of
the emergency program of 1986, IDA's professional staff facilitated the Project's smooth execution,
through their attitude of openness and dialogue, and through their experience and technical competence.
3.    As the Project dealt with large infrastructure workcs, the quarterly supervision missions allowed
us to resolve numerous important technical problems. In this context, we consider this frequency
particularly well suited.
Performance of the Borrower
4.    Following the restructuring undertaken upon the advice and support of IDA, we think that the
actions taken, in concertation with Bank staff, were appropriate, and, when necessary, allowed us to
adopt adequate arrangements conforming to the Project's objectives.
5.    In this context, the services provided by consultants, who, while efficiently assuring their
surveillance of the works, allowed us to improve the technical level of our staff, particularly that of the
younger civil servants, through the training they bestowed. This partnership between international and
local staff must be continued and amplified so that younger staff may become capable of assuming the
administrative and technical responsibilities which must be given them.
6.    The technical and financial management of the credit benefitted from experience acquired during
the execution of the Road Maintenance Project (Cr. 1728-CD). In particular, our technical services'
better Inowledge of Bank procedures enhanced our efficiency. From our point of view, it is desirable
that our higher level civil servants pursue their training in order to know better their IDA ceunterparts,
as much technical u financial, so as to always know how to cope with the many constraints nd technical
or financial obligations they are facing.
Relations with the Bank
7.    The coordination and cooperation between the Chadian and Bank staff were excellent throughout
the life of the Project.
8.    The advice and support given by the Bank allowed all Project components to progress well and
instituted a constructive and understanding dialogue between the two parties.



8
9.     The diaogue and frequent exchanges of view were, to us, one of the dominating factors in
attaining all the objectvs of,the Project.
Performance of Cofinancders
10.   The component financed by USAID was executed to the entire satisfaction of Government.
11.   The cofinancing planned was delivered on time and no significant difficulties hindered the
progress of this part of the Project.
12.   Government particularly appreciated the IDA mission concerned with the technical and financial
management of the USAID-financed component. For us, having only one representative was one of the
very positive elements with allowed for the Project's success.
