Reconstruction Project for Chad are to ensure timely\n            completion of the agreed high priority program by\n            reconstructing two formerly paved roads to reestablish\n            urgently needed all weather access and unimpeded flow of\n            goods and passengers on the main North-South corridor of the\n            country's road network. They also include reducing\n            substantially future maintenance and transport costs.\n            Specifically, this project would provide financial\n            assistance for the reconstruction to paved standards of the\n            N'Djamena-Djermaya road and the\n            N'Djamena-Guelengdeng roads, and finance consultant\n            services to supervise civil works."}, "docdt": "1988-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
