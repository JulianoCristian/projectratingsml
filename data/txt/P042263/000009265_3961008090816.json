Regulation and Public Enterprise Reform Technical Assistance\n            Project are to: 1) assist the Sri Lanka Telecommunications\n            Authority (SLTA) in its transition to a more independent\n            regulatory Commission and strengthen its regulatory\n            authority; 2) assist SLTA in: (a) improving its\n            administrative and technical capabilities to plan and\n            control the use of radio frequency spectrum; and (b)\n            establishing a computerized radio frequency management and\n            monitoring system; and 3) facilitate the divestiture of\n            government owned enterprises, including Sri Lanka Telecom\n            (SLT), by strengthening the technical and administrative\n            capacity of the Public Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC).\n            The project consists of two components: 1) technical\n            assistance for the strengthening of SLTA, including: (a) a\n            frequency management and monitoring system, with hardware,\n            software, expert assistance during the initial years of\n            operation, and staff training; (b) consulting services to\n            assist SLTA in selected studies on sector regulation; and\n            (c) staff training; and 2) assistance to PERC in financing\n            consultants and financial advisors for specific transactions\n            and strengthening of the PERC Secretariat (office equipment,\n            training, travel, etc.)."}, "docdt": "1996-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
