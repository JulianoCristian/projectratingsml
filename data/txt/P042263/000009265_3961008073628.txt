MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.            I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) for SDR 10.4 million (US$15.0 million equivalent) to
help finance a Telecommunications Regulation and Public Enterprise Reform Technical Assistance Project. The
proposed credit will be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years including ten years of grace. The
proceeds of the credit will be used to strengthen the Sri Lanka Teleconununications Authority (SLTA), for the
improvement of the telecommunications sector regulation, and the Public Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC),
for the privatization of public enterprises.
2.            Country Background. In recent years, Sri Lanka's economy has grown at about 5.5% per
annum primarily through rapid expansion of the export industry and service sectors. The economic
liberalization and privatization efforts over the last two decades have shifted the economic focus from the
public to the private sector. The private sector is now the principal source of investment and growth,
accounting for 78% of gross national product (GDP) and 63% of aggregate investment. Private sector
manufacturing output is growing at around 14% annually, while public sector output is shrinking. As a
result, Sri Lanka now has the highest exports of manufactured goods (in per capita terms) among the low
income countries. Income growth and the changing structure of the economy has led to a rapid growth in
denand for telecommunications services and an increased emphasis on quality.
3.            Sector Background. The main operator of telephone services, Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT),
was created under the 1991 Telecommunications Act out of the former Telecommunications Department
and has a monopoly on basic, wired voice services. The present telephone density of about 1 per 100 is at
the lower end of what would be expected for a country at Sri Lanka's income per capita. Presently, SLT
has about 200,000 subscribers and a waiting list of nearly as many applicants. Despite recent major
network expansions and service improvements, SLT will not be able to catch up with demand on its own.
Private investments and operations are expected to play an increasingly important role in the provision of
telecommunications services. In 1994, IDA prepared a telecommunications sector report' which provided
the framework for IDA's dialog with GOSL on further reform of the sector. The main conclusions of the
sector reform study were to promote competition, strengthen regulation, and privatize SLT.
4.            The 1991 Telecommunications Act opened up the market to private sector investments and
operations and created SLT and SLTA under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MOPT). Sri
Lanka now has one of the most liberalized telecommunications markets in Asia. The legal and regulatory
framework was established as part of the preparation of the 1991 Second Telecommunications Project (Cr.
2249-CE), funded by Project Preparation Facilities, and has contributed to a unprecedented increase in
private investments and operations of telecommunications services. As a result, there are now four mobile
cellular operators, five paging companies, three data transmission service providers, four companies
providing public card phone services and one internet service provider. There are also hundreds of private,
currently unregulated, resellers of SLT services called 'telephone bureaus" providing telephone, fax,
copying and other services.
1 Strategic Options for the Telecommunications Sector, Report No. 12464-CE, Green Cover dated March 16, 1994.



- 2 -
5.           In 1994, the number of cellular subscribers doubled and 40%  of all new telephone
subscribers (SLT's wired as well as cellular) were connected to cellular services. At the end of 1995, there
were about 50,000 cellular subscribers, or about 20% of all telephone subscribers in Sri Lanka (including
SLT). This is one of the highest percentages in the world and partially reflects SLT's inability to satisfy all
demand for service. Competition between the four licensed cellular operators has led to some of the lowest
tariffs in the region, and cellular services are now increasingly seen as a credible alternative to SLT's wired
services, especially by business subscribers.
6.            To reduce unsatisfied demand for service more quickly, GOSL recently decided to license
two additional private operators for domestic basic telecommunications services which will compete with
SLT. These operators will utilize wireless technologies for the rapid and cost-efficient expansion of basic
services. Proposals from potential licensees were opened at the end of November 1995 and licenses were
awarded in February 1996. Competition between SLT's wired and private radio-based networks is, thus,
becoming a reality. Already existing private radio based services, including existing mobile cellular
telephone networks, have sharply increased the use of the radio frequency spectrum. There are also six TV
channels and a number of public and private sound broadcasting stations. As a consequence, SLTA's work
load as regards radio spectrum allocation, licensing, billing and enforcement activities has grown
substantially. Further, the new private wireless telecommunications services will result in additional
demands on the radio frequency spectrum. These developments make it necessary to strengthen SLTA,
especially its radio frequency management capabilities. The increased number of operators and competition
in the local as well as in long-distance services, also makes it necessary to strengthen SLTA's capabilities
regarding interconnection and revenue sharing arrangements between operators.
7.            While GOSL has embarked on an ambitious privatization program  of state-owned
enterprises, the results so far are limited. The first round of privatization under the previous government
concentrated on small and medium size industrial enterprises. The impact of this program in reducing
government ownership and producing fiscal benefits was marginal. In early 1995, GOSL relaunched the
privatization program and expanded its scope to include large government-owned manufacturing
enterprises, insurance companies, financial institutions, the airline, and public utilities (power, gas and
telecommunications).
8.            The recently created Public Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC) is the government
agency responsible for implementing this privatization program. Its function is to coordinate and implement
GOSL policy decisions to encourage the private sector to invest in public ventures where there are clear
benefits to Sri Lanka in the form of additional capital, new technology and promotion of exports. GOSL
completed the sales transaction of Colombo Gas for US$37.0 million in October 1995 and plans to start the
privatization of banks and insurance companies, followed by Lanka Electricity Corporation and SLT. IDA
support under the proposed project will enable PERC to engage the services of professional advisors to
carry out the necessary studies for policy and strategy formulation, pre-reform packaging and
implementation of privatization transactions.
9.            Sector Issues. SLTA has not been able to keep up with the rapid expansion of the
telecommunications sector over recent years. Its largely manual systems for radio frequency assignment,
monitoring and billing are inadequate given the increase in radio based services. This has resulted in
deficient billing and lost revenues as well as illegal use of frequencies and interference.



- 3 -
10.          SLTA generates over US$3.0 million per year in license and other fees charged to the
operators and its operating costs are less than US$1.0 million. However, as a GOSL department, SLTA
has very little financial autonomy, its revenues go to the Treasury and its expenditures are provided for
through the GOSL budget. Staff benefits are govemed by GOSL's rules for departments and are
substantially below those for the private sector and SLT, which is a state owned corporation. This makes it
difficult for SLTA to retain suitably qualified staff for sector regulation, which increasingly makes use of
highly sophisticated equipment. Some regulatory aspects listed in the 1991 Telecommunications Act have
not been fully implemented due to SLTA's limited resources, e.g., consumer protection, anti-competitive
behavior and monitoring of operator performance. SLTA currently has 120 approved staff positions, based
on existing manual procedures, but has filled only about 70 of them. With the computerized radio
frequency management system to be installed under this project, SLTA expects to manage all its regulatory
functions with less than 100 staff.
11.          MOPT appoints the Director General of SLTA each year and may veto SLTA's regulatory
decisions. MOPT also oversees SLT's operations. This may lead to undue political interference and
conflicts of interest. For example, there have been complaints that SLT's radio based activities have been
given priority over those of private operators. Further, the scope and work load of SLTA is too much for
one Director General. To address the above issues, GOSL decided to amend the 1991 Act, converting
SLTA into a more independent Commission thus ensuring adequate financial autonomy outside of the
govenmment's budget and strengthening its regulatory authority. The Commission would be headed by five
commnissioners specialized in different aspects of regulation, e.g. technical, legal and commercial. The
amendment of the 1991 Telecommunications Act was drafted and reviewed by the Cabinet. On February
1, 1996, the Cabinet decided to go ahead with the amendment bill which is being prepared for
Parliamentary approval.
12.          PERC was established as a presidential task force in March 1995 to design and implement
GOSL's privatization program. In December 1995, a bill was enacted making PERC a statutory body
accountable directly to Parliament and audited by the Auditor General. Under its new status, PERC may
also, in addition to its privatization responsibilities, take over management of badly run state owned
ventures. PERC has a strong Board that, together with its legal status, should ensure adequate autonomy im
operations. However, PERC faces budgetary constraints, lacks qualified staff and know-how and needs
consultants and professional advisors to assist in carrying out the reform program. GOSL, therefore,
requested IDA support to assist: (a) PERC to carry out GOSL's privatization program, and (b) SLTA to
strengthen the telecommunications sector regulation.
13.          Project Objectives. The primary objective for the telecommunications component of the
project is to support continued reform and efficient development of the sector by strengthening sector
regulation and its institutions and provide for the efficient allocation and use of the radio frequency
spectrum. The project will also promote private investments, operation and competition in the provision of
telecommunications services in Sri Lanka. The main objective of the PERC component is to facilitate the
divestiture of government owned enterprises by providing expert advice and strengthening the technical and
administrative capacity of PERC. In addition to fiscal benefits, the sale of state owned enterprises will lead
to efficiency improvements.
14.          Project Description. The project will have two components: The first provides assistance
for the strengthening of SLTA's regulatory and institutional capabilities, comprising: (a) a frequency
management and monitoring system, including hardware, software, expert assistance during the initial
years of operations, and staff training (about US$15.3 million); (b) consulting services to assist SLTA in
studies of tariffs, service quality, market structure, and other sector regulation issues (about US$0.9



-4 -
million) and training of staff (about US$ 0.3 million). The second component will provide assistance to
PERC consisting of: (a) consultants, financial advisors and experts for specific privatization transactions
(about US$4.2 million); (b) marketing expenses for transactions (about US$0.8 million) and (c) training of
PERC staff (about US$0.1 million).
15.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. PERC was established with IDA support and continued
IDA involvement would ensure its proper staffing and efficient operation. GOSL has accepted the
conclusions of the 1994 telecommunications sector report (see para. 3) and the proposed project would
enable GOSL to implement the recommendations of this report. IDA's prior involvement in Sri Lanka's
telecommunications sector, and its experience in similar projects elsewhere, e.g., Mexico, Philippines,
Venezuela, and Pakistan, makes it well suited to assist GOSL in its reform efforts. GOSL would also gain
from IDA support in identifying suitable means to increase the flow of private capital, management and
technology for the expansion and improvement of Sri Lanka's infrastructure.
16.           Lessons Learned  from  Previous IDA  Operations. The  IDA  supported  Public
Manufacturing Enterprises Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2185-CE) of 1990 initiated GOSL's privatization
program and was successful in the privatization of the textile sector. IDA has been involved in two
telecommunications project in Sri Lanka. The first project (Cr. 1020-CE closed in June 1986) was
generally successful in separating the telecommunications and postal departments and supporting the
expansion of the telephone network. The second project (Cr. 2249-CE) is being implemented. It is currently
rated a problem project on implementation status solely because of a major delay associated with the
resolution of an issue over procurement of local networks. This issue is being resolved. It should result,
therefore, in an upgrading of the project and quick acceleration in disbursement.  The projected
development impact remains satisfactory. In addition to network expansion, telecommunications sector
reforms continued under this project through the 1991 Telecommunications Act, which separated the
service provider (SLT) from the sector regulator (SLTA). The telecommunications sector report (see para.
3) concluded that liberalization of the sector had progressed very well and that the new legal and regulatory
framework had contributed to an impressive increase in private investments and competition in the
provision of telecommunications services. However, the report also concluded that the success of sector
liberalization had created new demands on SLTA that it had difficulties to cope with. Moreover, changing
technology and global changes in market structure offered the opportunity for further gains through
enhanced competition and privatization of SLT. By supporting the proposed project, IDA would continue
to play a critical role in the telecommunications sector reform process initiated under previous projects and
facilitate increased private investment and competition under suitable regulation in the provision of
infrastructure services.
17.           The Bank's experience with similar projects outside Sri Lanka provided a relevant lesson.
In Mexico, the software did not perform properly, and this caused problems in the operation of the whole
frequency management system that have yet to be solved. The lesson is that the main radio frequency
management system should be procured in one package, including software, initial assistance in operations
and guarantees by a reputable supplier to ensure its proper functioning.
18.          A 1995 review indicates that the Bank's experience with technical assistance projects in
South Asia has not been altogether positive. That review also recommended concrete measures to improve
the performance of technical assistance: technical assistance should be designed as part of a broader
strategy for institutional development; borrower commitment must be assessed carefully and tested through
up-front action; monitoring indicators should be introduced; and so on. These measures have been
incorporated into the proposed project. In particular, suitable performance benchmarks have been identified
to monitor project progress and facilitate early corrective actions, if necessary.



- 5 -
19.          Country Assistance Strategy. The proposed project is consistent with IDA's Country
Assistance Strategy, which, inter-alia, supports the privatization of public services and the establishment of
an enabling legal and regulatory framework for private investments and operations. IDA's Country
Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Executive Directors on December 12, 1992 and is currently being
updated for Board discussion on May 14, 1996. The public enterprise reform component will support
GOSL's privatization program for state-owned enterprises. The project is also consistent with IDA's
strategy in the telecommunications sector which calls for shifting the Government's role from ownership
and operations to policy-making and regulation, promotion of efficiency and service quality, and increased
private sector participation in investments and competitive provision of services. Improved and expanded
telecommunications services will contribute to economic growth and poverty alleviation.
20.          Project Implementation. The Borrower would be GOSL and the implementation agencies
SLTA and PERC. A detailed design of the radio frequency management and monitoring system has been
prepared by consultants with the help of a Japanese grant (TF023104). SLTA has prepared an
implementation plan. An amendment to the 1991 Telecommunications Act has been drafted and terms of
reference for consultants to strengthen SLTA's regulatory systems are under preparation. For the PERC
component, Institutional Development Funds (IDF) have been used to prepare an operational plan and
assist in the preparation of the most immediate privatization transactions (such as Air Lanka, Lanka
Electric Co., Sri Lanka Telecom). PERC will also establish an effective core of staff to plan and coordinate
the privatization program, and establish a small cadre of technical experts (local consultants and
specialized civil servants) to provide the necessary technical expertise for implementing GOSL's
privatization program. The project cost is estimated at US$21.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$12.6 million equivalent. IDA would finance US$15.0 million equivalent. Custom duties
and taxes on imported equipment for the project have been estimated at about 40%, or about US$3.3
million equivalent. GOSL/SLTA will fund the necessary equipment housing and contribute monitoring sites
and buildings, which have been included in the project at nominal cost. A breakdown of project costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the projected
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
Technical Annex is attached to provide details of the project, in lieu of a Staff Appraisal Report.
21.          Project Sustainability. The 1991 Telecommunications Act provides a sound legal basis for
SLTA as the regulatory institution for the telecommunications sector. Despite the constraints on SLTA's
regulatory capabilities, as discussed in paras. 10 and 11, sector regulation has been reasonably effective,
including a quite satisfactory licensing regime. However, to ensure SLTA's longer term operational and
financial viability and administrative autonomy, the amendment of the 1991 Act and the conversion of
SLTA from a GOSL department into a more independent commission will be pursued under the proposed
project. A Telecommunications Sector Policy Letter confirms GOSL's commitment to amending the 1991
Telecommunications Act (see Attachment 1 of the Technical Annex). The Sector Policy Letter and the draft
amendment state that expenditures incurred by SLTA will be financed through license and other operator
fees. Since SLTA's annual expenses are less than US$1.0 million equivalent and its revenues, including
license and other fees from the service providers, are over US$3.0 million, its financial autonomy outside of
the government's budget would be ensured. Over the longer run, and with better means of control provided
under the project, SLTA's license and other revenues are likely to increase substantially as existing service
providers expand their operations and new operators are licensed. The importance of SLTA as a regulatory
institution will increase in a complex multi-operator environment. It will be in the best interest of GOSL,
the private operators and the public to maintain a strong and independent regulator to ensure adequate
interconnection and revenue sharing arrangements between operators and protection of consumer interests.



- 6 -
22.           PERC is fully committed to carrying out GOSL's program of divestiture of publicly
owned assets and the recently enacted legislation gives it adequate authority to do so. With the approval of
the Ministry of Finance, key firms like Air Lanka (airline), SLT (telecommunications), Lanka Electric Co.,
financial institutions, plantations and manufacturing units have already been identified by PERC for
privatization. The project, therefore, supports an existing program which has the full support of GOSL. An
Operational Plan for PERC (Attachment 2 of the Technical Annex) confirms GOSL's commitment to this
reform program and will be monitored during project implementation.
23.           Actions Agreed. A Telecommunications Sector Policy Letter and Action Plan, including
GOSL's reform objectives, reform plans, and amendment of the 1991 Telecommunications Act, were
conditions of negotiations and have been received by IDA (see Attachment 1 of the Technical Annex) as
well as an Operational Plan for PERC (Attachment 2 of the Technical Annex). The necessary steps and
time frame to implement this reform program are set out in these documents and progress on key steps will
be monitored during project implementation. During negotiations in Colombo, agreements were reached on
SLTA's project implementation plan, terms of reference for consultants and PERC's operational plan.
GOSL also confirmed that the conditions for Board Presentation had been fulfilled, namely, Cabinet
agreement to the amendment to the 1991 Telecommunications Act, and appointment of Project Managers
for SLTA and PERC. There are no specific conditions for Credit Effectiveness. Failure by GOSL to
implement reforms, as set out in the Policy Letter and the Operational Plan, in a manner satisfactory to
IDA, may lead to remedial action.
24.           Environmental Aspects. No environmental assessment is required, since the proposed
project would have no adverse impact on the environment. The project has been given a "C" environmental
rating.
25.           Program Objective Categories. The principal objective category of the project is private
sector development The project will: (a) reduce the dependence on the public budget for infrastructure by
increasing private sector investments, including the privatization of state owned enterprises; and (b)
improve the adequacy and efficiency of telecommunications services by promoting private operations and
competition under an enabling regulatory framework.
26.           Project Benefits. The project will promote economic growth by providing assistance for
reforms in two key sectors, telecommunications and public enterprises, which on implementation would
promote more efficient use of available resources. Higher and more broad-based economic growth,
associated with improved and expanded telecommunications services, will in turn help futher reduction of
poverty across Sri Lanka. The project is an attractive investment in institution building and economic
management by reinforcing the Government's role as policy maker and regulator while facilitating private
investment and operation of a variety of services. Telecommunications services are increasingly based on
radio technologies, and the radio frequency spectrum is increasingly recognized as a valuable resource that
should be efficiently managed and protected. In Sri Lanka, as in most other countries, the licenses for
existing mobile cellular and other radio-based services were granted without auctions or high up-front
charges. The project will provide SLTA with the licensing and monitoring tools to adjust its fees for the use
of radio frequencies towards their economic value, thereby increasing the fiscal benefits as well as ensuring
the efficient allocation of a scarce resources. The strengthening of SLTA and its regulatory authority would
increase the interest of potential private investors in the telecommunications sector. Private operators of
telecommunications services would benefit from knowing the rules for frequency assignments, tariff
adjustments, interconnection, fair competition, licensing, etc., and this would encourage them to continue to
invest and expand services. The consumers would benefit from increased choice and competition in the



-7 -
provision of services, as has been demonstrated in the cellular market, the establishment of quality of
service standards and the possibility to take their complaints to the regulator, SLTA, in case an operator
does not take adequate corrective action. Sri Lanka's development policy is increasingly outward oriented
and an efficient telecommunications infrastructure would support further diversification of exports,
including agricultural. Sri Lanka also has great potential for expanding tourism, especially high value
tourism, which also requires efficient telecommunications services.
27.           The assistance to PERC would help to mobilize financial, technical and managerial
resources from the private sector and reduce the strain on public sector resources. Privatizations would also
bring efficiencies through a more competitive and entrepreneurial focus, the use of new technologies and
modem management practices. The fiscal benefits of privatizations are also likely to be substantial, as
shown by the recent sale of Colombo Gas to Shell for US$37.0 million. Further sales, e.g. of financial
institutions, the airline and public utilities, are expected to bring in even higher amounts. The value of
GOSL's most valuable enterprise, SLT, is estimated at around US$400.0 million. The proposed assistance
to PERC is particularly timely given GOSL's strong interest in quick implementation of its privatization
program.
28.           Risks. The main beneficiaries, PERC and SLTA, are established on a firm legal basis and
SLTA has gained valuable experience since its creation in 1991, which should facilitate efficient project
implementation. However, a delay in the amendment of the 1991 Telecommunications Act and the
conversion of SLTA into a Commission may restrict its ability to retain suitably qualified staff and fully
carry out its regulatory functions. The availability of suitable staff for training, and benefits attractive
enough to retain them once trained, are imperative for the efficient operation of the sophisticated hardware
and software for radio frequency management to be provided under the project. To minimize this risk,
Cabinet approval of the amendment to the 1991 Telecommunications Act was made a condition of Board
presentation, which has been met. The progress of the implementation of agreed legal and other reforms
will be closely monitored by IDA and, if not found satisfactory, IDA would take remedial action.
29.           As illustrated by the experience in Mexico, there is a risk that the radio frequency
management system will not fully function as intended. This risk will be reduced by procuring the system in
one package, including software, initial assistance in operations, and guarantees from a reputable supplier
for its proper functioning. Training of SLTA staff and technical assistance, during the initial years of
operation will also be provided under the project, to ensure the proper functioning of the system.
30.           Lack of commitment by line ministries and labor unions and political opposition to
privatization may pose problems for PERC. GOSL's strong commitment and support for the project should
make these risks manageable.
31.           Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
