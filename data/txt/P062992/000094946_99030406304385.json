The objectives of the two-loan\n            operation are to prevent and mitigate the effect of the\n            current international financial instability on the economy,\n            and protect vulnerable groups as well. Nevertheless,\n            preventive measures are advisable, and the Government has\n            taken precautionary actions, such as restraining fiscal\n            expenditures, and including an innovative contingent\n            repurchase facility with private banks. Even though the\n            loans will help meet foreign exchange needs, allowing the\n            Government to remain focussed on longer term reform issues\n            and safeguarding the economic and social achievements, there\n            are risks, such as a delay in the upcoming planned reforms,\n            or in the lack of restoration by mid-1999, of access to\n            international capital markets, which wil make the financial\n            package currently assembled, non sufficient, thus resulting\n            in severe economic adjustment."}, "docdt": "1998-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
