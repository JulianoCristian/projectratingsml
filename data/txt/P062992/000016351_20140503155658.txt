Board Meeting of November 10, 1998
Statement by Valeriano F. García
 Argentina: Country Assistance Strategy, Special Structural Adjustment
               Loan and Repurchase Facility Support Loan
Introduction:
I would like to start by offering my thanks to Management for the
opportunity to discuss this CAS Progress Report and loans for
Argentina. In particularly to the staff, for acting well beyond the
call of duty when preparing these loans. Under the current
international financial crisis, the timing of this package is crucial
for Argentina. It is in this respect that I would like to express my
authorities’ gratitude to colleagues on the Board for giving
consideration to this Special Structural Adjustment Loan at such short
notice. Needless to say, my authorities are very appreciative of the
Bank’s continued support for the economic and social reform program in
Argentina. This report also gives me an opportunity to share with you
some of the recent economic events in my country.
Economic Performance:
The Argentine currency board system has been very successful. This
exchange rate regime -- together with trade reform, deregulation, and
privatization -- has led to unprecedented economic growth. Since the
implementation of the Convertibility Plan in early 1991, Argentina’s
GDP has grown by almost 40 percent.

During 1997, GDP growth was 8.6 percent, the second highest rate in
the world (figure 1). In 1998, economic growth is expected to slow
down, as a consequence of the worsening international economic
environment
                                                              2


You may recall that in 1995, as one of the aftershocks of the Mexican
crisis, the economy suffered the effects of large withdrawals of bank
deposits and international reserves. At the time, this presented a
considerable threat to the continuation of the Convertibility Plan;
however, the emergence of the Asian and Russian crises has not had the
same consequences. This is largely due to a number of measures that
the authorities adopted in recent years, and that have substantially
increased confidence in the restructured financial system.
Since the onset of the Asian crisis, Argentina’s international
reserves have actually increased by 18%, from US$22.2 billion to
US$25.4 billion (figure 2). In addition, the inflation rate over the
past year has been practically zero, one of the lowest in the world.

billion, compared with US$63 billion at the beginning of the Asian
crisis (figure 3). Over the same period, bank deposits in local
currency grew by 15 percent while those in US dollars increased by 24
percent. The Argentine financial system continues to be strong and
dependable, and this is particularly due to the presence of highly
rated foreign banks, which play an important role in the domestic
financial system.

Despite the good development of the Argentine economy, and as a
consequence of the global crisis, the behavior of a number of
indicators has sounded a strong note of caution in the economy. Since
the outset of the crisis, for example, the stock market index has
fallen by 50 percent, and peso-dollar spreads have widened
considerably (figure 4).

The Timely reaction:
The Argentine Government has announced a series of measures for
adjusting the economy still further to the new unstable international
conditions. The need for timely action has led to the immediate
implementation of measures for reducing public spending over the short
term. These include, among other actions, a cut of U$S1 billion in
spending under the 1998 budget, suspension of a large highway program,
and a US$400 million reduction in public works. This brought the
fiscal deficit down from 2.2 percent in 1996 to 1.4 percent in 1997,
and the estimate for 1998 is 1 percent (figure 5).

I also wish to emphasize how low public expenditure rates have been in
previous years; i.e. 16.5 percent of GDP in 1996 and 16.2 percent in
1997.
In 1989, hyperinflation created such mayhem that 38 percent of
Argentines were living below the poverty line, whereas today the
figure has fallen to 18 percent. Currently, income distribution and
economic opportunities are substantially more equitable.

All these figures clearly indicate that the Argentine economy is
sound, and that the Treasury is solvent, mainly as a result of the
measures that have been taken -- and continue to be taken -- in order
to strengthen the structural basis of the Convertibility Plan (the
Currency Board). In spite of this impressive performance by the
Argentine economy, and because of exogenous factors, international
capital markets are still effectively closed.

The Repurchase Facility Support Loan
This facility is related to the general architecture of a country that
has a currency board.
                                   4


The Currency Board has served not only as a key instrument in abating
inflation, but also as a guarantee of fiscal discipline.
Let me draw your attention to one important aspect of the implications
of a currency board system. Sometimes I feel that we are not aware of
all the constraints that such a system exerts on the economy. The most
important of these is the lack of a lender of last resort. To address
this problem, the Argentine Government has adopted the following
policy measures:

n The right of foreign banks to freely establish themselves in the
  market and to acquire assets. Ownership by foreign banks is now
  widespread in Argentina.
n The high capital requirements and -- more importantly – the very
  high liquidity requirements (20%) imposed on banks. Strengthened
  banking supervision and increased transparency in financial and
  fiscal information, in line with IMF recommendations.
n Over 100 percent foreign currency backing on the stock of the
  monetary base. Note that the essential component of proper currency
  board operations is only 100 percent backing of the flow of monetary
  transactions. We have chosen the more rigorous 100 percent backing
  on the stock of monetary base to boost confidence.
n The establishment of a repurchase facility with foreign private
  banks, amounting to almost 10 percent of total deposits. As part of
  the World Bank program, my authorities are requesting a contingent
  facility to cover potential margin.
We view this facility as part of an umbrella for ensuring that the
Currency Board functions properly. It is not an emergency facility. It
is a prudential facility, in the same way that liquidity requirements
for banks form part of prudential regulations, and are not considered
emergency requirements, even though they may be used in emergencies.
Bank support for a repurchase facility would clearly contribute toward
the strengthening of the reforms in the financial system.

To safeguard its financial sector, in a currency board context,
Argentina has put in place a safety net that accounts for 40 percent
of total deposits, and which operates as follows: (i) the first line
of defense is the 20 percent reserve requirement that the Central Bank
applies to commercial banks; (ii) as a second line, excess reserve
holdings by the Central Bank deposited abroad constitute 10 percent of
total deposits, and could be used for rediscounts; and (iii) as a
third line, the Central Bank has a repurchase agreement with a group
of foreign banks, comprising about 10 percent of total deposits. The
World Bank repurchase facility would be part of this architecture.


The Special Structural Adjustment Loan
In the current circumstances, we believe that the Bank can play a
strategic role, and that this SSAL is the best approach to the
problem. The loan will assist Argentina in preventing any potentially
negative effects from impacting vulnerable groups, and help in
maintaining its commitment to structural reform.
The proposed loan will support the continued efforts of the Government
of Argentina to deepen its “second-generation” reforms, which include,
among other things: improving the targeting and efficiency of various
                                   5


social programs that are designed to reduce poverty; providing a
minimum safety net for the elderly poor; maintaining levels of
spending in key social programs that are important to the poor;
improving the system of unemployment insurance and lowering non-wage
labor costs; making investment in education more equitable; improving
the quality of higher education; strengthening the regulatory
framework for health insurance; and developing a competitive managed-
care market for providing health care to pensioners.

A sense of urgency
Argentina needs these resources urgently in order to avoid adverse
consequences to its economy and ultimately to the poor. Therefore, I
would like to reiterate my authorities’ gratitude to the staff, and my
colleagues on the Board for giving consideration to this Special
Structural Adjustment Loan at such short notice.
