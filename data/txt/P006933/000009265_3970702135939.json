submitted concurrently.  Its purpose is to assist the\n            Government in implementing the Structural Adjustment Program\n            by providing essential information and analysis for\n            decision-making in key areas.  It will further prepare\n            specific action programs to achieve program objectives in\n            key areas of the economy.  Specifically, the loan will\n            finance about 230 man-months of consultant services to\n            prepare studies or provide institutional support in several\n            areas.  They include:  (a) improvement of budget preparation\n            and management; (b) reshaping of CODESA's activities;\n            (c) strengthening of public sector investment planning and\n            macro-economic analysis; and (d) analysis of social security\n            and health financing.  The project will also; (e) strengthen\n            the policy framework in agriculture; (f) modernize the\n            national banking system; (g) strengthen tax and customs\n            administration; and (h) improve the cost-effectiveness of\n            education expenditures.  Finally, the venture will involve;\n            (i) analysis of salary structure and incentives in the\n            public sector; and (j) analysis of tariff reform impact on\n            industrial sub-sectors."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
