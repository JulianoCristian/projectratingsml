INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR THE MOGADISCIO PORT EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Somali Democratic Republic for the equivalent of
US$5.2 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the extension of a
deepwater port in Mogadiscio. The proceeds of the credit would be relent
to the Somali Port Authority (SPA) on IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Recent Economic Developments in Somalia" was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors on August 29, 1972. Country Data Sheets are
attached as Annex I. A Bank economic mission visited Somalia in November/
December 1974; its final report is expected to be distributed to the Board
shortly.
3.        The Somali Democratic Republic was formed in 1960 by a merger of
the former Italian Trust Territory of Somalia and the British Protectorate
of Somaliland. Following a decade of parliamentary rule, the Government
was taken over by the military in 1969. The Supreme Revolutionary Council,
consisting of army and police officers, is the highest decision-making body.
4.        In 1970 the Government announced its adherence to a program of
scientific socialism, emphasizing egalitarianism and social justice, develop-
ment through the public sector, nationalization of certain foreign enterprises,
and the formation of cooperatives. This policy was at first associated with
a negative attitude toward private investment, but the Government now appears
to be taking a more favorable view of the role of private initiative. In
general, the Government's development efforts have been characterized by
austerity and self-reliance. Somalia joined the Arab League in February 1974.
This step has significantly improved the country's foreign assistance prospects.
5.        Somalia is located on the Horn of Africa with three thousand kilome-
ters of coastline on the Gulf of Aden on the north and the Indian Ocean on the
east. It has an area of 246,000 square miles. The topography varies from
a hot and arid coastal plain, which gives way to sparsely wooded savannah,
to rugged mountains, agricultural plateaus and lowlands of varying fertility
and rainfall. Much of the country is arid; water supplies are scattered
and often unreliable, and periodic droughts bring great hardship to both
the people and their livestock. Only a small proportion of the land is
arable. While geology suggests mineral resources, exploration is still in



-2-
the early stages. Lacking other known resources, development plans center
on agricultural and livestock development. However, progress in the develop-
ment of stock-raising and agriculture will depend upon careful management of
scarce land and water resources.
6.        With an estimated per capita income in the order of US$80, Somalia
is classified by the UN as one of the 25 least developed countries of the
world. Of the total population of approximately three million, about two-
thirds are nomads, who depend on livestock for their livelihood, and about
20-25% are farmers cultivating land along the Juba and Shebelli Rivers
and in the higher rainfall northwest region. The small monetary sector of
the economy provides only limited opportunities for employment. Apart from
the traditional export of livestock, commercial agriculture is mainly cen-
tered on the production of bananas for export, in which Italian concession
holders are still important, and the production of sugar for the domestic
market. Manufacturing and other sectors of the economy are restricted in
their potential by the small size of the market, poor infrastructure, and
the shortage of capital and entrepreneurial experience. No income distribu-
tion data exist, but about 70% of the population lives at subsistence
levels. Social services are still very inadequate; the school enrollment
ratio is among the lowest in the world, barely reaching 16% of the elementary
school-age population.
Recent Economic Performance
7.        There is little economic data on Somalia.    Even basic figures such
as GNP, population, number of livestock, or output of major agricultural crops
are only our rough estimates. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to measure
economic performance.
8.        Due to favorable rainfall, 1972 harvests reached record levels
and substantial food surpluses were purchased by the Government Marketing
Agency. Poor rainfall in 1973 and a virtual absence of rain during 1974
have led to widespread crop failures. The drought has cut exports of livestock
and bananas, the two largest earners of foreign exchange, and required large
imports of maize, sorghum, rice and sugar.
°.        Figures usually quoted place the livestock population of Somalia at
3 million cattle, 14 million sheep and goats, and 2 to 3 million camels. The
poor rainfall of 1973 and the drought of 1974 have reduced the livestock
numbers; losses may rise to about one third of the livestock population. This
has left large numbers of nomads destitute. The Government has set up relief
camps to help them; estimates are that camp population peaked at near 250,000
in June-July and has since fallen off considerably. About 100,000 former camp
inhabitants have reportedly returned to their former way of life while the
Government plans to resettle the remaining ones in agricultural zones to be
developed in the interriverine areas and in fishing communities along the
coast. The United Nations estimates that 120,000 tons of grain will be
required to feed the affected population until the rLext harvest in August
1975.



- 3 -
10.       Somalia's manufacturing sector consists of a few relatively large-
scale publicly owned enterprises and some small private enterprises. Out of an
estimated value added in industry of US$20.1 million in 1973, about 80% was
in the public sector. Most of the industries are agro-based, depending upon
locally produced raw material. Food processing accounted for over 58% of
value added in industry during 1973. After making strong progress in the
period 1968-70, a period of relative stagnation started in 1971 and had not
been reversed by 1973. Indications are that industrial activity mav have
picked up in 1974-75.
11.       Somalia's recent fiscal performance has been most encouraging and
it reflects the Government's emphasis on self-reliance. Current revenues have
increased from US$38.1 million in 1969 to an estimated US$90.5 million in 1974
and the current budget position has changed from a net deficit of US$2.0
million in 1969 to a surpus of US$11.6 million in 1973. The rising trend in
public savings was not sustained in 1974; against projected savings of US$19.7
million only about US$11.1 million is estimated to have been realized. A
diversion of resources to the crash literacy program for the rural areas is
responsible for part of the shortfall. Other factors adversely affecting
public savings were the more-than-doubling of budgeted police and defense
expenditures over this five-year period, the failure of public enterprises
to generate planned surpluses and the aggravation of the drought in 1974.
12.       Government recurrent expenditures, which already account for
slightly more than one fourth of estimated GNP, are likely to grow more
rapidly during the 1974-78 plan period than during the preceding five years.
New sources of revenue may be required since a substantial increase in rates
of existing taxes may not be possible. The whole system of taxation should
be reviewed with particular attention paid to the potential role of public
enterprises in mobilizing resource for development.
13.       Somalia's balance of trade has been in deficit since independence.
In recent years, the trade gap has grown from US$13.7 million in 1970 to
US$101.7 million in 1974. Exports jumped from US$31.9 million in 1970 to
US$56.5 million in 1972, but then declined by 9% in 1973. Although export
volumes continued to decline, export earnings in 1974 are estimated to have
been slightly higher than in 1973 due to better prices for livestock and
meat products. The drought has caused reductions in the production of live-
stock, meat products, and bananas, which together account for about 90% of
Somalia's exports. Imports, on the other hand, have been rising steadily,
from US$56.8 million in 1971 to an estimated US$166.0 million in 1974.
W4hile the rate of growth of imports appear high, some attempt has been
made to constrain food imports, at the cost of shortages during 1974 of
sugar, edible oil and foodgrains, and the proportion of development imports
appears to have increased from around 25% of the total in 1971 to about 40%
in 1974.



- 4 -
14.       Somalia's trade deficits have, until recently, been offset by
transfer receipts and capital inflows which together averaged almost US$28.2
million per year in the period 1968-72. In 1973 and 1974, however, transfers
and foreign borrowing, despite an increase to over US$79.4 million per year
have been insufficient to cover the trade gap. The overall balance of pay-
ments deficit was US$7.2 million in 1973 and US$9.0 million in 1974 and were
financed by draw-down of the reserves.
15.       Foreign aid has played and will continue to play a crucial role in
Somalia's economic development.   The level of foreign capital inflows has
increased from an average of US$39 million per year (62% grants) in 1960-69
to US$59 million (approximately 50% grants) in 1973 with the result that on
a per capita basis, Somalia receives substantially more aid than most other
developing countries. In the 1960's the main contributors were Italy, the
United States, the European Economic Community, Germany and the USSR. More
recently, China and North Korea have become important lenders; China is now
financing the largest single aided project, the Belet Wein-Burao Road, which
will link the sourthern and northern parts of the country. However, this
pattern of foreign aid now appears to be shifting -- the Arab oil-producing
countries are becoming a major source of development assistance. In the past
the Bank Group has played a relatively modest role; IDA credits accounted for
only about 10% of gross capital inflows during 1970-73.
16.       Most of the assistance to Somalia has been on soft terms.    In mid-
1974, the disbursed part of Somalia's foreign debt amounted to about US$145
million. Major sources of external capital were the USSR with 38%; Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Libya and Iraq together accounted fcr a further 16%; the Peoples'
Republic of China for 9%; while the Federal Republic of Germany and IDA each
accounted for about 11%.   Although a large share of this debt is interest-free
or at very low rates (2-3% per annum), the ratio of debt service to exports has
been rising, from 3.4% in 1972 to 5.8% in 1974 and is expected to reach 10% in
1975.  In view of the poor resource endowment, uncertain export prospects and
a public and private savings performance still in its infancy, Somalia should
exercise great caution in taking on external debt on commercial terms.
Development Planning
17.       In 1971, the Somali Government launched a three-year development
program which called for public investment of US$143.0 million. The main
sectors of investment were transport and communications (36%), water resources
(12%), agriculture (11%), industry (9%), livestock (6%) and irrigation (4%).
It is estimated that about two thirds of the planned investment was achieved.
The 1971-73 development program was followed by a f-ive-year program (1974-78)
calling for public investment of about US$620.0 million.    A little less than
one-third is to be financed from domastic resources. The sectoral allocations
are: agriculture, including irrigation (29%), transport and communications
(24.5%), industry (15%), and livestock   and range improvement (5%).   Roads
account for most of the investment in transport and communications though
they have received less priority than in the previous plan.    The most signi-
ficant feature of the current program is the sharp rise in planned investment,
from an actual level of about US$53.0 million in 1973 to an average of over



US$122 million per year in 1974-78 and the increased amount of domestic
financial participation. The current plan is also more oriented towards
directly productive investments.
18.       Since the bulk of the population is engaged in herding or in sub-
sistence farming, a development strategy for Somalia must start with agri-
culture and lviestock as a base. The maior development goals of the Somali
Government include self-sufficiency in foodgrains, the partial substituion
of other food imports (oils, rice), and a concerted effort to improve the lot
of the traditional nomadic herdsmen and eventually to settle some of them
permanently. These essentially production-oriented goals are reflected in
the eight-fold increase in annual investment in agriculture and irrigation
and the four-fold increase in annual investment in industry (as compared to
the 1971-73 plan). The current plan's emphasis on irrigated agriculture is
meant to make the country less dependent on the erratic pattern of rainfall,
and assure relatively stable and predictable increases in output. Some at-
tention (perhaps not enough) is continuing to be paid to projects in rainfed
agriculture (mainly through the Crash Program and the North West Agriculture
Project under consideration for IDA financing) which focus on how to make the
best use of the limited amount of rainfall. The plan continues to base its
development of industry on the processing of domestic raw materials to pro-
duce products mainly for import substitution.
19.       As it stands, the new five-year plan is probably overly ambitious
and its implementation has been rendered even more difficult because of the
continuation of last year's disastrous drought which has forced the Govern-
ment to concentrate all available financial resources on measures for the
survival of the drought stricken population. The effects of the drought on
the plan are likely to mean: (i) a slowdown in overall plan implementation,
(ii) a higher priority attached to agriculture and rural projects, (iii) a
lower-than-anticipated domestic financial participation because of large
requirements of public funds for use in emergecy relief.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SOMALIA
20.       Starting in 1965, IDA has made eight credits totalling US$52.9 mil-
lion, about 60% of which has been made for transportation development
including construction of two trunk roads (Afgoi-Baidoa in the central region
and Hargeisa-Berbera in the northern region), and a new deepwater port at
Mogadiscio. IDA credits were also made for education in FY71 and livestock
development in FY74. In FY75 a credit of US$8 million was approved for a
Second Education Project. No Bank loans or IFC investments has been made
to Somalia. IDA credits accounted for 9% of Somalia's outstanding debt at
the end of 1973. Debt service payments on existing IDA credits in 1980 are
projected at 9% of Somalia's total debt service payments.
21.       Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of July 1975
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Performance on ongoing projects
has been satisfactory, except for some initial delays.



- 6 -
22.       We plan to concentrate our efforts on the country's directly productive
sectors, agriculture and livestock, and also on education and transportation.
W4hile agriculture and livestock offer potential for development, most rural
development activities are only at the beginning stage. Moreover, agricul-
tural development in Somalia is particularly difficult because most of the
people in the rural areas are nomadic. Our first effort in livestock was
the Trans-Juba Livestock Project, approved in FY74. Our first agricultural
project would be a proposed project for agricultural development in the
northwest region, which will be presented to you shortly.
23.       The country's transportation facilities are inadequate and the
Government plans to continue transportation development in the next few years.
The Second Highway Credit now under implementation provides for feasibility
studies and detailed engineering for the improvement of the Hargeisa-Borama
Road in the northern region. The studies are expected to be completed in the
second half of 1975, and will provide the basis for a project which IDA might
assist in financing in association with other external lenders.
24.       Recently there has been a marked increase in resource inflow into
Somalia from the oil-exporting Arab countries. The Government expects this
trend to continue, but considers the lack of projects to be a constraint.
The Government has, therefore, requested IDA assistance in identifying and
preparing an adequate number of development projects to absorb these funds.
We are now exploring various possibilities of assisting the Government in
this task.
25.       As stated above, (paragraphs 8 and 9) a severe drought struck
Somalia last year. The most seriously affected areas were the central and
northeastern parts of the country. Loss of human life has been held down
because of the Government's actions in providing rapid and effective relief
measures. However, the losses of animal life and agricultural production have
been large. The Government hias already embarked on rehabilitation; it has set
up task forces for the preparation of a rehabilitation program, and UNDP has
agreed to assist in preparation. The Government has requested IDA assistance
in financing the rehabilitation program and a project is expected to be ready
for your consideration in a few months time. IDA's role is to be a catalyst
for attracting other external funds for drought rehabilitation.
PART III - THE TRMNSPORTATION SECTOR
26.       The exploitation of Somalia's limited resources has been inhibited
by the lack of adequate transportation facilities. The road network is still
underdeveloped; there are no railways, and air transport services are at an
early stage of development. The density of cargo and passenger traffic in all
modes is light.



-7-
Road Transport
27.       The 200 km bituminous highway from Afgoi, just outside Mogadiscio,
to Baidoa connects the Port of Mogadiscio to its hinterland. It was financed
jointly by IDA and' FED and completed in 1971. In the north a 160 km road
from Hargeisa to the port of Berbera, under financing provided jointly by IDA
and the African Development Bank, was completed in April of this year. There
is also a bituminous road from Afgoi southwest to Goluen financed by FED. A
1045 km road financed by the People's Republic of China is being constructed
from BeletWein in the central region to Burao in the north.    Despite the imple-
mentation of these various projects, the country's highway system is still
underdeveloped and most regions are isolated from modern transportation.
Ports
28.       Somalia has 27 ports along the more than 3,000 km coastline, includ-
ing four major ones at Berbera, Chisimaio, Merca and Mogadiscio, that account
for more than 95% of the country's ocean-borne foreign commerce. Despite its
lengthy coastline there is little coastal traffic. Berbera in the north and
Chisimaio in the south constructed with the help of the USSR and USAID res-
pectively, have sheltered deepwater facilities. Merca and Mogadiscio are
lighterage ports. Berbera is the only major port on Somalia's northern
coast and the principal outlet for livestock exports. Merca and Chisimaio,
located 90 and 500 km south of Mogadiscio, are primarily banana ports but
also handle small quantities of imports. Chisimaio also handles the export
of livestock and meat products. The port of Mogadiscio, which continues to
operate as a lighterage port during the construction of new port facilities,
handles about two thirds of the imports and about 5% of Somalia's exports.
Air Transport
29.       Somalia's domestic air transport system (Somali Airlines) has
direct flights between Mogadiscio and 12 other centers. Domestic and
international air freight transport is negligible. Domestic traffic amounted
only 18,000 passengers in 1969, but has been growing at an annual average rate
of 19% in recent years.    Only a few international airlines serve Somalia.
Organization
30.       Four ministries are concerned with the transport sector:     the
Ministry of Public Works which, through its Department of Civil Engineering,
is responsible for planning and constructing transport infrastructure and for
highway maintenance; the Ministry of Transport for vehicle registration and
control; the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Transport through the Somali Port
Authority (SPA), for ports; and the Mfinistry of Interior for highway traffic
control. No government agency exists to oversee the functioning of the
whole sector, but there is no pressing need for this at present.



-8-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
31.       In November 1964, the Bank made a technical assistance grant of
$311,000 for a preliminary engineering study of a new deepwater port at
Mogadiscio, the hinterland of which constitutes the most productive part of
the country and has the greatest potential for economic development. In
February 1967, the consultants, Societe Grenobloise d'Edutes et d'Applications
Hydrauliques (SOGREAH, France), produced a master plan for a new seven-berth
port. An IDA credit of US$550,000 (S5-SO of March 3, 1969) subsequently
financed detailed engineering for a first phase, and engineering was completed
in 1970.
32.       An IDA appraisal in November/December 197L led to a US$12.95 million
development credit (359-SO of March 15, 1973 for the construction of a new
deepwater port at Mogadiscio. At the same time the European Development Fund
(FED) made a grant equivalent to US$12.5 million that is being disbursed par
passu with the IDA credit.   Together, IDA and FED are financing 100% of the
project costs net of taxes. The project was designed to end the inefficient
and, particularly during the southwest monsoon season, unreliable lighterage
operations of the existing port. Substantial traffic presently carried un-
economically via other ports will be diverted to Mogadiscio after completion
of this project.
33.       The main elements of the ongoing project are a 770-meter long break-
water, two general cargo berths, one banana berth, one livestock berth, two
transit sheds and one warehouse, open storage areas, smaller buildings and
port operating equipment. Engineering and management consultants are also
included in the project. The works started in March 1973 and were scheduled
for completion by April 1976. The civil works contract was awarded under
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines to the
lowest evaluated bidder, IMPREGILO (Italy). The contractor was slow in
ordering construction equipment. This, combined with difficulties in
arranging transportation to Mogadiscio resulted in a slow start of construction.
The delays were compounded by the onset of the southwest monsoon. Since July
1974 the contractor has been working two 10-hour shifts, instead of the one
shift worked previously to reduce these delays. Construction is now some six
months behind schedule and will be substantially completed by October 1976.
The cost of the project is expected to be within the appraisal estimates.
34.       Due to financial constraints and the difficulty of projecting traffic
growth from an erratic traffic data base, the port was designed conservatively
with the likelihood that, should the projected traffic materialize, there
would be some congestion during peak periods, causing increased ship-waiting
time that could be eased somewhat by supplemental lighterage operations.     Since
the appraisal, however, traffic has increased more rapidly than was projected,
with tonnages in 1974 reaching nearly the level projected for 1977. The re-
opening of the Suez Canal, however, is not expected to have significant impact
on tonnages;  an increased number of ships will be calling at the port, but
the average tonnages of cargo per ship are expected to be lower. Under these



- 9 -
circumstances, a third general cargo berth is required by 1977, and the Govern-
ment of Somalia has requested the Association to assist in financing its con-
struction.
35.       As an extension to the ongoing project, the appraisal of the proposed
project has been greatly simplified and is based on IDA supervision missions'
findings, existing contract unit prices, and cost estimates prepared by the
consultants and Bank staff, followed by a desk appraisal. The results of the
appraisal are included in this report.
Project Description
36.       The proposed project will include:
(i) construction of a 180-meter long and 12-meter deep general
cargo berth in line with the two 160-meter long and 10-meter
deep general cargo berths financed under Credit 359-SO;
(ii) construction of a 180-meter straight line extension of the
770-meter breakwater financed under Credit 359-SO; and
(iii) supervision of construction of (i) and (ii) above as well as
provision of study and design services for a slipway, lighter
and tug berths.
The costs of detailed design for (i) and (ii) above will be financed 50%
under the FED Grant, and 50% under Credit 359-SO for the ongoing project.
The new port is expected to be fully operational by January 1977. MPW will
be responsible for the execution of civil works and SPA for operating and
maintaining the completed facilities. This is identical with the arrangements
for the ongoing project.
Cost and Financing Plan
37.       The estimated total cost of the proposed project net of taxes and
excluding the design work covered by the earlier financing is US$6.45 million,
based on construction of the additional civil works under provisions of the
present contract for the ongoing project. If the extension were delayed, it
would have been necessary to rebid the project and extra costs would be in-
curred for (i) contractor mobilization, (ii) increased unit prices which would
undoubtedly result for such a small project, and (iii) demolition of the round
head of the completed breakwater. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at
US$5.2 million or 81% of total costs. A breakdown of the project component
costs is as follows:

38.        As a result of the ongoing project, the site conditions are well known
and only 5% provision has been included for physical contingencies; so far actual
quantities are slightly below estimates. For price contingencies, however, con-
siderably larger funds have been allocated in anticipation of requests from the
contractor for compensation to cover increased costs in accordance with the terms
of the existing contract. There is also a risk that the rock quarry which is
presently being used, may not contain sufficient supply of rock for the extension
works, and that another more distant quarry may have to be used. Therefore, a
35% price contingency provision has been made which takes all of the above price
factors into account.
39.        The proposed credit of US$5.2 million will finance the estimated 81%
foreign exchange cost of the project. The Government will finance the remaining
local cost of the project, equivalent to US$1.25 million.
Onlending Terms
40.        The onlending terms will be the same as those agreed with the Govern-
ment for Credit 359-SO for the ongoing project, i.e., the Government will onlend
proceeds of the proposed credit to SPA on the same terms as the Association will
lend to the Government. Conclusion of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and SPA for the onlending of the credit proceeds will be
a condition of effectiveness (Credit Agreement, Section 6.01(b)).

Management and Operations of Somali Port Authority
41.       SPA, established in 1962 and reorganized in 1972, will operate and
maintain the new port. It is the responsibility of SPA to administer, operate
and maintain the country's ports, to plan and carry out their development and
to render services to port users. SPA is headed by a General Manager, and
a Board of Directors to handle policy matters. SPA's functional responsibilities
are organized under three departments, which are: (i) Planning, Coordination
and Engineering, (ii) Financial and Accounting, and (iii) Personnel. SPA
manages the four major ports at Mogadiscio, Berbera, Chisimaio and Merca,
and several minor ports as well. Its organization and operational functioning
are generally good but need improvement in individual areas. The borrower and
SPA have been slow in meeting some of the requirements of the ongoing credit,
particularly in appointing management, port operations and accounting consultants
to assist SPA. During negotiations it was agreed that the consultants will be
appointed by October 1975, and that their appointment will be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit (Credit Agreement, Section 6.01 (c)).
42.       SPA's operating results have been satisfactory (see Annex V, Table 1),
and SPA has been a dependable source of revenue for the Government. Operating
revenues have exceeded appraisal estimates except in respect of receipts from
harbor taxes which have been transferred from SPA to the Ministry of Finance
since October 1972 instead of in 1977 as previously expected. Net operating
income amounted to So. Sh. 9.4 million in 1973 and So. Sh. 12.4 in 1974.
Actual and forecast operating results for 1973 through 1976 are summarized
below along with previous appraisal estimates.

The annual return on net fixed assets for SPA has been consistently above the
rate of 5% required under the ongoing Credit. The return for tile new Port of
Mogadiscio is expected to average between 8 and 9% by 1980. The lower overall
return for SPA is mainly due to heavy investments in Berbera and Chisimaio ports.
43.        Existing tariffs at Mogadiscio Port are set for lighterage opera-
tions, but will be revised when the new deepwater port comes into operation.
The Somali Port Authority has agreed that not later than January 1, 1976 when
the first berth becomes operational, it shall:
(i)  take necessary measures to introduce and maintain
tariffs which will be set, as far as practicable,
for each port individually; (Project Agreement,
Section 4.05(a));
(ii)  levy tariffs on all ships and goods using the ports'
facilities and services, (Project Agreement, Section
4.05 (b)); and
(iii)  base such tariffs for individual services and facili-
ties in such manner as to be sufficient to cover
the costs of those services and facilities, and
take into account the desirability of ensuring that
economic benefits (particularly those enjoyed by ships)
resulting from the port investments accrue to the economy
of Somalia; (Project Agreement, Section 4.05 (c)). v



- 13 -
44.       Financial forecasts of SPA are given in Table 1, 2 and 3 of Annex V.
With the proposed project, net operating income would increase from So.Sh. 12.4
million in 1974 to So.Sh. 20.9 million in 1980. The return is expected to fall
temporarily to 4.8% in 1977 when the new port becomes fully operational, but
would gradually increase to about 7% by 1980. During negotiations, agreement
was reatched that SPA will take all necessary steps, including, where necessary,
revision of port tariffs, to ensure that SPA will earn an annual return on net
fixed assets of at least 4.5% in 1977 and 5% thereafter (Project Agreement,
Section 4.04).
45.       The Government is currently absorbing all the net surpluses of
SPA after provisions for depreciation and SPA's employee welfare fund.
This is unsatisfactory because SPA is left with inadequate funds to service
its debt obligations. During negotiations, therefore, it was agreed that
the Government will leave sufficient funds with SPA to meet debt service
requirements (Credit Agreement, Section 4.04).
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       The construction will be carried out by the contractor, IMPREGILO,
under the existing contract for civil works with HPW. For engineering con-
sulting services, the Government will retain SOGREAH, which has carried out
preliminary and detailed engineering and is supervising construction, all
in a satisfactory manner.
47.       Disbursements under the proposed credit will cover 80% of the costs
of civil works, and 100% of the cost of engineering services for supervision
of extension works and design of slipway and berths for tugs and lighters.
Disbursements will be fully documented. Estimated disbursements are shown
in Annex VI.
Economic Evaluation
48.       The Government is contemplating conversion of the existing light-
erage port to a naval installation and/or deepsea fishing port, once the new
port is in operation. It is, however, intended that some lighterage capacity
will be available if needed during peak traffic periods. The dolphin berth for
livestock cannot be used for handling general cargo. The banana berth is
expected to have some 30,000 tons spare capacity for general cargo in 1977
and this has been taken into account in the economic evaluation.
49.       The benefits from a third general cargo berth will consist of reduced
waiting time for ships served by the new deepwater berths, reduced cargo damages
and losses, and eliminated surcharges imposed by shipping lines for lighterage
operation, in the same way as for the ongoing project. For the purpose of
economic evaluation, only half of the benefits from reduced ship waiting time
have been assumed to accrue to Somalia. However, the benefits may be greater
depending on the tariff structure, yet to be determined. The assumptions used
in evaluating the project are listed in Annex IV. By plotting curves of the
costs of different operational alternatives involving two- or three-shifts



- 14 -
operations, and lighterage varying from zero to 150,000 tons per year, the least-
cost solutions have been found for the alternatives with the project (three
berths) and without the project (two berths). The optimum two-berth alternative
for 1977 has been established as a three-shift operation supplemented by some
30,000 tons of lighterage per year. The optimum three-berth alternative for
1977 has been established as a three-shift operation without lighterage. At
a somewhat higher ship-waiting cost, the three berths can have a two-shift
operation, still without any need for lighterage.
50.       The cost reduction for the three-berth alternative as compared to
two berths has been calculated at US$0.7 million in 1977 yielding a first year
economic return of 12% which confirms appropriate timing of the investment. The
economic return of the project over a 30-year lifetime is estimated at 20%, the
annual cost reduction increasing with the expansion of traffic volume through
the port and reaching some US$1.5 million in 1980. A fourth berth will be
needed by the early 1980's according to present traffic forecasts.
51.       The project's first-year economic return of 12% and the overall
economic return of 20% are higher than those returns of the ongoing project,
which were estimated in the Appraisal Report at 11% and 15%, respectively.
This is partly due to the comparatively low incremental cost of the pro-
posed berth, which requires construction of only 180 meters of breakwater, as
compared to 770 meters of breakwater for the berths under the ongoing project.
A calculation of the economic return for both projects combined gives a rate
of return of 16%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Somali Democratic
Republic and the Association; the draft Project Agreement between the Asso-
ciation and the Somali Port Authority; the Recommendations of the Committee
provided for under Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association; and the text of a resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
53.       Features of the Development Credit and Project Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 43, 44 and 45 of this report. Conclu-
sion of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and
SPA and appointment of consultants for SPA's management, port operations, and
accounting will be additional conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
credit (Credit Agreement, Section 6.01).
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.

PROPOSED PORT EXTENSION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Traffic Assumptions
The general dry cargo traffic for 1972, 1973 and 1974 was 162, 219
and 259 thousand tons respectively. The Bank Group's recent economic mission
to Somalia estimated that a future traffic growth of about 10 percent per
year is reasonable for Mogadiscio port. This is roughly half of the growth
rate since 1972. For the purpose of evaluation a conservative annual growth
rate of seven percent has been assumed from 1974 onwards. This gives the
following result.
1975  1976  1977   1978  1979  1980
General dry cargo forecast ('000 tons)    275    295   315   340   365   390

24 (three shifts)
Average Productivity per gang hour:      12 tons (two shifts)
10 tons (three shifts)
Average number of gangs per ship:         3
Average number of workers per gang:      12
Working days per year:                   313 (six days week)
Average loading/unloading per visit:     800 tons
Average service time per ship:            1.5 days
General cargo capacity at the banana
berth:                              30,000 tons in 1977
