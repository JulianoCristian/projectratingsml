The capacities of the existing vinyl acetate and\n            polyvinyl acetate units would be expanded and the\n            acetaldehyde unit would be fully utilized. New units which\n            would be constructed under the project include methanol,\n            acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and ethyl acetate plants. A\n            new unit would also be constructed for the separation of\n            carbon monoxide (CO) which would provide CO to the new\n            acetic acid plant and hydrogen to the existing butanol\n            plant. The project would enable Romania both to earn and\n            save scarce foreign exchange, and would assist in the\n            transfer of technology to the Romania chemical sector for\n            some of the project products. The project would also provide\n            employment for about 1,100 people. The only substantial\n            identified risk is that it may not be possible to achieve\n            fully the planned exports of 30 percent of production during\n            the first three years of operation due to heavy competion."}, "docdt": "1978-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
