                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objectives of the Project are: (i) to reduce Budapest's discharge of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) into the Danube River, and
                         consequently into the Black Sea; (ii) to enhance the nutrient trapping capacity of Gemenc and Beda-Karapancsa wetlands situated in the lower Hungarian part of
                         the Danube River; and (iii) to serve as a model for similar nutrient reduction initiatives in Hungary and other Danube basin countries.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The final implementation review mission was held in October 2011. As the project approaches the closing date, it has clearly achieved the first project and global environmental
                         development objective - reducing Budapest's nutrient (Nitrogen and Phosphorous) discharge into the Danube River and subsequently into the Black Sea through successful
                         completion and operation of the Tertiary Treatment at the North Budapest Wastewater Treatment Plant (NBWWTP), financed through Component A.

                         The second development objective is likely to be achieved because planned wetland restoration works under Component B are expected to be completed by the closing date, and
                         based on preliminary monitoring results for nutrient removal efficiency generated on the basis of completed works and hydraulic models prepared under a comprehensive impact
                         monitoring contract, the nutrient trapping capacity of the Gemenc and Beda-Karapancsa wetlands would be enhanced. Implementation of works under this component experienced
                         some delays due to a combination of factors including delays in obtaining various statutory licenses, as well as seasonal constraints, but are advanced and are expected to be fully

                         completed by the project closing date.

                         Achievement of the project's third development objective of serving as a model for similar nutrient reduction initiatives in Hungary and other Danube basin countries is linked to
                         successful communication and dissemination of the results and knowledge generated from the project. This objective has been achieved through dissemination of knowledge on the
                         project that has been shared in various international conferences and other scientific and professional knowledge sharing forums. A project closing conference was held on
                         November 15 and 16 in Budapest, to disseminate lessons from the project, and was attended by about 80 people, including participants from the region. The knowledge and lessons
                         are also to be captured and disseminated further after the project closes, through the GEF financed international knowledge sharing program, IW Learn.
