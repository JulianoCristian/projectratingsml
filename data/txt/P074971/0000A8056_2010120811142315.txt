                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objectives of the Project are: (i) to reduce Budapest's discharge of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) into the Danube River, and
                         conseque                               ntly into the Black Sea; (ii) to enhance the nutrient trapping capacity of Gemen                                   c and
                         Beda-Karapancsa wetlands situated in the lower Hungarian part of the Danub                                   e River; and (iii) to serve as a model for similar
                         nutrient reduction initiative                              s in Hungary and other Danube basin countries.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Component A (Development of tertiary treatment at the North Budapest Wastewater Treatment Plant (NBWWTP)) has been implemented in asatisfactory manner and the Plant was
                         substantially completed by March 2010. The contract is in the one-year trial or defects liability phase until March 2011. This investment has resulted in a reduction of Budapest's
                         nutrient discharge into the Danube River and subsequently into the Black Sea, thus contributing to the first global environmental objective (GEO) of the project.

                         The Works contract was finally signed in October 2010. However commencement of the works is dependant onbeing able to obtain necessary licenses (Environmental, Water,
                         Foresty) and the construction permits in a timely manner. It is imperative that the works commence as soon as possible if they are to be completed and the remaining project
