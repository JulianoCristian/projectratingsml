Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The key development objectives of the Project are: (i) to reduce Budapest's discharge of nutrients (nitrogen 
and phosphorus) into the Danube River, and consequently into the Black Sea; (ii) to enhance the nutrient 
trapping capacity of Gemenc and Beda-Karapancsa wetlands situated in the lower Hungarian part of the 
Danube River; and (iii) to serve as a model for similar nutrient reduction initiatives in Hungary and other 
Danube basin countries.
