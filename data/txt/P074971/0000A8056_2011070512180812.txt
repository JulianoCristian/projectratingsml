                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objectives of the Project are: (i) to reduce Budapest's discharge of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) into the Danube River, and
                         consequently into the Black Sea; (ii) to enhance the nutrient trapping capacity of Gemenc and Beda-Karapancsa wetlands situated in the lower Hungarian part of
                         the Danube River; and (iii) to serve as a model for similar nutrient reduction initiatives in Hungary and other Danube basin countries.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, there has been an improvement in implementation progress under the project since the last mission in October 2010. Component A (Development of tertiary treatment at the
                         North Budapest Wastewater Treatment Plant (NBWWTP)) was completed in a satisfactory manner. The one year trial/defects liability period was successfully completed in March
                         2011. The Plant was handed over to the Municipality of Budapest in April 2011 and is operating optimally. This investment has resulted in a reduction of Budapest's nutrient discharge
                         into the Danube and subsequently into the Black Sea, thus contributing to the first global environmental objective (GEO) of the project.

                         Works on about 50% of the project area under Component B (Wetland Restoration in the Gemenc and Beda-Karapancsa areas of the Duna-Drava National Park) commenced on
                         April 1, 2011 and are advancing steadily. However, works on the remaining 50% have not yet commenced due to a delay in obtaining a forestry license. The license is expected by

                         the end of June 2011. The contract is expected to be completed by the end of August 2011 but could be delayed if the license is not obtained in time. Monitoring of nutrient removal
                         results under Component B has been affected by the delay to the late commencement of the works. Some public communication activities under Component C (Dissemination and
                         Replication) have also been slower than planned; however an Action Plan to complete these activities was prepared and it is envisaged that outstanding activities will be completed
                         within the remaining implementation time-frame. Impact evaluation and dissemination activities under Component C, including the project closing workshop will also be implemented
                         before the closing date.
