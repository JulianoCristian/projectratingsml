2) to\n            enhance the nutrient trapping capacity of Gemenc and\n            Beda-Karapancsa wetlands situated in the lower Hungarian\n            part of the Danube River; and 3) to serve as a model for\n            similar nutrient reduction initiatives in Hungary and other\n            Danube basin countries. The changes will involve\n            introduction of amendments to the project's legal\n            documents to reflect official transfer of implementing\n            agency responsibilities from the former Ministry of\n            Environment and Water to its legal successors the Ministry\n            of Rural Development.
