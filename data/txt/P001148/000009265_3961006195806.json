The project achieved some of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            modest, sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of\n            the Bank was satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            marginally unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the current separation of the\n            training function from the operating entities of the sector\n            is not sustainable and CI-TELECOM, in particular, should\n            incorporate this training function into its human resource\n            management function. Second, although organization was\n            improved, more resources should have been allocated to\n            develop effective tools of management, such as computerized\n            billing, network management, and inventory and accounting\n            systems. Third, the project exclusively focused on issues\n            confronting the telecommunications operating entity without\n            encompassing broader issues, such as the Government's\n            prerogatives, role, and responsibilities toward the sector,\n            and the respective role and mission of the\n            telecommunications operator as well as the private sector in\n            the development of infrastructure and provision of services.\n            Finally, the intensity of Bank supervision was too low\n            during the critical build-up of the project. A formal\n            mid-term review would have been useful to review and\n            reassess the project's risks."}, "docdt": "1994-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
