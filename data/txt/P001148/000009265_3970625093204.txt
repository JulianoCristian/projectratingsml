SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUNMARY
Borrover:      Goverument of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire
Beneficiaries: Office National des Teleconmmunications (ONT) and Ecole
Nationale Superieure des Postes et Telecommumications
(ENSPT)
Amount;        $24.5 million equivalent
Terms:         20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
The Goverument yill:  (a) onlend $21.9 million equivalent
Terms:         of the loan proceeds to ONT under the same terms as the
Bank loan to the Goverrment but with ONT bearing the
foreign exchange risk; and (b) give $2.6 million
equivalent to ENSPT as a grant.
Projec.        The proposed project is an integral part of ONT's 1986-
Description:   1990 development plan. al I; is designed to strengthen
ONT to enable it, by 1990, to manage the sector effici-
ently. Through physical, institutional and financial
rehabilitation, ONT would improve quality of service,
extend services to rural areas to facilitate decentrali-
zation of economic and social activities and improve its
financial situation.
The project comprises: (a) rehabilitating equipment and
cable network and providing switching and transmission
equipment to improve quality of service; (b) upgrading
the maintenance organization by strengthening the
maintenance units, establishing an electronics repair and
instrument calibration center, upgrading the stores,
garage and workshops and providing tools, instruments,
spare parts and specialized vehicles; (c) upgrading three
microwave links and establishing six UHF links; (d)
extending telex services to the interior; (e) upgrading
computer facilities to handle management systems;
ai Though ONT's rehabilitation program is for the three year period
1986-1988, it is expected to be fully implemented only by 1990. It is
therefore referred to in this report as the 1986-1990 development plan.



(f) miscellaneous equipment including pover equipment;
(g) civil vorks; (h) fellowships, staff training and
related equipment; and (i) providing consultants'
services for project planning and implementation,
operational efficiency, manpower development, and for
studies including a reviev of ONT's tariff and corporate
structures.
Project        The project is expected to benefit all segments of the
Bcnefits       Ivorian society.  More efficient use of the
and Risks:     transportation system, due to increased use of
telecomminications services would reduce costs,
environmental pollution and energy consumption_  The
project faces no unusual risks. The major risk is that
ONT could fail to implement the project on time.
Significant delays here could threaten ONT's financial
viability. Provisions have been made to mitigate these
risks. Consultants' services are provided to assist in
the institutional development.

REPUEBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
SECOND TELCONKUNICATIONS PROJECr
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Governuent of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire (RCI) has
reqnested Bank assistance in ffnancing a telecommumications project for
rehabilitation over the period 1986-1988. The estimated cost of the
project is $116.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
about $44.3 million equivalent. The project costs include about $64.6
million equivalent for financial restructuring of ONT, of uhich about $50.1
million equivalent vould be borne by the Governament. Local costs include
$12.3 million equivalent for customs daties and taxes. The Bank vould
finance $24.5 million equivalent of total costs; other financing
institutions wbich bave confirmed their participation are the Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) for an amount of $17.2 million
equivalent and the European Investuent Bank for an amouat of $8.7 million
equivalent (En). The implementing agencies, the Office National des
Telecommmications (ONT) and the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Postes et
Telecommanications (ENSPT), are expected to finance the remainder ($16.2
million equivalent) out of self-generated fonds.
1.02     The objective of the project is to improve the telecommunications
sector in t.e following areas: (a) service quality; (b) access to service;
(c) ONT' s financial position, organization, management systems and
operational efficiency; and {d) resource mobilization. The maintenance
organization would be upgraded by strengtbenlng the mintenance UQitS and
establishing an electronics repair and instrument calibration centre.
ONTts computer facilities would be upgraded to iinprove billing, collection,
accounting and stores ma=sgement. ONT's capital structure and
institutional capabilities would also be improved.
1.03    The Bank, CCCE and EIB have played a significant role in designing
a project for sector rehabilitation and developuent. The Goverument is
comuitted to es toring ONT's financial viability.  The Government bas
already made available $24.7 million equivalent touards ths objective;
another $19.5 million equivalent vill be made avaîlable by the end of June
1986 vith the balance of Goverument's contribution of $5.9 million
equivalent being provided in 1987 and 1988 according to an agreed schedule.
1.04     The project vould take five years to complete. This is based on
the Bank's disbursement profile for telecomtzinications projects vorldwide
and reflects curre-t ONT management ability and actions already initiated
in ONT for implementation of the project.



Il.  THE TECOMUMNICATIC9S SECTOR
A. Background
General
2.01      Authority for the sertor in the Cote d'Ivoire rests with the
Ministere des Travaux Publics, Construction, Postes et Telecommunications
(MTPCPT). Under the Ministry, ONT is responsible for all public
telecagmunications services while ENSPT is responsible for training of both
posts and telecommunications staff. The inland services vere, up to July
1984, the responsibility of the Office des Postes et Telecommunications
(OPT), an entity vithin the then Ministere des Postes et Telecommunications
(MPT). The international services vere, until then, bperated by a State
owned company, the Societe d' Etat des Telecommunications Internationales
de la Cote d'Ivoire (INTELCI), which had more autonomy than OPT. On July
1, 1984, the Postal and Telecommunications branches of the OPT vere
separated and the Telecommunications branch merged vith INTELCI to form
ONT. Simultaneously, the Office National des Postes (ONP) was created.
Access to Service
2.02      The average telephone density, at end 1985, vas 0.56 main
telephone lines (DELs) per 100 inhabitants. Greater Abidjan had a density
of 1.69 and the rest of the country only 0.20. These figures, although
better than those in some African countries, are low compared vith those of
countries with similar GNPs to the Cote d'Ivoire.l/ Greater Abidjan, with
24% of the country's population, had 74% of the DELs. Of the remaining
DELs, about 9.0% vere in four principal regional cities and 17.0% in about
100 towns all over the country. Ninety f'>ur percent of the DELs were
served from automatic exchanges, the remaining lines being served from
small manual exchanges in 79 rural towns. There vere only 60 coin box
telephones and public call offices. Automated telex service vas available
to 1,790 subscribers, of whom 1,670 vere in the Abidjan area. Telegraph
service is also available.
Usage of Service
2.03      About 78Z of telephone subscribers (84% in Abidjan and 56Z in the
smaller towns) vere privare and 15Z government (11Z in Abidjan and 29% in
the smaller towns). The rest were ONT service telephones. Current statis-
tics do not distinguish between residential and business telephones, nor is
there data on the composition of traffic. The average telephone revenue in
1985 was $1,370 per DEL, which is higher than in many African countries.
1/ For example: Tunisia had 8.0 for the capital area and 1.1 for the rest
of the country, Morocco 3.0 and 0.5, Jamaica 5.6 and 1.2, and Zimbabwe
7.7 and 0.5 DELs per 100 inhabitants. Even a country like Kenya, with
less than one half of RCI's GNP per capita, bqd 4.7 in the capital area
and 0.3 in the rest of the country.



- 3 -
Existing Facilities and Quality of Service
2.04      At end 1985, total telephone switching capacity vas 81,560 lines
and telex exchange capacity 2,750 lines. Aunex 1 shows statistics on the
-development of facilities over the period 1979-1985. Service is poor, vith
many outages and long delays in restoration. Call efficiency is poor with
60Z of peak hour traffic and 40% of slack hour traffic lost. The vaiting
tIme for a dial tone often exceeds 30 seconds. This situation has arisen
due to equipment imbalance and poor maintenance. The problem vill be
alleviated through the project [paras 3.03(a) and (b)I.
Demand for Service
2.05      At end 1985, lines in service met 72Z of the expressed demand
(vorking lines plus registered applicants) for telephone connection; the
figure vas 68Z in Abidjan, 79% in the four biggest provincial cities and
86% in the rest of the country. This does not take account of significant
unexpressed demand as potential customers are discouraged from registering
by long vaiting times. In many cases, the vaiting time is longer than a
year. FrGm 1975 to 1985 DELs increased 9.0% per year and demand grev at
11.2Z per year (Annex 16, C3). Demand is estimated to grov at 6% per year
over the 1986-90 period. ONT aims to meet 80Z of demand by 1992. About
74Z of the demand for telex is currently met; ONT plans to fully meet it by
1992. The data on demand, quality of, and access to service are taken from
the 20 year Telecommunications Master Plan, which vas finalized in Harch
1985.  The work vas financed by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and executed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
Manufacturing
2.06      No significant telecommunications manufacturing industry exists
in the Cote d'Ivoire. A study by the Banque Ouest Africaine de
Developpement (BOAD) in 1981 concluded that due to the small quantities and
technological requirements, domestic telecommunications manufacturing vould
not be economically viable.
B. The Entity-ONT
Organization and Management
2.07      ONT was created in July 1984 by Presidential Decrees by the
merger of the Telecommunications branch of OPT and INTELCI (para 2.01).
This merger vas initiated by the Government to improve the efficiency of
the sector. The Governmeue later agreed to establish a planning unit at
the Bank's suggestion. The organizational structure of ONT is shown below.

This structure is acceptable and contains the essentials for addressing key
issues. The planning unit was established, and its staff trained by the
ITU. However, its role needs to be enhanced after it has gained sufficient
experience. The role, functions and status of the planning unit will be
examined under the overall review of ONT's organization structure [paras



- 5 -
2.10, 5.01 (c) aud (<u1).  It vas agreed during negotiations that a special
unit vill be established to ^oordinate the implementation of the project.
The unit vill report directly to the Director [para 5.01 (a)l. Top
managerial positions as well as other key posts in ONT are held by
ex-INTELCI staff. The new management vants to improve operational
efficiency. Rowever, its efforts are hampered by poorly defined job
descriptions, the current remuneration scheme, and the lack of systematic
in-service training [para 2.19(b)]. The project addresses these issues
through (a) a manpower planning review and preparation of an action plan
including the development of job descriptions; and (b) requiring ONT to
freeze its maupovez at the February 1986 level (except for a few
specialized categories) until 1990 [paras 5.01(b) and (c)].
2.08      A key factor for the success of ONT vill be its ability to retain
key ex-INTELCI staff. The remunerations in INTELCI vere at least twice
those in the civil service-ruled ONT and since ex-INTELCI staff members
bave good qualifications, they could find other employment. The loss of
such key personnel vould hinder the implementation of the project. It is
important that arrangements are made to retain these people. However, the
government is understandably reluctant to take short-tern measures which
could result in inequities. ONT has recently proposed a aew remuneration
scheme for its staff which is inadequate as it does not address all the
maupower planning issues. In preparing a manpower plan, the consultants to
be engaged under the project vould also assist ONT in establishing a sound
remuneration scheme [paras 3.04 and 5.01(c)].
2.09      ONT headquarters executes the overall control and supervision,
formulates and coordinates policy, and has direct responsibility for
network planning, major construction and billing.  Regional offices handle
day-to-day operations and subscriber relations. Due to the prominence of
Abidjan in ONT's activities, the division of labor between the Abidjan
Region and headquarters needs to be reviewed. Folloving the review of
ONT's organizational structure, job descriptions (para 2.07) vill be
prepared to reflect the vork load at headquarters and at the regional
offices [paras 3.04 and 5.01(d)3.
2.10      ONT vill require more autonomy in areas such as financial
control, setting tariffs, procurement, staffing and remuneration.  Under
the project, a study vill be undertaken to examine the potential of
reorganizing ONT under an autonomous corporate szructure and to review the
relationship between ONT and ENSPT. Contracts for the services of
consultants for the reorganization study vill be signed by October 1, 1986
and folloving a review vith the Bank by December 1987, the Government and
ONT vill implement the agreed recommendations [paras 3.04, 3.06 and
5.01(d)].
Accounting System
2.11      Before the establishment of ONT, accounts for both Posts and
Telecommunications in OPT vere maintained jointly. Under the first
project, accounting consultants were engaged and, in 1982, separate
accounts vere established for Posts and Telecommunications. The Agent



-6-
Comptable, who is the defacto Chief Accotatant, is appointed by, and
reports directly to, the Treasury. Accounts are maintained on a cash
basis.  Inventory management is poor. An internal audit section vas
created when ONT vss established but it lacks definition of levels of
responsibilities and authority. Consultants wlll be hired under the
project to improve management of the accouating system, inventory control
and internal audit [paras 3.04 and 5.01(f)].
2.12      Preparation of accounts in OPT vas very slow.  Draft 1981
accoutts vere only available in 1983; draft accoants for 1984 are nov being
finalized. To ensure timely presentation of accounts to the Bank, it was
agreed during negotiations that the folloving timetable vill be complied
vith [para 5.01(e)].

Billing and Collection
2.13      ONT billing is through a central computerized systea. From July
1984, the billing period vas reduced from quarterly to bimonthly. The time
required to issue bills after the closing date of each billing period has
gone from 40 days in 1983 to 20 days in 1985. Bills are mailed to
subscribers from the telephone accounting center where subscribers are
required to set;le thelr accounts in person. There is a shortage of
computer terminal units at the center to link up vith the computer and
subscrlbers are subjected to long waiting times at the time of payment.
Mezsures to settle arrears are being introduced under the project (paras
2.16 and 3.15). Follow up procedures for nonpayment exist but have not
been adhered to. Under the proposed project, equipment vould be provided
and procedures2/ for bill payment and disconnection for nonpayment vould
be developed and implemented. This would reduce the time required to
disconnect service from about 7 months to about 2 months after the billing
date by the end of 1988 (Annex 6) and accounts receivable vould decrease
from 12 months' billing at end 1984 to 2-1/2 months by end 1988.
p
2/ Alternatives being considered include settlement of accounts through
commercial banks.



Consultants vill be engaged under the project to suggest improvements in
the billing and collection systems, including introduction of a monthly
billing system. It was agreed during negotiations that a monthly billing
system vould be introduced by March 1987 [para 5.01(f)].
Accounts Receivable
2.14      At end 1985, accounts receivable vere about CFAF 31 billion ($80
million), equal to 12 months' revenues. The amount due from official
subscribers (governuent and its agencies) vas CFAF 9 billion ($23 million),
while the renainder, CFAF 22 billion, vas due from private subscribers. A
significant portion of the outstanding amount has been carried forward for
a number of years. ONT estimates that CFAF 14 billion (about $36 million)
is irrecoverable and has requested Governuent's approval to write off
CFAF 12 billion in F786 and CFAF 2 billion in FY87. The financial
forecasts have assumed that this amount vould be written off the balance
sheet in FY86 aad FY87 (Annex 12).
2.15      ONT is taking some measures to reduce outstanding accounts. The
billing period has been reduced from three months to two months; collection
rate has increased from CFAF 2.0 billion per month in 1984 to CFAF 3.6
billion per month in 1985. Further improvements are expected vith the
billing and collection systems to be implemented under the project [paras
3.03(c) and 3.04 (v)].
2.16      The Covernuent has agreed to clear its outstanding accounts by
FY87. ONT has engaged three law firms to assist it in collecting
receivables from private subscribers. A phased plan to clear the arrears
=.-s agreed during negotiations and this is included as a target to measure
ONT performance (para 3.15 and Annex 6).
Financial Restructuring
2.17      As a result of ONT's veak operational efficiency and debt
incurred from previous investments, the Govern_ent and ONT have agreed to
restore ONT's financial viability through a restructuring plan which will
cover ONT's total financial requirements estimated at $64.6 million
equivalent.   The Government has agreed to contribute $50.1 million
equivalent toward this anount, part of which ($24.7 mlllion equivalent) has
already been made available, while an amoumt of $19.5 million equivalent is
expected before the end of June, 1986, vith the balance being provided in
1987 and 1988 according to an agreed schedule. The remaining portion of
ONT's financial requirement ($14.5 million equivalent) vill be financed by
CCCE in an amount of $5.7 million equivalent, while $8.8 million equivalent
of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan vill be utilized to finance a
portion of the increnental operating costs during the project period. In
order to alleviate 0NT's debt burden, the Government has agreed to pay the
interest on disbursed funds from the Bank, CCCE and EIB loans during 1987
and 1988 and convert the corresponding amount into equity in ONT. These
measures should enable ONT to be financially viable by 1989. As a
condition of loan effectiveness, the Government and ONT vill present to the
Bank a financial restructuring plan for the period 1986-88 [para 5.02(d)].

C. Developuent
Sector Goals
2.18      The country's goals for the sector are:
(a) to rebabilitate and strengthen ONT to establish a
viable and vell managed telecommunications entity;
(b) to provide efficient telecommunications services; and
(c) to extend services to the rural areas to help
decentralize economic and social activities.
Priority has been accorded to rehabilitating existing plant and improving
ONT's financial performance and operations and management systems.
Sector Development Constraints
2.19      The principal constraints are summarized below:
(a) Sector Organization: ONT as a government -office'
lacks the effective autonomy of an independent entity;
(b) Staffing: ONT lacks job descriptions for most of its
posts resulting in inefficiency and overstaffing;
(c) Planning: ONT's planning capacity is inadequate. The
overal; utilization of the network, which should be 75Z
to 80% is only 50%; and
(d) Maintenance: ONT lacks an adequate maintenance
organization with well trained staff. This leads to
losses of revenue due to long and frequent outages,
to client frustrations due to poor service quality, to
high operational costs and to reduced equipment life.
Bank's Role and Strategy
2.20      Experience vith Past Lending. The Bank has been associated vith
the telecommunications sector in the Cote d'Ivoire since 1974. The first
project (Loan 981-IVC), approved in 1974, has been completed. It supported
the 1974-78 program for expanding inland telecommincation services and
included institutional development components. The project experienced
procurement and building construction delays. This reflected the poor
management of the entity and the unfamiliarity of the Borrower with the
Bank's procedures. The physical expansion component of the project vas
completed but the institutional improvements were not. However, as a
result of Bank involvement in the sector, some improvements have taken
place. The first 20-year Master Plan for the sector has been prepared in



consultation with the Bank.3/ Also, a planning unit has been established
(para 2.07). Improvements bave also been realized in the accounting system
such as the separation of postal and telecommunications accounts beginning
with FY82.
2.21      Project Focus.  Given the experience under the first project, the
proposed project focuses on assisting ONT in designing and implementing a
program for institutional rehabilitation and development. The Bank's
involvement is expected to result in lover prices for equipment and
-services procured through ICB.
III. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
A. Description
The Program
3.01      ONT's investment program for the period 1986-1990 comprises
ongoing works from the 1981-1985 Development Plan and new vorks under the
1986-1990 Development Plan. ONT proposes to complete the 1986-1990
Development Plan in two phases. Phase 1, which is covered by the proposed
project and will cover the period from 1986 to 1988, includes institutional
rehabilitation and developuent, financial restructuring and extension vorks
of the highest priority which will lead to better utilization of existing
investuents. Phase II, wl.ich includes expansion vorks to meet about 80% of
demand for telephone service in both urban and rural areas will only be
undertaken after successful completion of Phase 1 including a satisfactory
rehabilitation of ONT's financial situation. The total cost of Phase I of
the 1986-1990 Development Plan is estimated at $116.7 million equivalent,
-ith a foreign exchange component of $44.3 million equivalent. Out of the
total project cost of $116.7 million equivalent, about $64.6 million
(including $8.7 million equivalent in foreign exchange) will be needed to
set ONT's capital structure on a sound basis.
Project Objectives
3.02      The project has the following main objectives:
(a)  improving quality of telephone service through better
network balance, improved maintenance and
rehabilitation and replacement of old assets;
(b)  improving ONT's institutional capabilities in planning,
implementation, procurement, operational efficiency,
maintenance procedures, financial management, billing
and collection, and training;
3/ TORs for the study vere prepared and team members selected in close
consultation with the Bank. The work which vas financed by UNDP and
executed by the ITU, vas finalized in March 1985.



- 10 -
(c) improving ONT's capital structure; and
(d) providing telex facilities to meet business needs.
Project Description
3.03      Specifically, the project consists of the folloving:
(a) rehabilitating existing equipment and cable network and
providing switching and transmission equipment to
eliminate traffic congestion and to improve quality of
service;
(b) upgrading the maintenance organization by strengthening
the maintenance units, establishing an electronics
repair and instrument calibration center, upgrading the
stores, garage and vorkshops, and providing tools,
instruments, spare parts and specialized vehicles;
(c) providing and installing:
(i) equipment for extending telex service to the
interior;
(i) equipment for upgrading three existing microwave
backbone links and establishing six nev UHF links;
(iii) equipment for upgrading computer facilities to
handle billing, collection and management systems;
and
(iv) power equipment;
(d)  construction of buildings for 14 microwave repeater
stations and 2 satellite telephone exchanges; and
(e) staff training, and about 100 manmonths of fellowships
for overseas training of ONT staff. Assurances vere
obtained during negotiations, that by October 1, 1986,
ONT vill have selected the training disciplines and
foreign administrations for fellowships in consultation
with the Bank [para 5.01(g)].
3.G4      The project provides for 75 manmonths of consultants' services
for institutional development. Consultants vill review the areas indicated
below and assist ONT in implementing recommendations arising from the
reviews (Annex 15). Both the Government and ONT have agreed in principle
to implement the findings of the reviews. The technical assistance would
be in the folloaing areas:



- il -
(a) reviewing ONT s organization and management,
including exmining the potential of reorganizing
ONT under an autonomous corporate structure and its
relationship with ENSPT;
(b) manpower planning review, including reviewing
staffing standards, job descriptions, and
remneration for ONT staff;
(c) designing and assisting in implementing the
maintenance organization and the organization of
the repair and calibration center in Abidjan;
(d) improving procedures for connecting subscribers;
(e) improving the billing and collection systems;
(f) reviewing tariff structure and levels; and
(g) developing a system for managing the radio
frequency spectrum.
3.05      ONT staff has inadequate experience for preparing technical
specifications and bid documents for international competitive bidding.
Consultants will be engaged to assist ONT in this and in the acceptance
testing of equipment.  Forty five manmonths uould be required for:
(a)  planning the expansion of external plant, power plant,
air conditioning plant, switching and transmission;
(b) preparing bid documents and evaluation of offers; and
(c)  acceptance testing of equipment.
3.06      Establishing a main.- snce organization, introducing an effective
billing and collection system, improving procedures for subscriber
connections, and reviewing tariff structures are key components of the
project.   ONT would sign all contracts for consultant services not later
than October 1, 1986. Consultants for the study on ONT's reorganization
(including the possibility of establishing an autonomous corporate
structure) vill report to the Goverument by July 1987. The Government and
ONT will review the conclusions and recommendations with the Bank and, by
December 1987, agree on a timetable for implementing the agreed
recommendations [para 5.01(d)]. Terms of reference (TORs) for all
consultants' services are in Annex 15. A list of six consultanting firms
as well as the TORs for all consulting services were agreed upon during
negotiations [para 5.01(h)].
3.07      Annex 3 shows the anticipated growth of telecommunications facil-
ities over the project period. Map IBRD 19007R-Cote d'Ivoire shows planned
telecommunications development in Cote d'Ivoire under the proposed project.

B. Costs
Project Cost
3.08      The total cost of the project in estimated at CFAF 44.9 billlion
($116.7 million equivalent) vith a foreign exchange component of CFAF 17.0
billion ($44.3 million equivalent). Project base coft estimates reflect
estluated early 1986 prices, and are based on experience with contracte
under the first telecoumunications project and on experience in other coun-
tries. The local cost component includes CFAF 4.7 billion ($12.3 million
equivalent) for customa duties and tares. ONT ls liable for customs duties
at average rates of 40Z for telecoumunication equipment and SOZ for
vehicles. The value added tax on local vorks and purchases is 25Z.

Contingencies
3.09      Physical contingencies are 5% on local and foreign costs for
equipment, 10% on local and foreign costs for services and 10X on civil
works. Price contingencies are based on local and foreign cost increases
of 7.2% in 1986, 6.8% in 1987 and 1988, 7.0% in 1989 and 7.1% in 1990.
Project Financing
3.10      Besides the Bank, CCCE and EIB have agreed to finance the
project.  It is proposed to finance the project as follows:

$21.9 million equivalent of the proceeds of the Bank loan would be onlent
to ONT. About $2.6 million of the Bank loan would be passed on to ENSPT in
the form of a grant. The CCCE loan to the Government would be at 8.22%
p.a. with repayment over a 15 year period, including five years of
grace4/. The EIB loan to the Government would be at 5.5% p.a. (8.5% less
an interest subsidy of 3.0% in accordance with the Lome Convention) with
repayment over 17 years, including five years of grace. The proceeds of
the Bank, CCCE and EIB loans vould be onlent to ONT under the same terms
but with ONT bearing the foreign exchange risk. During negotiations, ONT
reconfirm ed the aggregate size of the three-year investuent program and
vill consult with the Bank before making any changes to the investment
program [para 5.01(j)]. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and ONT and of a grant agreement between the
Government and ENSPT, acceptable to the Bank and reflecting the above,
vould be conditions of the loan effectiveness [paras 5.02(a) and (b)].
Conditions for effectiveness of agreements with CCCE and EIB will be
fulfilled prior to the effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan [para
5.02(e)].
C. Procurement, Implementation

3.12      Equipment for $10.3 million (including contingencies) financed by
the Bank would be procured by ICB in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Negotiations with existing suppliers would be used to procure
$0.8 million of spares to be financed by the Bank. Limited international
bidding (LIB) would be used to procure $1.0 million of measuring equipment
and tools. LIB has been selected for these packages as the amounts
involved are either small or there are only a limited nuaber of suppliers.
LIB would also be used to procure $2.6 million of equipment and some
services for ENSPT.  Items falling under the description of incremental
operating costs (stores, fuel, spare parts, etc.) vorth $8.8 million
equivalent will be procured under limited competitive bidding either
locally or internationally. Bank-financed contracts costing $1.0 million
equivalent or more will be subject to prior Bank review of procurement
documentation and will cover about 85% of the total value of such contracts
for telecommunication equipment. Other Bank financed contracts will be
subject to post award review. Selection of Bank-financed consultants



- 15 -
(about $1.0 million equivalent) vould be ln accordance vith Bank
guidelines. Procurement under cofinancing vould be in accordance vith the
guidelines of the respective iastitution.
Disbursements
3.13      Disbursements against CCOE and EIB loans would be in accordance
vith the requirements of these institutions. Except for payment against
coatracts of less than $20,000 equivalent, ihich will be disbursed against
statements of expenditure, the proposed Bank loan of $24.5 million would be
disbursed against full standard documentation for: (a) 100Z of foreign
expenditures for goods, (b) 100% of total expenditures for consultants, (c)
OOZ of foreign expenditures and 80Z of local expenditures for ONT's
incremental operating costs, and (d) 100% of foreign expenditures and 80%
of local expenditures for the ENSPT comiponent. Tvo Special Accounts of
$3.1 million equivalent for ONT and $0.3 million equivalent for ENSPT vill
be established in the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA). These figures
represeat three months estimated disbursements during the peak disbursement
period of 1987 to 1988. The Special Accounts for the Bank loan would be
replenishable and vould be used for disbursements against all
expenditures.   Applications for replenishment vill be submitted on a
bimonthly basis.  To provide for local coumterpart funds, replenishable
Project Accounts for ONT and ENSPT vill be opened. Opening of the Project
Accounts for ONT and ENSPT vith initial deposits satisfactory to the Bank
-_ll be a condition of loan effectiveness [para 5.02(c)].  The estimated
schedule of Bank loan disbtrsements for the three-year rehabilitation
project is presented in Annex 4. This is based on the Bankvide
disbursement profile for 40 telecommunications projects during 1972-1983
and reflects current ONT management ability and actions already initiated
in ONT for implementation of the project.  The bureaucratic procurement
procedures lin Cote d'Ivoire up to contract notification May affect the
disbursement schedule.  Rovever, the revision of such procedures initiated
under Bank prompting, is expected to lead to a reduction of such
delays.5/ The loan is expected to be closed on June 30, 1991.
Implementation
3.14      Based on the experience it gained under the First
Telecomimmications Project and, with the assistance, vhere necessary, of
consultants specifically recruited for the purpose, ONT vould implement the
project, except that installations vill be done by contractors under ONT's
supervision.  To minimize implementation delays, technical assistance has
been included and frequent Bank supervision missions vill be scheduled
during 1986 and 1987 (para 4.10).  The proposed implementation schedule for
the major components is presented in Annex 5. The project is expected to
be completed by December 31, 1990.
Performance Indicators
3.15      Performance indicators to monitor ONT's implementation,
operational and financial performance are given in Annex 6.  The targets
for 1986 and 1987 vere agreed during negotiations, as representing

desirable and feasible levels. ONT will report progress against the
physical indicators in the quarterly project reports and progress against
the financial indicators will be reported in annual financial statements.
The targets for subsequent years will be agreed to by the Bank and ONT
during the preceding year together vith any necessary corrective measures
[para 5.01(k)].

Net fixed assets comprise CFAF 57 billion from OPT and CFAF 17 billion from
INTELCI.  The long-term debt includes amounts oued to foreign and local
banks, the French Posts and Telecommunications administration, the Treasury
and ONP. ONT's debt service for the 1986-1988 period is estimated at CFAF
52,682 million (about $137 million). The current ratio at 1.5 is
artificially high since current assets include about CFAF 12 billion of
accounts receivable which are not likely to be recovered (para 2.14).
Adjusting for this factor, the current ratio drops to about 0.9.
Future Financial Performance
4.03      Revenues for 1985 have been estimated at CFAF 37.1 billion.
Forecast financial statements for 1986-1990 are in Annexes 9 to 12. A
summary of ONT's future financial performance is given below.

4.04      ONT's projected financial performance over the project period is
good. However, 1986-87 will be critical witth regard to ONT's cash flow.
This vill be helped through measures proposed under the project including
the rem»oval of physical bottlenecks in the network which should result in
additional revenues, billing GNP for lines it has in service, emphasis on
collection of arrears, long-term borroving and equity contribution by the
Government (para 2.17).
Financing Forecast
4.05      The funds flow forecast (Annex 11) is based upon the
implementation of the proposed project.  The following suimarizes the
financing plan for 1986-90.

ONT's net cash generation would finance the equivalent of about 47Z of the
total program cost over 1986-90. The average debt service coverage over
the period is forecast at 1.3. Sufficient provisions have been included in
the project to ensure that ONT's financial performance vould be
satisfactory. During negotiations, it vas agreed that:
(a) ONT and the Governinent shall prepare a three year rolling
financial restructuring plan, starting with the period
1986-1988, satisfactory to the Bank, and that such plans
shall be reviewed with the Bank not later than October of
each year [paras 5.01 (1) and 5.02(d)];
(b) ONT's cash flow in any year shall not be less than the
local fund requirement of ONT's approved investment
program in the following fiscal year [para 5.01(m)];
(c) ONT's rate of return on average net revalued fixed
assets in operation vould not be less than llZ [para
5.01(n)]; and



- 20 -
(d) ONT shall not incur any new debt, if after the incurrence
of such debt, the debt-equity ratio shall be greater than
75/25 ln FY87, 70/30 in FY88, 65/35 in FY89 and 60/40 in
FY9O [para 5.01 (o)].
B. Economic Analysis
Tariffs
4.06      The average revenue per DEL in 1985 Was $1,370 which is high
compared to many African countries.  Tariffs increased by 11% in July 1981
and by 16% in October 1982. The initial connection charge for a telephone
is about $120 (Annex 13). Local calls are untimed while long distance
calls are. ONT has agreed to introduce local call timing during the
project implementation period. Tariffs in Cote d'Ivoire have not been
revieued for several years. Consultants vill be engaged under the project
to review tariff structure and levels.  Results of the revieu will be
discussed between ONT and the Bank and agreement reached not later than
Narch 31, 1987 on an action plan for the implementation of the revised
tariff structure and levels [paras 3.04 and 5.01(p)].
Benefits
4.07      The eronomic analysis relates to ONT's 1986-90 investment
program. The proposed project has been designed to support the
Goverument's economic plan. As outlined in paragraph 2.05, there is a
large unsatisfied demand for telecommunications services and the investment
program is expected to meet only part of this. All segments of the
1pflpulation should benefit from the distribution of benefits of the proposed
investment program through communication-related increases in Governzent
and business efficiency and the resulting lower costs for goods and
services.
4.08      Sector rehabilitation and priority investnents vill enable ONT to
have a wider impact on other sectors than is apparent from telephone
statistics. For example, the transfer of funds to and from Goverument over
the 1986-90 period results in a net surplus in favor of Goverument of about
$28.9 million. These funds vould be available to Government for investment
in other sectors.
4.09      The internal financial rate of return on the proposed project is
estirated a- 17%. This understates the benefits which vould be derived
from the investnà.rt program. It does not take into account all indirect
and external benefits received by non-users of the services. On the basis
of estimates of consumer surplus, adjusting for customs duties snd taxes,
and the application of a standard conversion factor of 0.90 to local costs
and revenues, the quantifiable estimate of the project's minimum economic
rate of return is 30% (Annex 14).



- 21 -
Risks
4.10     Significant delays in implementation of the project could threaten
ONT's financLal viability. To minimize this risk and bearing in mind the
experience of the first project (para 2.20), technical assistance has been
included and the project will be supervised closely during 1986 and 1987.
Conditionalities on project implementation will also reduce this risk
(paras 3.14 and 3.15). Poor incentives and low remuneration leading to the
loss of key personnel would also adversely affect implementation. A
manpower plan to be prepared by consultants appointed under the project
will address this issue (para 3.04).
4.11      The growth rates used in projecting revenues (Annex 12) have been
discussed at length vith Government and ONT officials as vell as with the
other cofinanciers. The rates are conservative and are expected to be
attained.
4.12      A sensitivity aralysis  has been carried out.  A 20Z increase in
capital and operating costs, combined with a 20Z decrease in benefits,
would reduce the quantifiable economic rate of return from 30% to 11%. A
two-year delay in all benefits with no postponement of costs, which is
highly unlikely, vould reduce the economic rate of return to 16% (Annex
14).
Least Cost Solution
4.13      The investment program (para 3.01) is the least cost solution for
providing the service levels planned, within the constraincs imposed by the
existing configuration and technology of the telecommunications network.
The timing and dimensioning of various elements in the system are based on
accepted engineering practice for selection of techniques and equipmLnt.
Environment and Health Aspects
4.14      The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or
health impacts. Improved telecommunications services improve the delivery
system for routine and emergency health services. Increased use of tele-
communication services produces more efficient use of the transportation
system, reduces costs, environmental pollution and energy consumption.
AGREEMENTS
5.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(a) a special project management unit shall be created
directly under the Director to oversee the implementation
of the project (para 2.07);
(b) except for few specialized categories, ONT shall freeze
recruitment for the period 1986-1990 (para 2.07);



-22-
(c)  signing of contracts with consultants by October 1, 1986
to review ONT's organization including the possibility of
reorganizing ONT under an autonomous corporate structure,
to review the relationship between ONT and ENSPT, to
prepare job descriptions for all posts, to establish
staffing standards, and to propose reuzneration for ONT
staff (paras 2.07, 2.08, 2.10 and 3.04);
(d)  consultants appointed for the reorganization study will
report to the Government by July 1987. The Goverument
and ONT uill review the conclusions and recommendations
with the Bank and, by December 1987, agree on a timetable
for implementing the agreed recommendations (paras 2.10
and 3.06);
(e)  to ensure timely presentation of accounts to the Bank,
draft accounts for FY85 will be presented 8 months after
the end of the fiscal year with the audited accounts 12
»onths after the end of the fiscal year. This vill be
reduced to 7 and 10 months for FY86, to 6 and 8 months
for FY87 and to 4 asd 6 months for FY88 and thereafter
(para 2.12);
(f)  completing the studies to computerize inventory control
and to improve the accounting system, the billing snd
collection systems and the introduction of a monthly
billing system by March 1987 (paras 2.11, 2.13 and 3.04);
(g)  ONT will select by October 1, 1986, in consultation vith
the Bank, the training disciplines asd foreign
Administrations for fellowsbips [para 3.03 (e)|;
(h)  terms of reference for all consultant reviews including a
list of six consulting firms (para 3.06);
(i)  a financing plan (para 3.10);
(j) ONT reconfirmed the aggregate size of the three-year
investment program (1986-1988) and ill consult with the
Bank before maklng changes to the said investment program
(para 3.10);
(k)  performance targets representing desirable and feasible
levels for 1986 and 1987 vere agreed upon. Targets for
each subsequent year will be agreed to jointly by the
Bank and ONT during the preceding year together with any
necessary corrective measures (para 3.15);
(1) ONT and the Governuent would prepare a three year rolling
financial restructuring plan for ONT satisfactory to the
Bank and would review it with the Bank by October in each
year [para 4.05 (a)];



-23 -
(a) ONT's net cash flow during any given year shall be not
lesa than the local fund requirement of ONT's approved
investment program for the folloving fiscal year [para
4.05(b)I;
(n) ONT would apply measures to ensure that its annual rate
of return on the average net revalued fixed assets in
operation is not less than 11Z [para 4.05(c)];
(o) ONT shall not incur any neo debt, if after the incurrence
of such debt, the debt-equity ratio shall be greater than
75/25 in FY87, 70/30 in FY88, 65/35 in FY89 and 60/40 in
FY90 [para 4.05(d)]; and
(p) completing a review of the tariff structure and levels,
the results of vhich vould be discussed with the Bank and
agreement reached not later than March 31, 1987 on an
action plan for the implementation of revised tariff
structure and levels (para 4.06).
5.02      Conditions of loan effectiveness are:
(a) ONT and the Government had signed a subsidiary loan
agreement acceptable to the Bank, whereby the proceeds of
the Bank loan vould be oulent to ONT at The Bank's
variable interest rate plus 2Z per annua for a period of
20 years including a five year grace period (para 3.10);
(b) execution of the ENSPT grant agreement vith terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.10);
(c) opening of Project Accounts for ONT and ENSPT to provide
for local counterpart funds vith initial deposits
satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.13);
(d) presentation to the Bank of the three year financial
restructuring plan for ONT for the period 1986-88 (para
2.17); and
(e) the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the
loass from CCCE and EIB are fulfilled (para 3.10).
5.03      Provided the above conditions are met, the proposed project is a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Goverumwnt of the Republic of Cote
d'Ivoire, of $24.5 million for a term of 20 years including 5 years grace,
at the standard variable interest rate.

Notes and Assumptions on the Financial Forecasts 1985-1990
Income Statements
1.        Annual increases ln number of vorking DELs are as per program
implementation schedule.
2.        Average revenue per DEL to grow at Z% per annum with the largest
annual increase of 6% occurring in 1987.
3.        Average revenue per telex subscriber to grov at 4Z per annum
between 1985 and 1988 and to remain constant at CFAF 2.5 million per annum
thereafter.
4.        Telegraph revenues have been assumed to remain constant at CFAF 1
billion per annum.
5.        Other revenues (computer services, private lines, etc.) have been
assumed to grow at an average of 5Z per annum, from a toral of about CFAF 3
billion in 1985 to a total of CFAF 3.8 billion in 1990.
6.        Wages and salaries have been assumed to remain at the 1985
average vage per employee. An increase of 3Z per annum has been assumed to
cater for promotion and possible premiums.
7.        The nuiber of staff per average 1,000 DEL in operation to decline
from 76 in 1985 to 52 in 1990. This assumes ONT vill freeze the total
nmber of staff at 4,400.
8.        Maintenance and transportation costs per DEL have been assumed to
remain at the 1985 level. This is based on the assumption that a better
maintenance organization vill result in increased efficiency.
9.        Operating costs have been inflated at rates similar to the
projected inflation rate in Cote D'Ivoire.
10.       Depreciation has been calculated at 5% per annum of the average
gross plant in service in the year.
11.       Interest on new foreign loans has been assumed at 10% per annum on
the average outstanding loans over a 15 year period including 5 years of grace.
Interest on new local loans has been assumed at 15% per annum on the average
outstanding loans over a 12 year period including 3 years of grace.

12.       ONT is not liable for corporate (income) tax.
13.       The level of doubtful accounts as a proportion of gross revenues
vould decline from 7% in 1985 to 6Z in 1986, 5Z in 1987, 4Z in 1988, 3% in
1989 and would remain at 2% thereafter.
Balance Sheets
14.       Increase in gross fixed assets is related to transfer from works
in progress as assets become revenue-producing.  Vork in progress on
average is transferred to fixed assets equally over the two succeeding
years.
15.       Accounts receivable as a percentage of gross revenues would be
50% in 1986, 30% in 1987 and remain constant at 20% thereafter.
16.       Inventory as a percentage of gross fixed assets to increase from
6% in 1986 to 10% in 1987 and to remain constant at 10% thereafter.
17.       Advances, prepayments and other carrent assets to remnain at about
25Z of cash operating costs.
18.       Accounts payable as a portion of work in progress and cash
operating costs would be about 35Z.
19.       Long term debt represents existing cozmit-ments and proposed
borrowings from CAA, CCCE, EIB, and IBRD. Withdravals are based on the
disburseuent profile.
20.       Of the estimated CFAF 14 billion irrecoverable accounts
receivable, CFAF 12 billionwould be written off in 1986 and CFAF 2 billion
in 1987.
21.       For determining the rate of return on revalued average net fixed
assets in operatiork, assets vere revalued at 20Z in 1986 and at 5Z per
annum in each subsequent year.
22.       The Goverument will be responsible for paynents of interest
due on foreign loans (Bank, CCCE and EIB) in 1987 and 1988. The amounts
would be converted to Government equity in ONT in those years.

SECONID TElECOMUICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investments
1.       ONT's investment program for the period 1986-1990, of which the
Bank-financed project is an integral part, also includes ongoing and other
works. The close relationship between project and nonproject investments
makes any attempt at separation arbitrary.  Therefore, the rate of return
calculation is made on the basis of ONT's entire telecommunications
investment program.
2.       The benefit period of the program extends from 1986-2006, when on
average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
completed its useful life. Account has been taken of investments made
prior to 1986 but yielding benefits during the program period.
3.       As from 1991 on, operating costs and revenues related to the
program are assumed to remain constant.  Incremental revenues are based on
expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and on traffic brought
about by the program. Opera.ing costs are based on additional costs
generated by the increases in costs and traffic; they are net of
depreciation and interest. Annual capital replacement costs of about CFAF
5 billion bave been included for the period 1991-2006. No residual values
of fixed assets have been taken into account as the present value of these
in real terms weuld be minimal.
4.        A sumuary of the program's incremental cost and benefit streams
is given below in CFAF billions. All revenues aad costs have been deflated
to bring them to their comparable 1986 price levels.

The internal fimancial rate of return for the above net benefit stream is
16.5%.
5.        The above calculation understates the benefits to be derived from
the telecommunications investment program.  It does not take into account
consumer surplus aad Indirect and external benefits received by noa users
of the telecommunications services. A portion of the consumer surplus was
estimated by assumiu.g (a) that new consumers are similar to the average
existing consumer a-d (b) that existimg and mew e-ubscribers vill be villing
to pay for telecommunications services the same prices ia real terms as
they pay today. Based on these assumptions, adjustimg for taxes and
duties, and on applying a standard coaversation factor of 0.90 (to local
costs and revenues), a minimum estimate of the economic rate of return for
the program is 29.6%.

guide the foru¨lation and implementation of appropriate
structure and levels of tariffs for telecommunications
services in Cote D'Ivoire, apply these principles to
the present structure and levels, and recommend any
necessary changes.
19.      Main Elements
a) Demand Assessment - assess the characteristics of
demand for each of the services offered, and the
sensitivity of demand to the prices which might be
charged, vith a view to determining the cost to
consumers of doing vithout a service where demand
cannot be fully met and the consumers whose demand
is the least price elastic. The work would
require a review of existing records of service
applications, service quality, to be supplemented
by appropriately designed sample surveys;
b)   Usage - carry out a complete revieu of usage data
including, inter alia, the business (including
Government) and residential usage patterns,
traffic and traffic congestion analyses, call rate
aunalyses and local, long distance and
international revenue analyses. Particular
emphasis should be placed upon peak call use.
International traffic pattern should be enalyzed;

discussion and analysis linking national economic
development plans and the interactive role of
tariffs should be made. In particular these
should foeus upon tariff policies as they relate
to long distance charges. Consultants should
assess basis for charging various groups of
services/consumers e.g., public call offices,
rural consumers, mobile systems, to initially
stimulate socially desirable use of the service
and/or recover full costs;
d)   Financial Implication - a financial impact
analysis should be made linking tariff policy and
the resource mobilization capabilities of the
telecommunications sector. Consultants should

20.       Results - The study should result in a recommetded set of tariff
policy guidelines, together with an analysis of the relevant data
necessary as a precursor to tariff decisions. The study should also
result iu a set of alternative prices for various services, identifying
the impact of these upon revenue a-d financial performance of ONT.
Recommendatioas should also be made regarding the organizational
requirements for a system to review tariffs ou a systematic and regular
basis.
