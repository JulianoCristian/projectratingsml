promote the provision of\n            grid-connected and off-grid energy services by the private\n            sector, NGOs and cooperatives using environmentally\n            sustainable, renewal energy technologies; (2) strengthen the\n            environment for Demand Side Management (DSM) implementation;\n            and (3) improve public and private sector performance to\n            deliver energy services through renewable energy and DSM.\n            The project components are three: The ESD credit component,\n            channeled through private Participating Credit Institutions\n            (PCIs), would provide medium and long-term financing to\n            private sector firms, NGOs, and cooperatives for solar home\n            system and village hydro pre-grid electrification,\n            grid-connected mini-hydro schemes, and other renewable\n            energy investments.  The second component would finance a\n            pilot grid-connected wind farm project to be executed by the\n            Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).  This pilot project is\n            expected to demonstrate the commercial viability and\n            long-run economic potential of wind power in Sri Lanka, and\n            to catalyze future private sector wind farm development.\n            The third component, the capacity building component, will\n            provide training and technical support for renewable energy\n            and energy efficiency initiatives by both the public and\n            private sector."}, "docdt": "1997-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
