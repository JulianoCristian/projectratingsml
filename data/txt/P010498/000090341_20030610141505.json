of the Energy Services\n            Delivery Project for Sri Lanka was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was high, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the borrower performance was highly satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that one of the key barriers for\n            private entrepreneurs and households was access to\n            additional capital for energy investments, each of them with\n            their own set of reasons. For all of the private developers\n            involved in the project, the strengthening of a business\n            enabling environment was of a key importance. The\n            introduction of a new industry coincides with learning of\n            new skills within almost all organizations involved.\n            Introduction of new technology in a sector as well as in a\n            company often needs to be driven by sound economic rationale\n            and market principles. For the introduction of the\n            alternative energy systems in Sri Lanka, two fundamental\n            principles were followed: (i) the system need to be the\n            least-cost option compared to its competitor products (grid\n            connected mini hydro projects); or, (ii) the incremental\n            cost of the systems need to be in-line with the incremental\n            cost globally and have a clear declining path of these costs\n            due to economies of scale (solar home systems and village\n            hydro projects). Initial market surveys and pre-investment\n            studies scoped the market for the new technology systems.\n            One of the major reasons for the success of the Energy\n            Service Delivery is that project design was flexible enough\n            to allow different approaches and changes as and when\n            required. Sound project management and financial management\n            are enabling factors. Competent financial management and\n            project management staff in both implementing agencies were\n            enabling factors for successful project implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
