        mixed results, for although it concurs with the\n            Implementation Completion Report (ICR) ratings of likely\n            sustainability, and satisfactory Bank performance concerning\n            the Second Power Distribution and Transmission Project\n            (PDTPII), it downgrades the project outcome to moderately\n            satisfactory, institutional development impacts to modest,\n            and the Borrower performance to unsatisfactory; whereas,\n            regarding the Energy Services Delivery Project (ESDP), the\n            audit upgrades the ICR ratings of outcome, and Bank\n            performance to highly satisfactory, yet concurs on its\n            likely sustainability, high institutional development\n            impacts, and highly satisfactory performance by the\n            Borrower. The main lessons from the Second Power project\n            concern the importance, prior to Board approval, of\n            addressing procurement policies, and procedures that could\n            create problems, and delays later; the need for a truly\n            independent regulatory regime to govern tariff\n            determination, in order to help safeguard the sector's\n            financial viability; and, the importance of rigorously\n            assessing risk, and identifying exit mechanisms for project\n            components, in areas of civil unrest. Conversely, the ESDP\n            yielded the following lessons of broad applicability, as the\n            Bank expands its assistance for renewable energy, as part of\n            its 2001 Energy Business Renewable Strategy, and 2003\n            Infrastructure Plan. These lessons can be clustered around\n            three important areas: a) building-up the business and\n            policy environment, addressing in particular the key barrier\n            of access to capital; b) scaling-up the market, including a\n            reliable after-sales service system, and end-user training;\n            and, c) establishing strong project, and financial\n            management systems, including monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2004-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
