"This is the Project Completion Report\n            (PCR) on the Niger Livestock Project, for which a credit was\n            signed on April 27, 1979, becoming effective on October 12,\n            1979. The project closing date, initially scheduled for\n            March 31, 1985, was extended on four occasions, eventually\n            until September 30, 1989. The final disbursement of proceeds\n            was made on September 28, 1989, and the credit was disbursed\n            in its entirety. The general objectives of the project were\n            to increase pastoralists' incomes and improve the\n            economic environment for livestock production. In the\n            different types of zone, production systems were to be made\n            more productive: in the cropping zone, for instance, the\n            goal was to increase livestock productivity, while in the\n            pastoral zone pastoralists were to be organized more\n            effectively, particularly for pasture and water resource\n            management. The physical results of the project are\n            particularly evident in the pastoral zone, in the way\n            pastoralists are organized and in the siting of pastoral\n            centers. The project assisted with the formation of 144\n            Groupement Mutualiste Pastoral (GMPs) and 9 Groupement a\n            Vocation Cooperatives (GVCs), which, given their economic\n            aims and level of organization, closely resemble full-scale\n            cooperatives. These associations, because they can rely on\n            the pastoral centers, which are actually service complexes,\n            are now contributing to the growth of the pastoral economy.\n            In all areas, tangible results are to be seen in: (i)\n            improved livestock productivity; (ii) the infrastructure\n            created in the project area; and (iii) a data base\n            consisting of the findings of numerous surveys. In moving to\n            improve livestock productivity, the project introduced needs\n            that must be classed as essential from now on and have\n            created very heavy demand among pastoralists for veterinary\n            and animal husbandry goods, particularly antiparasite\n            products. In addition, existing livestock service benefited\n            from better working conditions and numerous\n            training/retraining opportunities for their staff."}, "docdt": "1991-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
