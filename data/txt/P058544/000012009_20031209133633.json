          fulfilling the conditions for the release of the second\n            tranche of the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) Project.\n            It concludes that the Borrower has maintained a satisfactory\n            macroeconomic policy framework, achieved satisfactory\n            progress in carrying out the overall program with respect to\n            public resource management, public sector management, and\n            enhancing governance and fighting corruption, and, completed\n            six of the eight specific actions for the second tranche\n            release as required under the Development Credit Agreement.\n            One condition related to the Law on Investment has only been\n            partially completed, because after a process of extensive,\n            additional consultation with the private sector, the precise\n            formulation for the revised Law submitted to the National\n            Assembly was changed from the language inserted into the\n            tranche condition. Another condition related to the social\n            sector disbursement ratio was also only partially met\n            because flood-related expenditures raised non-social sector\n            spending in an unanticipated, but appropriate, amount. The\n            Government is continuing to support the thrusts of these two\n            conditions, by making the investment incentive regime more\n            transparent and predictable, and, by further reorienting\n            expenditures to the social sectors. In the light of\n            satisfactory overall performance, it is proposed that\n            waivers be granted on a no-objection basis for the above\n            actions in order to release the second tranche of the\n            Credit, in the amount of US$15 million equivalent."}, "docdt": "2003-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
