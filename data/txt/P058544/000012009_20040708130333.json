"versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings convey a satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, and modest institutional\n            development impacts. Lessons first address political\n            stability as the major factor, actually a prerequisite, in\n            fulfilling the successful implementation of macroeconomic\n            and structural reforms, and, remains a critical factor in\n            structural adjustment reform in Cambodia. Nevertheless,\n            while the ownership of the project resided with the senior\n            officials, it was apparently less so among the ministries,\n            and technical staff involved in the program. An effective\n            vehicle would need to be instituted to involve mid-level,\n            and technical staff in the preparation of structural\n            adjustment programs. It is noted the structural adjustment\n            program dealt across ministries, and agencies without\n            proper, and effective mechanisms to enhance its\n            implementation. There is a critical need for a specific\n            inter-ministerial steering group, dedicated to assume the\n            leadership of the operation, and a secretariat with\n            representatives from affected ministries, and agencies for\n            implementation of the operation. These two groups could help\n            the Project Management Unit overcome some of the\n            bottlenecks, due to the country's weak civil service,\n            and to deal with potential rivalries among agencies. This\n            also leads to the availability of technical assistance from\n            donors, and strong Bank team support, extremely crucial in\n            low-income country with weak technical, working capacity.\n            Lessons further reinforce the need for Bank staff\n            continuity, particularly that of the Task Manager; for\n            strong dialogues with the Government, and, of specific\n            provisions, such as Intersectoral Steering Committees, or\n            Public Advisory Commissions, to help maintain and retain the\n            momentum of reform. In addition, lessons also address the\n            need for legal draftsmanship of conditionalities, to be\n            consistent between the Letter of Development Policy, the\n            Development Credit Agreement, and the Policy Matrix,\n            especially in reference to performance expectations\n            involving third parties (concessionaires), and qualitative\n            actions (restructuring, consultation). Moreover, the\n            multi-tranche release credit presents a challenge to the\n            government in fulfilling the conditions for the floating\n            tranche, and the second tranche releases, given the fragile\n            political reality in the Borrower country. It is thus\n            suggested, the reform process in Cambodia would be better\n            met by the new lending instrument, PRSC, (Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit), which provide customized support to\n            country-development, and country-owned reform programs,\n            following extensive consultations among all stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2004-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
