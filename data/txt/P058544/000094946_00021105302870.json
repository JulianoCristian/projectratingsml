First, the SAC program aims to assist in\n            improving public resource management which includes resource\n            mobilization and forestry management. Second, it will assist\n            in enhancing public sector management which comprises\n            expenditure rationalization and preparatory steps for\n            military demobilization and administrative reform. Third, it\n            will assist in formulating a strategy on enhancing\n            governance and fighting corruption in economic management\n            and implementing. The main benefits of the credit is that it\n            will assist the Government in making a successful transition\n            toward sustainable development with significant poverty\n            reduction and broad-based economic growth. Furthermore,\n            Cambodia will improve enabling environment for private\n            sector development through tackling governance problems. The\n            program will also contribute to improving the access of poor\n            households to basic social and economic services such as\n            basic education, health facilities, etc. The risks\n            concerning SAC implementation include: deterioration in\n            political stability; insufficient political will; weak\n            institutional capacity; and weak governance."}, "docdt": "2000-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
