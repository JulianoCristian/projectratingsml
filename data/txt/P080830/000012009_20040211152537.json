Given the nature of this project, and\n            the existence of a number of indigenous populations, and\n            ethnic groups living in the project area, this Indigenous\n            Peoples Plan (IPP) sets the framework to ensure their\n            participation, and that they also share the project's\n            economic benefits. Public awareness campaigns should\n            disseminate information on the implementation of the\n            program, taking into account language diversity, cultural\n            heritage, and traditional ways of life, in order to\n            facilitate access to communal benefits. Nongovernmental\n            organizations, and experienced organizations in indigenous\n            matters, shall survey community requirements in a\n            participatory approach, to comply with the state, and\n            municipal development plans, and define/prioritize the\n            communities' demands. Capacity building, and training\n            shall be provided for community management, organizational\n            skills, and for agricultural productivity activities, among\n            others. Such training shall focus on empowering communities\n            towards managing their own subprojects, in the areas of food\n            products, infrastructure development that complement\n            education, and health activities; and, basic infrastructure\n            - water supply and sanitation, electricity, and improved\n            transportation modes, - and, support for the promotion of\n            cultural activities.
