United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) from 0.647 to\n            0.700 by the year 2007. There are four project components\n            which comprise (a) strengthening the results-based\n            management capacity at the State level for planning,\n            cross-sectoral integration, monitoring and evaluation of\n            public policies and investments under Maranhao's\n            Multi-Year Government Investment Plan (PPA); (b) supporting\n            cross-sectoral integration of development actions at the\n            municipal and local levels through the design and\n            implementation of integrated municipal development plans and\n            the introduction of State-municipal performance agreements;\n            (c) financing demand-driven community investments for\n            income-generation, health and sanitation, education,\n            culture, environmental management and others impacting the\n            HDI and environmental sustainability; and (d) strengthening\n            municipal governance through the participation of community\n            associations and municipal councils in decisions that are\n            directly related to improvements in the living conditions of\n            the rural poor, and through capacity-building focused on\n            integration of environmental sustainability issues in the\n            decision-making process."}, "docdt": "2004-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
