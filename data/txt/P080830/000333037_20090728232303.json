outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: a decentralized, rural Community-Driven\n            Development (CDD) project in a very poor state with issues\n            of institutional capacity at all levels and geographic\n            dispersion may not be the best vehicle for introducing\n            results-based management and similarly challenging\n            activities involving complex vertical and horizontal\n            linkages. While the Northeast CDD projects have, since\n            inception, been vehicles for the successful piloting and\n            scaling up of innovation, not all participating states have\n            equal capacity to host innovation successfully. Innovation\n            also needs consistent commitment and full understanding and\n            buy-in of all stakeholders. Decentralized, community-based\n            projects with broad geographic coverage require more\n            frequent, technical and specialized missions including\n            fiduciary and safeguard specialists. Other Northeast rural\n            poverty reduction projects are now focusing much more on\n            productive investments which have specialized technical and\n            operational requirements. The ability of supervision\n            missions to finance the inclusion of specialists is critical\n            to the success of such activities, including via the\n            training opportunity they can provide to state technical\n            units for analyzing, approving and overseeing implementation\n            of such subprojects."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
