To this end,\n            subprojects will be identified, and selected in accordance\n            with their capacity to generate income, and employment\n            through protective environmental conservation actions.\n            Notwithstanding the environmental nature of this project,\n            this environmental assessment stipulates the following\n            mitigation measures. Capacity building will be provided for\n            adequate technical practices on the use of agricultural\n            machinery, and conservation measures for soil preparation,\n            as it concerns crop sowing, and harvesting. Subprojects\n            concerning agroindustries, should consider its site location\n            at considerable distance from rivers or natural water flows\n            to minimize water pollution, and in areas with adequate\n            wastewater drainage, while the use of septic tanks, and\n            fencing the perimeter should be further considered. The use\n            of compost from residues should be practiced, in addition to\n            biodegradable substances, and organic residues'\n            transformation processes for soil preparation as needed.\n            Solid wastes should be collected, and disposed of at\n            selected landfills, or recycled as possible as per standards\n            regulations. Management of irrigation systems should take\n            into consideration minimal water requirements, to protect\n            aquatic ecosystems, and, minimize detours on natural river\n            flows, to include as well regulatory measures for the\n            sustainable use of groundwater. Crop storage requires the\n            use of appropriate tanks, located at considerable distance\n            from river, and water flows. Finally, livestock management\n            practices should consider \"rotation\" pastures\n            controlling the number of animals, for vegetative, and soil\n            preservation purposes."}, "docdt": "2003-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
