           Liberia's income and export earnings from rubber\n            through an intensive program of replanting about 40,000\n            acres of old rubber and rehabilitation of about 24,000 acres\n            of mature untapped rubber. Improved farm inputs would be\n            provided to about 6,300 small and medium-size farmers on the\n            basis of credit along with extension services, training of\n            farmers and tappers, and assistance for on-farm processing\n            and marketing. The project would also aim at institution\n            building by establishing a Rubber Development Unit as a\n            permanent extension service and training of Liberian staff\n            at all levels. At peak production, the project would\n            increase rubber production from Liberian-owned farms by more\n            than 100% of the present output and would bring about a\n            substantial increase in productivity and the income of small\n            and medium rubber farmers. The project faces no special\n            risks that cannot be overcome through advance planning and\n            appropriate cultivation practices."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
