The most positive element in the\n            Bank's performance on this project was its flexibility\n            in dealing with the problems as they surfaced. This was\n            amply demonstrated by its readiness to undertake a review of\n            the project contents early in the project execution period\n            and an agonizing reappraisal of the project towards the end.\n            The lesson that the Bank can draw from the project\n            experience is that preconceived notions of agricultural\n            development strategies and priorities, particularly when it\n            involves the uneducated poor traditional rural sector,\n            should be very critically examined at the time of project\n            preparation. A project of this type can not be successful on\n            the basis of agronomic possibilities alone; complex\n            sociological and institutional issues also need to be\n            thought through Project mid-term reviews are desirable in\n            some cases. They can be beneficial only if an examination is\n            made of the project's fundamental shortcomings.\n            Adjustments in the targets and project costs can prove to be illusory."}, "docdt": "1991-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
