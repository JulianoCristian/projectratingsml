The project consists of the completion\n            of a new barrage, which would replace the old weir. The\n            barrage has four sections, totalling 3600 meters in length,\n            across the four branches of the river. It is divided into\n            175 bays, each equipped with a spillway gate, and will raise\n            the pond level to 13.64 meters. The project includes\n            preparatory studies for a second phase project, which would\n            concentrate on command area development, and technical\n            assistance to GOI for the preparation of command area\n            development projects in other States of India."}, "docdt": "1975-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
