          Maintenance Project will enhance road transportation\n            efficiency in Nicaragua, by improving infrastructure along\n            key international trunk road corridors, providing better\n            access to agricultural areas, and ensuring the\n            sustainability of road improvements. The components will: 1)\n            finance rehabilitation, and improvements of the Managua -\n            Izapa, and the Muhan - El Rama roads. Rehabilitation will be\n            within the existing right of way, and will encompass bus\n            pullover areas, and road shoulders to improve traffic\n            safety, in addition to pavement recycling techniques to\n            finalize road sections of the Managua-Izapa road, already\n            improved under a previous operation, as well as the Muhan-El\n            Rama road, including existing alignments, drainage, and road\n            signaling works; 2) stabilize rural secondary, and tertiary\n            roads, primarily within the region devastated by Hurricane\n            Mitch, under private contractors, who will restore roads to\n            gravel standards. Consulting services will assist the\n            Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) during\n            implementation; 3) finance routine, and periodic\n            maintenance, to implement spot maintenance, and major\n            maintenance works by contracts, to increase private\n            participation, including training, equipment, and technical\n            assistance (TA) for micro-enterprises; and, 4) help MTI\n            implement, and manage road sector development through TA,\n            training, and studies provision."}, "docdt": "2000-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
