    Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project for Nicaragua were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            importance of experience and lessons learned under previous\n            projects. International Development Association (IDA) and\n            government experience from previous operations in the sector\n            helped to enhance supervision effectiveness and ensured\n            leadership and involvement during project implementation.\n            Transport sector operations initiated by IDA had\n            continuously pursued the objectives of improving managerial\n            efficiency and reducing infrastructure bottlenecks in\n            Nicaragua. In this context, each project was supportive in\n            the introduction of innovative strategies such as road\n            stabilization programs, sustainable mechanisms for periodic\n            and routine maintenance, and expanding private sector\n            participation in the sector. Road Stabilization (Adoquine)\n            Program is highly appropriate for the rural poor. The Rural\n            Roads Stabilization Program (PEA) yielded several important\n            advantages in terms of social and economic outcomes. As a\n            cost-effective rehabilitation method, the use of adoquines\n            reduced maintenance costs and facilitated the participation\n            of small local businesses. It also uses local technology and\n            materials, supports bicycle traffic, and has a very low\n            environmental impact. The PEA has proved to be a very\n            effective instrument to generate productive short term\n            employment for skilled and unskilled workers from the\n            communities, through the mobilization of local resources\n            (material, labor, and technology), expansion of community\n            and local involvement in planning and decision making, and\n            the organization of communities in addressing local needs.\n            This type of program is very cost effective and can produce\n            positive social and economic impacts in the beneficiary zones."}, "docdt": "2007-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
