livestock, and forestry production; b)\n            validate technology using adaptive research in collaboration\n            with the extension service; c) transfer technologies to\n            producers via extension; d) improve the capacity of public\n            institutions to generate and extend new technologies by\n            strengthening their ability to identify problems, manage\n            scientific problems and use research results from external\n            sources; and e) establish improvement in funding for\n            agricultural research.  The project has three components.\n            The principal component is technology generation through\n            research.  Research areas include: crop improvement,\n            livestock management, forestry and natural resources.  The\n            second component is technology transfer through extension.\n            Activities include on-farm trials to validate promising\n            technologies, staff training, and soil conservation.  The\n            last component involves institutional development of the\n            National Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock\n            Research (INIFAP).  This component will improve the\n            institutional capacity of INIFAP, assist in mobilizing\n            resources via cost recovery, promote work on environmental\n            and sector productivity issues, and broaden the intellectual\n            base of agricultural research."}, "docdt": "1992-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
