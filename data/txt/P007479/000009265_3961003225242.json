The project comprises three main\n            components:  (1) secondary reform support which includes:\n            (a) the introduction of a common curriculum; (b) related\n            pre-service and in-service training; (c) textbooks; (d)\n            educational support materials; (e) physical infrastructure\n            for schools; and (f) studies and pilot programs for\n            secondary education.  (2) Evaluation and management\n            strengthening which includes:  (a) rationalizing the\n            examination system; (b) establishing a secondary reform\n            management team to ensure that the reform is adequately\n            supported; (c) conducting a public awareness campaign to\n            inform key stakeholders about the benefits of the reform;\n            (d) developing an evaluation system to monitor the impact of\n            the new curriculum; and (e) preparing the second five-year\n            phase of the reform.  (3) Social policy analysis which will\n            improve the capacity of the government to undertake\n            sophisticated social policy analysis and formulate more\n            effective and targeted social sector programs."}, "docdt": "1993-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
