     Re: Jamaica: Netherlands Grant related to Loan 3580-JM
                  (Reform of Secondary Education)
                  Amendment to the Netherlands Grant Agreement
Dear Sir:
     Please refer to the Netherlands Grant Agreement dated September
1, 1993 between Jamaica (the Recipient) and the International Bank
of Reconstruction and development (the Bank), acting as Administrator
of grant funds provided by the Minister for Development Cooperation,
for the above-mentioned Japanese Grant Agreement.
     In response to the request made by the Recipient, the Bank agrees
to amend the Netherlands Grant Agreement as follows:
Section 2.02 (b) is hereby amended to read as follows:
"The Recipient shall, for the purposes of Part C of the Project, open
and maintain in Dutch guilders a special deposit account in a
commercial bank in Jamaica, acceptable to the Administrator, on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Administrator, including protection
against set-off, seizure and attachments. Deposits into, and payments
out of the Dutch Special Account shall be made mutatis mutandis in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement,
provided, however, that the amount of the "Authorized Allocation"
referred to in paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement
shall be an amount equivalent to nine hundred thousand Dutch guilders
(DGL900,000) or such other amount as the Administrator may specify."
     In your capacity of duly authorized representative of the
Recipient, please indicate your agreement to the foregoing amendment
by signing and dating the duplicate original of this letter enclosed
herewith and returning the same to us.
     This amendment shall take effect as of the date of this letter
upon receipt by the Bank of the countersigned copy. The Bank will
acknowledge receipt and advise you of the effectiveness date of this
amendment.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
   AND DEVELOPMENT
