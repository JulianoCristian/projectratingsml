Regardless of success,\n            lessons convey the need for deepening the reform in such\n            areas as: greater emphasis on high standards for all\n            students, particularly those under-performing; greater\n            support to schools to address deficiencies; and, improvement\n            in the implementation process, with emphasis on performance\n            indicators, and greater accountability. Most importantly,\n            since the project was designed almost a decade ago, the\n            focus was to provide the necessary inputs, and strengthen\n            management capacity. However, this supply-driven model,\n            needs to be complemented by a demand-driven approach, in\n            order for the reform to take root at the school level.\n            Regarding the social policy analysis (SPA), lessons\n            stipulate that building analytic capacity is a slow, and\n            incremental process, which requires careful diagnosis, for\n            activities to reach the required cumulative effect. The\n            success of SPA lies in that it reached the broad network of\n            people involved in generating data, analyzing it, and\n            developing policy, and, because analysts had access to data\n            for training, and research purposes. However, with respect\n            to training indications suggest that demand is likely to be\n            high; that participants should be relatively homogeneous in\n            terms of mathematical background, computer literacy, and\n            access to computer facilities; and, that participants should\n            be encouraged to enroll program-wide, rather than individual\n            courses, to enhance curriculum skills."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
