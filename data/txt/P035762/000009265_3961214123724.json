Strengthening the financial sector will also\n            underpin the overall program of stabilization and structural\n            reforms and, in particular, the continued restructuring and\n            recovery in the enterprise sector.  Moreover, the project\n            will help meet external financing requirements and support\n            the budget. The FSAL aims to advance the structural reform\n            process by supporting critical reforms in the financial\n            sector, notably, the establishment of a conducive\n            environment for banking sector growth and the resolution of\n            problem loans and problem banks.  The loan will be disbursed\n            in two equal tranches, the first available on loan\n            effectiveness, and the second six months later, dependent on\n            satisfactory implementation of the reform program."}, "docdt": "1996-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
