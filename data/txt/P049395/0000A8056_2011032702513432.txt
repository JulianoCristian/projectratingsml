                         (ii) reduce environmental degradation, and improve the supply and efficient use of energy; (iii) reduce the barrier to the wide spread use of renewable energy
                         technologies; and (iv) provide technical support to the Borrower for the institutional and capacity building of key sector agencies, and for regulatory, fiscal and
                         institutional reforms in the mining sector to attract private investment

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Energy Access Project received an Additional Financing to rehabilitate the urban distribution network of its 8 major cities and Addis Ababa. With this additional financing about
                         19 grid substations will be upgraded and about 50 villages will be brought under grid network.

                         Rehabilitation and expansion of the Addis Ababa distribution system under the original project is moving smoothly. Underground construction and low voltage rehabilitation are almost
                         complete, The overhead medium voltage and pole transformers is expected to be complete by May 2011. However, the contractors for the Distribution Control Center have not yet
                         received access to site to start installation and EEPCO may not be able to complete this contract by the Credit closing date. EEPCO has been advised repeatedly to provide the
                         contractor with access to the site, but EEPCO management was unable to resolve pending issues related to handing over of the site to the contractors. Implementation of the rural
                         electrification component is almost finalized, with 62 out of the 65 towns electrified.

                         The Rural Electrification Fund is revising its Project Operational Manual to support the private sector to access this fund for their working capital requirements to import and distribute
                         moder lighting products approved by the Lighting Africa Program.
