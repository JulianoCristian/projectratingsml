follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, global environmental objective (GEO)\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, risk to GEO outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: multi-sector energy project without a\n            strong, cross-sector institutional focus can result in a\n            loss of commitment and underachievement of objectives.\n            Notwithstanding the need to address urgent issues in\n            multiple energy subsectors, if project scope and design are\n            not tailored to the institutional capacity of the\n            implementing agencies, there is a substantial risk of delays\n            and limited achievement of project objectives. The lack of\n            performance indicators for capacity building and the absence\n            of a clear linkage to planning for staff-development limit\n            the extent of impact assessment for training and technical\n            assistance programs. If the detailed design of a major\n            project is not completed prior to credit approval for an\n            investment operation, there is a high risk of delay and or\n            cancellation. The lack of a clear results chain in a\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) framework can lead to\n            major data gaps and missed opportunities for impact\n            evaluation. The lack of a system of standardized testing for\n            improved fuel wood stoves prevents a full assessment of the\n            program's impact on reducing emissions from the burning\n            of wood. The lack of detailed coordination of rehabilitation\n            work for urban power distribution systems with city planning\n            authorities and shortages of local construction materials\n            can be major obstacles to timely completion of the work."}, "docdt": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
