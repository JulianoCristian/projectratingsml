F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document) 1
The project's development objectives are to: (i) establish a sustainable program for
expanding the population's access to electricity and improving the quality and adequacy of
electricity supply, thus supporting broad-based economic development and helping to
alleviate poverty; (ii) reduce environmental degradation and improve energy end-use
efficiency; (iii) reduce the barriers to the wide spread adoption of renewable energy
technologies, in particular solar photovoltalic (PV) and micro-hydro power generation in
rural areas, thereby contributing to the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions via
displacement of kerosene and diesel that would otherwise be used for lighting and
electricity generation; and (iv) provide technical support for institutional and capacity
building of key sector agencies, including for regulatory, fiscal and institutional reforms in
the mining sector.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
None.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The proposed global environment objective is to initiate the process of eliminating the
barriers that impede the development of renewable energy, in particular solar photovoltaic

  The PDO as set out in the PAD is substantially consistent with that of the Financing Agreement (FA) with
the exception that the FA PDO is more concise, omitting the higher level objectives on broad based economic
development and poverty alleviation in (i) and the details related to (ii).
                                                   viii
(PV) systems, and develop micro hydro capacity. The global objective would contribute to
the reduction of GHG as some of the use of diesel for power generation would be displaced
by the renewable energy2.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
None.

  The Grant Agreement defined the PDO as follows: The objectives of the Project are to: (i) establish a
sustainable program for the expansion of access to electricity and for improvement of the quality and
adequacy of the electricity supply in the Recipient’s territory; (ii) reduce environmental degradation, and
improve the supply and efficient use of energy; (iii) reduce the barriers to the wide spread use of renewable
energy technologies; and (iv) provide technical support to the Recipient for the institutional and capacity
building of key energy sector agencies, and for regulatory, fiscal and institutional reforms in the mining
sector to attract private investment.

1.      Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1.    Context at Appraisal

1.      Economy/ Energy Sector Interface. The Energy Access Project (EAP), appraised
in 2002, was part of a multi-sector strategy to reduce poverty and improve environmental
quality in Ethiopia. EAP supported the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP)
of 2001. The I-PRSP called for expanded, improved infrastructure to support higher levels
of economic growth, in order to raise Ethiopia’s low level of per capita income (US$100).
The main source of energy for 90 percent of the population (67 million in 2002) was
biomass—wood and dried leaves from trees—for subsistence, mainly for cooking food.
Continued dependence on biomass without access to modern fuels was a barrier to the
transformation of large segments of Ethiopia’s population away from a life of subsistence.
An estimated 13 percent of the population had access to electricity but only 6 percent had
electricity connections, with connections in rural areas much lower, at 2 percent of the
population.

2.       The Power Subsector. EAP supported the strategy of the Government of Ethiopia
(GoE) to increase the electricity access of the population from 13 percent to 20 percent
between 2002 and 2012. To reduce imbalances between rural and urban areas, the rural
electrification strategy called for the development of an independent Rural Electrification
Board (REB) and the Rural Electrification Secretariat (RES) to identify viable projects. The
strategy also provided for the creation of the Rural Electrification Fund (REF) to assist in
the financing of capital expenditures by households and businesses for connection to the
national power grid or the development of off-grid electricity systems. In 2002, the national
power utility, EEPCo, had 600,000 customers, of which 85 percent were residential
consumers using mainly electricity for basic lighting. Electricity connections were highly
concentrated in Addis Ababa and the Central Region of Ethiopia, which accounted for
about 70 percent of total electricity sales. 3 Decentralization of electrification and greater
commercialization were key factors for improving operational performance of the utility,
the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo). 4

3.     The Biomass Subsector. The low level of electricity access was one side of
Ethiopia’s energy poverty; the other was diminishing biomass resources, the main sources
of energy. The demand for wood products was increasing at about the same rate as the
growth of population (three percent annually), outpacing annual forest yields. Only 10
percent of Ethiopia’s total land area of 1.1 million square kilometers (km2) was arable

3
  EEPCo’s total generating capacity was 473 MW and projected to rise to 981 MW by 2012. Electricity
losses were high- at 19.3 percent- and system outages were commonplace. Power demand was growing fast
but EEPCo’s tariffs were insufficient to generate the needed capital for investment. System load growth was
an estimated seven percent annually, based on an electricity tariff of US cents 5.6 per kWh, amounting to
only 62 percent of the long-run marginal cost of supply (LRMC).
4
  The decentralization of EEPCo’s operations to eight regional offices was in progress at the time of project
appraisal. A management information system (MIS), including an accounting module, was in the
implementation stage. The MIS, under implementation with support from the Nordic Development Fund
(NDF), was designed to support the operation of regional offices as separate profit/cost centers. EEPCo was
also planning to contract its management to an experienced utility for several years. With EEPCo and other
development partners focusing on these short-term measures, EAP was to finance a long-term power sector
strategy.

                                                     1
while Ethiopia’s forest cover was only about four percent of land area. Vanishing forest
resources were a major environmental threat to Ethiopia, a landlocked country, periodically
afflicted with water shortages, soil erosion, and the threat of desertification. Inadequate
supplies of fuelwood and inefficient use in cooking stoves, with high levels of smoke and
wood resource waste, were also adversely affecting the health and well-being of women,
who had the primary responsibility for gathering fuelwood and cooking.

4.      Key Issues and Strategic Choices. EAP sought to simultaneously address the
following issues, which had resulted in low energy access: inadequate investment in system
maintenance and expansion; a large, scattered, rural population for which grid-based access
was not an economically viable option; limited development of off-grid solutions for
electricity supply; human capacity constraints to implementing electrification programs,
and widespread use of biomass energy leading to deforestation and biomass deficits. The
key strategic choice in project design was to address energy poverty in the electricity and
biomass energy sectors simultaneously in single project. The Bank and the Borrower
recognized that biomass would remain important, as a cooking fuel, in the energy balance,
even with expanded access to electricity. Both grid-based and off-grid electricity
connections also supported the Global Environmental Objective (GEO) of reducing fossil
fuels for lighting, by replacing kerosene lamps with electricity for lighting.

5.      Rationale for Bank Involvement. EAP aimed at supporting higher-level objectives
for sustainable economic growth, better distribution of economic opportunity, and private
sector development associated with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 5 in place at the
time of project appraisal. By giving priority attention to rural energy development, EAP
supported greater regional balance in access to infrastructure for economic growth and
improved quality of life. The Project also supported private sector development, for solar
PV and mini-grid expansion. Finally, the Bank brought country and technical experience to
this operation through: (i) two previous energy projects in Ethiopia, and (ii) a Regional
Program in the Traditional Energy Sector (RPTES), assisting 15 African countries in
developing sustainable management practices for biomass fuels.

1.2.       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
           approved)

6.      The Project's Development Objectives (PDOs) were to: (i) establish a sustainable
program for expanding the population's access to electricity and improving the quality and
adequacy of electricity supply, thus supporting broad-based economic development and
helping to alleviate poverty; (ii) reduce environmental degradation and improve energy
end-use efficiency; (iii) reduce the barriers to the widespread adoption of renewable energy
technologies, in particular, solar photovoltaic (PV) and micro-hydro power generation in
rural areas, thereby contributing to the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions via
displacement of kerosene and diesel that would otherwise be used for lighting and
electricity generation; and (iv) provide technical support for institutional and capacity
building of key sector agencies, including for regulatory, fiscal and institutional reforms in
the mining sector.
7.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) listed key performance indicators for the

5
    The latest CAS, at the time of project appraisal, was dated September 9, 1997.

                                                        2
power and biomass sectors by project closing. The five key indicators in the power sector
were: (i) an additional 850,000 persons with direct access to electricity (plus an additional
250,000 persons with indirect access to electricity through the improved services of
electrified health and educational institutions); (ii) a significantly faster rate of small
business development in newly electrified areas than in similar locations not yet electrified;
(iii) a permanent regulatory and institutional structure for private-sector led rural
electrification; (iv) an adequate distribution network to meet requests from new customers
(backlog reduced by 75 percent); and (v) reduction of the incidence of low voltages and
voltage fluctuations beyond acceptable ranges. In the biomass sector, the three key
indicators were: (i) the production and distribution of 320,000 improved, injera-baking
stoves; (ii) an additional 302,000 hectares (ha.) of forests under participatory management;
and (iii) 384,000 ha. of new agroforestry schemes.

1.3.   Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
       approved)

8.     The Global Environment Objective (GEO) was to initiate the process of eliminating
the barriers that were impeding the development of renewable energy, in particular solar
photovoltaic (PV) systems and micro hydro capacity. The GEO was to contribute to the
reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) as some of the use of diesel for power generation
would be displaced by the renewable energy. The key indicators for the GEO were the
following: (i) solar PV systems installed in 320 institutions, heath centers and schools, (ii)
4,000 homes with solar PV systems and (iii) 5 mini-hydro schemes developed.

1.4.   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
       Indicators, and reasons/justification

9.     The PDO was not revised during project implementation.

1.5.   Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
       Indicators, and reasons/justification

10.    The GEO was not revised during project implementation.

1.6.   Main Beneficiaries

11.     The direct beneficiaries were people living in towns and villages gaining access to
their electricity in their homes and small businesses. The indirect beneficiaries were people
without direct household connections but served by health centers or schools improved by
electricity access.

1.7.   Original Components (as approved)

12.      Component 1: Institutional and Capacity Building. This component consisted of
preparation of the following outputs: (i) a long-term power sector strategy; (ii) an indicative
Rural Electrification Master Plan and specific studies to build a pipeline of rural
electrification projects for private-sector investment; (iii) an integrated, rural energy
strategy paper, covering both the biomass sector and modern forms of energy; (iv) capacity-

                                              3
building for private-sector enterprises interested in investing in small-scale renewable
energy resources; (v) capacity-building for the key energy sector agencies – EEPCo, the
Ethiopian Electricity Agency (EEA), the regulatory body, and the Rural Electrification
Secretariat (RES); and (vi) regulatory reforms for the mining sector.

13.     Component 2: Urban Distribution and Load Dispatch. This component included
the following subcomponents: (i) expansion and rehabilitation of the urban electricity
distribution system, covering the country’s four largest load centers: Addis Ababa, Bahir
Dar, Dire Dawa, and Nazareth; and (ii) establishment of a Load Dispatch Center (LDC),
which was to include a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.

14.     Component 3: Rural Electrification. This component consisted of technical and
financial support for: (i) grid-based rural electrification to be managed by EEPCo, and (ii)
private-sector development of isolated rural electricity systems, including the development
of local capability to formulate renewable energy strategies and plans.

15.     Component 4: Biomass Management. This component consisted of: (i) the
development of a national strategic plan and policy framework for the biomass energy
sector; (ii) the planning, establishment and monitoring of participatory sustainable natural
forest management systems covering 302,000 ha; (iii) the establishment of
farm/agroforestry schemes, covering 384,000 ha; and (iv) support for energy end-use
efficiency improvement in the household sector, through the promotion of 320,000 injera-
baking stoves in peri-urban and rural areas.

16.      Project Component 5: Environmental Mitigation. This component was to
finance the cost of implementing the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) prepared
under the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). It included the following
activities: (i) capacity-building for an environmental and social management unit to be
established by EEPCo; (ii) implementation of a compensation plan for crops lost during the
construction of power lines; and (iii) technical audits to ensure and support safe disposal of
old transformers containing polychlorinated biphenyls.

Project Costs and Financing

17.    The total cost of the Project, as designed at appraisal (Original Project) was
US$199.12 million equivalent. Table 1A shows the original allocation of Bank financing of
EAP, by component. The power sector components – improvements to the power system
and increased access to electricity-- accounted for 80 percent of the total. Improved
biomass management accounted for 14 percent and support for institutional development
and capacity building along with environmental mitigation, the remaining six percent. As
shown in Table 1B, Bank financing accounted for about 67 percent of the total with the
Borrower (Government of Ethiopia) financing 23 percent and other financiers, the
remaining 10 percent.

1.8.    Revised Components
18.      In 2010 an Additional Financing (AF) credit in the amount of $180 million was
approved and the Original Project restructured to drop the supply side activities of the
biomass component, scale up ongoing activities, and add new activities within existing
components. Over 75% of the Additional Financing was allocated to Component 2 to
finance increasing the capacity and reliability of urban networks by carrying out power
system rehabilitation within and beyond Addis Ababa. The government identified this as a
priority investment activity to achieve its goal of expanding electricity access. Although
more than half of the Original Project proceeds were allocated to this activity, it remained a
priority for scaling up under the AF credit, given the large, ongoing financing needs of this
investment activity. The rehabilitation work and upgrading under the Project were intended
to almost double the power distribution capacity in Addis Ababa and seven additional
cities. Table 2 summarizes the components of the restructured project.

                                  previously electrified villages; the installing of 1.1 million compact
                                  fluorescent lamps (CFLs) in the houses of new electricity consumers, and
                                  the installing energy-efficient lamps for the streetlights.

     (b) Off-Grid                  Financing of the drilling and testing of appraisal wells for geothermal
                                  development, in partnership with the Government of Japan.

1.9.     Other significant changes

19.      In 2006, the government established the Universal Electricity Access Program
(UEAP), as the framework under which EAP’s component for expanding grid based rural
electrification would be implemented. Due to delays in project implementation, two closing
date extension were approved in January 2007 and in June 2009. In 2010, an Additional
Financing and a restructuring were processed simultaneously with the effect of: eliminating
the supply side activities under the biomass management component; significantly scaling
up support for power system rehabilitation, increasing grid-based connections, supporting
geothermal development and improving energy efficiency; reallocating expenses in line
with activities under the restructured project and revising the performance indicators to be
consistent with changes made since the MTR in 2005.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

         a.       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     The Project’s design incorporated experience with other electrification 8 and
biomass development projects, 9 taking account of some lessons learned 10. The Project’s
rationale was sound in its tailoring of electrification access to location, allowing the private
sector to take the lead in providing electricity access to remote areas, and rehabilitating

6
  Bahir Dar, Mekele, Jima, Awassa, Dessie, Nazareth, and Dire Dawa.
7
  Shops, artisans, flour mills, etc.
8
  Eritrea, Ghana, India, Laos, Indonesia, Mozambique, Sri Lanka, Uganda, and Vietnam. Also, a feasibility
study found the rehabilitation and expansion of the urban distribution market in Addis Ababa to be the least-
cost means of reducing electricity losses as well as meeting un-served energy. Furthermore, prior to appraisal,
EEPCo funded a study tour of engineers and management staff to Ghana to learn about shield-wire
distribution technology, a low-cost power option proposed for use in the Project. Finally, the GoE revised the
EEPCo tariff to ETB 5/kWh (US$0.06/kWh equivalent) in 2006 as recommended by the cost-of-supply
study, an important step towards maintaining EEPCo’s financial viability.
9
   The Cooking Efficiency Improvement and New Fuels Marketing Project and the Commercialization of
Innovative Woodstoves Project. The design of the supply-side component in the biomass sector benefited
from the analysis of: (i) successful participatory forest schemes tested in Burkina, Ethiopia, Mali,
Mozambique and Senegal; and (ii) successful experience with farm/agroforestry schemes in Ethiopia,
Mozambique and Senegal.
10
   Lessons in these areas concerned the importance of involving the beneficiary communities in the design of
remote power systems and ensuring cost-recovery.

                                                      6
power distribution systems to support increased access. Also, the government showed a
strong commitment to the project’s objectives. 11 The Project preparation and design had a
number of shortcomings, which were to have an important impact on project outcomes:
First, despite the importance of the biomass sector in the energy balance, the strategic
choice of including the biomass sector with the power sector in a single project did not take
into account government ownership of the biomass program as a whole and its institutional
capacity in the coordination of activities to be implemented by different sub-sectors;
Second, the team failed to heed lessons from past projects on the importance of simplifying
the project design, while the scale of access expansion i.e. 120,000 new, rural customers,
was unrealistic; 12 Third, the design of the rehabilitation of the urban distribution system
and the completion of the institutional architecture were left to project implementation,
ultimately contributing to substantial implementation delays; and Fourth, the PAD rated the
overall project risk as moderate when it should have been rated substantial, given the
project’s complexity and existing institutional capacity constraints. 13

2.1.     Implementation
21.      Overview. EAP took about 10 years to complete from effectiveness in 2003 until
the closing date of June 30, 2013, more than double the original four years envisaged. The
main factors that caused the delay were the lack of readiness, at appraisal, of the design for
the rehabilitation of the urban power distribution systems and unforeseen changes in city
planning in Addis Ababa, which delayed the completion of physical works. The supply side
of biomass component was cancelled due to the lack of interest from the GoE. Throughout
project implementation, the Implementation Status Report (ISR) ratings ranged from
satisfactory to moderately satisfactory, with a moderately unsatisfactory rating at the end
due the lack of timely implementation of activities planned under the additional financing.
Finalizing the design of the rehabilitation of the power distribution systems and the weak
institutional capacity of EEPCo caused implementation delays. The end result was that by
the closing date of the project, minimal progress was made on the implementation of power
system rehabilitation financed by the AF, thus all of the AF proceeds allocated to that
component were cancelled. Annex 2B provides a detailed review of project
implementation. Of the total amount of US$340 million allocated to the Project from the
Original Credit in 2002 and AF Credit in 2010, the Bank disbursed only about US$160
million, or 47 percent. Table 3 shows the changes in project financing.


11
   The Government’s Letter of Development Policy supported the foundational elements for improvements to
the power system, expansion of electricity access, enhanced sustainability of biomass resources, and the
promotion of private-sector involvement in the energy sector. The Chairman of the Board of EEPCo and the
Minister of State for Infrastructure had taken a key interest in promoting electricity access.
12
   EAP covered the national power grid, off-grid systems, afforestation, improved cook stove production as
well as regulatory aspects of the mining sector.
13
   The analysis in the PAD considered four categories of risks as moderate: adoption of low-cost designs for
grid extension, the effectiveness of power sector strategies, failure to mainstream the components for biomass
management, and limited government capacity for project preparation and implementation. The adoption of
low-cost designs was to be mitigated by EEPCo’s strong interest in such designs during appraisal. For the
mainstreaming of biomass management, the PAD assumed that the success of the initial small program being
supported by the project would allow for mainstreaming in follow-up projects. However, this underestimated
the difficulties involved with actual adoption of the initial program. The PAD considered that the institutional
set up at the time of appraisal, strengthened by consultancy services, to be sufficient to mitigate the capacity
risks in implementing rural electrification investments.

22.     Mid-Term Review (MTR). The Project’s MTR, conducted in October 2005, found
implementation progress moderately satisfactory. Disbursements were extremely low at 5.4
percent of the Original Project amount (US$132.7 million equivalent). Nevertheless, the
MTR was optimistic that the pace of disbursement would pick up, noting a contract
recently awarded for grid-based electrification. The MTR also gave considerable attention
to financial and institutional factors constraining implementation of the off-grid component.
Finally, the MTR modified some of the project’s performance indicators. 14
23.      Establishment of the Universal Electricity Access Program (UEAP). During the
implementation of EAP, the Government established the UEAP as the overall framework
for extending the power grid to rural towns and villages, serving up to 20,000 people.
UEAP’s initial target was the electrification of about 50 percent of rural towns over five
years with the remaining rural towns electrified after 10 years. Most remote towns were to
be electrified through off-grid systems. From 2006, the UEAP coordinated all rural
electrification programs in Ethiopia. The beneficiaries include residential customers,
commercial/industrial customers, such as flourmills, irrigation centers, water pumping, and
telecommunications.
24.     Extensions of the Closing Date and Restructuring. The Bank extended the
closing date from June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2009, based on signs of progress in the
implementation of most components after a slow start and low disbursements. A second
extension took place from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2011, due to additional time required
to complete the Urban Power Distribution Component. The Additional Financing Credit
was also a restructuring operation that addressed a financing gap in the Original Project
urban network rehabilitation component, extended the project scope of rehabilitation work
to additional towns outside of Addis Ababa, and provided funding to assess the country’s
geothermal potential in support of a large scale renewable energy development. The GEF
grant supporting off-grid electrification with renewable energy closed on June 30, 2012,

14
  Following the MTR, the ISRs show the addition of a target of 17 percent for power system losses, from a
baseline of 20 percent, and a target operating margin of US cents 1.0 per kWh for EEPCo.

                                                   8
three years later than the original closing date of June 30, 2009. The final closing date for
the Project as a whole, including components funded by the AF, was June 30, 2013.

2.2.     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
25.     There were serious shortcomings and inconsistencies in the M&E framework of
EAP, which had to be sorted through during the ICR in order to have an M&E framework
that could be used for performance evaluation (Table 4). First, there was a disconnect
between the key indicators in the main text of the PAD and the annex with the design
summary15. Second, some key indicators in the PAD were not included in the
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs), i.e., faster business growth in electrified areas and
reduction in the backlog of requests for connections. Third, there was no methodology
given for comparing business growth in electrified and non-electrified areas, the key
indicator of the energy/economy interface. Fourth, the tracking of indicators in ISRs was
inconsistent. 16 Fifth, there was a lack of logical distinction between outputs and outcomes,
as discussed in paragraph 31. Sixth, there was no tracking of cumulative results in the ISRs
of the Project’s last three years. Annex 2A provides a detailed account of the changes in the
M&E framework during project implementation.

26.      Taking the above factors into account for the purpose of evaluating achievement of
the PDOs, the ICR used outcome indicators highlighted in the main text as well as the
institutional capacity indicator from the design summary of the original PAD,
supplemented by measurable indicators established during the MTR. The ICR has based
this selection on two factors. First, the EAP did not change objectives during the decade of
its implementation. Second, with the cancellation of most of the Additional Financing
credit, the new indicators selected and noted in the ISRs for the last three years of the
project became essentially invalid.

27.     Table 4 summarizes the performance indicators used for the ICR’s evaluation of
EAP’s performance. In cases where performance indicators were listed as both outcome
indicators and intermediate outcome indicators, the ICR evaluation has chosen the key
outcome indicators highlighted in the main text of the PAD. For example, the ICR has
classified the number of towns connected (and the related number of connections), along
with the number of solar PV and mini/micro hydro installations as intermediate-outcome
indicator but the number of people gaining access to electricity through these connections
as outcome/impact indicators.




15
   For example, in the main text of the PAD, reductions in voltage fluctuations and a decrease in the backlog
of connections were performance indicators of improved service quality. However, in the design summary,
the outcome indicators for improved service quality were significant reductions in unserved energy and
losses.
16
   For example, regarding network losses, sometimes ISRs tracked a percentage decline and other times a
specific loss target (i.e. 17 percent). The final loss target of 9 percent was unrealistic and the loss reduction
indicator was dropped altogether toward the end of the Project.

28.     As indicated above, the ISRs selectively monitored the key indicators in the PAD,
focusing on quantitative indicators and reporting on progress twice per year. However, the
Bank could have given more attention to the results chain, particularly the relationship
between intermediate and final outcome indicators. For example, in its list of key
indicators, the PAD provided an outcome/impact indicator for “faster rate of growth for
income-enhancing and economic diversification businesses in project areas.” This was the
only outcome indicator of the impact of electricity on the economy. Instead of setting up
an appropriate M&E framework for evaluating it, the ISRs dropped the indicator. Most of
the quantified ‘outcome’ indicators --such as the facilities constructed and the number of
persons with access to electricity--were really outputs, or intermediate outcomes in a
results chain that, with hindsight, should have focused more on the electricity/economy
interface.

2.3.     Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     Safeguards. EAP, as originally designed, triggered two safeguard policies:
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01); and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).
EEPCo developed and publicly disclosed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) in
accordance with World Bank requirements. The restructuring of the Project also triggered
the safeguards for International Waterways (OP/BP7.50). The possibility of financing
micro hydro power plants was envisaged under the original scope of the Project but
ultimately no such plants were financed. The AF for EAP also triggered Physical Cultural
Resources (OP/BP 4.11) because of the possibility of a cultural find during geothermal
exploration. Furthermore, the AF triggered OP/BP 4.01 because of possible contamination
from old transformers removed from the system during upgrade of the urban electricity
distribution network and substations. Finally, EAP and the AF triggered OP/B4.12, due to
the high volume of bird flocks in project areas. EEPCo developed and publicly disclosed an

                                                     10
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for screening of individual
projects as well as a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), in accordance with the World
Bank requirements. The Project supervision documents do not reflect problems with
safeguards compliance, other than some delays in compensation for persons affected by the
Project. There was also no need to monitor compliance with OP/BP7.50 and OP/BP 4.11
because both micro hydro schemes and drilling activities were not implemented during the
project period

30.     Procurement. Although EEPCo was a major procurement entity in Ethiopia, the
legal framework and institutional arrangements for procurement were problematic for the
company throughout project implementation. Specific problems encountered, included high
staff turnover and a highly centralized decision-making process, requiring EEPCo’s Board
to approve most procurement packages. This cumbersome process delayed the submission
of bid evaluation reports that required review by several tender committees. The resolution
of procurement complaints caused further delays. The EEPCo also expressed dissatisfaction
on occasion with the time required for clearances given by the Bank, as there were often
multiple iterations prior to issuing the “no objection”. As part of the overall portfolio
discussion, IDA and EEPCo agreed on the recruitment of an internationally experienced
Procurement Advisor under the second Electricity Access and Rural Expansion Project
(EAREP2). This Advisor has helped to provide on-the-job training to EEPCo project staff
and enhance the quality of procurement documents submitted to IDA.

31.     Financial Management. Overall, EAP complied with requirements for project
reporting and auditing. However, at the corporate level, there were delays in reporting and
audits were due to the introduction of a computerized accounting and billing system in
2006, which created interface issues with the accounting software The Bank expressed
concern about the lack of a data back-up mechanism and inefficient processes for manual
updating of customer billing records. The Bank also expressed concern about the lack of
internal financial controls in EREDPC, recommending improvements. EEPCo’s audit was
consistently submitted after the due date, with the same qualifications, year after year,
without rectification. The Bank suggested that EEPCo conduct a “Just-in-Time” assessment
to improve its business processes. In early 2012, the JIT assessment of EEPCo’s financial
management and governance procedures prompted a dialogue between the Bank’s task
team and EEPCo management, which led to an agreement on a time-bound action plan.
EEPCo has also agreed to install an enterprise resource package (ERP) that would integrate
data within EEPCo’s accounting, billing, procurement, human resources, stores
management, and operations management systems and facilitate better information flow,
oversight and management of its operations. The ERP package is currently at the
procurement stage, with financing provided under Electricity Network Reinforcement and
Expansion Project (ENREP).

2.4.   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

32.    Following the implementation of the EAP, the Bank adopted a programmatic
development approach to rural electrification and access expansion in Ethiopia. In 2006, the
Bank supported the first Electricity Access for Rural Expansion Project (P097172), which
closed on December 31, 2012. The second Electricity Access and Rural Expansion Project
(P101556) was approved in 2007 and will close on December 31, 2014. The most recent

                                            11
project to support access expansion in Ethiopia was the Electricity Network Reinforcement
and Expansion Project (P119893), approved in 2012. During the supervision of these
ongoing projects, the Bank’s project team is following up on household electricity
connections implemented by EEPCo, with goods procured under EAP’s additional
financing credit. These follow-on projects have been continuing the promotion of off-grid
electricity access expansion by the private sector and the strengthening of the power
distribution network in Addis Ababa and other towns, as well as assisting with geothermal
exploration. However, the future commitment of funds for investment in expanding energy
access will depend on: (i) measurable improvement in EEPCo’s institutional capacity,
especially outside of Addis Ababa, (ii) progress in attracting private capital, and (iii)
progress in improving the quality and reliability of electricity supply. 17

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.  Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

33.     The Project’s objectives for electricity expansion and strengthening continue to be
highly relevant to Ethiopia’s Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) and the Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Ethiopia. The per capita gross national income
(GNI) in Ethiopia is currently about US$391, substantially lower than the average of
US$1,176 for Sub-Saharan Africa. The GTP, which covers the period 2009/2010 to
2014/2015, is designed to help Ethiopia become a middle-income economy by 2020/2023.
A key element of the GTP is the provision of quality infrastructure. Pillar one of the Bank’s
CPS fosters competitiveness and employment, for which increased and improved delivery
of infrastructure are key elements. The GTP calls for expanded coverage of electricity
services from about 41 percent of Ethiopia’s towns and villages at present to 75 percent by
2015, doubling the number of customers to about four million by that time. 18 The rapid rise
in electricity demand has saturated the generation and transmission capacity of EEPCO’s
network, requiring continued upgrading and expansion to meet GTP objectives. 19 As
indicated in Section 2.5, IDA-funded projects are still contributing to addressing the
challenges of efficient system performance. Thus, the relevance of EAP’s objectives
remains high.




17
   Under EAREP II, 5 micro-hydro schemes are to be developed by private operators or cooperatives.
Besides funding improvements to the transmission network, ENREP will further strengthen the Addis Ababa
network as part of a package to improve the distribution networks of 8 towns. Regarding geothermal
development, ongoing drilling activities are using the equipment and consumables bought under the
Additional Financing Credit, with financing from the Government of Japan. These drilling activities have
paved the way for an IDA-financed Geothermal Development Project.
18
   The number of electricity consumers connected to the EEPCo system grew from 600,000 in 2002 when
EAP was appraised, to more than 2 million in 2011. With the increase in access in recent years, demand for
electricity has soared. Average annual growth in demand was above 15 percent during 2005-2010, jumped to
25 percent in FY2010, and 32 percent in FY2011.
19
   Numerous segments of the network are over 30-40 years old and many power lines are experiencing a 35
percent voltage drop in transmission. The transmission lines, distribution lines, and the sub-stations are in
urgent need of repair and expansion even to meet the current load.

   The indicator was based on broad based rehabilitation work in the distribution system planned in the
original Project for Addis Ababa and four other major towns. However, project funds could only support
rehabilitation work in Addis Ababa in the MV system. EEPCo has calculated the reduction in losses in the
Addis Ababa distribution system, due to the Project’s rehabilitation work, at 0.52 percent, significantly less
than 3%.

who obtained off-grid access to electricity as well as those who connected to the power
grid. 22. The Project expanded access in 67 towns instead of the planned 85 towns, or 79
percent of the target. In addition, EAP provided indirect access to an estimated 1,100,000
people, more than four times the target. 23 In sum, two indicators were partially achieved
and 1 exceeded its targets.

37.    EAP did not track reductions in the backlog of requests for electricity service or
voltage fluctuations. Power system losses declined from a baseline of 20 percent to around
17 percent briefly during the project but by the project closing they had returned to around
20 percent. As indicated earlier, the M&E framework of EAP did not have a system for
evaluating the extent of business diversification resulting from electrification.

Objective 2: Reduce environmental degradation and improve end use efficiency.

Farm/agro-forestry schemes established.                384,000 ha.

38.     EAP only partially achieved this objective, as Table 6 indicates. On the demand
side, the production and sale of 2.6 million stoves amounted to more than double the
revised target set during project implementation and eight times the target at project
appraisal. However, on the supply side, EAP did not achieve either of its targets. In 2006,
the Government informed the Bank that it had dropped the supply-side subcomponent.
However, the forestry-management subcomponent was not formally cancelled until the
Project’s restructuring in 2010. Given that both demand and supply-side measures were
necessary to meet the objective, the ICR considers this objective only 50 percent achieved.

39.    Objective 3 (GEO): Reduce the barriers to the widespread adoption of renewable
energy technologies, in particular solar photovoltaic (PV) and micro-hydro power
generation in rural areas, thereby contributing to the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions through the displacement of kerosene and diesel fuels that would otherwise be
used for lighting and electricity generation, respectively.

   The total is based on 120,000 connections, the intermediate outcome indicator, assuming five persons per
household, for a total of 600,000. In addition, 10,500 people gained access through diesel-powered mini-grids
and 5,040 persons through solar PV-based systems
23
   This estimate is based on the electrification of 200 health centers, each serving an estimated 5,000 people
and 100 schools, each serving an estimated 1,000 students.

No. of mini-hydro grids installed         5             0 installed but environmental and social impact
                                                        assessments (ESIAs) were prepared and designs were
                                                        completed.

40.     The GEO-financed components were considered pilot operations to test the market
and modalities for renewable energy promotion. As Table 7 indicates, the Project
substantially achieved the GEO physical indicator, reaching 94 percent of the target solar-
PV installations for health centers and schools. It is estimated that 160.7 tons of CO2 will be
avoided per year with the use of PV systems. None of the mini-hydro grids was installed.
However, the EAP did result in the completion of Environmental and Social Impact
Assessments (ESIAs) as well as design studies for the mini-hydro plants such that five
projects are now ready for implementation. Consequently, the ICR confirms that the EAP
met the GEO with moderate shortcomings and consequently the achievement of the GEO
outcomes should be rated moderately satisfactory.

41.     Objective 4: Provide technical support for institutional and capacity building of
key sector agencies, including regulatory, fiscal and institutional reforms in the mining
sector.

42.      Table 8 summarizes the targets and achievements in institutional development and
capacity building. By project closing, EAP had resulted in the establishment of the
institutional and financial architecture for rural electrification. The EREDPC has a mandate
to conduct studies on national energy resources, collect data, and promote renewable
energy in rural areas. The RES appraises rural projects and provides advisory services,
capacity building and training to Ethiopia’s regional energy bureaus and cooperatives. The
REF enables private and cooperative engagement in rural electrification activities through
loan-based finance and technical support. This fund subsidizes 85 percent of the cost of
rural electrification projects, with renewable energy sources entitled to a higher subsidy of
95 percent. Regarding sustainability, the Bank has concern that the absorption of EREDPC
within Ministry of Water and Energy (MoWE) -- as opposed to remaining an autonomous,
public sector institution--may limit the institution’s effectiveness in promoting renewable
energy in rural areas and in further expanding rural electricity access.

                                                       15
43.     During EAP’s implementation, EEPCo, the agency responsible for managing the
major project components, had an operating margin fluctuated during implementation
between US cents 0.4 per kWh and US cents 1.5 per kWh, with data on this margin
unavailable at project closing. Moreover, EEPCo’s current financial position is weak so its
ability to continue supporting rural electrification expansion is uncertain. Given these
considerations, and despite progress made in establishing an institutional framework for
expanding rural electricity access, the longer-term impact of this framework is not assured.
Thus, the ICR considers the institutional objective only partially achieved, with uncertainty
regarding sustainability.

Summary Achievement of Objectives

44.    Table 9 summarizes the achievements for all four objectives in the table below.
Overall, the ICR considers that EAP only partially achieved each of the four objectives,
three with significant shortcomings and one with moderate shortcomings, raising concern
about long-term sustainability. Taking into account the shortcomings and weighing the
importance of the objectives, the ICR finds, on balance, significant shortcomings in the
achievement of objectives.

Table 9: Summary Achievement of Targets for Project Objectives

3.3.     Efficiency

45.      The PAD prepared an economic cost-benefit analysis for three project components:
(i) urban distribution system rehabilitation and expansion, (ii) the construction of a load
dispatch center, and (iii) grid extension to towns and villages. The Economic Internal Rate
of Return (EIRR) at appraisal, for all three of these components combined was 18 percent.
The EIRRs by component were as follows: urban distribution system rehabilitation (13
percent), load dispatch center (20 percent), and grid-based rural electrification (14 percent).
All components had positive economic net present values (ENPVs). For the ICR,
information was available to re-estimate only the EIRR and ENPVs for the grid-based
electrification component. Based on the roughly the same period as the PAD, from project
start to 2037, the ICR has re-estimated the EIRR at 21 percent with an ENPV of US$67. 7
million at 10 percent and US$40.5 million at 12 percent, using relatively conservative
estimate of willingness to pay for electricity. 24 Annex 3 provides details of the analysis.
24
  The economic cost-benefit analysis in the PAD used the average tariff of US$0.06 per kWh in 2002 as a
proxy for WTP. The ICR has used US$0.17 per kWh for the base case WTP, a figure cited in recent Bank

                                                   16
The higher EIRR of 21 percent, calculated for the ICR, compared to the EIRR of 14 percent
in the PAD, results primarily from the valuation of the benefits at the WTP of US$17 per
kWh, whereas the PAD valued the benefits at the average tariff of US$06 per kWh, used as
a proxy for WTP.

3.4.    Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

46.      On the positive side, EAP: (i) increased rural electricity connections significantly;
(ii) established an institutional framework for continuing rural electrification in the future;
and (iii) made notable progress toward eliminating barriers to renewable energy
development (GEO). On the negative side, the Project : (i) had significant shortcomings in
achieving specific outcome indicators; (ii) did not generate the data to fully assess the
efficiency; (iii) failed to implement the entire supply side of the biomass component; and
(iv) cancelled most of the Additional Financing Credit due to low disbursements. The
distribution of improved fuelwood stoves was a considerable success with a large-scale
impact. However, as indicated earlier, this program represented only half of the biomass
management component, which, in its entirety, accounted for only about 14 percent of the
original project costs. Furthermore, despite the EAP’s long implementation period, there
was no upgrading of the M&E framework to evaluate the economic impact of
electrification on small business development, an indicator in the PAD, or the
environmental impact of improved stoves and the substitution of renewable energy for
diesel-based generation in off-grid electrification. Also, the ICR considers the risk to
development outcome substantial. Therefore despite the continued high relevance of
objectives, weighing both the positive and negative results and considering the limited
extent to which efficiency can be evaluated, the ICR has rated the overall outcome
moderately unsatisfactory.

3.5.    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

47.     Under EAP, the Bank managed Trust Funds (from the Government of Japan),
amounting to US$ 1.86 million for financial and social assistance to the Former Women
Fuel Wood Carriers Association (FWFCA), which consists of about 30,000 women who
earn a living collecting woody biomass and transporting it over long distances. The woody
biomass typically collected consists of branches, leaves, twigs, and barks weighing
approximately 35kg to 80kg that the women carry distances ranging from 10km to 30km.
They sell the woody biomass at city centers for Birr 15 to 25 (equivalent US$1 to US$1.5).
These earnings are not sufficient to support the families of these women, which have an
average of seven children each. A successful pilot project in Addis Ababa has helped the
women in the FWCA to improve their marketing systems, diversify their income, and
improve access to health and educational facilities. Subsequently the project was expanded
to cover women in the cities of Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar, Dessie, Mekelle, Awassa, Nazret,

reports, which is toward the low end of the range reported for African (US$0.15 to US$0.25 per kWh). In
recent years a much higher WTP estimate of US$0.30 per kWh has been reported by the Bank for Ethiopia.
However, given the weakness of the data available for the analysis, the ICR has opted for the more
conservative estimate. Using the lowest WTP, the EIRR at 17 percent is still higher than the appraisal
estimate (14 percent).

Harar, and Dire Dawa. This project closed in August 2011. No detailed evaluation of the
expanded project was available for the preparation of the ICR.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

48.      The Bank repeatedly has requested that EEPCo address its severe capacity
constraints, improve its database and strengthen network-planning capabilities. Deficiencies
in procurement performance, leading to project delays, were pervasive throughout project
implementation. The Bank and the Borrower have taken steps to expedite the procurement
processes, which have been improving. Also, the lack of coordination between grid and off-
grid electrification activities has proven a critical barrier to the implementation of off-grid
electrification because REES needs a response from EEPCo to implement approved mini-
hydro projects. The Bank has recommended that the Ministry of Energy take the lead in
improving coordination between EEPCo and REES. To enhance private-sector led rural
electrification, the Bank has recommended that REES and EEA explore a new business
model for rural electrification that allows private rural entities to purchase bulk power from
EEPCo and become de facto distribution companies. 25 EREDPC needed to strengthen its
organizational capacity, especially for procurement. 26 The Bank also has found that the
quality of the technical, environmental and social assessment needs significant
improvement.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development and Global Environmental Outcomes

Rating: Substantial

49.     The Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to achieving universal
access to electricity and the main institutions for expanding electricity access are in place.
However, there remain serious constraints, increasingly evident over the past decade,
regarding: (i) the limited institutional capacity in the energy sector; (ii) the financial
sustainability of EEPCo, which has a vital role in expanding grid connections; (iii) a
government strategy that is heavily dependent on state owned energy institutions with
limited involvement of private operators; (iv) the lack of agreement on a viable strategy for
sustainable expansion of access to electricity in rural areas; and (v) the lack of tangible
progress over the past decade in improving the quality of electricity supply. Considering
these constraints, the ICR has rated the risk to the main development outcome, i.e. to
establish a sustainable program for expanding electricity access, as substantial.

50.     There are no major issues related to the operation and maintenance of the solar PV

25
   This model would allow cooperatives, private operators or other organizations to purchase bulk power, at
wholesale prices, from EEPCo, at the nearest sub-station, and re-sell the power at the retail price in one or
more villages. The Bank has explained to counterparts in Ethiopia that this type of arrangement has operated
successfully in Bangladesh, Mali, Costa Rica and the United States.
26
   Project supervision noted the high turnover of key personnel under REF, which is staffed with independent
consultants and therefore constantly experiencing a “brain drain” problem. During project implementation,
the Bank noted that EREDPC was aware of this problem and was trying to staff the REF group with qualified
professionals. Furthermore, the Bank recommended that EREDPC review its business model for the
development of mini-hydro-plants to determine why it was not attracting a large number of bankable projects.
These issues had not been resolved by project closing in June 2013, when EREDPC became a Directorate
under the MoWE.

systems installed in the health posts and schools. A small budget for battery renewal will
need to be considered 5 years after installation. Given the modest cost involved it is not
anticipated as a burden for GOE in light of the fuel cost savings created by replacement of
diesel sources. Therefore, the risk to Global Environmental outcome is rated moderate.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.   Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

51.     The objectives of the Project were aligned with Ethiopia’s priorities for the
economy and the energy sector as well as with the Bank’s CAS. However, there were
significant shortcomings, at project entry, in design, institutional assessment, ownership of
the strategy to expand electricity access, and the risk assessment. The Project was too
ambitious, with: (i) multiple components and three implementing agencies; (ii) a wide
scope of activities, which included grid-based and off- grid connections, power system
rehabilitation, and biomass management; (ii) inadequate assessment of institutional
capacity; (iv) a serious lack of readiness for implementation, which inevitably led to delays;
and (v) an underestimation of the project risks. In addition, regarding monitoring and
evaluation as discussed in Section 2.8 and Annex 2, the results indicators in the PAD were
not consistent with the design summary in the PAD. More specifically, the Project’s design
left most of the preparation for the rehabilitation of the urban distribution system to project
implementation, a decision that resulted in major delays while the institutional constraints
and the delayed preparatory work were not adequately accounted for in the assessment of
risks. Considering the aforementioned shortcomings, the ICR has rated the Bank’s
performance in ensuring quality of entry moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

(including fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

52.     The Bank supervised EAP simultaneously with other projects focusing on issues
common to the entire energy portfolio. Task team leadership changed five times over the
10-year implementation period, causing some continuity problems. The strengths of
supervision were: (i) flexibility in working with the Borrower, reallocating project funds in
line with the Borrower’s requests, (ii) the posting of a senior energy specialist in Addis
Ababa to manage the Bank’s large energy portfolio in Ethiopia as of 2008, and (iii)
cancellation of large portion of the additional financing due to lack of activity, focusing on
the preparation of a new project. The main shortcomings were missed opportunities over a
10-year implementation period to: (i) simplify the project, taking into account the
capabilities of the implementing agencies; (ii) redesign the M&E framework for a clearer
results chain focusing on outcomes; and (iii) establish a stronger capability of the Borrower
for cross-sector monitoring and reporting. Actions in these areas could have greatly

                                                19
enhanced the project performance. Towards the last couple of years, there have been some
improvements in Bank management and supervision of the energy portfolio in Ethiopia but
it came too late to have a major impact on the overall EAP’s outcome. Considering the
aforementioned strengths and shortcomings, the ICR finds the Bank’s performance in
supervision moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

53.    Overall, the Bank’s performance had several identified weaknesses. At entry, there
were significant shortcomings in scope and design while during supervision there were
missed opportunities to take corrective action. Based on moderately unsatisfactory
performances in ensuring quality at entry and in supervision, the ICR rates overall Bank
performance as moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2.   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

54.      During project implementation, the Government, through the UEAP and the GTP,
further strengthened its commitment to expanding electricity access by targeting the
electrification of 75 percent of towns by 2015. However, there were also significant
shortcomings in the Government’s performance. During the power crisis in 2009/2010,
when shortages of hydropower resulted in the use of costly diesel-powered plants, the
Government did not allow EEPCo to pass these costs on to the consumer, resulting in a
sharp deterioration in the company’s financial performance. The government did not also
maintain an overall, cross-sector project coordinator, which was necessary, due to the
complexity of EAP, to ensure adequate monitoring of the project during implementation
and consolidation of the Government’s contribution to the ICR. Also, the government did
not take full ownership of the biomass component, dropping the supply-side activities.
Therefore, on balance, ICR has rated the Government’s overall performance moderately
unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

55.     The ICR has rated EEPCo’s performance as moderately unsatisfactory, primarily
due to management and operational deficiencies cited in supervision reports and major
delays in completing the design work. EREDPC successfully managed the component for
the distribution of improved wood-based cook stoves, far exceeding the target distribution.
However, because EREDPC had shortcomings in managing training and in financial
controls, the ICR has rated its performance as moderately satisfactory. The Ministry of
Agriculture was to manage the participatory forestry management and farm agro/forestry
programs. Due to the cancellation of these components, the ICR is unable to evaluate the

                                            20
Ministry’s performance. Given ratings of moderately unsatisfactory and moderately
satisfactory for the overall performance of EEPCo and EREDP, respectively, and the fact
that EEPCo was responsible for the largest project components, the ICR has rated overall
implementing agency performance as moderately unsatisfactory, consistent with Bank
guidelines for mixed ratings.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

56.     Given ratings of moderately unsatisfactory for both the Government and the
implementing agencies, the overall rating of overall Borrower performance is moderately
unsatisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned

57.     The following are the key lessons learned from the Project:

(i)     Project Scope and Ownership

58.     A multi-sector energy project without a strong, cross-sector institutional focus can
result in a loss of commitment and underachievement of objectives. EAP was committed to
simultaneously expand access to modern energy and increase the availability of biomass
energy, the main fuel source for 90 percent of the population. However, neither the Bank
nor the Borrower maintained this commitment throughout project implementation,
ultimately leading to the cancellation of EAP’s subcomponent for improved management of
biomass supply in addition to the use of more efficient fuelwood stoves. The Government
was supposed to implement the biomass activities on its own but the project files showed
no evidence that this took place, raising doubts as to the government’s ownership of this
component. 27 Had the EAP established an entity to monitor actions in both the power and
biomass sectors, there may have been more attention given to this component.

59.      Notwithstanding the need to address urgent issues in multiple energy subsectors, if
project scope and design are not tailored to the institutional capacity of the implementing
agencies, there is a substantial risk of delays and limited achievement of project objectives.
As noted earlier, EAP was extremely ambitious in design, scope, institutional framework,
objectives and time framework for project completion. There were three major investment
components, each implemented by a different ministry or implementing agency, as well as
an institutional and capacity building component. With hindsight, in a country with weak
institutional capacity, there probably should have been three separate projects –
rehabilitation of the distribution system, expansion of electricity access, and improved
biomass management, each of them with a reduced scope and commensurate
implementation capabilities at the time of appraisal.



27
  The Government informally abandoned the participatory forestry and the agroforestry subcomponents
without informing the Bank, sometime in 2006; however, the Bank did not formally cancel the component
until 2010.

                                                 21
(ii)    Assessment of Capacity-Building Impact

60.      The lack of performance indicators for capacity building and the absence of a clear
linkage to planning for staff-development limit the extent of impact assessment for training
and technical assistance programs. The Bank’s supervision reports constantly referred to
institutional deficiencies –most notably in procurement and financial management--high
staff turnover and the need for capacity building. However, there was no evidence of
linkage of numerous technical assistance and training activities provided by the project to
staff development planning in each of the implementing agencies or any substantive follow-
up on the impact of activities on institutional performance. Thus, the design of future
projects should ensure a shared understanding between the Bank and implementing
agencies on capacity needs and an agreed program on capacity building for which the
various energy agencies take full ownership.

(iii)   Project Readiness

61.     If the detailed design of a major project is not completed prior to Credit approval
for an investment operation, there is a high risk of delay and/or cancellation. EAP’s
preparation left the detailed design of critical rehabilitation work in the urban electricity
distribution system to project implementation. This was a major task, involving
considerable data collection and analysis. Before completing the design during project
implementation, there were substantial disagreements between EEPCo staff and the design
consultant as well as between the Bank and EEPCo on the design, which contributed to
implementation delays. Moreover, experience with the subsequent AF Credit revealed that,
even with a completed design at appraisal, problems may still arise due to the lack of
commitment to the design and unforeseen changes due to external factors that can delay the
completion of physical works.

(iv)    Importance of the M&E Framework

62.      The lack of a clear results chain in an M&E framework can lead to major data gaps
and missed opportunities for impact evaluation. EAP was originally designed when the
Bank was just beginning to give greater attention to performance monitoring, particularly
measurable indicators. However, the Bank had a long implementation period during which
it could have improved the M&E framework. In a project such as EAP, which makes a
case for funding due to its potential impact of electrification on the economy, the benefits
cannot be fully evaluated without an M&E framework designed to assess its impact on key
economic activities. The PAD referred to monitoring the development of businesses in
areas with and without access to electricity but there was no framework for such analysis at
project appraisal or during project implementation. Similarly, the Project was supposed to
reduce the adverse impact use on the environment through demand and supply management
in the biomass sector and the replacement of hydropower for diesel power in the
electrification of remote rural areas. However, the M&E framework did not provide any
targets or analytical constructs for measuring environmental impacts. The framework also
did not provide technical data needed for an ex-post economic and financial analysis of the
Project.



                                             22
63.     The lack of a system of standardized testing for improved fuelwood stoves prevents
a full assessment of the program’s impact on reducing emissions from the burning of wood.
The improved stoves sold under the Project claimed efficiency in the range of 47-63
percent. However, these estimates were arrived at by different organizations using various
testing protocols. In order to improve project quality and better assess environmental
impact, a modern laboratory for stove testing is necessary. This testing could have been
incorporated in EAP’s M&E framework for estimating the reduction resulting from the sale
of improved wood-fueled stoves under the Project.

(v)        Close Coordination with Local Planning Authorities and Flexibility in
           Materials Contracting

64.     The lack of detailed coordination of rehabilitation work for urban power
distribution systems with city planning authorities and shortages of local construction
materials can be major obstacles to timely completion of the work. Discussions with
EEPCo and reports on the delay of the rehabilitation work in the urban power distribution
system indicated that the lack of coordination with city planning was a major obstacle,
given considerable construction work in Addis Ababa during the Project’s implementation
period. The master plan for urban development in the city reportedly changed frequently
during project implementation, often without warning, causing delays in the rehabilitation
work. Therefore, the planning of rehabilitation work in the distribution system needed to be
continuously coordinated with city-planning authorities. There were also shortages of local
materials, such as cement and iron bars, during the project. In order to avoid delays due to
these shortages, construction contracts should include a clause requiring the import of
materials if they are not available locally.

7.         Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)        Borrower/implementing agencies

65.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED) did not have major
comments 28 on the ICR. The implementing agencies through UEAP shared the following
comments:

 (a) Additional Financing 049395 of the Grid based Rural electrification
UEAP claimed connection of 306 customers to the grid and requested the revision of the
financial and economic analysis section accordingly. The ICR took into account the fact
that all the distribution materials procured under the additional financing were shipped
from February 2013 (i.e. 4 months before closure) and not used for electrification during
the project implementation period. Therefore it is hard to consider customers connections
as part of the AF results. UEAP refers to the time required for IDA no objection and
recommend a further revision of the Country Office current threshold for the clearance to
be considered. It should be noted that the Procurement Hub Coordinator based in Addis has
been given more responsibility the last years, however large complex contracts require
corporate oversight. Revisions requested on some sections of the Annex 7 were taken into
account.

28
     MOFED’s comment on the datasheet was taken into account

                                                   23
(b)    Urban Distribution Rehabilitation Project

EEP highlighted the fact that Energy Access Project comprises several components of
specific projects, whereas the Rating summary tabulated in ICR seems in a combine project
portfolio basis and it is difficult to see the detail rating approach for each component.
Therefore, it is hard for them to share some of the rating results with regard to Urban
Rehabilitation Component. The ICR is based on an overall assessment of the implementing
agency which is a mix of the performance under the different components.

Annex 2: Outputs by Component

Planned Output               Actual Output
Component 1: Institutional Development and Capacity Building
Long-term power sector A rural electrification strategy was prepared prior to the Project appraisal. Its
and rural electrification objective was to enable increase in the population’s access to electricity from
strategies prepared          an estimated 13 percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2012. According to World
                             Bank development indicators, the latest figure on access to electricity in
                             Ethiopia is 23 percent (2010 data). During the implementation of EAP, the
                             Government increased its commitment to extending electricity by
                             establishing the Universal Electricity Access Program (UEAP). This would
                             help in the realization of 100 percent access to electricity by 2015. EEPCo
                             did not prepare a power system master plan as part of the project as
                             originally envisaged; it informed the Bank of an existing plan and thus
                             declined the Bank’s assistance in this regard.
Component 2: Urban Distribution and Load Dispatch
Distribution            grid The project extended and strengthened the distribution system, with the
strengthened and extended    focus on Addis Ababa, which accounts currently for 60% of electricity
                             demand in EEPCo’s system. Initially four other towns were to be included in
                             the Project’s network rehabilitation work but due to an increase in the cost of
                             materials as at the time the detailed design work was completed, there was
                             not enough funding to cover the additional networks. The additional
                             financing for the project was supposed to rehabilitate networks of additional
                             towns in extreme disrepair but was cancelled due to insufficient time left to
                             complete the works, given the long delay in the design work and cancellation
                             of most of the proceeds. However, the follow-on Electricity Network
                             Rehabilitation and Expansion Project (ENREP) will rehabilitate the networks
                             of eight (8) towns. The Project made a great stride in modernizing Ethiopia’s
                             management of the distribution system through the installation of an
                             automated Load Dispatch Center (LDC). The LDC will enable reduction in
                             outage duration and unserved energy. The Project also extended the system
                             grid to 67 towns as described below.
Component 3: Rural Electrification
About 100 villages, towns The Project helped provide 67 towns with access to electricity from the
or     rural    communities EEPCo grid, compared to an estimated 85 towns at appraisal. EAP
electrified in a financially electrified 21 remote villages from the grid with diesel generators and vastly
and          environmentally extended access to electricity generated by renewable energy through
sustainable manner           providing about 1,000 households, 200 health centers, and 100 schools with
                             electricity generated by solar-PV systems
Component 4: Biomass
Management of biomass The Project objective was to improve biomass management from the demand
resources improved and side and the supply side simultaneously through the distribution of a target
demand for improved, number of improved, wood-fueled, cooking stoves and the establishment of
wood-fueled         cooking participatory management of forests and agroforestry developments. The
stoves                       project helped create the demand for improved, wood-fueled cooking stoves
                             as planned, evidenced by the production, sale and distribution of 2.5 million
                             cooking stoves by the private sector, far exceeding the target distribution of
                             320,000 cooking stoves set at appraisal. However, improvements on the
                             supply side cannot be ascertained based on available project data. The
                             Government cancelled the supply-side component during project
                             implementation and did not produce the completion report requested by the
                             Bank. As a result of this, at project closing, it was unclear to what extent the
                             participatory management of 384,000 hectares of participatory forestry and
                             302,000 hectares of agroforestry took place with funding outside the Project.

Annex 2A: Review of the Project’s Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework

1.       Given the age of the project, the results framework used the log frame approach
with sector and project related objectives and a large number of indicators at the level of
the PDOs, intermediate outcomes and outputs. The project’s M&E framework had both
qualitative and quantitative outcome indicators but the indicators in the main text and the
design summary were not always consistent (Annex 1).The main text of the PAD listed key
indicators in three categories, corresponding to the first three objectives: expanded
electrification, improved quality of electricity service, and improved biomass management.
However, for the Institutional and Capacity Building component, there was no
corresponding indicator. The design summary had multiple indicators for each component
but it would have been difficult to track all of them.

2.      The main text shows eight key indicators compared to seven in the design
summary, with only two outcome indicators in common: the end-of-project target for
hectares of forests under participatory management and the number of hectares under agro
forestry schemes. Of the design summary’s seven outcome indicators, only these two are
quantified. The indicator for a post-project institutional structure required the establishment
of institutions responsible for sustaining the energy access program. The other four
indicators cannot be measured without baselines targets and a specified methodology. In
contrast, the main text shows eight indicators, of which six have measurable targets.

3.      During project implementation between 2005 and 2010. The outcome indicators
in the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) were not consistent with either the main text
or the design summary of the PAD. The ISRs from project effectiveness through 2004
show no M&E framework due to the slow start of EAP. However, in 2005, the ISRs list
five outcome indicators. Unlike in the main text of the PAD, there are no outcome
indicators for a target number of persons with access to electricity. Instead, there is a target
of 850,000 cited as an output/intermediate indicator. For improved quality of service, the
ISRs initially cite a three percent decrease in losses but beginning in 2009, the target is
changed to an actual percentage target for system losses (17 percent). Also, unlike the
PAD, the ISRs give a quantitative indicator for the institutional performance of EEPCo: an
operating margin of greater than US$0.01 per kWh.

Table 2.2: Key Performance Indicators in the ISRs during the period 2005-2009
Expanded electricity access: No outcome indicator
Improved quality of service: a three percent or reduction in losses, or a 17 percent loss, from a baseline of
20 percent, target by the end of the project.

Improved biomass management: (i) target distribution of 320,000 stoves, increased to 1 million stoves
beginning with the ISR in 2010, on the demand side; and (ii) 384,000 hectares of forests under participatory
management and 302,000 hectares of agroforestry, on the supply side.
Capacity building and institutional development: operating margin of EEPCo at least US cents 1.0 per
kWh.

4.      M&E changes following restructuring in 2010 and 2013. From June 2010 until
project closing on June 30, 3013, the outcome indicators changed two more times due to
the Additional Financing Credit, and a final restructuring that result in the cancellation of
83 percent of the additional funds.

5.      The restructuring of 2010 had four outcome indicators. It restored, as an outcome
indicator, a target total number of people gaining access to electricity through household
connections in urban and rural areas, and dropped the afforestation targets due to formal
deletion of the related subcomponent of the biomass management component. It also
revised the target for end-of-project losses in the power system from 17 percent to 9.6
percent. The M&E framework kept the targets for EEPCo’s operating margin and for the
dissemination of improved cookstoves using fuelwood, but increased the target number of
stove distribution from 1.0 million to 1.2 million.

6.      The Bank dropped the ambitious target for power system loss reduction, which was
clearly unrealistic, and the planned operating margin for EEPCo. The two outcome
indicators retained after the restructuring were the number of people gaining access to
electricity, with a decreased target, from 700,000 down to 100,000 30.




30
     These targets covered the connection program supported by the Additional Financing Credit only.

7.       Monitoring of the GEO objective. The M& E framework tracked the indicator for
the GEO objective separately from the indicators for the overall PDOs. The GEO objective
was a subset of the PDO objective to expand electricity access. It focused on removing
institutional and technical barriers to increasing access with renewable energy technology.
The Project’s ISRs incorporated two targets from the GEO Trust Fund (TF) Agreement: the
number of mini/micro hydro plants installed (5) and the number of solar home systems but
with a lower target, 4,000 instead of 8,000.

8.      The ISRs mention emissions avoided by replacing diesel-based mini-grids with
hydropower. However, this indicator was not tracked through to Project closing and no
target value was established. Also, the ISRs did not incorporate other indicators contained
in the TF Agreement: number of persons trained; the improved quality of health centers
and schools; and the total capacity of renewable energy systems. Instead, they included an
indicator for the number of PV systems in health centers and schools (320).

9.       Results indicators for the ICR. For the purpose of evaluating achievement of the
PDOs, the ICR used outcome indicators highlighted in the main text, as well as the
institutional capacity indicator from the design summary of the original PAD,
supplemented by measurable indicators established during the MTR and prior to
restructuring in 2010. The justification for this choice of indicators is based on:

    •    Maintenance of the same PDOs throughout a decade of implementation;
    •    Key measurable indicators appearing in the main text of the PAD with the
         exception of an indicator measuring capacity building for institutional
         development, despite some inconsistencies between the main text and Annex 1 of
         the PAD; and
    •    Very low level of disbursements under the Additional Financing Credit together
         with restructuring in 2010 when most proceeds were cancelled.

10.     In cases where performance indicators were listed as both outcome indicators and
intermediate outcome indicators, the ICR evaluation has chosen the designation in the main
text of the PAD. The ICR has classified the number of towns connected (and the related
number of connections), along with the number of solar PV and mini/micro hydro
installations as intermediate-outcome indicators. However, the number of people gaining
access to electricity through these connections is classified as outcome/impact indicators.

     Table 2.5: Key Indicators used for the ICR Evaluation Outcome Indicators

access:                      250,000 people with indirect electricity access served by electrified health

Improved quality of       Power system losses at 17 percent at the end of the Project, from a baseline
electricity service       of 20 percent, a decline of 3 percent during the Project’s implementation
                          period.

                          million after restructuring in 2010)
                          Supply side: 384,000 hectares of forests under participatory management and
                          302,000 hectares of agroforestry, on the supply side.

                          electrification.
Intermediate Outcome Indicators
Health clinics and schools electrified with solar PV systems: 320
Mini/micro-hydro installations established: 5
Number of towns electrified: 85
Number of additional grid connections due to the Project: 150,000


11.     As indicated above, the ISRs selectively monitored the key indicators in the PAD,
focusing on quantitative indicators and reporting on progress twice per year. However, the
Bank could have given more attention to the results chain, particularly the relationship
between intermediate and final outcome indicators. For example, in its list of key
indicators, the PAD provided an outcome/impact indicator for “faster rate of growth for
income-enhancing and economic diversification businesses in project areas.” This was the
                                            30
only outcome indicator of the impact of electricity on the economy. Instead of setting up
an appropriate M&E framework for evaluating it, the ISRs dropped the indicator. Most of
the quantified ‘outcome’ indicators, such as the facilities constructed, the number of
persons with access to electricity were really outputs, or intermediate outcomes in a results
chain that, with hindsight, should have focused more on the electricity/economy interface.

Annex 2B: Detailed Review of Project Implementation

1.     Key Factors Affecting Project Implementation

1.1.    Factors within control of the Bank. The project period was 10 years. The Bank
had control over monitoring the Project’s performance, disbursing funds, and reallocating
funds among the Project’s components. During project implementation, the Bank was
heavily engaged in supporting the development of Ethiopia’s energy sector. The Bank was
responsive to government’s requests and adapted to changing circumstances, which I
reflected in the extending the project’s closing date three times and further restructuring the
project twice. While the task team leadership changed five times over the 10 year
implementation period, having a consultant engineer working in Addis from the beginning
of the Project through completion helped maintain the Project’s institutional memory.
Bank management made an effort improve the overall performance of the Bank’s energy
portfolio in Ethiopia by stationing a Senior Energy Specialist in the Bank’s Addis Ababa
office from 2008 and also tried to expedite the procurement process by increasing the sign-
off threshold of the Procurement Coordinator based in Addis Ababa.

1.2.    Factors within Control of the Government. These factors were: adherence to
agreed sector policy, provision of its planned share of the financing, and establishment of
and provision of funding for, key institutions involved in rural electrification. For the most
part, the GoE adhered to sector policy; however, it did not show full commitment to
allowing EEPCo to recover its costs and several times during project implementation,
financial performance was rated unsatisfactory. In particular, the Government did not allow
EEPCo to pass on to the consumer, the higher costs of generation that resulted from
reliance on expensive, emergency, diesel-based power during the power crisis. As a result,
EEPCo’s operating margin declined below target levels and even turned negative.
Regarding local government, frequent changes in city planning, substantially delayed
rehabilitation of Addis Ababa’s power distribution system. Furthermore, the Government’s
policy decision, during project implementation, not to provide initial subsidies to promote
private-sector development in the solar PV market, resulted in the re-design of the solar PV
component, delaying implementation of rural electrification activities.

1.3.    Factors within control of the implementing agencies. The Project’s implementing
agencies were responsible for keeping implementation on schedule and attaining the targets
for the performance indicators. The Project had three implementing agencies: EEPCo,
EREDPC and the Ministry of Agriculture. EEPCo’s disagreement with the design of the
urban rehabilitation work financed under the Original Project and the consequent change in
the scope of work of the design consultant for the urban rehabilitation work resulted in
substantial delays and ultimately cancellation of a large amount of funds dedicated to
rehabilitation. Both positive and negative factors affected the implementation of the
biomass component. A key factor in the success of the improved cookstove program
financed by the Project was that the program benefitted from an “institutional champion”,
EREDPC that was committed to the expanded dissemination of improved fuelwood-based
cooking stoves. In contrast, on the supply side, the lack of ownership, on the part of the
Ministry of Agriculture, for planned afforestation programs, delayed progress and
ultimately resulted in cancellation of the supply side subcomponent. The lack of expertise
in procurement for the Project, due in part to high staff turnover, was a key factor in project

                                              32
delays, affecting not only components in EAP but other projects in the Bank’s energy
portfolio as well. Finally, the lack of an overall project coordinator for the Borrower across
the various subsectors that EAP supported -- electricity, biomass, solar PVs, mining and
geothermal energy—resulted in some loss of sector integration. The evidence of that was
that it was not possible to receive from the government an integrated completion report
covering the Project as a whole. The project files also reflect inadequate coordination
between EEPCo and EREDPC/RES on rural electrification in terms of assignment of
responsibilities for specific rural areas.

1.4.   Factors outside control of the Bank, the Government, and the implementing
agencies. Bank funds for the Project increased due to favorable exchange rate between the
US dollar and the SDR. However, by the time the design for rehabilitation of the urban
power distribution network was completed, the cost of materials on the international market
had increased, increasing the cost of the planned rehabilitation of urban power distribution
systems. Also, deficits in power capacity in 2009, due to low hydropower availability,
caused a moratorium on new connections over the period 2009/2010.

2.     Implementation Experience with Specific Components

2.1.    The physical activities financed by the Original project were mostly implemented,
except the supply-side activities of the biomass component due to the GoE’s decision to
cancel the sub component. Most of the activities to be financed by the Additional Financing
faced major challenges in financial management and procurement and were not
implemented. Despite the GoE’s request to extend EAP’s closing date after June 30, 2013
and reasonable progress in the dialogue on those issues, the Bank and Borrower agreed to
close the project ultimately, cancel resources which had not been used and recommit those
resources to the geothermal project that was under preparation at that time. A review of the
progress of implementation of each component follows:

2.2.   Rehabilitation of the urban distribution network. Originally, the Project was
intended to rehabilitate and strengthen the power distribution systems of four major cities,
the capital Addis Ababa and three others—Bahir Dar, Dire Dawa, and Nazareth. However,
the funds allocated from the Original Project were sufficient to support only the renovation
of the Addis Ababa due to changes in design and increases in the international prices of
materials. The total amount disbursed under this component was US$ 81.2 million.

2.3.   Table 1 compares the physical works planned at appraisal with the actual works
completed at project closing. The actual rehabilitation work called for more medium-
voltage (MV) cables, an increased number of underground cables to align power system
development with urban planning. The length of low-voltage (LV) envisaged at 1,640 km
was planned for the renovation of seven cities. However, due to these design changes and
limited funding, the Original Project could construct 130 km of LV lines, in the Addis
Ababa area only. As a result the number of 15 kV/0.4 kV distribution transformers required
was also considerably lower, 110, compared to 429 envisaged.

2.4.     Grid-based electrification. Under EAP as originally designed, the grid-based rural
electrification component connected 120,000 households in 67 villages, about 79 percent of
the planned number of villages to be electrified. Based on an average of five persons per
household, the Original Project provided electricity access to about 600,000 people through
grid connections. With the Additional Financing, the Project was to electrify 50 towns
connecting an additional 70,000 customers. The Project procured the equipment needed for
construction works and the connection of consumers. However, most of the connections
could not take place before the project’s closing date. Table 2 shows planned and actual
number of towns electrified by region.

2.5.    Off-grid electrification. EAP electrified 21 villages with diesel generators. Each
village had an average of 500 households, resulting in the provision of 10,500 persons with
access to electricity. The Project prepared five mini-hydro projects but these projects were
not completed prior to the project’s closing date and are currently being developed. Also
EAP electrified 1,108 households with solar PV system, through cooperatives, providing an
estimated 5,040 persons with access to electricity. Furthermore, EAP electrified 200 rural
health posts and 100 elementary schools with solar PV systems. Based on an average of
5,000 people served by the health posts and 1,000 students per elementary school, the
                                              34
project gave 1,100,000 persons in rural areas indirect access to electricity, though improved
quality of services.

2.6.     Biomass management. On the demand side, the Project’s financing and
institutional support led to the production and sale of 2.6 million improved cooking stoves
using fuelwood, by the closing date. In 2006, the Government informed the Bank that it
had dropped the supply-side subcomponent. However, the forestry-management
subcomponent was not formally cancelled until the Project’s restructuring in 2010.

Capacity building and institutional development. Due to the Government’s or
implementing agencies’ decisions to drop certain studies and capacity building activities
originally agreed as part of the Project, this component was only partially completed.
Progress on the implementation of this component was noted sporadically in the Bank’s
Aide memoires and ISRs and thus there is no comprehensive record of the status of
completion of various training and studies. In sum, capacity building and institutional
development was not a priority for the government or the implementing agencies during the
implementation of the EAP. At project appraisal, US$10.8 million were allocated for this
component. In the 2010 restructuring, the amount allocated to this component was reduced
to US$4.0 million equivalent and US$3.0 million equivalent was added from the AF to
increase assistance to the mining sector. The status of technical assistance and studies, by
implementing agency, at the close of EAP follow:

   •   EEA. The Government decided against the preparation of a long-term power
       development strategy, originally planned for EEA under EAP, determining that the
       strategy in place was adequate. The US$500,000 originally allocated for the power
       system strategy study was to be reallocated to other components.

   •   Mining Department. To assist the development of the mining sector, EAP funded
       a study prepared by the consulting firm, Sofreco, on mineral policy and regulations,
       at a cost of US$224,618.

   •   EEPCo. The Bank, in its project-supervision reports, repeatedly highlighted the
       company’s need for capacity building activities to address a severe capacity deficit.
       In particular, the Bank emphasized the need for improved network planning,
       requiring a better database and technical studies to help optimize investments. A
       major achievement in capacity building was the establishment of the Environmental
       Management Unit (EMU), which is now a permanent part of EEPCo’s Corporate
       Planning Office and, headed by an environmental specialist.

   •   EREDPC. While staff of this agency benefitted from training, the proposals
       appeared to be developed ad hoc, which meant that there was still a need for
       technical training directly linked to mini-hydro and solar PV development as well
       as productive uses of electricity.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Background

1.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the Energy Access Project (EAP)
included an economic cost/benefit analysis of investments to improve and expand EEPCo’s
infrastructure for increasing the access of Ethiopia’s population to electricity. These
investments accounted for about two thirds of total project costs. They consisted of: (i)
extension of the power grid to rural areas; (ii) rehabilitation and expansion of the urban
distribution system; and (iii) the establishment of the Load Dispatch Center (LDC). The
PAD estimated economic internal rate-of-returns (EIRRs) and Economic Net Present
Values (ENPVs) for each of the EEPCo-managed components. The PAD did not provide a
detailed economic analysis for home-based, solar PV systems for independent grids
planned under the Project. These components were considered pilot operations and were
funded by GEF. The PAD also provided no economic analysis for the biomass components
or an impact analysis of the capacity-building/technical assistance components. Also, the
PAD provided no financial analysis of the investments.

2.      Around the time of EAP’s closing in 2013, the Bank prepared an economic analysis
of the grid-based rural electrification component. This analysis was to be an input to the
efficiency analysis for the Project’s ICR. However, the ICR team has re-estimated the
EIRR and related ENPVs (Clarify?). The ICR has not re-estimated EIRRs and ENPVs for
investments in the rehabilitation of the urban distribution network or the establishment of
the Load Dispatch Center (LDC). The analysis at appraisal and the information contained
in EAP’s ISRs did not provide sufficient detail for a re-estimation to be made.

Re-Estimation of the EIRR and ENPVs for the Grid-Based, Rural Electrification
Component

A.      Key Assumptions

3.      Actual and projected connections. The ICR used the total grid-based actual rural
connections associated with the Project, as reported in the ISRs, estimated at 120,000
before the closing of the original credit for the Project in 2011. 31 The PAD and the ISRs for
EAP did not disaggregate planned connections by sectors. Given that a little more than 90
percent of connections in Ethiopian rural electrification projects have generally been for
households, and lacking a detailed sector breakdown for the 120,000 connections, the ICR,
for simplicity in the analysis, has assumed all connections to be residential. The ICR has
allocated the connections, by year, based on the percent share of annual capital
expenditures assumed during the period 2005 to 2011 (Table 1), given the lack of data on
annual connections associated with the Project. The connections linked to the allocation of
capital expenditures for 2005 have been added to the connections for 2006, assuming a
year’s lag between initial expenditures and the first set of completed connections. The
assumed connections linked to capital-cost assumptions for 2008 and 2009 amount to
18,000. However, due to the moratorium on connections during these years, given severe
power supply constraints, the ICR has added these connections to assumed connections for

31
  The Additional Financing was to bring about 70,000 connections; however, by the project closing, only a
negligible number of connections had taken place. Therefore, the ICR has not included them in the analysis.
                                                    36
2010 and 2011, divided evenly between these years.

4.      The AF was to finance infrastructure for about 70,000 connections additional to
those financed by the original credit. However, by the Credit’s closing, only a negligible
number of connections had taken place. Therefore, the ICR has not included them in the
estimated actual connections associated with the Project at closing, assuming that they will
be covered by the projections for future growth in connections (See para. 6).

Total               100            120,000         120,000

5.     To the base of 120,000 connections assumed in place by project closing in 2013, the
ICR has applied EEPCo’s projected growth rate of connections, 15 percent a year, to the
period 2011 through 2017, arriving at 277,567 connections by 2017. The ICR analysis has
maintained this level of connections constant for the economic analysis through 2037.

6.      Electricity consumption. The ICR has assumed residential consumption of 65
kWh per month, amounting to 780 kWh per year, per connection, from 2006 to 2013. For
the period 2014 through 2023, the ICR has assumed an average annual growth rate of
2.49 32 percent for residential energy consumption, reaching an annual consumption per
connection of 971.5 kWh by the end of this period. The analysis has held this consumption
level constant through 2037.

7.     Costs. On the cost side of the analysis, the ICR has assumed capital costs, operation
and maintenance (O&M) costs, the cost of electricity supply, and the cost of residential
connections. The estimated actual total capital costs are US$ 82.3 million. The ICR has
used the annual percentage disbursement rate of the original Credit for the EAP as a whole,
applied to the estimated actual capital costs of the grid-based rural electrification
component between 2005 and 2011. These costs include the amount allocated to the
component in the original Credit and reallocated funds from other components, amounting

32
  An economic analysis prepared by the Bank toward the end of EAP reported consumption of 65.5 kWh per month in
2002 and a growth rate of 2.47 percent annually during 2007-2013, citing EEPCo as the source.
                                                       37
to US$ 66 million (See percentage shares in Table 1). Also the ICR analysis has assumed:
(i) US$ 16.3 million from the AF, approved in 2010, expensed in 2013 on infrastructure for
future connections, given that most of the AF was undisbursed before then; (ii) an industry
standard of two percent of annual capital costs as yearly O&M costs; (iii) EEPCo’s
reported connection costs of US$ 26; and (iv) supply costs of US$.06 per kWh 33, the long-
run marginal cost of supply (LRMC) currently reported for EEPCo.

8.     Benefits. For the base-case EIRR and ENPVs, the ICR has used a Willingness To
Pay (WTP) of US$0.17 per kWh, applied in recent reports on rural electrification projects
in Ethiopia. This WTP falls within the range of WTP estimates for Africa: US$0.15 per
kWh to US$0.25 per kWh. In recent years, due to increased incomes, WTP in Ethiopia has
been as high as US$0.30 per kWh. However, the ICR analysis has used more conservative
estimates due to concerns about quality of data.

B.      Results of the Analysis and Comparison with the PAD Estimates for the EIRR
        and NPV

9.      The PAD, prepared in 2002, estimated the EIRR for the grid-based electrification
component at 14 percent, associated with an estimated capital cost of US$ 43 million. The
related ENPVs were US$21 million and US$7.7 million at discount rates of 10 percent and
12 percent, respectively. The benefits were valued at the average tariff of US$0.06, taken
as a proxy for WTP, far below the current WTP for rural electrification (US$0.17 per kWh)
for Ethiopia. Using this WTP, the ex-post analysis (Table 2) has re-estimated the EIRR at
21 percent, associated with the much higher estimated actual capital costs of US$82.3
million. The associated ENPVs are US$ 63 million at a discount rate of 10 percent and
US$40.5 million at a discount rate of 12 percent. Applying the lowest WTP value for
Africa (US$0.15 per kWh), reduces the EIRR to 17 percent, with the related ENPVs
remaining positive but considerably lower than in the base case: US$41.1 million and
US$23.3 million, at discount rates of 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively.

higher figure.

Summary of Borrower’s ICR (as provided by the different project Offices)

I.      Introduction

The Government of Ethiopia did not provide a consolidated completion report, from the
Borrower’s perspective, on the performance of EAP. Instead, the ICRR team received five
completion reports from implementing agencies, ranging from 3-59 pages each, and
totaling 127 pages. Therefore, the ICRR team has put together excerpts from these reports
to serve as the Borrower’s contribution within a maximum of 10 pages, as prescribed in the
ICR guidelines. These excerpts, presented below, by implementing agency, appear as
written in the full reports, unedited. 35 The full reports submitted to the Bank, noted below
with regard to the excerpts, may be found in the project files

II.     Contributions from EEPCo

A.      Urban Distribution System Rehabilitation Component

[Excerpts from: Urban Distribution Rehabilitation Project: Project Completion Report,
Wondwossen, Regassa, October 31, 2011 (59 pages).]

Conclusion

•       The original target of Rehabilitation work volume and loss savings have been
satisfactorily achieved in Addis Ababa in terms of medium voltage networks. In case of
low voltage network rehabilitation, substantial scope changes have been made on the
quantity and the loss reduction contribution would be insignificants decreased proportion to
the scope reduction.

•      The Construction target of the Medium voltage express feeder which upgrades 100
percent load carrying capacity of existing medium voltage system has been achieved.

•       Other benefits than loss savings are obvious but cannot be easily quantified.

•      Right – of - way complaints and subsequent changes in the construction work has
caused delays and increased construction costs.

•     Due to several reasons the overall project completion time increased by 10.3
months, that means additional costs (additional consultancy months and Employer’s staff
month plus operation costs) and delayed benefits.

•       The volume of the actual rehabilitation work, especially underground cable
construction was considerable increased due to Addis Ababa master plan implementation
during the project execution stage.

   Some sections have slight changes in font and formatting for presentational purposes. Footnotes and
bracketed notes in the main text were added by the Bank’s ICRR team.

                                                 46
•      The actual expenditure in the foreign component of the project is much higher that
the Appraisal Report due to design change and world market price increments.

•      The nature of the project forced both internal and external intervention during
design and implementation period. This would contribute the project completion time delay
and associated costs.

Recommendation

•      The future rehabilitation work should be done after intensive risk assessment and
stakeholder’s analysis study to avoid complex problems during design and construction
periods.

•       The nature of the project needs well documentation and accurate data now and then
on existing networks due to distribution network dynamism prior to the design and
implementation stage, This shall be realized by accurate information exchange between
internal and external stakeholders and dedicated team in the project who manage such
continues activities to minimize the risks on reworks and unnecessary costs.

•      The project nature calls diligent support and assistance from all stakeholders to
complete the project within the time frame and budget. This would achieved by marketing
the project to the designated public by all means of media prior to the project
commencement.

•       Local Authorities support in providing validated data/ information to such type of
project is critical for successful completion of the project as per the original plan.
Therefore, the subsequent same type of project shall deal with all concerned Authorities to
validate all the required data/ information by the project in due time.

•       Understanding of the nature of the project by stakeholders is very crucial to support
such type of project during design and implementation stage. In this regard, liaison works
with relevant Authorities in due time is very important.

B.     Grid-Based Electrification

[Excerpts from: The Additional Financing for Energy Access Project, Final Report-Draft,
October 2013 (38 pages)].
The overall activity of this project was designed to be implemented under the following
two categories:

A.     Procurement of distribution items for the electrification of 100 rural towns and
connection of 70,000 customers:
This procurement is supply only and was being carried out with International Competitive
Bidding Procedure (ICB)

B.     Construction of distribution network for 100 rural towns/villages; which are
dispersed in the different regions of the country.
The construction part was being carried out by local electromechanical contractors and
UEAP’s own task team.

                                             47
London power associate (London); a consultant for both the urban rehabilitation
component of the seven major towns and Grid based rural electrification commenced its
task on September 2012 and concluded on 30th June , 2013.

Amongst the many tasks that were undertaken by the consultant the major ones include the
following: (i) After Reviewing the existing EEPCo’s specification for the distribution
items, one standard technical specification was developed; which is to be used consistently
by the different project units of EEPCo. (ii) Design the rehabilitation distribution networks
for seven major towns. (iii) Has produced a study about the usefulness of implementing
GIS based environment for EEPCo’s Network and prepared an engineering estimate for its
implementations. (iv) Produced a separate study on how to optimize the size of conductors
and transformers.

From the total 9 distribution items that were intended to be procured under the Grid based
rural electrification, contracts was committed with different supplier only for eight
contracts totaling to US$16.72.

Currently all the items of these contracts were delivered to the different warehouses’ of
EEPCo; except having short supplies and defects on few items of some of the contracts.
Due to this, the project couldn’t disburse an amount of US$0.485 million from the signed
contract amount up until the final date of the grace period of the credit (i.e. 31 October
2013). Notwithstanding the shipment of the entire contract was concluded well before their
final delivery date.

An individual GIS consultant was hired on single source selection basis so as to provide
training to EEPCo’s staff on Arc-GIS soft wares and also to map the 450 towns of EAREPI
on to the digital map. However, only sixty eight towns were mapped by the end of the loan
closing date.

The construction of one hundred towns; which were deemed to be completed within the
loan closing date was not completed. As a result the project was not successful in
energizing the lines and giving the intended customer connections. The construction of
both MV and LV network for the one hundred towns was being undertaken by local Electro
Mechanical contractors, who were selected and awarded contracts based on a given sets of
prequalification criteria. The fact that flat rate prices were not revised over a fixed interval
of time in the phase of galloping inflation is presumed to have exacerbated the delay in the
construction. This has resulted in not having a fair number of efficient and experienced
electromechanical contractors. (See Annex 7 of the full report for towns’ status detail).

Technical and non-technical Issues

The main difficulties through the implementation phase emanate from not having a
procurement officer; at project level. In connection to this recruitment and retention of
procurement professional has been a challenge. Due to this Engineers get distracted from
their core assignment while trying to handle routine procurement issues. Secondly
construction works got delayed mainly due to lack of having sufficient numbers of efficient
and capable electromechanical contractors’. Added on to this of having proper support
from local administration has made its own contribution to the delay.

                                              48
Points for the Bank’s consideration

All points that were included in the final completion report of EAREP I are listed below for
IDA’s consideration. With regard to the procurement that was cleared by IDA, it appears
that procurement that are being cleared at country office level are going at a faster pace
against those procurements and Bid evaluation report that are being cleared at RPM level.
It is therefore of paramount importance to the client, if further revision of the current
threshold for the clearance is considered.

III.  REF’s Contribution (Off-Grid Electrification)
[Excerpts from: How REF is doing? (undated) submitted by REF ( 3 pages)].
Under Solar home system (SHS) for households

       •       1108 households electrified (through 8 cooperatives and 1 private sector)
       •       25,000 number of users under installation progress

Under Institutional PV

       •       336 number of off grid rural primary schools electrified
       •       545 number of off grid rural health posts electrified
       •       34 federal and regional energy offices and training institutions

Problems

       •       Lack of maintenance service backup in local areas
       •       Users Improper use
       •       Substandard items, especially 1108 households purchased from local
       markets
       •       Health posts use heater type refrigerators (diesel run), usually consumes
       high power for 24 hours a day,
       •       Very slow implementation rate
       •       Due to many reasons took long time to complete contracts (schools and
       health posts)

Remedy

       •       REF trained 200 technicians to provide services in their local areas
       •       Through Contracted companies 450 technicians are trained, involved in
       installation and will also manage after installation services whenever required,
       •       132 local area energy officers are trained, to carry inspection and monitoring
       •       Check during inspection, provision of proper users training and
       documentation
       •       Discussed with health offices to replace such refrigerators
       •       REF procured equipment have testing facility in the country, to keep import
       of solar equipment good quality



                                             49
Impact of the projects

      •   The community of the off grid areas have; light for their house, charge mobile,
          listen radio, students do their assignment night time, reduces woman’s burden
          during pregnant and also after birth in care.
      •   In addition to improves day to day schools activity the teachers have charged
          lanterns for their home at night, spent more time to check students assignment and
          prepare,
      •   Even the refrigerators are not recommendable for solar projects; health post services
          become much better.
      •   Created job opportunity for technicians in their local area.

Monitoring and Evaluation

The monitoring of installed PV systems carried in coordination with regional offices and
development bank of Ethiopia. Among the installed sites the monitoring report shows;
about 80 out of 1108 installed have not functional Battery, Charge controller, inverter
problems are main causes. Up on the report discussed and reached agreement to arrange
additional loan to repair once. Institutional PV systems main problems are as stated in
under problems above. In Primary schools lantern users not regularly charge and most
found fail.

  According to the report, the implementation phase, concluded in June 2011, resulted in the establishment of
a data management system employing flexicadastre software for the Ministry of Mines, regional mines and
energy bureaus. Total expenditures were 32, 260.64 British pounds for the design phase and for the
implementation phase, 2,175,178 Birr and 1,121,749 Euros.

Background

The project has been implemented from September 2003. However, actual stove
dissemination begun in 2006 to the expected level. Initially, it was planned to disseminate
320,000 stoves but so far in just the past five years over 2.6 million stoves were
disseminated. Beyond that over 5,000 stoves producers and experts received training on
energy saving techniques and stove production and marketing methods. The stoves under
dissemination are tested and proved to save from 30%-57% biomass fuels compared to the
traditional stoves depending on their type. Stove dissemination was made initially in six of
the nine regional states of Ethiopia (Oromia, Amhara, Southern Nations and Nationality
People (SNNP), Tigray, Ben Shangul-Gemuz, and Gambella) by the Ethiopian Rural
Development and Promotion Center – EREDPC through Regional and woreda Bureaus of
Energy. However, because of the demand for the stoves in other regions, the project
included all other regionals but with only on technical assistance and training.

Outputs of the Intervention

•        Until June 2011, over 2.6 million stoves of six different models were disseminated
over five years (2005-2011) all over the country.
•        Over 5,000 individuals from the private sector are trained and are involved in the
stove business.
•        120 stove production centers were established for use by rural cooperatives nearly
all of them are run by women.

Lessons Learned

Quality control in decentralized production

•      Provide molds to make every piece of the stove identical, thus guaranteeing
standardized production.
•      Closed stoves were self-built based on a template and using locally-available
materials. Therefore the production process was not standardized.

Efficiency measures of stoves

•       The Gonzi stove is claimed to save about 57 percent while the Mirte stove saves 47-
52 % and the Tikikil, about 63 percent. Validation of these claims could not be done
because tests were carried out differently; by different organizations and most likely with
different testing protocols and methodologies. Therefore, it is advisable that the GoE
consolidate such stove parameters by promoting a new round of updated validation tests,
with a rigorous standard technical evaluation process applied to all stoves.
•       Build in the success of RHEEIP to establish a modern laboratory for stove testing
and development.




                                              53
Business management

Provide training in management and bookkeeping to keep cost, production and sales
records. This is a useful link in MRV system.

Financial support to producers

In general, producers have requested micro-credit only once, showing the minimized
importance of such support;

Marketing strategy

•       Dissemination and sale of stoves are done by the artisans themselves, with each
group producing and selling stoves directly to individual customers, to retailers, NGOs or
government programs which often buy in bulk;
•       Reduction of IAP by ICS is used as a strong marketing message. In the absence of a
chimney, the extent of production of IAP needs to be documented and validated by proper
tests. This has implications for design and installation of ICS;
•       Although the EREDPC has developed a stove with a chimney for commercial
purposes, it should be better promoted, so as to gain broader acceptance;

End user Education/Training

•      Proper biomass stoves use and maintenance should be taught and reinforced
because without proper maintenance and operation, a well-designed stove can quickly
become inefficient and polluting;
•      All the six steps (from lab. Testing to monitoring and evaluation) should be applied.
•      Strong and continued promotion through all possible medium is very important.
•      Regular and systematic follow up, technical assistance, monitoring and is very
important to avert market barriers.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) +MRV

•       Past achievements should be properly documented, by organizing the data base and
the information, perform a household survey among ICS users, to estimate and document
the quantitative and qualitative impacts of the RHEEIP, to better understand the actual
patters of use and preferences for future ICSs.
•       In particular, focus should be given to re-evaluating the performance of the
RHEEIP stove portfolio, in terms of energy efficiency, durability and emissions (IAP and
GHG).

Scaling-up strategy

The World Bank can add value and assist in scaling up the strategy, and by sharing its
