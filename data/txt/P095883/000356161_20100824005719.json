Some lessons learned included:\n            Aceh's experience in the aftermath of the tsunami\n            illustrates both the critical importance of land rights in\n            reconstruction and reconstruction efforts, as well as the\n            vulnerability of land administration systems, particularly\n            those relying on paper records. Countries need to have\n            systems and policies for recovery in place prior to\n            disasters in order to be able to respond quickly and\n            effectively to natural disasters and other emergencies. In\n            the case of Indonesia, this is particularly prone to natural\n            disasters, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, volcanoes, and\n            forest fires, BPN (National Land Agency - Badan Pertanahan\n            Nasional) should seriously consider developing and legally\n            adopting a post-disaster strategy to guide rehabilitation\n            and reconstruction efforts with regard to land. A clear\n            commitment on the part of national authorities to protect\n            property rights is critical in avoiding large-scale land\n            grabbing and speculation. Moreover, customary land practices\n            are often designed as safety nets to protect the most\n            vulnerable groups, including women. Thus, it is of utmost\n            importance not to undermine these safety nets when\n            transitioning from customary rights to state-provided land\n            tenure and administration systems. Reconstruction efforts\n            can often open new opportunities. The damage to land records\n            as a result of the tsunami underscores the need to have\n            back-up systems. A further reminder of this occurred during\n            implementation when one of the field team base camps burned\n            down and records were lost."}, "docdt": "2010-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
