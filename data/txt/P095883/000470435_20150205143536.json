Also, reestablishing land\n            ownership is a major precondition for rebuilding\n            settlements. At the household level, secure tenure provides\n            access to credit and other benefits. The Reconstruction of\n            Aceh Land Administration System (RALAS) project seeks to\n            restore property rights using participatory processes. A\n            number of civil society organizations (big international\n            groups as well as Aceh-based ones) have been trained by this\n            World Bank-administered program to conduct Community Mapping\n            and Community Driven Adjudication processes. The survivors\n            of the community are brought together as a \"human\n            archive\" to discuss and agree whose property was where,\n            the shape of the property boundaries, and so forth. Then a\n            map is drawn up and all survivors and community leaders sign\n            the map - to say that this is indeed the record of the\n            village. This is then posted for a defined period in a\n            prominent place so that anyone who has a counter claim can\n            lodge it. If they do, there is adjudication by the whole\n            community but eventually the record is agreed to be true.\n            The Land Administration Agency, much of which was destroyed,\n            then comes in and draws up highly detailed maps and marks\n            out the property boundaries as the community indicated with\n            surveyor\u0092s poles. The next step is to give over legal title\n            to that land, which is very important because most of these\n            people, especially the poorest, have never had title deeds\n            to their lands. Even before the tsunami, only at most 25\n            percent of land ownership had been registered."}, "docdt": "2006-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
