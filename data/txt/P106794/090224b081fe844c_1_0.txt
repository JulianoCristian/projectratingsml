                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to expand access to urban water supply in Cameroon through a subsidized household connections program. The project shall allow for
                         the installation of about 40,000 household connections in urban areas countrywide over 5 years, equivalent to a 25% increase in the total number of water connections in
                         the country. An estimated population of 240,000 people shall gain access to safe piped water (current urban coverage is estimated at 35%).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of September 1, 2013 over 25,000 connections have been completed achieving about 63% of the total number of planned connections. However, with less than one month left
                         before the project closing date, the completion of the remaining 15,000 connections is impossible.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         There is a need (i) to restore the financial equilibrium of the water sector; and (ii) to accelerate the implementation of the GPOBA-subsidized water connection program.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
