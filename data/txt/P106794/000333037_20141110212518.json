Some lessons learned included: key project\n            documents could be translated into the client\u0092s language to\n            help ensure agreement on project objectives, activities, and\n            accountabilities. Convening activities may be conducted\n            among project stakeholders to clarify objectives and mutual\n            expectations and agree on plans going forward. The\n            availability of water supply should be assessed prior to\n            investing in new connections.

A communications campaign\n            to inform about the public about a connections project\n            should follow, rather than precede, capacity to deliver\n            water. Known risks to a project during preparation, and\n            action steps to mitigate them, should be identified during\n            project design to strengthen the prospects for satisfactory\n            project performance.
