    Structural Adjustment Project are to stabilize the economy,\n            improve its competitiveness, create an incentive framework\n            for the efficient allocation of resources, lay the\n            foundation for export-led growth and for improved living\n            conditions for the Rwandese people. Specifically, the credit\n            will support measures to: (i) establish and maintain a\n            competitive exchange rate and a more liberal foreign\n            exchange allocation and trade regime; (ii) liberalize\n            domestic trade, simplify and reduce the regulatory\n            environment; (iii) alleviate institutional and production\n            constraints in key sectors (coffee, and energy); (iv)\n            establish a process of public expenditure programming; (v)\n            provide a satisfactory social \"safety net\" within\n            the framework of an agreed public expenditure program that\n            is consistent with a sound macroeconomic framework; and (vi)\n            initiate policy reforms dealing with taxation, labor\n            legislation and civil service."}, "docdt": "1991-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
