Key lessons learned are: Borrower\n            ownership of the program, commitment to its objectives, and\n            the drive for results are critical to the successful\n            implementation of an ambitious structural reform program.\n            The close cooperation between the World bank and the\n            Government was instrumental in ensuring design quality and\n            effective project. It was determined initially that a core\n            set of up-front actions, including the adoption of major new\n            legislation, was essential to ensuring effective\n            implementation and sustainability of the program's\n            objectives. Insistence on this principle extended the period\n            preceding the Board presentation; and this period was used\n            very effectively to refine the program, gain political\n            support at the highest levels in the country, and advance\n            bank and enterprise privatization. From the outset, the\n            Government determined to sell State-owned enterprises and\n            banks to strategic investors who could bring in the\n            necessary capital and know-how and provide appropriate\n            governance. Putting in place a modern regulatory and\n            supervisory framework is crucial to reforming the financial\n            sector, but does not itself guarantee effective financial\n            sector supervision. While political independence and strong\n            regulatory and supervisory powers can be provided relatively\n            rapidly by passing appropriate legislation, the development\n            of supervisory skills, culture, and confidence is longer-term."}, "docdt": "1999-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
