Hungary's efforts to implement effective\n            reform of its enterprise and financial sectors. The loan\n            will provide fast-disbursing funds for balance-of-payments\n            assistance for the government's reform program. The\n            government will aim to maintain a stable macroeconomic\n            framework within which essential structural reforms can be\n            implemented, especially those which will accelerate bank and\n            enterprise privatization. The reform program's main\n            components include: (1) an enterprise privatization program\n            targeting substantial reduction of remaining State shares in\n            enterprises, particularly in large utilities over the\n            1995-97 period; (2) a strong program to curtail and reduce\n            enterprise losses, and help free resources for projects of\n            much higher returns; (3) comprehensive legal and regulatory\n            development in the banking sector designed to preserve\n            financial discipline and to ensure that scarce resources are\n            effectively allocated to the most dynamic enterprises; and\n            (4) radical improvement in bank governance in the context of\n            a bank privatization program aimed at privatizing all\n            remaining State-owned banks by 1997's end."}, "docdt": "1997-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
