Health Extension\n            Adaptable Lending Program Project (FHEP) for Brazil were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            A lesson learned was that pooled funding approach that was\n            adopted as a design feature of the Bank's financial\n            support to the FHEP offered several advantages that make the\n            approach worth replicating, given similar conditions. The\n            pooled funding approach: (i) allows for a single\n            procurement, financial management and disbursement system,\n            which reduces transaction costs of Bank financing and\n            ensures that support under a project for improving those\n            systems results in improvements to the Government's\n            systems; (ii) directs Government and Bank efforts to\n            technical and fiduciary oversight, monitoring and\n            strengthening of the larger Government program rather than\n            ring-fencing a much smaller Bank-financed project; (iii)\n            allows the Bank's technical specialist(s) to focus\n            technical advice during supervision on technical aspects,\n            while financial management and procurement specialist\n            address compliance with the Bank's fiduciary\n            requirements; (iv) inserts the Bank-financed project into a\n            high-priority programmatic and policy framework; and (v)\n            creates the vehicle to link both Government and Bank\n            financing to results. In effect, the pooling approach under\n            the FHEP benefited both the Government and the Bank by\n            redefining a partnership to focus on results."}, "docdt": "2007-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
