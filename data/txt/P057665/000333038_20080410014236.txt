1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Bank's US$68.0 million loan approved on March 14, 2002 to finance the Family
Health Extension Project (FHEP) provided assistance for the first phase of a three phase
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) in support of Brazil's Family Health Program
(Programa de Saude da Familia, or PSF). The three phase APL was to provide support
to the Government's PSF which sought to improve utilization and quality of publicly-
financed health services by:

(a) Expanding coverage of the PSF in about 100 large municipalities, establishing well-
articulated referral and counter-referral systems, and introducing performance-based
financing and management arrangements;
(b) Establishing family health as a core element of health professional and para-
professional training; and
(c) Strengthening the Ministry of Health's (MOH or Ministerio da Saúde, MS) capacity
to monitor and evaluate PSF health services, policies and training activities on a
systematic basis.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Inequities in Health Outcomes. When FHEP was prepared, then recent estimates were
that 45 percent of Brazil's population lived in poverty and 23 percent (35 million) lived
in extreme poverty. Approximately half of the poor lived in urban areas. Data from the
1996 Demographic Survey showed that the health status of Brazil's poor was
significantly worse than that of the non-poor. Children of poor families had three times
higher risk of dying before the age of five than children from the wealthiest segments of
the population. Fertility rates of poor teenage girls were six times higher than those of
better-off teenagers, and poor girls faced much higher risks of maternal morbidity and
mortality.

The Demographic Health Survey data suggested that, at similar income levels, the urban
poor had slightly worse health outcomes than the rural poor. Approximately 40 percent
of Brazilians in the poorest wealth quintile and 75 percent in the second poorest quintile
lived in urban areas. Health indicators among the urban dwellers in the poorest quintile
were as bad as or worse than among those in rural areas.

While poor urban children had better vaccination rates and were more likely to be treated
for diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) than their rural counterparts, the
prevalence of these diseases among the urban poor was higher. Although the urban poor
had better access to health services during childhood than the rural poor, the higher urban
infant mortality rates raised questions about the timeliness, continuity and quality of care
received and/or the severity of the underlying illness. In general terms, the poor had
utilization rates 25 percent lower than the non-poor in both urban and rural areas. It was
these inequities that reflected higher transaction costs and behavioral barriers that led the
Government of Brazil to introduce proactive community and family health delivery



                                            1

systems such as the PSF, and to provide financial incentives for the country's 5,500
municipalities, which are the main players in the organization and delivery of public
health services, to adopt them.

Previous Health System Reforms. In the 15 years before the FHEP was prepared, Brazil
had implemented a series of health policy reforms that had transformed the organization,
financing and provision of health services in the country. In the late 1980s, Brazil had
converted its federal public health financing system to a single national health fund. In
the mid-1990s, it had instituted a per capita payment for primary care services that was
distributed directly to municipalities, a reform that caused vast improvement in the equity
of the health care system. This capitation system was later enhanced by the PSF, through
which the Federal Government (the Borrower) transferred additional funds to the
municipalities that agreed to implement a proactive primary health care model, provided
resources were spent for agreed purposes and municipalities fulfilled their agreed
obligations.

Decentralization of Service Delivery.        Brazil had taken an incremental approach to
decentralization and health system reform. Decentralization efforts, supported through a
constitutional reform and associated legislation, had transformed the National Health
System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS) from a centralized system to one in which
municipalities, and to a lesser extent states, were responsible for the organization and
delivery of public health services. Responsibility for primary care had been transferred to
Brazil's 5,500 municipalities, which received block grants from the MOH to finance
partially primary care (these were matched by municipal funds). At the time of FHEP
preparation, about 10 percent of municipalities had qualified for "full management"
status under which they received block grants to manage primary, secondary and tertiary
care, including paying private hospital providers.

There were, however, several issues that threatened future system performance and
expansion of the PSF: (a) a mismatch between delegated responsibilities and institutional
capacity of many municipalities; (b) an unclear division of responsibilities between states
and municipalities; (c) weak municipal capacity to organize and manage health service
delivery, in part due to a lack of trained management professionals; (d) absence of
systematic monitoring and evaluation; (e) a tendency of municipal managers to focus on
inputs rather than results and outputs; and (f) the inability of many states and
municipalities to implement functional referral systems. These and other deficiencies of
the decentralization were addressed through new regulations issued by the MOH in
January, 2001.

Financing of Health Care Services. The Government had also adopted reforms in the
financing of health care that provided a strong impulse to decentralization, strengthened
the resource base and demonstrated the Government's strategy of gradual improvement
of the health financing system.          The Government had replaced fee-for-service
reimbursements for basic interventions by a system of per-capita transfers for primary
care (Piso de Atenção Básica, PAB).           The amount capitated was augmented for
municipalities that adopted priority programs, such as the PSF. As the demand for



                                             2

services exceeded the amount the MOH was able to spend on health care, there was a
rationing system whereby states were allocated an annual ceiling for SUS funding. The
MOH also introduced other cost-containment measures, including physical and financial
ceilings for impatient services and direct control over high-cost interventions.

The Government also secured Congressional approval of a Constitutional Amendment
that mandated an increase in funding by the Federal Government, and the earmarking of
12 percent of state revenues and 15 percent of municipal revenues for the health sector.

Still, health sector financing was characterized by: (a) instability in funding flows, and
large but decreasing differences in per capita health care funding across states and
municipalities; (b) a persistent bias toward high-cost hospital services and slow
improvements in the quantity and quality of basic care; (c) insufficient linkages between
financial mechanisms and health priorities; (d) poor incentives for managers of primary
care unit and hospitals (mostly private) to use public resources efficiently; (e)
management weaknesses at the municipal level, particularly in managing the financing
system, in using information for monitoring and evaluation of performance and taking
corrective action; and (f) absence of analyses of resource usage.

Its coverage was to increase from 10 to 60 percent of the population in targeted large,
urban municipalities upon completion of the seven year APL.

        The Family Health Program and its Challenges. The PSF was introduced in 1994,
building on the strengths of its predecessor the Programa de Agentes Comunitários
(PACS), which had introduced the use of paid health agents who reached out to the
community in an organized fashion. PSF was seen at the center of the transformation of
the mainly curative and hospital-centered health care system toward one that was oriented
toward prevention, promotion and basic care. PSF organized community agents into
teams, which typically included a general practice or family health physician, a nurse,
one or two auxiliary nurses and, often, one dental health professional team for one or two
PSF teams. Building on the PAC, the PSF provided teams with equipment (medical,
transport, and basic information technology) and a standardized system of work and
reporting requirements. Each team was assigned the responsibility of providing care to a
defined set of 600-1,000 families.

At the time the FHEP was prepared, the PSF covered nearly 38 million people (about
one-fourth of the population) in 3,124 municipalities with 10,900 Family Health Teams.
Some municipalities were still operating with the PACS. The Government aimed to
expand the PSF to half of the country's population, meaning that the program would need
to double in size. At the time, most of PSF's expansion had taken place in rural and peri-
urban areas, where municipal primary providers were in short supply. Implementation in
urban areas was patchy, in part because the PSF faced the dual challenge of extending
coverage and converting the traditional and often ineffective municipal primary care
delivery system to one based on the family health strategy. A comparison of summary
features of the traditional model of providing primary care, common in urban centers, and
the family health model introduced through the PSF is presented in Table 1 below:

The PSF faced several challenges, as follows: (a) the Program's expansion in large urban
areas and metropolitan regions had been slower than expected, despite changes in
financial incentives; (b) municipal health authorities did not have clear criteria for
prioritizing program interventions and geographical areas, and instead applied a mix of
risk criteria combined with community and political demands; (c) an inadequate referral
system was in place because of the lack of a defined entry point for the population and
the absence of a provider who assumed responsibility for an individual's and family's
total care that co-existed under the existing traditional PHC models; (d) PSF services
were of uneven quality due to shortages of vaccines, medicines, laboratory services,
equipment and medical supplies and treatment protocols and standards, quality control
and training; (e) there were important human resource supply bottlenecks in terms of
quantity and quality, and varying skills among existing PSF teams, which constrained
expanding coverage and improving quality of PSF; and (f) PSF's contractual/employment
arrangements relied heavily on temporary personnel. As a result, they were flexible, but
unstable, and resulted in legal and political challenges and the high rotation of personnel
in PSF teams which compromised program continuity and the stability in the
doctor/patient relationship, which was central to the PSF's family health model.

Basic health care was very high on Brazil's development agenda, and the Government's
four year development plan, Avança Brasil -- Plano Plurianual/PPA 2000/2003, stated
that the expansion of PSF was a leading priority for the health sector. To reach its goal of
expanding PSF to provide coverage to half of Brazil's population by 2002, the
Government:     (a) promoted primary health care interventions that were most cost-
effective and beneficial to the poor, and prioritized actions that focused on communicable
and non-communicable illnesses that affected the poor; (b) secured increased financing
for the sector and for the PSF (14 percent of the MOH's budget was assigned to PSF); (c)
approved new regulations that sought to correct observed deficiencies in the



                                           4

decentralization process while strengthening institutional arrangements to facilitate PSF
expansion. Municipalities and states that complied with the regulations would qualify for
higher federal transfers. The regulations also strengthened management requirements for
municipalities to qualify for "autonomous management" status and created a stronger role
to the states in overseeing municipal resource management. States and municipalities
were required to develop health plans and sign performance agreements that specified
performance targets. Municipalities that complied with the new regulations would be
"certified" by the MOH to receive increase per capita payments; and (d) drafted a human
resource policy that supported the development of personnel skilled in health services
management, family planning and family health strategies and practices, while
standardizing and regulating the contractual arrangements that affected PSF teams.

Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank was particularly well poised to support the
Government in its efforts to scale up and improve the PSF with financial and technical
assistance to be provided for the Program, initially through the FHEP's first phase. The
Project built upon several years of Bank support to Brazil's health sector.1 Furthermore,
the objective and design of the FHEP was fully consistent with the themes of the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy for Brazil dated March 30, 2000 (Report No. 20160-BR) and
reiterated in the 2001 CAS Progress Report, both of which highlighted the strategic
importance of improvements in the health sector in poverty reduction efforts. It also
anticipated the Bank's 2007 HNP Sector Strategy, in that it recognized: (a) the Bank's
comparative advantage in the areas of system strengthening; (b) the importance of
supporting reforms that separated the functions of finance, purchase and provision of
health services; (c) the Bank's overall mission to supported programs that addressed the
needs of poor and underserved populations, with a particular emphasis on cost-effective
basic health services that met the needs of women and children.

The Bank was also seen to provide: (a) established experience with adjustment and
performance-based lending; (b) global international experience and expertise on project
design and implementation, particularly in the areas of financial incentives and transfer
mechanisms, program targeting and evaluation; and (c) broad strategic perspective on the
sector and capacity to bring to the health sector experience gained in supporting other key
government agencies and ministries.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The Development Objectives of Phase I of the FHEP were, to:

    (a) increase coverage of health services among populations in urban centers with
        populations of 100,000 or greater, especially among those with limited access to



1SUS Health Reform Project (REFORSUS), Disease Surveillance Project (VIGISUS),
and AIDS/HIV Control Project.



                                            5

        and utilization of basic health care, through expansion of and conversion to the
        PSF approach, development of a referral and counter-referral system, and
        improvement in the management and organization of basic health services;
    (b) improve the quality of family health service provision through developing and
        strengthening in-service and pre-service training of human resources in the PSF
        model; and
    (c) improve the performance and effectiveness of basic health care services through
        strengthening monitoring and evaluation, information management and
        accreditation systems.

Coverage extension activities were to focus on large urban areas, which were
characterized by poorly integrated traditional service delivery systems and large numbers
of families living in poverty and confronting severe social risk. About 40 of Brazil's 223
municipalities with populations of 100,000 or more were expected to participate in the
Phase I project (and about 100 were expected to participate by the end of the seven-year
APL). The strategic aim was to raise PSF population coverage from about 10 to 35
percent within those municipalities.        Support for decentralization reforms and
management improvements were also to focus on urban municipalities.               Quality
enhancement activities related to training, monitoring and evaluation, information
management and accreditation were expected to yield nationwide benefits.

Progress towards achievement of the Project's Development Objectives was to be
measured through a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system which would build on
established health information systems.        The Project's key output/impact related
performance indicators included the following:

PSF Municipal Coverage and Expansion
    · Average population coverage in about 40 urban municipalities raised from 10 to
        35 percent;
    · 40 percent of maternity admissions from PSF catchment areas in the participating
        municipalities are referred by PSF teams;
    · 30 percent reduction in number of hospital admissions for ARI for children under
        five from participating PSF catchment areas;
    · Performance-based management and supervision system developed and piloted in
        each municipality; and
    · Performance-based, federal-municipal transfer mechanism approved and under
        implementation;

PSF Human Resource Development
    · In-service training provided to 10,000 PSF physicians, nurses and community
        health agents;
    · 3000 professionals trained in health services planning, management and
        organization; and
    · Family health residency programs established with at least 100 enrolled residents.




                                           6

Monitoring and Evaluation
    · Development and approval of a regulatory framework for the accreditation of
       PSF/Basic Health Units and PSF training institutions;
    · Evaluation completed of a sample of PSF teams and PSF training institutions,
       implemented between 1997 and 2001; and
    · Monitoring and evaluation system for PSF, including local feedback mechanism
       and performance targets developed and tested.

The First Phase FHEP also set out the Trigger Indicators for each of the subsequent two
phases of the seven year APL (see Annex 10).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The First Phase FHEP's objectives were not revised formally.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project's main benefits would include improved health outcomes for the population
of large urban centers that had limited access to and utilization of basic health care
services; greater access to high quality basic health care services; greater municipal, state
and federal capacity for management of the health care system, including development of
information, monitoring and evaluation systems; more and better-trained professionals
and other health care workers prepared to deliver basic, outreach-oriented health care.

The Project was not to target low-income beneficiaries per se, as the PSF is not a
program exclusively for the poor. Rather, the PSF is a model for providing basic health
care for the entire population of Brazil. The Government's social programs are universal
and are expected to remain so, but the Government recognizes that the barriers to
universal access are felt primarily by low-income populations. In addition to allocating
extra resources, the Government aimed, through the PSF and the Project, to reduce access
barriers by extending the PSF-based outreach model. The Project was expected to benefit
low-income populations since they were considered to be the main users of the SUS
through self-targeting. The Living Standard Measurement Survey conducted in 1996 and
1997 showed that the poor relied heavily on public providers, particularly for health care.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project included three components, directly related to each of its Development
Objectives: (a) PSF Municipal Conversion and Expansion; (b) PSF Human Resource
Development; and (c) Monitoring and Evaluation.




                                            7

Component 1: PSF Municipal Conversion and Expansion (US$86.9 million Total
Project Cost, US$25.9 Loan Financing)

Component 1, PSF Municipal Conversion and Expansion, would support the extension of
basic care services through the expansion of the population covered under the PSF model
in about 40 municipalities with populations of over 100,000 inhabitants. This would be
achieved through the implementation of Basic and Family Health Care Conversion
Subprojects (Conversion Subprojects) to convert the organization and provision of basic
health services from a traditional model to the prevention, outreach- and performance-
oriented Family Health Model; strengthen the decentralization regime, following the
NOAS/01 regulatory framework2 and introduce a performance-based transfer mechanism.

The specific objectives of the component were to: (a) expand access to and utilization of
basic health services by populations at risk in urban areas, which were underserved,
through the implementation of the PSF model and upgrading the service network; (b)
establish functional referral and counter-referral systems through the establishment of
integrated service networks; (c) strengthen the system of PSF management and
organization; (d) improve the performance of the municipal providers of basic health
services through development of performance-based organizational and management
models, and the introduction of new health care practices.

Municipalities that were seeking support under the Project would submit a Conversion
Plan (Plano de Conversão) as well as related Basic and Family Health Care activities that,
taken together, would constitute the Conversion Subprojects. Criteria for eligibility and
selection of participating municipalities as well as guidelines for the preparation of the
Conversion Plans would be established by the MOH, and included in the Project's
Operational Manual (OM). Eligibility Criteria were also included in an Annex in the
Project Appraisal Document, and included, for example: population (above 100,000);
participation in the decentralization process; details to be included in the presentation of
municipal health plans; specifics to be included in the three-phase, seven-year
Conversion Plan; agreement to carry out baseline studies, and agreement to implement an
agreed fiduciary framework.

The Conversion Subprojects would form the basis for Subproject Implementation
Agreements between the respective municipality and the MOH, which would set forth the
respective obligations regarding Subproject implementation, including: (a) broad
description of a seven-year Conversion Plan, including global end-of-program
performance targets; (b) detailed description of Conversion activities that were to be


2Approved in 2001 and updated in 2002, NOAS represented a new set of regulations promulgated to
correct some of the shortcomings of the SUS health reform, including the persistent lack of integration or
coordination among levels of care, and the need for smaller municipalities to join with others to achieve the
minimum size required for the efficient provision of secondary and tertiary services. The regulations
sought to establish a regional planning level to improve the organization and distribution of health services.
It also sought to strengthen the municipal management of basic care, and establish state plans for
regionalization and specialized hospital services.




                                                   8

implemented in the first three-year phase of the APL; (c) technical and fiduciary
performance targets that would determine eligibility for participating in subsequent
phases of the APL; (d) procurement plans and corresponding disbursement schedule for
Subproject activities, specifying eligible expenditures; (e) obligations regarding reporting,
record keeping, maintenance of accounts, and auditing; and (f) terms for cancellation of
disbursement and/or the Agreements. Municipal Conversion Plans would mirror the
Project in that they were to proceed in three phases. The initial agreement signed would
include trigger indicators for passing from the first to the second phase. The indicators,
which were largely in line with the indicators for Component 1 of the Project, aimed to
(i) monitor progress in the transformation of the primary health care system; and (ii) set
standards for acceptable fiduciary practice.

Once approved by the MOH, Conversion Subprojects would be implemented by the
respective municipality. The following groups of activities would be financed through
the Subproject pool:

       (a)         Family Health Extension and Basic Care Provision:            This would
                   support the expansion of PSF population coverage and the delivery of
                   basic care in participating urban municipalities through financing
                   incremental operational costs incurred in the organization, supervision
                   and provision of family health and basic care services.
       (b)         PSF Conversion, including the following groups of activities:

Component 2: PSF Human Resource Development (US$37.4 million Total Project
Cost, US$33.3 million Loan Financing)

Component 2, PSF Human Resource Development, would support the implementation of
a human resource policy that would contribute to the expansion of the PSF model,
strengthen the qualifications and performance of family health professionals and PSF
teams, and introduce new contents and methods in the preparation of health professionals.
This Component would have a national focus, and was to be managed through the Project
Coordination Unit in the MOH (the PCU).

The objectives of this Component were to: (a) increase the number and quality of PSF
human resources; (b) expand and strengthen pre-service and in-service training for PSF
human resources; (c) expand and strengthen programs for professional training, including
residencies in family health, specialty training for physicians, nurses and dental hygiene
assistants; and (d) introduce special programs (such as training center consortiums and
virtual networks to exchange information) and demonstration projects that would support
and strengthen the human resource development activities.

Many of the activities financed under Component 2 were to be implemented through the
Pólos de Capacitação, training centers that offer courses and training modules directed at
professionals on the Family Health Teams. In addition, about 100 institutions of higher
learning--universities, faculties and medical and nursing schools--together with State
and Municipal Health Secretariats would be able to participate in the Program. Activities
for the para-professional members of the team, particularly in the case of dental
technicians, were to be implemented through Health Technical Schools (Escolas
Técnicas de Saúde), which are linked to the State and Municipal Health Secretariats.
Existing contracts with training institutions were to be supported under this Component,
as well as new contracts that were to be selected on a competitive basis.

Activities were grouped into three subcomponents:

    (a) In-service training of PSF professionals and para-professionals would aim to
        strengthen PSF service organization and provision by supporting in-service
        training for several types of service managers, health professionals (doctors and
        nurses) and para-professionals (community health agents).            By financing
        consultancy services and workshops for training, training materials and
        publication, training programs would be developed and implemented in clinical
        practices, public health, health planning, clinical and non-clinical management.
        This subcomponent would also support development of national strategies, plans,
        guidelines and training modules for medical waste management for primary care
        facilities;
    (b) Pre-service and specialty training of PSF professionals subcomponent would
        finance consultancy services, scholarships, internships, training workshops,
        conferences, materials and publications to provide pre-service training to
        professionals relevant to the organization and provision of services under the PSF



                                           10

        model. This subcomponent would support the development and expansion of
        programs that prepare health managers, family health physician and nurse
        specialists, dental hygiene assistances and community health agents.
    (c) Demonstration activities to support training and education would seek to improve
        the quality and quantity of training opportunities for current and future members
        of PSF teams through the creation of regional networks of training centers,
        creation and maintenance of a web-based clearinghouse for training materials, and
        piloting of curriculum development programs in medical and nursing schools to
        develop new and improved educational methods and materials relevant to the
        family health discipline. The subcomponent would finance consultancy services,
        audio-visual equipment, training workshops, conferences, materials and
        publications.

Component 3:        Monitoring and Evaluation (US$7.4 million Total Project Cost,
US$6.2 Loan Financing)

Component 3, Monitoring and Evaluation, would support the application of rigorous and
coordinated monitoring and evaluation methodologies to assess the structure, processes,
outputs and impact of the PSF.         This would require building on, improving and
integrating several existing health sector information systems.          Also, evaluation
methodologies, instruments, strategies and plans developed under other FHEP
components would be applied.

The primary objectives of this Component were to: (a) create systems for permanent,
cost-effective monitoring and evaluation of the PSF and the training institutions'
performance; and (b) develop and implement systems of accreditation of basic family
health units and PSF training centers.

The Project would provide financing for four subcomponents, all of which would be
conducted on a national basis and managed through the PCU within the MOH. As
necessary, MOH would enter into subcontracts with universities and/or technical
institutions for management of research. The four subcomponents were as follows:

    (a) Strengthening of Monitoring Systems would finance activities that supported the
        consolidation and standardization of monitoring systems and instruments for basic
        health care.    It would strengthen PSF monitoring, incorporate performance
        measures into monitoring systems, expand and strengthen regional technical
        support centers (Núcleos Estaduais de Monitoramento e Avaliação da Atenção
        Básica) responsible for collecting and synthesizing health system data and
        overseeing PSF performance, development of integrated data systems and
        introduction of new information technologies.          Financing would support
        consultancy services, training, computer hardware and software, study tours and
        training workshops, materials and publications.
    (b) Evaluation of PSF Implementation would support the development of evaluation
        methodologies and instruments to measure the acquisition and application of
        skills by individuals trained in family health and the impact of training center



                                           11

       networks, demonstration projects, curricular and pedagogic innovations supported
       in Component 2. It would also support impact evaluations of a sample of PSF
        teams and PSF training centers implemented between 1997 and 2001. Financing
        would support consultancy services, publications, training workshops and
        materials, study tours and seminars.
    (c) Accreditation of the Basic Family Health Teams, Facilities and Training
        Institutions would finance consultancy services, publications, training, workshops
        and seminars to develop an accreditation regulatory framework and corresponding
        systems for: (a) family health teams and facilities; and (b) PSF training centers
        (Pólos de Capacitação).
    (d) Research and Evaluation Fund would support evaluations and operational
        research on topics related to the development and performance of the PSF and the
        related training institutions, the process of decentralization and of the SUS,
        human resources in the health sector, efficiency and effectiveness of the PSF, and
        other strategic topics identified by the MOH. Awards would be made on a
        competitive basis.     Financing would be provided for consultancy services,
        publications, workshops and international seminars.

Component 4: Project Management (US$3.8 million Total Project Cost, US$1.9 Loan
Financing)

Component 4, Project Management, would support project management for all
components of the Project, including the design and implementation of a monitoring
information system to monitor and supervise project activities. This Component would
also support issue-specific studies related to seeking solutions to implementation
problems.     Financing would be provided for consultants' services, facilities and
equipment for the maintenance of the PCU and per diem for supervision in the field.

1.6 Revised Components

On August 31, 2004, the Loan Agreement for the Project was amended to reflect mostly
adjustments to the Project's scope, and modifications to its financing arrangements. The
new Government that took office in January, 2003 embraced the "Projeto de Expansão
da Saúde da Família" (FHEP), making full extension of the Family Health Program
(PSF) to the uncovered population a major policy initiative. The main modifications to
the Project, as reflected in the Loan Amendment, were the following:

Extending the Family Health Program. The original design for Component 1 of the
Project provided assistance to extend PSF to 40 municipalities in APL 1 and an additional
60 municipalities under APL II. As urban areas had the lowest rates of PSF coverage, the
MOH planned to extend the PSF to the universe of 231 large, urban municipalities with
populations over 100,000, starting under the FHEP (APL I). The Bank loan which was
originally to finance PSF in 40 municipalities would now finance 231 municipalities.

Human Resource Development. The MOH also altered the human resource policy for
health and sought to redefine the role of the Training Centers (Pólos de Capacitação) that
were to implement, in part, the training activities under Component 2 of the Project. The


                                           12

Government's new policy called for the Training Centers to provide pre-service
(formação) and in-service training for all of its programs and services, not just the PSF.
As such, the MOH preferred to use its own resources to reform and finance the Pólos.
The Federal Government was to allocate US$38 million equivalent to Component 2
which, as counterpart funds, still remained as part of the total project cost as Non-Bank-
Financed. Loan funds that were originally allocated to Component 2 were transferred to
Component 1 to finance additional municipalities and to Component 3 which would now
include State Subprojects, as described below.

Monitoring and Evaluation Activities. The MOH aimed to strengthen the role of the
states to oversee, monitor and evaluate PSF performance, together with the Program's
linkages to upper level care (medium and high complexity services) through referral and
counter-referral systems.        This would be consistent with the Government's
decentralization policy that called for strengthening the stewardship role of the states
through the gradual transfer of M&E responsibility to them, and would fit well with the
objectives of Component 3 of the Project.          Additional funding provided for this
Component (and under the Loan), would be applied to two groups of activities: (i)
expansion of monitoring and evaluation activities already contemplated in the Loan
Agreement to cover the additional municipalities included under Component 1; and (ii)
strengthening of state capacity for monitoring and evaluation through co-financing Fund-
to-Fund, federal to state transfers--the State Subproject pool covering all of the 27 states.

Changes to Schedule I of the Loan Agreement. Schedule I to the Loan Agreement was
amended to reallocate funds among expenditure categories to reflect the changes in (a)
through (c) above, to increase the percentage of expenditures to be financed under the
Conversion Subprojects Category from 30 to 55%, and to include a new disbursement
category for the State M&E Subprojects.

Given the increase in the Project's scope, at the time of the Loan Amendment, total
project costs were estimated to increase from US$136 million to US$153 million. As a
result, the Government's counterpart contribution was expected to increase from US$68
million to US$86 million, resulting in an overall cost sharing of 56% (Government) and
44% (Bank).

1.7 Other significant changes

On November 30, 2005, the Bank agreed to extend the Loan's Closing Date by eighteen
months until June 30, 2007. This extension was needed to allow the Borrower additional
time to complete project activities which had suffered delays in view of implementation
issues that affected the Project from 2004 to 2005. (See Section 2.2 below).

On June 29, 2007, the Bank agreed to a reallocation of proceeds among expenditure
categories, mostly to reflect actual project expenditures.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes




                                           13

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The FHEP had the Government's full commitment: it was definitely the Government's
program, which the Bank was supporting with financial and technical assistance. The
FHEP aimed to support the Government's vision of a health sector that placed the highest
priority on quality basic health care, and rationalized, integrated financing and delivery of
services. The PSF had been a core element of the Federal Government's efforts since
1994 to improve primary care and raise per capita health expenditures by municipal
governments. Commitment by the Federal Government was strong for PSF expansion
into urban areas, given that this fit squarely into its main policy and programmatic
priorities. The PSF was the Government's leading priority for the health sector. It was
also seen as a strategically important project in the larger agenda of poverty reduction
which was an important focus of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (Section 1.1).

In broad sectoral terms, the FHEP addressed essential inputs for a better-functioning and
more responsive health system: (a) municipal capacity for the expansion of PSF and for
the organization and management of basic and higher-level health care; (b) the quantity
and quality of human resources for the delivery of basic health services; and (c) policy-
and program-relevant information and knowledge to improve the system's performance.
These inputs had been identified by the Government and the Bank as essential, high
priority areas where targeted actions, supported by strong policy and technical work,
would have large payoffs in improved performance and sustainability of the PSF and of
broader reform efforts.

The FHEP was designed, through each of its four components, to support activities that
would address each of these identified priority inputs, in addition to financing the
expansion of the PSF to urban areas. The FHEP's focus on urban areas was justified as
there was already substantial coverage among small municipalities with large rural areas;
MOH had focused PSF expansion there during the early stages of implementation. One
of the goals of the FHEP was to reach populations with limited access to and
underutilization of basic health services. As such, the urban focus of the FHEP was
appropriate since 38 percent of those in the poorest income quintile lived in urban areas,
and the health indicators among the urban poor were as bad as or worse than those of the
rural poor.

Project design also benefited from extensive consultations through workshops, group
discussions, and qualitative and quantitative assessments with families, community
agents, nurses and physicians. As an ongoing program, PSF implementation had already
been accompanied by a variety of consultations to influence the program. Additional
participatory evaluations were also held during preparation of the FHEP, specifically to
understand the factors that led to both successful and disappointing PSF implementation
experiences.

The selection of a three-phase APL as the lending instrument was appropriate given the
following considerations: (a) a long term horizon was needed to meet the Program's


                                              14

development objectives; (b) a sound sector reform program, developed by the
Government and reviewed by the Bank was in place; and (c) the Government decided
that it wanted to stage the PSF expansion and decentralization reforms due to the
complexity of the activities required and the need to pilot new arrangements that had not
been evaluated fully in the sector. The APL instrument was seen to be appropriate to
support an incremental approach to PSF expansion and sector reforms, while solidifying
long-term institutional and political commitment to the program.

While the Government could have implemented the FHEP without the Bank's financial
assistance, it sought the Bank's involvement to: (a) introduce output- and performance-
based approaches to the PSF implementation and expansion; (b) transform the existing,
primary care practices to the PSF model; (c) include implementation of the PSF in the
then recently approved decentralization reforms; and (d) develop and implement strong
monitoring and evaluation of the PSF's implementation.

In designing the FHEP, the Government and the Bank took into account lessons learned
related to: (a) evaluations regarding the performance of the PSF, which indicated that the
program had the potential to improve the coverage and quality of basic care, as well as
health outcomes in Brazil ; (b) international experience with the implementation of
primary care models which indicated that successful implementation of new primary care
models depended on major changes in the underlying incentives; and (c) the Bank's
previous experience in supporting Brazil's health sector, which suggested allowing for
flexibility, but within an agreed framework that emphasized results. The APL instrument
that was selected was particularly responsive to this lesson.

Perhaps the most out-of-the ordinary aspect of the FHEP's design, however, was the
Bank's unrelenting efforts during preparation to customize the loan's fiduciary
arrangements to respond to the needs of this middle income client. The Government had
sought a special funds pooling arrangement together with innovative fiduciary features
that would allow the Bank's financial assistance to be channeled to the PSF for
Conversion Subprojects through its existing federal-to-municipal grant system, following
its internal procedures. To respond to this request, the FHEP introduced three innovative
fiduciary features:    (a) extension of the period (to one year) for which advances
(disbursements) would continue to be made before the eligibility of expenditures were
reconciled through Project Monitoring Reports (PMRs); (b) loan proceeds would finance
30 percent of the Conversion Subproject Pool, instead of 30 percent of each expenditure
transaction, as is the normal practice; and (c) application of national rules for the
procurement of small packages of goods and works, with compliance assessed on an ex-
post basis. During preparation, the Bank identified the potential risks of the FHEP's
funds pooling mechanism, and agreed with the Borrower on a comprehensive set of
arrangements and requirements to mitigate those risks.

Because it supported a large government program, the FHEP by design was large in
scope, and ambitious. However, the Bank had a strong relationship with the MOH, and
detailed knowledge of sectoral issues through a sustained program of support over the




                                          15

years to Brazil's health sector. Likewise, the MOH had staff at the federal level with
extensive experience in managing Bank-assisted projects.

The main implementation risk related to the variability of institutional capacity among
the municipalities that would participate in the FHEP, but the Project's design
incorporated mitigation measures that would address this risk. The inclusion of State
Subprojects also brought similar risks associated with varied levels of institutional
capacity among the states.

2.2 Implementation

Following the approval of the US$68 million loan by the Bank's Board of Directors on
March 14, 2002, the Project was well advanced to start implementation. A draft of the
Operational Manual, the guidelines for selection of municipalities to be included under
Component 1 and detailed implementation plans for each of its components, were nearly
completed. Soon after effectiveness on December 13, 2002, the MOH began considering
expanding the number of municipalities participating in this first phase of the FHEP, but
reductions in budget allocations to address fiscal constraints affected initial
implementation.

The change in the Government administration in early 2003 brought renewed and
strengthened support for expansion of the PSF, which the new administration embraced
as one of its main policy initiatives. Because of this, the Minister of Health immediately
requested an amendment to the Loan Agreement in order to expand its coverage to all
urban municipalities in Brazil. The Government and the Bank began discussing the
scope and content of an amendment to reflect the new Administration's priorities.

The loan amendment described in Section 1.6 was approved in August, 2004, after
detailed analysis and review by both the Government and the Bank. Implementation of
the FHEP, however, was not accelerating. By end-2004, about US$17 million had been
disbursed, all for transfers under Component 1 for Conversion Subprojects. By April
2005, with only nine months left before the Closing Date, and only about US$17 million
disbursed, it became clear that the high turnover of personnel in the Project Management
Unit (PMU) and in MOH's Family Health Department were taking a toll on
implementation. The high turnover had resulted in the depletion of experienced technical
and fiduciary staff capable of guiding project execution and providing the required
technical assistance to municipalities. The Government's decision to extend coverage of
the PSF to all urban municipalities with a population over 100,000 without strengthening
implementation capacity exacerbated the delays.

By the time of the Mid-Term Review in early March 2005, the Project was facing serious
implementation issues, and Implementation Progress, Financial Management, Project
Management and Procurement supervision ratings, along with ratings for all but
Component 3 had been downgraded to MU. The situation for Component 1, Family
Health Conversion Subprojects, was as follows: (a) only 29 of 177 municipalities had
registered 80% or more of the implementation funds received, most municipalities
reported less than 30%; (b) many municipalities were far from achieving the performance


                                          16

targets specified in the agreements signed with the MOH; (c) MOH had been providing
little or no technical and fiduciary assistance to high-risk, struggling municipalities and
states; (d) action plans for improving municipalities' procurement and financial
management capacity had not been prepared; and (e) the MOH had been lax in
monitoring municipal performance (technical or fiduciary) and in responding to requests
for assistance from the municipalities. The Government and the Bank agreed upon an
"emergency plan" to accelerate and improve the quality of technical and fiduciary
implementation and monitoring of this component. Implementation of the plan was to be
monitored by the Bank team on a quarterly basis, and the Component's rating would be
upgraded if all of the agreed items in the plan were under implementation.

Component 2, Human Resource Training and Formation, was no longer financed by the
Bank following the loan amendment, but was still a part of the FHEP. The Project's
original design called for the directing of project funds to Family Health Training Centers,
known as PSF Pólos. The new Administration eliminated the PSF Pólos and replaced
them with Permanent Education Centers which in principle were to respond to all of the
HR training and formation needs of the entire health system (not just those for PSF).
This transformation was still a work in progress at the time of the Mid-Term Review.
Municipalities felt that the new centers were either non-operational or did not respond to
their training needs. Some municipalities were developing and implementing their own
training programs, and the Government and the Bank agreed to develop a grant transfer
system (similar to Component 1) to support training and educational needs of those
municipalities with the capacity to develop and implement training programs.

Component 3, Monitoring and Evaluation, was the FHEP's technical "star".
Disbursements were low, but after months of delay the Government had approved the
amendment which would allow for the implementation of a grant transfer system to the
states to support monitoring and evaluation of the PSF--the State Subprojects. The
MOH team had completed complicated procurement to contract a number of academic
institutions to evaluate the PSF. It had also developed and tested an instrument to certify
the quality of the family health teams. The team was in the final stages of developing a
research and evaluation fund for family health.

Component 4, Project Management, was eventually financed entirely with counterpart
funds.

By June of 2005, with six months left to loan closing, it was not clear that the FHEP
would be able to meet its Development Objectives without a Closing Date extension,
which was difficult to justify without sustained improvement in the Project's
Implementation Progress. The Project's DO rating was also downgraded to MU. At the
time, however, there were positive signals that implementation was improving.
Improvement in implementation performance had occurred over the previous two months,
and the Government's team had been making steady progress towards fulfilling all of the
actions outlined in the agreed "emergency plan", which included: (a) a survey of
progress and problems in each of the municipalities, including progress on key
PDO/intermediate indicators; (b) based on the survey results, risk classification and



                                            17

implementation of an action plan to monitor progress; (c) contracting of technical and
fiduciary personnel to provide technical assistance to municipalities; (d) strengthening of
the fiduciary capacity of the PMU.

By September of 2005, the MOH had developed and implemented an array of technical,
operational, and fiduciary interventions to improve implementation. Most of the actions
specified in the "emergency plan" had been completed or were nearing completion.
These included: (a) hiring of 10 professionals for the PMU; (b) contracting about 35
consultants to support the MOH's Department of Basic Care in providing technical
assistance to municipalities and states; (c) targeting of 35 municipalities for technical
follow-up; (d) targeting of 16 municipalities (of the 35) for fiduciary follow-up; (e)
diagnosis by the MOH of the main difficulties faced by states and municipalities; (f)
reassessment of municipalities' and states' procurement and financial management
capacity; (g) establishment of state and municipal action plans that included technical
fiduciary and political actions; (h) training of PMU, municipalities' and states' staff in
operational and fiduciary procedures; and (i) conducting MOH-municipal/regional
workshops to assess and review technical and fiduciary issues.                At the time,
disbursements and the pace of disbursements had increased significantly, and the number
of municipalities that registered 80% or more of subprojects' execution increased from 29
in March to 69 in October. The Project's Implementation Progress rating was upgraded
to Satisfactory.

The MOH had overcome the main bottlenecks that affected the Project's implementation
in 2005: lack of personnel and leadership. The Project now benefited from a stable and
professional PMU, and although there was still room for improvement, technical
assistance to the states and municipalities had improved significantly, and operational and
fiduciary-related activities had progressed considerably. With improved performance,
and an 18 month extension of the loan's Closing Date, the prospects of the FHEP meeting
it development objectives had improved significantly.

At closing, $90,968.56 remained undisbursed in the loan account and was cancelled.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design of M&E. An important goal of the PSF program was to contribute significantly to
the strengthening of the Basic Health/Family Health Program (Atenção Básica/Programa
Saúde da Família) (AB/PSF) information and M&E systems and thus improve municipal
performance and the performance of individual family health providers. In fact, the
development of strong and effective monitoring and evaluation systems and capacities
was very much an integral part of the FHEP's design.            In the First Phase FHEP,
Component 3, Monitoring and Evaluation (Section 1.5.), was designed to strengthen the
PSF's monitoring systems, and support the evaluation of the PSF's implementation and
the accreditation of the family health teams, facilities and training institutions. It would
also support the establishment of a Research and Evaluation Fund that would promote
and stimulate research and evaluation related to the PSF or other broader health care
topics, while developing the capacity of researchers on those subjects. M&E for the
Project itself, was designed to depend on, improve and expand the existing AB/PSF


                                           18

M&E system, making it an important vehicle to monitor progress in achieving desired
outcomes, as well as to build performance criteria into the PSF's design.

Indicators used in the AB/PSF information system were developed by the PSF to monitor
municipal performance and progress in attaining desired health goals. There were 50
indicators, most of which assess the impact of the AB/PSF programs on health outcomes.
However, the national system did not include the output and process measures needed for
downstream municipal decision-making to improve performance.                    Although
municipalities were responsible for PSF implementation and management at the local
level, few if any had developed M&E systems to measure providers' performance. The
FHEP aimed to support strengthening of municipalities' capacity to monitor PSF
performance and utilized information for effective management of the program.
Municipal data was to be transmitted to the national AB/PSF M&E system for
consolidated monitoring and evaluation of the PSF and the Project's MIS. The First
Phase FHEP aimed to lay the groundwork for the implementation of information systems
that were necessary for the municipal health system to assess the performance of their
providers, and for the Project and the national MOH to evaluate management by the
municipal health systems.

The FHEP was designed to develop capacity at the municipal level to provide good
quality information for use in evaluation, and then use that information for purposes of
evaluating the Project. The goal was a sustainable system that provided the municipal,
state and national managers with the information they needed to evaluate the impact of
the AB/PSF program on health outcomes.

In the FHEP's first phase, studies were to be carried out evaluating 50% of the PSF teams
and 15 training institutions. The findings of these studies were to be used as inputs for
the design of the M&E system, and for the expansion of PSF training. They would also
provide important information to focus greater attention on quality and accreditation of
both training institutions and PSF providers.

Because of the critical importance of monitoring and evaluation towards the
accomplishment of the PSF's objectives, activities aimed at strengthening the M&E
system were included as triggers in the APL series. Under the First Phase FHEP, the
M&E system for the PSF and the maternal and child care (MCH) referral-counter referral
network was to be developed, approved and tested. In the second phase of the APL, it
was expected that the M&E system for the PSF and the MCH referral-counter-referral
network was to be implemented in all participating municipalities. Finally, in a third
phase, the M&E system and the referral-counter-referral network (not just MCH) were to
be implemented in all municipalities. In addition to strengthening the PSF's M&E
system and providing a measurement of progress towards the accomplishment of the
FHEP's development objectives, the inclusion of monitoring and evaluation as a separate
and important component in the FHEP (Component 3) was imperative to support the
program's increasing focus on performance-based management and financing. Like
M&E, the APL program was to support a gradual roll-in of performance-based
management for the PSF over the APL's three phases. By then end of the three-phase



                                          19

FHEP, both performance-based management and monitoring and evaluation were to be
institutionalized in the PSF.

The FHEP also contemplated an impact evaluation at the end of the APL program, and
the first phase included financing for collecting and analyzing baseline indicators.
Because of the importance of having good data for an evaluation of the program in the
future, the availability of key baseline indicators in municipalities participating in the
First Phase FHEP was included as a trigger for the second phase.

Monitoring and evaluation of the FHEP's implementation obviously benefited from the
program's strong emphasis on M&E. Drawing on the logical framework, the Project's
MIS was designed to extract data on key indicators including inputs, outputs, processes
and outcomes. It would track compliance with training and population targets set for the
extension of coverage by the PSF, and the quantity and quality of the training and the
health care services provided. In Phase I, the Project's MIS also included monitoring
progress on several key health outcome indicators (including immunization, prenatal care
and hospitalization rates for ARI). The MIS would also permit monitoring the targets that
assess progress towards implementing stronger PSF information and M&E systems at the
municipal level.

M&E Implementation. Implementation of the Project's monitoring and evaluation was
closely linked to the progress with respect to project-financed M&E activities under
Component 3. From the beginning, Component 3 was the first to begin implementation.
As early as June, 2003, the Bank's Implementation Status Report (ISR) reports progress
on preparing the evaluation design and the corresponding baseline survey for
participating municipalities. Implementation of M&E was eventually affected by the
very same issues that affected overall project implementation:           (a) turnover of
experienced personnel in the PMU and the MOH's Family Health Department which, in
addition, made the process of providing technical assistance to the municipalities
difficult; and (b) the Government's decision to extend the PSF's coverage to all 231
urban municipalities without strengthening implementation capacity. The April, 2005
ISR reports that the MOH had been lax in monitoring municipal performance and in
responding to requests for assistance from municipalities. The challenge to the MOH of
increasing quality technical assistance to municipalities was only aggravated by the more
than five fold increase in the number of participating municipalities.

On the positive side, the MOH aimed to strengthen the role of the states to oversee,
monitor and evaluate PSF performance together with the Program's linkages to upper
level care (medium and high complexity services) through referral and counter-referral
systems. As this fit very well with the objectives of Component 3 and was consistent
with the decentralization policy that called for strengthening the stewardship role of the
states through the gradual transfer of M&E responsibility to them, the Government
requested that this be considered as part of the package of loan amendments being
discussed with the Bank at the time.




                                           20

The approved loan amendment took over nine months to be approved by the Government,
but eventually provided additional funding for Component 3 to apply to two groups of
activities: (a) expansion of monitoring and evaluation activities already contemplated in
the Loan Agreement to cover the additional municipalities being incorporated under the
Project; and (b) strengthening of states' capacity for monitoring and evaluation through
co-financing Fund-to-Fund, federal to state transfers. Regarding the latter, the MOH
requested the creation of a state Subproject Pool to finance M&E capacity building in all
of Brazil's 27 states.

While specific M&E activities implemented by the MOH directly under Component 3
were advancing (contracting of the baseline to evaluate the PSF, developing and testing
an instrument to qualify the family health teams), the lack of personnel to provide TA to
the municipalities in all areas, including M&E, continued to affect the availability of
quality data with which to monitor the FHEP. By mid-2005, the ISR rated Monitoring
and Evaluation as MU (although Component 3 was rated S). The Action Plan agreed
with the Government as part of the Mid-Term Review addressed this weakness. To
improve the Project's performance monitoring the Government was to provide a survey
of progress and problems in each of the municipalities, including progress on key
PDO/intermediate indicators in response to the Action Plan agreed with the Bank. With
this, and the overall turnaround in project implementation that resulted from the Action
Plan, project M&E improved significantly. Still, the Bank's ISR did not have available
information to measure progress towards accomplishment of the Project's Development
Objectives.

By project completion, the FHEP's monitoring indicators had been updated to align them
with MOH information systems. However, some clean-up was needed to ensure that the
reporting followed closely the indicators in the PAD. The final report, received in
October, 2007 provides an explicit assessment of whether an indicator was accomplished
or partially accomplished, and other relevant information. Performance assessment of
key outcome and intermediate results was made in terms of the base line. Output and
process indicators were compared to targets.

M&E Utilization and Sustainability. The Government's vision of the health sector--one
that has functional referral and counter-referral networks and induces continuous quality
improvement at all levels--depends on excellent monitoring and evaluation systems.
When FHEP was prepared, the lack of an evaluation culture, as well as shortcomings in
the methods and processes for monitoring and evaluation, were major constraints to the
development of a quality- and performance-oriented service delivery system. The Project
supported significant investments in developing these M&E systems, and establishing
systems for accreditation of family health units and training institutions. The PSF
monitoring system was developed, including the design of instruments and corresponding
indicators. A referral system for mother-child care was developed and implemented, and
a performance-based management system in support of PSF was developed and tested in
a sample of participating municipalities.




                                          21

The performance-based financing scheme consisted of two parts. The first involved a
bonus for municipalities that complied with three performance criteria: (i) execution of at
least 90 percent of funds received from the Project and according to approved
implementation plans, (ii) evidence of progress toward achievement of performance
indicators, particularly in terms of PSF coverage extension, and (iii) presentation of
accounting ledgers detailing expenditures for at least 75 percent of funds received.
Announced in mid-2005 and implemented in 2006, the bonus was distributed as a lump-
sum payment to thirty-five (of 187) participating municipalities. The bonus represented
50 percent of the value of each municipality's original grant. The second part consisted
of a "performance prize" based on three criteria: (i) that spending was aligned with
approved implementation plans; (ii) that the municipality attained PSF population
coverage of at least 70 percent; and (iii) that the municipality complied with fiduciary
benchmarks related to procurement and financial management. Twelve participating
municipalities received the prize in 2006, sharing R$6 million in additional transfers. The
prize was awarded during a formal ceremony attended by the federal health minister and
the mayors of the winning municipalities.

Although modest in scope, the above-described performance-based financing was the
first of its kind for the MOH. Despite initial resistance, it was well-received by the MOH
and participating municipalities. Significantly, the MOH has included a modified version
of the scheme in a recently approved policy (2006), known as Health Convenants (Pactos
de Saúde).       The Health Convenants link future federal financing to states and
municipalities to compliance with agreed benchmarks. The MOH transfers about ÜS$13
billion annually to the states and municipalities to support health service delivery.

The next phase of FHEP, currently under preparation, would support further
improvements in M&E at the municipal level, and strengthen further the state health
secretariats' capacity to conduct supervision, monitoring and impact evaluation. New
MOH regulations assign to states an increasingly important role in measuring results,
monitoring municipal performance and evaluating the impact of health delivery statewide.
They will also be responsible for increasing the supply and quality of health professionals
and para-professionals and providing technical and supervisory assistance to low-
capacity municipalities. More important, however, the next phase of the APL would seek
to implement a more robust results-based financing system, by linking levels of financing
to levels of performance in terms of coverage extension, quality improvement and
fiduciary performance. This arrangement would count on signed management contracts
that specify performance indicators, as well as spending and implementation plans.
Performance indicators will be updated frequently. Good monitoring and evaluation
systems, at all levels, are the backbone of the health sector's strengthened results focus,
and, therefore, prospects for their sustainability are excellent.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Perhaps the most innovative aspects of the FHEP were its fiduciary arrangements. First,
the Project adopted a pooled funding approach in which loan funds were pooled with
those of the Government to satisfy the Government's request that Bank financial
participation in the grant-based financing system through which the federal government


                                           22

finances health services managed by states and municipalities (known as fundo-a-fundo).
Initially, only the Subprojects under Component 1 operated in a pooled fashion. Later,
after the Loan Agreement was amended to provide financing to states under Component
3, a second state Subproject pool was incorporated.

The first phase FHEP also introduced innovative operational arrangements under these
pooled components, including: (a) financing a share of the government transfers for PSF
instead of a share of each transaction (as is normal practice); (b) disbursements against
Statements of Transfers issued by the MOH; (c) annual certification of expenditures by
states and municipalities through internal and independent audits; (d) the application of
national rules and systems for procurement and financial management; (e) the carrying
out of fiduciary risk assessments; and (f) strengthening of sub-national governments'
fiduciary capacity.    These innovative features facilitated the smooth flow of Bank
financing to municipalities, created a single oversight and reporting system rather than
parallel systems for Government and Bank reporting purposes, reduced the size of the
administrative personnel needed to follow fiduciary requirements and reoriented Bank
supervision to technical matters, including strengthening of the Government's fiduciary
framework.

Because of staff rotation, the significant increase in the number of participating
municipalities and the inclusion of the 27 states in pooled financing, fiduciary monitoring
took more effort than originally envisioned.       There were also occasional delays in
submitting required Project Management Reports, and clarifications on issues raised in
audit reports. A special Financial Management Supervision mission in April, 2007
confirmed that the Bank loan financed less than 30% of the Federal Government's 2003-
2006 financing of the PSF, and that the Bank's financing went for eligible expenditures
as approved in the yearly Plano de Operação Anual, or Annual Operating Plans
(including procurement plans) for each municipality and state, and was supported by
appropriate documentation. The mission also found that all states and municipalities
maintained an accounting and financial management system for the specific purpose of
recording PSF/FHEP information, and recommended that in the Project's future phases it
would be possible and even preferable to rely on the Government's existing financial
management systems.

The first phase of the FHEP did not trigger any of the Bank's Safeguard Policies. (At the
time, Bank practice was to classify health projects as environmental category C.)
Nonetheless, under Component 2, the Project financed the development of a national
strategy, implementation guidelines and manual and training modules to aid in the task of
managing the medical waste generated within the basic health care units. The Manual
and training modules were field tested with Family Health Teams in several
municipalities, and the program would be expanded in future phases of FHEP.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The PSF now has an established M&E system, with agreed monitoring indicators.
Baseline data has been compiled to allow impact evaluations that would provide feedback
of the program's effectiveness. The development and consolidation of a system of


                                          23

performance-based financing will ensure that resources are allocated efficiently, while
municipalities with less than satisfactory performance are provided support needed to
improve their implementation records.

Extending PSF coverage to urban municipalities is the Government's highest priority in
the health sector. Bank financing represents a fraction of the overall PSF budget. MOH
budgetary allocations to PSF have increased by 10 percent annually between 2001 and
2006. Finally, as coverage expands, the MOH has merged separate transfers for other
basic health care programs into a single block grant, increasing the likelihood of the
PSF's sustainability.

Bank financial support to the PSF was designed as a three-phase APL. Despite the slow
initial implementation of the First Phase FHEP, the Program in the end progressed well.
Preparation is well advanced for a US$83.45 million loan for the Second Phase FHEP.
The Government has already complied with the trigger indicators originally established
for moving to the APL's third phase.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PSF was at the time the FHEP was approved and still remains a high priority for the
Government today. The health status of Brazil's population has improved significantly
over the last 10 years: infant mortality has decreased by 47 percent in 14 years, mortality
rates from vaccine-preventable diseases in children are negligible and diarrhea diseases
are the cause of less than 7 percent of deaths among children under five years of age.
Still, significant health system issues remain. Substantial disparities still exist in health
status, health financing and service utilization among regions, states and municipalities,
income groups and between urban and rural areas. Also, Brazil's health care system,
where the Government is the predominant actor, remains hospital- and specialty-centered,
compromising the affordability and sustainability of the delivery systems. Only 45
percent of Brazilians have regular access to more affordable primary health care, and
coverage continues to be lower in large cities. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are
now the main cause of death and disease in Brazil, placing a significant impact on health
care costs and the economy. Quality of health care is generally unknown or low,
particularly in facilities serving poor populations. As the burden of NCDs becomes
greater, the need for greater interaction between different levels and components of the
health system increases, and a well functioning primary health care facility as the central
point from where other health facilities are referred becomes imperative.

The PSF continues to be the MOH's flagship program and main strategy for extending
primary care, defining health priorities and improving health outcomes. Although the
PSF now covers 45 percent of Brazil's population, coverage lags in the 250 large, urban
municipalities where about 60 percent of the country's population resides.              The
Government has set a national target of 50 percent of the population covered by PSF by
2008. As a result, the FHEP's objectives continue to be very relevant today, including



                                           24

the revision to the Project's scope which expanded greatly the number of municipalities
covered in the first phase.

Those objectives also continue to be aligned with the strategic pillars of the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy: equity, competitiveness and governance. They are also
closely aligned with the human development strategy for Brazil: (a) reducing poverty
and inequality; (b) contributing to Brazil's competitiveness/growth by improving the
efficiency of social spending; and (c) strengthening governance by introducing
accountability measures in the health sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The achievement of the Project Development Objectives and outputs under the First
Phase FHEP was satisfactory. Phase one of the FHEP extended the population coverage
of the family health model, established a federal transfer mechanism in support of
program-financed investments, established and implemented pre-service and in-service
training of family health professionals and para-professionals, development and tested a
performance-based financing and management system, designed a quality certification
system, strengthened the PSF's monitoring system, collected baseline data for subsequent
impact measurement in the future, and developed protocols for referrals and care
practices for PSF teams.

A detailed presentation of progress towards accomplishment of the First Phase FHEP's
Key Performance Indicators is provided in Annex 2, and summarized below in this
section.

Objective 1: Increase coverage of health services among populations in urban centers
with populations of 100,000 or greater, especially among those with limited access to
and utilization of basic health care, through expansion of and conversion to the PSF
approach, development of a referral and counter-referral system, and improvement in
the management and organization of basic health services.....

A couple of words explaining the achievement of the FHEP's PDOs are in order. First,
the first phase of the FHEP went well beyond what was originally expected in terms of
the Project's coverage, by expanding the number of participating municipalities from 40
to 187. The MOH had in 2003 requested that the coverage target be scaled down from 35
percent to 30 percent to reflect: (i) the large increase in the number of participating
municipalities; (ii) the heterogeneity of the newly expanded group of participating
municipalities; and (iii) removal of selection criteria for municipal participation (e.g.,
existing coverage, commitment, institutional capacity, etc.), opening up participation to
the universe of municipalities with populations greater than 100,000. Given this, it was
unlikely that the 35 percent target could be reached for the FHEP I, even if all of the
participating municipalities met exactly their individual targets. The Bank was unable to
agree to the requested reduction in the coverage target since achieving 35 percent
coverage was a trigger for phase two of the APL. In the end, the Project attained, on


                                              25

average, 34.4 percent coverage for all municipalities. With the quadrupling of the PSF's
targeted population base in FHEP I, the expansion of PSF definitely exceeded
expectations in terms of coverage of the PSF. With the original target of expanding
coverage to 35 percent of the population in 40 municipalities, the FHEP would have
benefited about 5.5 million persons. With the expansion of the number of participating
municipalities, and considering the actual expansion in coverage to reach 34.4 percent of
population in those 187 municipalities, FHEP I is benefiting about 28.9 million new
inhabitants.       Table 1 below presents the status of achievement of outcome/impact
indicators for the Project's first objective.

 1 It was not possible to monitor these indicators when the Project was expanded to cover 187 municipalities.
 Hospitals and specialty ambulatory units did not possess the information systems to determine where patients were
 referred. As the Project was originally conceived it would have been possible to modify information systems of 40
 municipalities, but not for the much large number included in the reformulated project. Instead, two indicators
 included in Conversion Agreements, that were used to monitor municipal performance were used to measure progress
 towards the expansion of the PSF referral system: (i) percentage of PSF teams which had implemented protocols for
 referrals and counter-referrals; and (ii) existence of appointment centers for specialized care referrals. See Table 2 in
 Annex 2 for progress towards achievement of the targets for these proxy indicators.
 2 This indicator was modified to measure visits by household teams on a monthly instead of yearly basis.
 3.This indicator was not monitored. Please see section 3.2 for an explanation.




                                                          26

In all, sixty-four percent of the 187 municipalities achieved or exceed the 35 percent
target. These results were especially remarkable given the following: (i) municipal
elections in 2004 affected mostly Component 1 of the Project, whose accomplishments
are reflected in the table above; (2) the indicators that measure coverage of selected
outputs in terms of total covered population (e.g., % pregnant women attended by PSF
teams receive tetanus vaccine) are affected not only by the number of outputs but also by
the denominator which increased presumably by expanding coverage to lower capacity
municipalities; (3) the dramatic increase in the number of PSF participants resulted in a
redistribution of the Program's available resources to a larger number of municipalities,
resulting in less funding being made available for investments; (4) there was tremendous
diversity among the participating municipalities (population, complexity of health system,
institutional capacity, epidemiological profile, and experience with the PSF)---in fact,
12% of the participating municipalities began PSF implementation within the last five
years.

During implementation of the FHEP it was necessary to adjust some of the monitoring
indicators, especially because of the added challenge of obtaining and monitoring
information from 187 municipalities as opposed to only 40 included in the original
project design. For example, it was not possible to obtain information to monitor the
indicators to measure progress towards the expansion of the referral system (Indicators 5
and 6 in Table 1 above). Instead, progress with the expansion of the referral system was
measured by the following indicators:         (i) percentage of PSF teams which had
implemented protocols for referrals and counter-referrals; and (ii) existence of
appointment centers for specialized care referrals, both of which were included in the
Municipal Conversion Agreements among the indicators that were used to monitor
municipal performance (see Table 3 below). Also, there were minor changes such as
measuring monthly, as opposed to yearly, household visits per PSF health team.

It was also not possible to monitor the indicator "Performance-based management
systems developed and piloted in each municipality to support PSF implementation", for
two reasons. First, the MOH first wanted to formalize a performance-based management
system with the municipalities for the delivery of PSF/AB services. This system, known
as the Basic Care Convenant (Pacto de Atenção Básica), was launched in late 2006. The
system consists of 30 indicators, including the 12 utilized in the first phase of FHEP. The
experience gained in the first phase regarding performance-based contracting (between
the MOH and participating municipalities) contributed to the development of the Basic
Care Covenant, which will have a national-wide coverage once it is fully implemented.
Second, the vast majority of municipalities did not have information systems to collect
and assess the date required for performance-based management of PSF teams. That
system, known as PROGRAB, a web-based system developed with support under the
FHEP I is now available to all municipalities. Phase Two of the FHEP will support the
implementation of PROGRAB as well as the establishment of performance-based
management systems in participating municipalities.

 Project's first objective:

 In addition to the indicators established in the PAD, individual Municipal Conversion
 Subproject Agreements included slightly different indicators that were monitored
 annually for each municipality.                  The Subproject Agreements also included trigger
 indicators for moving from one phase of assistance to the next (municipal conversions
 mirror the FHEP APL in that they would proceed in three phases). The consolidated
 information, from all 187 municipalities participating in phase one of the FHEP is

1 Based on 187 municipalities that implemented the coverage extension and conversion plans.
2 Target varied from 5 to 25 percent depending on municipal population size. Importantly, the baseline indicator at
project onset was 28 percent.
3This indicator was modified to measure visits by household teams on a monthly instead of yearly basis.
4 Target varied according to municipal population size.



 It is interesting to note the differences in results by classifying participating
 municipalities based on their populations, by their initial PSF coverage and indicators.


                                                        28

There are great disparities among the population of participating municipalities, some of
which have a little more than 100,000 inhabitants to others with more than 10 million.
Municipalities with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 inhabitants, which
represented almost 85 percent of the participating municipalities in FHEP I, had
surpassed the target of 35 percent coverage by 2004. The municipalities with larger
populations had greater difficulties in converting to the PSF since they needed to put in
place a much larger number of PSF teams to achieve the same level of coverage in
percentage terms. Still, these larger municipalities made a much greater effort to put in
place PSF teams, and they account for 22 percent of the population covered by PSF.

Achievements in the area of health service indicators, such as maternal and child health
(prenatal coverage) and reduction in hospital admissions for ARI and diarrhea were also
analyzed based on the level of PSF coverage in participating municipalities. For example,
municipalities with PSF coverage of over 60 percent showed the highest increase in the
number of mothers with 7 or more prenatal visits--12 percent, or six times more than the
average for all municipalities. The increase in the coverage of tetanus vaccination for
pregnant women was up to three times higher in municipalities with over 40 percent
coverage of PSF than the average increase for all participating municipalities.         As
expected, the average decline in hospital admissions for ARI and diarrhea was higher in
municipalities with greater PSF coverage. For example, municipalities with over 60
percent coverage reported a decline of hospital admissions for ARI and diarrhea of 15
and 7 percent respectively between 2003 and 2006, compared 2 and 4 percent for
municipalities with less than 20 percent coverage.         The weakest difference among
municipalities with different PSF coverage levels was evident in the indicator for
children's vaccination coverage, probably because of the already high baseline for this
indicator. In sum, increases in PSF coverage are strongly associated with improvements
in utilization (e.g., pre-natal visits) and results (e.g., vaccination coverage) as well as
quality of spending (e.g., reduction in hospital admissions for conditions sensitive to
primary care, such as ARI and diarrhea).

Objective 2: Improve the quality of family health service provision through developing
and strengthening in-service and pre-service training of human resources in the PSF
model.

Most of the outcome and output indicators with respect to improving the quality of family
health service provision through developing and strengthening in-service and pre-service
training of human resources in the PSF model were met or exceeded. It is expected,
therefore, that the actions towards accomplishment of these objectives were important
factors in producing the health results and outcomes among the population served by the
PSF. These results were impressive given that many municipalities had not initially
assigned priority to training activities for PSF health workers since these activities were
originally to be implemented at the federal level by the Pólos de Educação Permanente
em Saúde (PEPS). Further, in the end, these activities, although no longer financed by
the Bank loan after the restructuring in May 2005, continued to be an integral part of the
Project, and continue to be monitored closely.

An analysis of the training of staff involved in the implementation and coordination of
the AB/SF programs shows that while in 2003 less than half (48%) of those staff had
training in areas related to planning, management and health service organization and
delivery, that proportion had increased to 86% only two years after the start of project
implementation. Table 3 below shows the increase in the percentage of health care
workers with relevant training from 2003 until 2006.

Among the PSF teams, almost 93% of the doctors and nurses working for the Program
for more than six months had been trained in at least two of the following strategic areas
of the AB:     women's health, children's health, tuberculosis control, elimination of
leprosy, hypertension control, diabetes control and dental health. By mid-2006, 85% of
the participating municipalities had developed PSF training programs and only 11% of
them had not developed their own programs and, therefore, still depended on the states'
training programs or that of the Pólos.

Tables 3 and 4 in Annex 2 present the status of achievement of outcome/impact and
output indicators related to the Project's second objective.

Objective 3: Improve the performance and effectiveness of basic health care services
through strengthening monitoring and evaluation, information management and
accreditation systems.

The FHEP made an enormous contribution to establishing and institutionalizing a culture
of monitoring and evaluation in Brazil's health system (Section 2.3). Not only did the
Project finance several activities to strengthen and improve monitoring systems, but it
promoted the decentralization of monitoring functions to the state level, and required the
use of detailed monitoring of project activities by both states and municipalities.

Eight different research institutions were contracted to carry out base line studies that are
needed for carrying out an impact evaluation of the PSF. Between 2005 and 2006, base
line studies were carried out for all 231 municipalities with a population of more than
100,000 inhabitants.

Some of the base line studies compared the two models of basic health (PSF and AB),
and revealed significantly better results for the PSF compared to traditional delivery
programs. For example, the base line for Sao Paulo included an analysis that compared
the two models of AB by applying the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT) in 384
health units.     The PCAT looks at eight different dimensions of primary care:
accessibility, entry point, link/relationship, range of services, coordination or integration
of services, focus on family, community orientation, professional training, which are
considered to be indicative of the overall quality of health systems. The results of the
analysis showed that at all levels, the PSF teams received better performance than the
traditional AB systems. In other municipalities in Sao Paulo, the base line revealed that
the in family centered models such as PSF, basic health services received higher coverage
and the capacity for delivering basic services was higher.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

An updated cost-benefit analysis was not prepared after Project completion, in part
because this is the first phase of a two phase program. The cost-benefit analysis that was
prepared during preparation considered savings in hospitalization, to be brought about by
improvements in the health system's efficiency, to be among the most important direct
benefits of the Project. These savings would be realized through two sources: First, the
Project was expected to result in reduced unnecessary hospitalizations due to greater
capacity to resolve medical needs at the local level, thus reducing system and self-
referrals to hospitals. Second, the Project was expected to reduce risk factors in the target
population that increase the demand for hospitalizations. In 2002, for example, the Bank


                                            31

estimated that 31 percent of all hospital admissions in SUS, representing 20 percent of
hospital spending, were for conditions that could be treated by an effective primary care
system     In all, the Project was expected to shift healthcare provision from expensive
hospitals to more efficient and higher quality primary care centers.

The expansion of primary care access reduces costly inefficiencies in the previous
hospital-centered delivery system. A primary care system, such as PSF, creates the
environment to adopt lower-cost, effective care, improve the efficiency of treatment
patterns through case management, and discourage incremental spending with no
apparent benefits. Finally, the PSF has been a pioneer in improving overall system
governance by specifying performance targets, linking financing to performance,
strengthening monitoring and promoting systematic evaluation, all of which are leading
to increased efficiency in Brazil's public health system.

Several studies have been performed to evaluate the PSF, according to the expected
benefits that were identified in the cost-benefit analysis. Drawing on longitudinal, state
and municipal panel data, recent research suggests that the PSF extension was associated
with improved health outcomes: (i) a 10 percent increase in state-wide PSF coverage was
associated with a 4.6 percent decrease in infant mortality (IMR) controlling for other
health determinants (Macinko et al, 2006); (ii) higher levels of PSF coverage at the
municipal level was associated with decreases in IMR, higher immunization rates and
pre-natal coverage and a reduction in hospital admissions (de Carvalho, 2005); and (iii)
higher municipal coverage was associated with lower admission rates for preventable
diseases in children (Sales and Gentile, 1998; de Carvalho, 2005). Comparative studies
of PSF vs. traditional basic care facilities found that the former outperformed the latter in
terms of service production, population utilization, supply of preventive activities, and
parents' reports on health status of infants (Facchini et al, 2006; Escorel, 2002). Finally,
based on interviews with a small sample of women, PSF and non-PSF units were
compared in terms of a subset of quality, access and effectiveness indicators. PSF
services were rated significantly superior in terms of access to vaccination coverage,
hospital maternity care, drug access, home visits and patient satisfaction (Mendes et al,
2004). Finally, inpatient treatment of stroke decreased in municipalities with high PSF
coverage from 52/10,000 to 38/10,000 (de Carvalho, 2005).3

It is difficult to estimate the administrative costs of a project that finances a government
program like PSF as implementation of the program is carried out by an existing
administration and staffing at the three levels of Government. Total recurrent costs of the
PSF financed by the MOH and by state and municipal governments increased from
US$885 million in 2002 to US$ 1,665 million in 2007. The Project itself contained

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The first phase FHEP's overall outcome is considered satisfactory based on the
Program's and the Project's continued relevance, the substantial achievement of its three
objectives, and the Project's efficiency and especially contribution to greater efficiency in
the health system, as described above.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

See Section 1.4.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The FHEP Program in general, and the First Phase FHEP, in particular, had an
exceptionally important institutional capacity focus. It was not a project to deliver family
health services only, but one that would improve substantially the Government's
capacity--at all levels--for delivering family health services in an effective and efficient
manner. Components 2 and 3 of the FHEP related directly to activities--training,
capacity development and M&E--designed to improve the states' and municipalities'
ability to deliver quality health services, and the federal and state governments' capacity
to monitor and provide assistance to the municipalities in the process. The Project laid
the groundwork for implementation of a new, performance-based system of allocating
scare resources, while contemplating vehicles for analyzing causes for lack of
performance and providing assistance to address identified issues.                  The Project
accomplished this successfully, not only as a result of the activities it financed, but also in
part from the different relationship that was established with the client, in which its
budget, financial management, procurement and disbursement systems were found
acceptable for purposes of the Bank's fiduciary requirements. As a result of this, the
Bank's direct technical assistance for purposes of addressing financial management and
procurement issues had an impact on the financial management and procurement systems
applicable to the whole of the PSF.

By design, the PSF is intricately woven into a well-established and extensive
participatory process in the health sector. In addition to the priority assigned by the
MOH, the PSF has been discussed and endorsed by stakeholders through consultative
mechanisms, including national, state, municipal and local health councils (to secure
client inputs) and the Intra-governmental Management Commissions (to secure inputs
from federal, state, municipal health authorities and staff. Basic health priorities and
corresponding indicators in the PSF resulted from a series of consultations with state,
municipal and local health councils during 2000 and published by the MOH.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

The risk to development outcome of the FHEP is negligible to low.

The Project--and the APL program--was designed to support and help expand and
improve an existing Government program, the PSF. The institutional structure and
improvements in areas such as financial management and monitoring and evaluation
were not specific to the FHEP, but to the PSF program as a whole. The FHEP assisted to
improve the design and implementation of the PSF program as a whole, and these
improvements are expected to be maintained and even deepened.

The PSF is likely to be sustainable in the long run due to the high level of ownership
from all stakeholders, and the significant political and financial investment that has been
made. The PSF counts on governmental support at all levels. It is one of the largest,
federally-funded health programs, spending about US$750 million in 2004, representing
5.6 percent of total federal expenditures for health and 12 percent of transfers to the sub-
national level. Between 2002 and 2004, federal financing increased by 75 percent,
demonstrating continuing federal support. Depending on the level of coverage and
population, municipalities contribute and additional 10 to 15 percent. More recently,
eight states have created special programs to finance PSF extension.

By design, the PSF is intricately woven into a well-established and extensive
participatory process in the health sector. In addition to the high priority that the MOH
assigns to the program, the PSF has been discussed and endorsed by stakeholders through
consultative mechanisms, including state, municipal and local health councils.

As it finances basic health care needs of the population, it is difficult to imagine that a
political change would affect the priority that it assigned to the PSF.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Highly Satisfactory


                                           34

The Bank's performance at ensuring quality at entry is considered highly satisfactory.
The Project, and the APL program, was designed to support and improve an existing,
priority government program as opposed to a specific project. Its design ensured that the
Bank's assistance fit within the framework of the Government's existing PSF program.
The FHEP addressed the Government's health sector strategy and priorities and it
supported correctly the Project's/Program's clearly defined objectives by including not
only components that addressed the target population's health care services, but also
components that centered on improving the PSF's implementation efficiency and
sustainability. Since monitoring and evaluation was central to a well-performing results-
based financing system to which the Borrower aspired, the Bank incorporated within
FHEP financing a component aimed at developing and implementing cost-effective
monitoring and evaluation of the PSF. The Bank's financial assistance was tailored to
respond to the Government's request that the Bank agree to rely, to the extent possible,
on the Government's own financial management and procurement rules, while
strengthening and improving them in the process to comply with the Bank's fiduciary
requirements. The skill mix and the continuity of the Bank's preparation team were
correct, and because of the emphasis on innovative fiduciary practices, included several
experts in this area.

The cost of project preparation was high and well above norms largely because of the
innovative features of the Bank's loan which required active involvement of several
fiduciary specialists throughout preparation. The preparation team needed to evaluate
thoroughly the Government's existing financial management and procurement systems
and design the Bank's loan instrument and project management, monitoring and
supervision systems in a manner that responded to the client's request for using their
systems while complying with Bank policies and requirements.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during supervision was satisfactory. The design of the FHEP
involved a new, more responsive way of supporting a governmental program in Brazil,
with potentially high rewards in terms of leveraging Bank finance to achieve results on a
broader scale. After a detailed preparation phase, the Bank's supervision effort would be
central to ensure responsiveness to this new assistance modality. In part because of this,
the Bank's TM, who had been involved with project preparation since its start, was
decentralized to the Bank's Country Office in Brasilia. Together with specialist fiduciary
staff and an Operations Officer, also based in the Country Office, the definition of Bank
supervision took on a new meaning. In addition to the formal twice-yearly supervision
missions, Bank staff was available on a just-in-time basis to assist the MOH in addressing
implementation issues as they arose. Bank supervision was limited not only to working
with the MOH, but also to supervising and working with several states and municipalities.
The Bank's reporting and fiduciary arrangements relied largely on the Government's
systems, and financial management and procurement specialists were responsible for the


                                              35

supervision of their respective fiduciary aspects. As a result, the Bank's Task Manager
was able to devote a much larger effort on supervising the Project's technical aspects and
providing technical advice to the client on sectoral issues. The Bank's supervision team
showed tremendous flexibility and responsiveness in restructuring the Project to respond
to the new Administration's priority of extending the PSF to all large, urban
municipalities, providing greater involvement of the states in M&E activities, and
adjusting the Project's financing correspondingly. When implementation issues arose as
a result of this and staffing issues, the Bank's supervision team was able, working in
close coordination with the client, to turn around a project that was already in "problem"
status and well on its way to fail in achieving its development objectives to one that made
a major impact in Brazil's health sector, and on Bank's modality of support to the sector.
Because of the Project's reliance on Government fiduciary systems, supervision of the
Project's financial management and procurement became important to meet the Bank's
fiduciary obligations. When minor fiduciary issues arose, the Bank mounted special
missions by procurement and financial management experts to address identified issues
and ensure that existing arrangements were in place to avoid similar issues in the next
phase of the Bank's assistance to the FHEP. The Project's supervision ratings were
generally appropriate, although the Implementation Status Reports could have been a bit
more explicit on the minor fiduciary issues that were encountered.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

For the reasons described in section (a) and (b) above, the Bank's overall performance
can be considered satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Government's performance is considered highly satisfactory. The Government was
very supportive of project preparation efforts, and had a critical role in requesting that
Bank assistance be provided through the framework of the Government's existing
program, utilizing its systems to the extent possible, and including a strong emphasis on
monitoring and evaluation, and a move towards performance-based financing. The
Bank's loan was approved less than a year before a change in Government administration.
Still, the Bank's loan became effective in about nine months, which is considered
reasonable given the average time it takes for most loans to become effective during even
non-electoral periods (since loans require Congressional approval). Counterpart funding
became in issue towards the middle of 2003, largely due to fiscal constraints that
emerged at the time. Once the new Administration came into office, these issues were
addressed, and the Government reaffirmed its priority not only to providing continuity to
the PSF, but more importantly, to providing increased financing to the program and
expanding its scope significantly.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance



                                           36

Rating: Satisfactory

The Implementing Agency's performance is considered satisfactory. From the start, the
MOH sought a strong partnership with the Bank to support its flagship PSF Program.
With the change in Administration, and a redefinition of its priorities, the MOH worked
closely with the Bank to restructure the Bank's financial assistance in a way that
capitalized on the value of the Bank's technical advice as well. It took some time for the
MOH to specify the details of the proposed loan amendment, and secure its approval by
the Government. Still, because of the priority it assigned to the new project focus, the
modifications in the amendment were being implemented by the MOH well before the
amendment was countersigned by the Ministry of Finance. With a greatly increased
number of urban municipalities participating in the PSF, of varying institutional
sophistication, the MOH began to encounter implementation difficulties. At the same
time, the high turnover of personnel in the Project Management Unit and in the MOH's
Family Health Department resulted in the depletion of experienced technical and
fiduciary staff capable of guiding project execution and providing the required technical
assistance to the municipalities. Faced with the reality that implementation was faltering,
the MOH worked closely with the Bank to define an action plan to accelerate and
improve implementation, and complied fully with each of those actions, as agreed. The
MOH's support to the development of a strong program of M&E for the PSF was evident
throughout the Project, and was an instrumental factor in modifying and improving the
performance and results focus in the Ministry itself and among the states and
municipalities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

For the reasons described in section (a) and (b) above, the Borrower's overall
performance can be considered satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The pooled funding approach that was adopted as a design feature of the Bank's
financial support to the FHEP offered several advantages that make the approach worth
replicating, given similar conditions. The pooled funding approach: (i) allows for a
single procurement, financial management and disbursement system, which reduces
transaction costs of Bank financing and ensures that support under a project for
improving those systems results in improvements to the Government's systems; (ii)
directs Government and Bank efforts to technical and fiduciary oversight, monitoring and
strengthening of the larger Government program rather than ring-fencing a much smaller
Bank-financed project; (iii) allows the Bank's technical specialist(s) to focus technical
advice during supervision on technical aspects, while financial management and
procurement specialist address compliance with the Bank's fiduciary requirements; (iv)
inserts the Bank-financed project into a high-priority programmatic and policy
framework; and (v) creates the vehicle to link both Government and Bank financing to



                                           37

results. In effect, the pooling approach under the FHEP benefited both the Government
and the Bank by redefining a partnership to focus on results.

The inclusion of a very large number of municipalities with varying institutional and
technical capacities offered many lessons. First and foremost, it is necessary to have in
place both monitoring systems with a defined number of easily verifiable indicators to
monitor and assess performance and technical assistance arrangements in the form of a
permanent cadre of central- and state-based technical and fiduciary personnel to provide
support to the municipalities, especially those with lower capacity.           To determine
municipalities' capacities, it is necessary to conduct in-depth technical and fiduciary risk
assessments and categorize municipalities according to technical and institutional
capacity to plan, supervise and monitor family health care. Based on these assessments,
it is important to craft customized plans and interventions to: (i) extend services; (ii)
strengthen planning, management and supervisory capacities for primary care; (iii)
strengthen fiduciary capacity; and (iv) support municipalities with change management.
As a result of these assessments, management and fiduciary improvement components
should be introduced in state and municipal plans. Also, eligibility criteria should be
established for continued participation in the program, and special support mechanisms
should be introduced for municipalities with low capacity.

The First Phase FHEP also provided important lessons on technical design issues for
this particular model of family health program, especially in a decentralized
environment. For the program to be successful, it is important to strengthen the capacity
of family health teams to respond to patient demand. For this, in coordination with the
states, the program should develop and implement a human resources action plan that
fosters the stability and sustainability of family health physicians. Also, the program
should strengthen interventions to; (i) expand quality certification systems applied to
municipalities and family health teams, based on results of a quality assessment
instrument; (ii) integrate the family health program into municipal policy making and
planning; (iii) implement network arrangements that link family health teams to
diagnostic and specialized care centers as well as logistic and transport systems; (iv)
promote healthy behaviors and integrated management of chronic diseases; and (v)
improve the availability of essential pharmaceuticals for poor populations.

A final lesson is that it would be useful for large programs that are implemented among
three levels of government, such as the PSF, to establish a mechanism to facilitate the
stability of personnel at the federal level that are hired to provide technical assistance
to states and municipalities. This may be difficult to ensure given staffing changes
resulting from changes in administrations and other reasons. Still, it might be possible to
issue a contract, for the duration of the program, with a private firm or academic
institution to recruit, hire and pay the personnel that will be providing technical assistance.

1It was not possible to monitor these indicators when the Project was expanded to cover 187 municipalities. Hospitals and specialty
ambulatory units did not possess the information systems to determine where patients were referred. As the Project was originally
conceived it would have been possible to modify information systems of 40 municipalities, but not for the much large number
included in the reformulated project. Instead, two indicators included in Conversion Agreements, that were used to monitor
municipal performance were used to measure progress towards the expansion of the PSF referral system: (i) percentage of PSF
teams which had implemented protocols for referrals and counter-referrals; and (ii) existence of appointment centers for specialized
care referrals. See Table 2 in Annex 2 for progress towards achievement of the targets for these proxy indicators.
2This indicator was modified to measure visits by household teams on a monthly instead of yearly basis.
