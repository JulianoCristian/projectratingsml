Project (FHEP), an operation under an Adaptable Lending\n            Instrument (APL) in three phases of three, two and two years\n            each, seeks to improve utilization and quality of\n            publicly-financed health services. The project has three\n            main components. The first component expands coverage of the\n            government's Family Health Program (Programa de Saude\n            da Familia, or PSF) in about 100 large municipalities,\n            establishing well-articulated referral and counter-referral\n            systems, and introducing performance-based financing and\n            management arrangements. The second component establishes\n            family health as a core element of health professional and\n            para-professional training. The third component strengthens\n            the health ministry's capacity to monitor and evaluate\n            PSF health services, policies, and training activities on a\n            systematic basis."}, "docdt": "2002-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
