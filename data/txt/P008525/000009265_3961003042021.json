A policy framework of systemic and\n            structural reforms has been developed with the assistance of\n            the Bank in the following areas: enterprise reform\n            (including privatization), procompetition and anti-monopoly\n            policies, financial sector reforms and establishment of a\n            social safety net."}, "docdt": "1992-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
