Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project's main objectives are:(i) to increase the agricultural productivity of about 0.8 million feddans of irrigated land by improving drainage
 conditions through evacuation of excess irrigation water with subsurface drains into existing open drains; and(ii)to avoid yield and production losses
 on this land, which would result if waterlogging and soil salinity problems were to persist.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?
 Yes

 Board Approved Revised Project Development Objective (If project is formally restructured)PHRPDODEL
 1) Increase the efficiency of drainage of about 1 million feddan of irrigated land, (2) increase agricultural production and improve rural income, and
 (3) to identify and oversee the resolution of environmental issues resulting from the discharge into the open drains of untreated industrial and
 domestic waste water in the project area.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project is scheduled to close on March 31, 2015. The recent mission (conducted during Feb. 15-22, 2015) has initiated the ICR (Implementation
 Completion and Results Report) preparation process.
 The original project successfully completed all project activities, fully achieved its PDO, and disbursed 100% of the IBRD loan proceeds (US$ 50.0
 million equivalent).
 Under the AF (US$ 30.0 million equivalent), overall project implementation continues to improve. About 81 percent of the project target area (of 90,000
 feddan of subsurface drainage improvements) has been completed, benefiting about 75,747 farm families. In terms of financial progress, over 85
 percent of the loan proceeds has been committed and about 57 percent disbursed. It's projected that by end of the project, the disbursement will
 increase to 70%, leaving about 30% of the loan undisbursed. Contract management continues to be a challenge. Despite best efforts by the project
 team and repeated reminders, some contractors (especailly those state-owned companies) are still poorly performing, with 11 contractors reported as
 having made no progress since September 2014. Additionally, major goods tenders have also been cancelled at the last minute. As a result, a total of
 about US$ 9 million of the loan proceeds (30%) will likely be undisbursed by the project closing date. The Government has proposed various options to
 fully utilize the loan including procuring raw material (PVC powder) and spare parts for pipe factory, machinery and plants. Unfortunately, some of the
 requests could not be supported as the proposed activities were judged to have no signifcant contribution towards achieving the PDO. For some other
 activities to which the Bank agreed to support in principle, due to lack of proper planning, the tenders were cancelled at the last minute due to shortage
 of time available for complete delivery of the goods.
 Moreover, the sustainability of the MIS (management information system) which is a critical component of the overall drainage improvement program
 in Egypt, in which the Government has already spent over 10 million Egyptian Pounds from the project is in great danger unless urgent decision is taken
 to upgrade the sytem. The recent World Bank mission advised the Government to urgently upgrade the MIS.

 Overall Comments
 The additional indicators included at the project restructuring in March 2013 such as the reduced response time to emergency drainage reports
 are no longer relevant as most of the activities anticiapted for implementation at the time were not implemneted due to poor planning and
 procurement delays.
