F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (PDOs)
The objectives of the Project as per the original Loan Agreement are: (a) to increase the
efficiency of drainage of about 0.8 million feddans of irrigated land; (b) to increase
agricultural production and improve rural income; and (c) to identify and oversee the
resolution of environmental issues resulting from the discharge into the open drains of




                                             ii
untreated industrial and domestic waste water in the project area.1
Revised PDOs2 are to: (a) increase the efficiency of drainage of about 1 million fed of
irrigated land, (b) increase agricultural production and improve rural income, and (c)
identify and oversee the resolution of environmental issues resulting from the discharge
into the open drains of untreated industrial and domestic wastewater in the project area.

 There were some inconsistencies in the wording of the objectives in the original project documentation.
These are described in Annex 7. At the time of the Additional Financing, consistency was ensured.

2The revised PDOs under the AF reflect the increased scope in terms of targeted area but otherwise remain the same.
For this reason, the ICR team does not consider the PDO revision as substantial and does not include a split evaluation.

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal
1.       After the construction of the Aswan High Dam in 1965, the Arab Republic of Egypt moved
to year-round irrigation, with crop intensities close to 200 percent, while the natural drainage
process historically provided by fluctuation of the Nile’s level between summer and winter was
lost. Recognizing the urgent need for effective drainage to mitigate the risk of waterlogging and
salinization, since 1970 the government of Egypt (GoE) adopted a strategy to provide and maintain
all the cropped lands with artificial drainage systems. Drainage projects were included in all of the
earlier and current Five-Year Development Plans.

          Note: * Egypt’s First Five-Year Plan started on July 1, 1982.
2.      The World Bank (IDA and IBRD) involvement started in December 1970 with the Nile
Delta Drainage I Project. Subsequently, five more projects were approved for drainage
development. The total area supported by the Bank before the start of the Second National
Drainage Project (NDPII) was 3.32 million fed for open drains, 3.21 million fed for new subsurface
drains, and 0.15 million fed for renewal and rehabilitation of malfunctioning subsurface drains. A
feddan (Arabic: ‫دان‬ّ ‫ف‬, faddān) is a unit of area used in Egypt, Sudan, Syria, etc that means 'a yoke
of oxen': implying the area of ground that could be tilled by them in a certain time being equivalent
to 60 meter × 70 meter or 4200 square meters (0.42 hectares). The IDA/IBRD participation in the
drainage program helped attract the support of other donors, such as the United States Agency for
International Development, the German bank for international development financing
(Kerditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau [KfW]), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European
Investment Bank (EIB), and the Islamic Development Bank. The Dutch bilateral program also
made important contributions.

3.      NDPII was the second time slice of the government's National Drainage Program. The first
time slice (1992–2000) consisted of about 0.7 million fed of subsurface drainage and 0.51 million
fed of open drains, financed by the World Bank, with co-financing from KfW and the Netherlands.
The NDPII project supported the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objective of raising rural
incomes through diversified agriculture based on efficient and environmentally sustainable use of
land and water resources, with emphasis on irrigation and drainage (I&D) infrastructure as
principal vehicles for encouraging sustainable agricultural development, reducing rural poverty,
and ensuring the well-being of the rural population. The project also supported the CAS objective


                                                       1
of developing human resources through the provision of training and technical assistance (TA) to
the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP).

4.       NDPII (total budget US$278.4 million; Bank contribution US$50 million) start date was
June 5, 2001 as part of a multi-donor effort including EIB, KfW and the Netherlands. Their parallel
funding had grant aspects that could focus more on the institutional aspects. KfW focus was mainly
in the issue of attracting private sector for the plastic pipe factories (pipes are needed for subsurface
drainage and were/are owned by EPADP) while the Netherlands focused on a training program for
EPADP staff.

5.       The EPADP was selected as the implementing agency4 as it is the Agency in charge of
drainage in Egypt. The EPADP is a large semiautonomous organization established in 1973,
employing more than 20,000 persons. It was and still is responsible for the design, procurement,
and implementation of all drainage works, as well as maintenance of drainage systems in all of
Egypt. In most countries, irrigation and drainage services are managed by the same agency. Egypt
is a rare case where there is one institution for irrigation and another for drainage. This
organizational set up stems from the essential role played by drainage in the Nile delta and the
importance of managing drainage well to prevent salinization. The EAPDP enjoys a good
relationship with other government agencies (the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation
[MWRI], Ministry of Finance [MOF], and Ministry of Environment). In the field, the EPADP was
at the time of appraisal and still is structured into five regional sectors5. Each regional sector has a
number of general directorates. The regional sector office coordinates, awards contracts, and
follows-up on implementation. The general directorate level is where most of the field works are
implemented on the ground. The EPADP owns and operates seven plastic pipe production factories,
geographically distributed over the country, with a unit at the Cairo office responsible for
procurement of raw material and spare parts together with coordinating production according to
the demand.

1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators
6.      The project's main PDOs as stated in the Loan Agreement: The objectives of the Project
are: (a) to increase the efficiency of drainage of about 0.8 million feddans of irrigated land; (b) to
increase agricultural production and improve rural income; and (c) to identify and oversee the
resolution of environmental issues resulting from the discharge into the open drains of untreated
industrial and domestic waste water in the project area.

7.     There were discrepancies in the PDO in the original package – see a detailed explanation
in Annex 7.



4
  The organizational structure of the EPADP consists of several central directorates at the Cairo Headquarters Office,
for Research and Design, Planning and Follow-up, Electrical and Mechanical Affairs, Sector Affairs, Management
Information Systems (MIS), Quality Control, Drainage Advisory Service, and Administration and Finance. Each
Central Directorate consists of a number of departments and units. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and
Environment Units operate under the Planning Central Directorate.

8.      The key performance indicators of NDPII were (a) water table lowered in project areas by
no higher than 1 m below ground level; (b) soil salinity reduced to below 4 mmhos/cm; and (c)
about 400,000 farm families benefited as follows: 25 percent benefited by year 3, 40 percent
benefited by year 4, 60 percent benefited by year 5, 80 percent benefited by year 6, and 100 percent
benefited by year 7.

1.3      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
9.      An AF to NDPII was approved on March 23, 2010, to cover the costs associated with
scaling up the activities and replicating the impact of NDPII to an additional 90,000 fed. The PDOs
were revised to: (a) to increase the efficiency of drainage of an additional 90,000 fed of irrigated
land to bring the total area improved under the project to almost 1 million fed; (b) to increase
agricultural production and improve rural income; and (c) to identify and oversee the resolution of
environmental issues resulting from the discharge into the open drains of untreated industrial and
domestic wastewater in the project area. 6

10.    The key performance indicators for the AF remained the same but the target values were
increased to reflect the scale up.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries
11.    The target population that would benefit from the NDPII project was originally identified
as about 400,000 farm households. It was based on the prevailing land ownership at the moments,
as most of the farmers in the project areas were small holders with an estimated average
landholding size of 2 fed. The target population benefiting from the AF was planned to be an
additional 45,000 households. The average farm size was later revised during project
implementation to be 1.5 fed, implying that the target population would be about 593,000 (for
890,000 fed) and 687,000 (for 1,030,000 fed) farm households. The final estimate of main
beneficiaries is 704,710 if considering only subsurface drainage. When considering beneficiaries
from open canals the number raises to more than 1 million beneficiaries (water users benefitted).

1.5      Original Components
12.      The original NDPII components were as listed:

      (a) Provision of new subsurface drainage for about 500,000 fed (US$147.00 million base
          cost), including 390,000 fed in the old cultivated lands, about 110,000 fed in recently
          reclaimed lands, and 10,000 fed of trenchless drains;
      (b) Renewal and rehabilitation of old malfunctioning subsurface drainage on about
          300,000 fed (US$40.69 million base cost) in areas already provided with earlier types of
          drainage systems;
      (c) Deepening and remodeling of open surface drains on about 365,000 fed (US$14.77
          million base cost), mostly in the project areas;


6
  The revised PDOs under the AF reflect the increased scope in terms of targeted area but otherwise remain the same. For this
reason, the ICR team does not consider the PDO revision as substantial and does not include a split evaluation.




                                                             3
      (d) Provision of materials, equipment, and spare parts (US$17.5 million base cost),
          including PVC/PE powder for a transitional period, emergency pumping equipment for the
          regional emergency centers, subsurface and open drain operation and maintenance (O&M)
          equipment, miscellaneous equipment, vehicles, and spare parts for the drainage program;
          and
      (e) Institutional support for the EPADP (US$10.43 million base cost) such as: (i) TA and
          training to assist the EPADP and the Water Boards Project to establish a pilot scheme for
          integrating I&D users’ associations in the two governorates of Kafr El Sheikh and
          Sharkiyah, covering areas not exceeding 2,000–3,000 fed each; (ii) TA and training in
          support of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP); (iii) support for farmers’ outreach
          and participatory activities; and (iv) supply of equipment, vehicles, TA and training to
          EPADP (M&E and O&M of drainage system).
1.6      Revised Components
13.    AF-NDPII was approved on March 23, 2010, to help finance the costs associated with
scaling up the activities of the project. The former Component 1 (subsurface drainage) and
Component 2 (open drain rehabilitation and remodeling) were merged into a new component
called Drainage Works. The activities, however, remained the same just increasing the amount of
works to reflect the scale up: (a) provision of subsurface drainage to an area of 35,000 fed; (b)
renewal and rehabilitation of old subsurface drainage in about 55,000 fed; (c) deepening and
remodeling of open surface drains in 20,000 fed; (d) procurement of machinery, equipment, and
spare parts; and (e) technical support to strengthen the EPADP’s capacity.

1.7      Other significant changes
14.    To help better coordination of the AF’s activities, two revisions to implementation
arrangements were proposed as follows: (a) to help coordinate the activities related to the civil
works within the EPADP, AF-NDPII proposed to assign regional project coordinators in each of
the 5 EAPDP regional offices (called sectors) to facilitate the flow of information and follow up
on the procurement and disbursement aspects of civil work contracts and (b) to improve project
coordination at the government level, the Ministry of International Cooperation (MoIC) requested
the establishment of a Project Steering Committee comprising representatives of relevant
departments from at least the MWRI, the MOF, and the MoIC.

15.     In March 2014, the AF was restructured and the loan agreement amended, to include: (a)
reallocation of loan proceeds among expenditure categories and (b) increase in the percentage of
expenditures to be financed under the loan from 65 percent to 85 percent. These changes were
expected to accelerate the implementation progress and disbursements, as well as improve the
likelihood of achieving the PDOs.

16.    The closing date was extended multiple times to accommodate the additional financing and
compensate for implementation delays (see data sheet), partly related to the events associated with
the Arab Spring.7



7
 The project’s original ending date was June 30, 2007, but in March 2006 upon the request of the borrower, the closing
date was extended to June 30, 2008, to ensure that all the project’s foreseen activities were completed and the

2.         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
17.     This section provides detail on the following elements of preparation, design and quality
at entry: (i) Relevance and Rationale for World Bank engagement; (ii) Knowledge base; (iii)
Design; (iv) Risk analysis; and (v) Implementation Arrangements.

18.      Relevance and Rationale for World Bank engagement: The World Bank’s engagement
in the drainage sector spanned over four decades, co-financing over six investment operations. The
level of the Bank’s engagement in the sector was evolving, from supporting infrastructural projects
at the beginning to financing a combination of infrastructural projects as well as institutional
capacity building, beneficiary participation, sustainability, and quality of service delivery aspects.
The project focused solely on drainage and was complemented by other projects in the Bank
portfolio that supported strengthening of irrigation services, agriculture extension and institutional
reform. The Bank played a lead role in coordinating other development partners and encouraging
co-financing of different activities, in particular the soft elements of the program. The project
design was focused and relevant to the context at appraisal. As designed the project would
contribute to resolving outstanding implementation as well as institutional capacity challenges
towards creating a capable and efficient drainage sector as well as support investments with
transformational impacts on the livelihoods of farmers and the nation’s economy more generally.
The approach taken by the project seems sensible to the ICR team.

19.     Knowledge base: The project preparation process included a series of surveys and studies
that helped in ensuring the soundness of background analysis, including: (a) project activities and
components; (b) estimated costs; (c) economic and financial analysis based on costs and expected
benefits; (d) procurement and disbursement arrangements; (e) institutional aspects and
implementation arrangements; (f) M&E; (g) farmers’ participation and integration of I&D user
associations; (h) social assessment, including issues of cost recovery and crop compensation; and
(i) EMP.

20.     Design: Earlier drainage projects provided experience and lessons that were effectively
taken into account in the design of NDPII, including the following:

      a)   A longer implementation period of six years was proposed to take into consideration the
           implementation speed experienced during the previous phase;

      b)   Particular attention was being paid to ensuring an effective start-up e.g. the PAD called
           for concerted efforts by the MWRI, EPADP, MOIC, and the Bank to accelerate the
           process of effectiveness;




objectives attained. Subsequently, the closing date was modified to accommodate for the Additional Financing. The
original closing date of the AF (March 31, 2013) was extended by two years to March 31, 2015.




                                                       5
   c)   There was a recognized issue with low efficiency in procurement of drainage plastic pipe
        from the existing Government production facilities. At project design, the Bank engaged
        an expert from the plastic pipes industry as a consultant to advise on privatizing the
        existing seven factories or finding other options for supplying the plastic pipes on a
        competitive basis. The consultant reviewed the situation, including the capacity, cost, and
        demand of pipes for the remaining part of NDPI and NDPII. Estimates were also made of
        the capital value of the assets. The project design appropriately proposed that the EPADP
        pursue actions to further improve efficiency and spur competition;

   d)   At the design stage, there was a need to continue improving efficiency and capacity
        utilization of project management. In response, the project included measures to
        strengthen EPADP and upgrade existing facilities (MIS, M&E Unit, and environmental
        monitoring unit [EMU]); and

   e)   The issue of crop compensation and the mechanisms by which payments were delivered
        were readdressed during appraisal of the NDPII. It was agreed that the EPADP would
        establish a pilot network linking the EPADP headquarters (HQ) to the five regions to
        ensure flow of accurate information about crop compensation and how it was carried out,
        as well as to have a monitoring system to correct problems in the compensation process.

21.     One shortcoming of the original design was the inclusion of objective 3 regarding
“environmental issues” without the resources and participation of other stakeholders foreseen in
the original design. Despite having achieved only marginally the environmental objectives under
the original phase (in terms of identifying and resolving the discharge of raw wastewater and solid
wastes in open drains), the approach and efforts under AF was not adjusted.

22.    Risk Analysis. Risks were appropriately assessed in the PAD and risk mitigation actions
were identified and recommended. Critical risks identified were: (a) inadequate drainage project
designs (rated low); (b) inadequate availability of O&M funds (rated low); (c) lack of cooperation
of farmers in participating in CUAs (rated moderate); and (d) conversion of public monopoly in
pipe production into private monopoly (moderate). The overall procurement risk was considered
low in the project design, assuming past experience of the EPADP in the Bank procurement
procedures established over many years of implementing similar projects.

21.     Implementation arrangements (including Safeguard and Fiduciary aspects). One of
the strengths of the project was that it was designed to be implemented by EPADP with its own
staff, providing greater assurances for effective capacity building and sustainability. As a
prerequisite for the proposed project, the EPADP established an Environmental Unit, whose
purpose was to coordinate environmental work carried out by the Drainage Research Institute
and/or other government agencies concerned with environmental issues. An important function of
this unit was to create environmental awareness among EPADP personnel assigned to the HQ and
regional field offices.

2.2.1   Implementation

22.    Start-up. The World Bank’s Project Loan Agreement was declared effective on June 5,
2001. The KfW Loan and Financing Agreement for NDP II was signed on October 3, 2001 and



                                                6
the Loan became effective in early November 2001, while the EIB Loan agreement became
effective on June 1, 2002. Initial implementation was smooth with the project making good
progress in preparing design works, in awarding contracts and in constructing drainage works.
Training of EPADP staff was undertaken (via the Netherlands grant until 2004). The studies on
the privatization of pipe factories and private sector participation were ongoing. Given the
availability of significant grant based technical assistance and capacity building support, the World
Bank financed project was focused primarily on physical infrastructure elements, although as part
of the broader program, the Bank actively engaged in the dialogue regarding the progress on
institutional elements.

23.     Mid Term Review (MTR) (2005). During the MTR, the positive progress in terms of the
infrastructure component was confirmed. The project was making good progress in preparing
design works, in awarding contracts and in constructing drainage works. The total awarded areas
for new sub-surface drainage were about 345,000 feddans (69% of the total proposed area), of
which about 240,000 feddans (49% of total area) were completed. The total completed
rehabilitation area stood at 77% of the total area with 99% of the total contracted. For open drains,
progress was equally satisfactory with about 285,000 feddans awarded (78% of total proposed
area) and 67% of the area completed. This compared well with the about 70 % of project
implementation time that elapsed between Loan effectiveness and closing dates. At the same time,
the delays in institutional progress were highlighted by the MTR and the urgency to address the
findings on the study on privatization was noted.

24.      Additional Financing (AF) (2008 onwards). Based on the good progress in awarding
contracts and in constructing drainage works (95% awarded and 85% completed of drainage area
and 127% awarded and 114% completed of area for open drains in the Aide Memoire of 2008),
initial discussions started for the identification of the AF. In 2010, an Additional Financing was
approved to scale up the successful experience. At the time, no major changes to the design of the
project was proposed as the project was technically sound with the subsurface drainage works
continuing to be based on high quality specifications and well established international practices.
The original phase had achieved much more than originally expected so it seemed sensible to
proceed. The institutional agenda was not in focus, particularly since another World Bank financed
project IIIMP (co-financed with KfW and The Netherlands) had come into the portfolio focusing
on resolving the longstanding institutional challenges in both irrigation and drainage sectors in an
integrated manner. Although institutional aspects were directly the responsibility of the TA
support from bilateral agencies, the AF may have been an opportunity to encourage stronger
linkages between the irrigation and drainage agendas.

25.     January 2011 and after. The AF was approved in March 2010, signed in June 2010 but
not declared effective until August 5, 2011. Due to parliamentary elections in 2010 and the turmoil
in early 2011, there were delays in effectiveness as well as in the first disbursement which was not
made until almost two years after AF approval in March 2012. The political turmoil of 2011 and
the following years also led to procurement and contract management delays, high turnover at
EPADP management and a more difficult context for the institutional reforms and lack of
resolution related for example to the pipe factories.




                                                 7
26.    The main issues (positive and negative) that have impacted the implementation are
presented below:

      Strong engineering capacity. The EPADP is a national agency specialized in drainage
       works for agricultural lands, with more than 40 years of experience. It was effective for
       implementing drainage infrastructure (Component I and II) at a very large scale. All the
       infrastructure targets were met or exceeded and the quality of works were generally very
       high.

      Low cost of drainage development. Drainage development in Egypt is at a cost of less
       than 1,000 US$/ha. This is particularly low considering the amount of works, leveling and
       pipes needed. Just as an example, in Sub-Saharan Africa irrigation development costs
       (similar type of works) are in the order of 15,000 US$/ha. The low cost of the drainage
       together with the key necessity in the delta (if not, the high groundwater table will salinize
       the soil and agricultural production will no longer be possible) makes drainage
       development an economically viable investment.

      Complementarity of donor financing. The donors were well coordinated and financed a
       complementary package of interventions including a KfW grant (1.8 US$ million) used to
       finance the establishment of Water Boards, to study the privatization of pipe factories and
       assess private sector participation in maintenance of the drains. The Netherlands grant (3.6
       US$ million) was established to pilot program in each of the five sectors, one directorate
       for conducting monitoring of maintenance activities, drainage performance and complaint
       management with the selection of two pilot areas.

      Plastic pipe factories. EPADP started exploring the interest and ideas of the private sector
       and the MWRI approved the EPADP’s request to start legal procedures for selling the pipe
       factories. In March 2003, an agreement was reached to transfer the factories to the newly
       established I&D holding companies as a first step toward full privatization. A study of the
       modalities of transfer and an assessment and evaluation of the pipe factories’ assets was
       carried out and the final report was ready by February 28, 2004. Upon examining the legal
       aspects, the state council ruled in 2006 that the transfer of ownership to the holding
       companies was illegal and would have detrimental consequences to the EPADP, involving
       high risk to future drainage projects. In October 2006, the GOE liquidated the holding
       companies. With this background, a high-level MWRI committee concluded that selling
       the factories to the private sector was not a valid option. Nevertheless, the EPADP accepted
       that contractors could supply plastic pipes from private companies but the capacity of the
       private local factories was limited to only about 8–10 percent of the need for 80 mm lateral
       plastic pipes (further details in annex 2). Thereafter, due to lack of funds to buy sufficient
       raw plastic powder (as the WB did not approve it) had effects on frequent unavailability of
       drainage plastic pipes contributing to project implementation delays. The reluctance within
       the EPADP to go ahead with privatizing the pipe factories came from: (a) the risk of cost
       escalation in the case of private sector monopolies who will control prices, a situation
       which may have serious implications on the project implementation and ultimately on the
       poor beneficiaries; and (b) the risk that the private sector will change the activity from pipe
       production to more profitable production or even shut down the factories and replace them



                                                 8
       with commercial or residential housing since most factories are close to or within urban
       areas.

      Subsurface drainage investments have a long-life and low on-farm maintenance.
       Maintenance needs for the drainage pipes are low with minimal upkeep required over the
       expected pipe lifetime of 30 years (subsurface drainage is buried and its deterioration rate
       is very low). Surface open drains need regular weed cleaning and desilting and EPADP
       has acquired considerable experience in maintenance of both subsurface and surface
       drainage and keeps an annual budget line item for maintenance even under budgetary
       constraints.

      Farmer Participation and Water Boards for open drains O&M. The establishment of
       Water Boards at the secondary canal level is a sector policy issue led by the irrigation sector
       of the MWRI. NDPII participated in the establishment of two Water Boards for subareas
       where both irrigation and subsurface drainage improvement were being developed. In these
       areas, the EPADP conducted the participatory design and management exercise. However,
       the legal status of the Water Boards remains unclear as the required law could not be issued
       to date. This remains as a sector issue for the MWRI, which is progressing at a very slow
       pace due to the still unstable social and political situation of Egypt.

      Procurement. Contract management by the EPADP had some shortcomings in terms of
       awarding contracts to poorly performing contractors and not terminating excessively
       delayed civil works in time to rebid and complete the works before closing. The absence
       of qualified procurement specialists and the lengthy internal procedures to complete the
       procurement process and sign contracts also caused serious delays. There were cases in
       which the time between advertising and signing of a contract took more than six months.
       Hands-on procurement training was provided to the relevant technical staff for all
       International Competitive Bidding (ICB) processes at HQ. However, regional staff of the
       client stated that they did not receive procurement training except at the beginning of each
       project phase, that is, twice in 15 years.

      Crop compensation risk. The cropping calendar and the level of cropping intensity
       allowed for a small window of opportunity for drainage works to be completed when there
       were no crops in farmers’ fields. Farmers were paid compensation for crop damages and
       losses during subsurface drainage installation works. The compensation was based on a
       well-established system that is employed in a diverse number of I&D projects in Egypt.
       The legal framework that regulates these compensations were updated in response to
       complaints from the farmers, mainly concerning the low value of these amounts and the
       excessive time between the occurrence of the damage and the compensation payment. The
       actual application of the crop compensation process entailed delays in some cases, resulting
       in discontent among the farmers and, occasionally, threats to the completion of
       uncompleted contracts. However, the final targets of subsurface drainage were achieved.

27.     Risk Management. Risks and mitigation actions were monitored through project
supervisions and particularly at the midterm review. Well-established design criteria were included
but not always adequately followed, e.g. establishment of a coordinator at regional level. Yearly
budget provision for O&M was reviewed and farmers were consulted and they participated in


                                                 9
drainage works designs. Numerous Collector User Associations (CUAs) were established as
suggested by the project but they have not assumed a relevant role until now in operation and
management.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
28.     M&E design. The logical framework for the intervention was sound. The implementation
of improved and new drainage systems allow leaching of excessive salts out of the cropped land
soil and lowering the water table. This leads to higher yields over time and associated increases
in farm level incomes.

29.     Implementation. The EPADP’s M&E Unit under the Planning and Follow-up
Department undertook periodic collection of relevant data. The project impact on yields, water
table depth, and salinity of both soil and groundwater was continually assessed. The collected data
were consolidated in M&E reports and included in the semiannual progress reports, which were
shared with the Bank. Reports covered the status of implementation, any problems that may have
arisen, and the corrective actions being taken, if any. They also provided an updated procurement
program, disbursement, and commitment tables. In addition, they included crop yields and the
impact on the functioning of subsurface drainage, including O&M, particularly maintenance of
open drains.

30.     Management Information System (MIS). The project helped develop the MIS
infrastructure, including (a) digitizing most of the paper-based and old-aged drainage networks
onto a GIS-based format to facilitate planning and decision making; (b) a network linking the
EPADP HQ with the five drainage regions and the training center at Tanta; (c) establishing and
upgrading the information system; and (d) training information technology staff of the EPADP
and end users. Further development of the MIS faced problems due to delays from the contracted
company. Long delays affected the performance of the MIS because of outdated hardware and
software installed from 2008. Meanwhile, the MWRI top management did not agree to use the AF
funds before the total completion of MIS activities provided under NDPII. By the time the
problems with the supplier (contractor) were solved, it was too late to initiate new procurements
under the AF. The GOE has committed to use its own resources to finance the necessary
components for the MIS.

31.    Utilization of M&E. Utilization of the M&E for management and decision-making
purposes (including course correction) was not clearly done. Automating the M&E through the
use of the MIS was not possible due to the above-mentioned problems. The M&E Unit was
understaffed. It depended on a small group of engineers from the HQ who moved around the whole
country. The regional offices of the EPADP did not include M&E staff to help and complement
the work of the central unit.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
32.     The project was classified as Category B according to OP 4.01 as there were no associated
significant, sensitive, diverse, unprecedented, or irreversible impacts. The triggered safeguards
policies were OP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement. The
EPADP prepared an Environmental Assessment, including an EMP that addressed environmental
issues related to environmental pressures on open drains, which are of a ‘generic nature and


                                                10
external to the project’ as defined in the PAD, in addition to issues related to construction waste
management, dust, noise, and chance finds of archeological objects. The inclusion of these generic
issues was required to achieve the PDO related to ‘identify and oversee the resolution of
environmental issues resulting from the discharge into open drains of untreated industrial and
domestic wastewater in the project area’. The activities under the AF were under the same
environmental category as the original project as they did not constitute any shift in the scope of
interventions and constituted only an upscaling in the project with the same activities.

33.     Overall, the project activities complied with all applicable Bank policies. In view of the
ongoing stricter application of safeguard standards, a full Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)
was prepared for the AF as a precautionary measure. The preparation of an RPF with the inclusion
of crop compensation procedures is a practice that has been adopted very recently for the different
ongoing projects in the I&D sector in Egypt. The RPF adopted the Egyptian crop compensation
system, which is based on the market value for lost cash crops. This is well aligned with OP 4.12
and the guidelines of the Involuntary Resettlement Sourcebook, which specifies that when
arrangements cannot be made to allow for harvest, the market value for lost cash crops is paid. It
was agreed that the subsurface drainage contractors pay all the crop compensations amounts
through contracts' (BOQ4) to the beneficiaries and no payments could be made to the contractors
for completed work until crop compensation was paid to farmers.

34.     The project maintained acceptable financial management (FM) arrangements and complied
with the reporting and accounting requirements. All audit reports were received, reviewed, and
found acceptable by the Bank. However, the FM component was always rated Moderately
Satisfactory mainly due to the failure of the EPADP to use the MIS to process the financial
statements in spite of significant investment in the MIS development under NDPII and the AF.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
35.     The EPADP has developed capacity over many years in design, construction, and O&M of
subsurface and open drainage systems. The EPADP receives an annual budget from the
government to carry out its annual plans. Loan agreements proved crucial for implementing those
plans and it is likely that all ongoing drainage contracts at the project closing date will be
completed through government funds. Maintenance of subsurface drainage systems is carried out
by the EPADP’s drainage centers and sub-centers, which have been supported by acquisition of
flushing machines through the project. Public and private sector contractors carry out regular
desilting and weeding of open drains through performance contracts issued by the EPADP. It is
highly likely that maintenance of the drainage systems will continue after the project.8 The EPADP
expressed its commitment to develop its MIS using government funds.



8
 Maintenance of drainage systems is the responsibility of the EPADP except in the areas under the IWRMDs.
Drainage maintenance responsibility in these areas was transferred to the IWRMDs with the staff who were originally
working for the EPADP along with their flushing equipment. The performance of the IWRMDs with respect to
drainage maintenance remains an issue. There are claims that drainage maintenance is often deferred by the IWRMDs
and priority is given to maintenance of irrigation systems. The issue is under review at the highest level at the MWRI,
which is examining remedies and alternatives. The problem, as understood by the ICR team, is due to lack of
appropriate institutional, administrative, and financial arrangements associated with the merger of several MWRI
departments doing different jobs.


                                                         11
36.     Cost recovery. There is a successful, existing cost-sharing arrangement supported by
legislation whereby the investment costs in subsurface drainage are substantially recovered from
beneficiaries over a 20-year period with no interest charged. The GOE thus subsidizes
approximately 50 to 55 percent of this investment and the beneficiaries contribute 40 to 45 percent
in real terms. The EPADP, in collaboration with the National Survey Department and the
agriculture cooperatives, prepares lists of the names of the beneficiaries and their share in the
actual cost of the subsurface drainage system. These lists are sent to the MOF for collection.
Consultation carried out during project preparation with beneficiaries in the social assessment
indicated that they are willing to pay for this investment cost.

37.    There is enough evidence that the GOE will continue its plans to enhance the efficiency of
drainage in the country by implementing new drainage projects. The EPADP is currently
negotiating new drainage projects with AfDB, Islamic Development Bank and KfW.

38.     The EPADP’s main focus since its establishment is (and has been) the construction or
rehabilitation of drainage systems. The recent integration of I&D, explained before that started
with IIIMP, implied transfer of drainage maintenance to the newly established Integrated Water
Resources Management Districts IWRMDs, which became responsible for the O&M of the
improved I&D systems. Along with these changes, the MWRI is promoting user participation
through the establishment of Water User Associations (WUAs), Branch Canal WUAs, and Water
Boards at different levels of water management. The role of the EPADP according to the IIIMP
PAD is to support this transformation and not as the lead implementing agency. The evaluation of
the performance of the EPADP in implementing institutional reform should be considered from
this perspective. The primary institutional reform aspects within the EPADP during NDPII were
the privatization of the plastic pipe factories; involvement of the private sector in open drain
maintenance; development of its MIS; and FM. Within the IIIMP, there is an additional role for
the EPADP to support the institutional reforms by training and building the drainage maintenance
capacity of the IWRMDs and in environmental management.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives: High
39.     The PDOs were and remain highly relevant to the government's strategy as it contributes
to agricultural development, particularly targeting socially disadvantaged groups. Well-
functioning I&D systems constitute a strategic sustainability measure for crop production in Egypt,
which also has a significant contribution to the GDP. Drainage prevents deterioration of the
irrigated lands, increases agricultural productivity, and increases farmers’ incomes.

40.     The project supported the CAS objective of raising rural income through diversified
agricultural production based on efficient and environmentally sustainable use of land and water
resources. It also supported the objective of developing human resources through the provision of
training and TA. The new CPF under development, also includes an objective related to
agricultural development and irrigation which confirms the continued relevance of the objectives
to the Bank’s engagement in Egypt.




                                                12
Relevance of Design and Implementation: Substantial
41.      Design of the project components was generally adequate and satisfactory to achieve the
PDO in terms of current country and global priorities and the Bank’s assistance strategy. The two
components for developing drainage infrastructure were complemented by a component for
institutional capacity that supported long-term sustainability. The design followed well-established
procedures and benefitted from experience gained and lessons learned during previous Bank-
supported projects. Subsurface drainage, as a choice for drainage improvement, is advantageous
to small landholders as they do not cut part of the cropped land and it requires minimum
maintenance work. One shortcoming was the fact that the privatization of the plastic pipe factories
considered in project design as the preferred solution proved difficult and resulted in
implementation delays as securing regular plastic pipe supplies became a constraint for project
works. This remains an unfinished agenda, which the AF did not fully address.

42.     The intervention logic of the project was good and based on experience from past
operations, One weakness identified was that the PDO included an environmental objectives that
was relevant but too ambitious in the light of the complexity of the problem, the fragmented
responsibility across multiple institutions, and the limited resources made available by the project
to achieve the results.

3.2 Achievement of PDOs
PDO - To increase the efficiency of drainage of about 1 million fed of irrigated land:
Substantial
43.     The project was successful in increasing the drainage efficiency in about 1 million fed. By
the closing date, NDPII managed to achieve 104 percent of targeted new drainage, 103 percent of
renewed and rehabilitated areas, and 105 percent of open surface drainage.

44.     The continuous monitoring data provided by the EPADP M&E Unit shows that as a result
of the drainage improvements, the water table has been lowered to an average of about 1 m below
ground level.

45.    A beneficiaries’ survey conducted by EPADP indicated satisfaction with the project
productivity increase that reflected positively on their income. On average, 75% of the farmers
thought that the subsurface drainage was good as well as the water table had lowered (Table 2).
The economic and financial analyses confirmed that subsurface drainage effectively managed to
increase crop yield and income (Annex 3). During the supervision missions and consultations with
farmers, these benefits were unanimously highlighted. The enhancement in land productivity has
improved the income of the poorest segment of the rural areas since most of the farmers are small
holders who have an average size of landholding of 2 fed or even less.

PDO - To increase agricultural production and improve rural income: Substantial
46.    The impact of the project’s improvements on agricultural production and rural income has
been derived from upgrading the drainage. The increase in crop yield was in the range of 14–29
percent due to lowering of the water table and leaching of soil salinity (Annex 3). The effect of
improved drainage was highest on the yield of the crops most sensitive to salinity (for example,




                                                13
maize). The amount of yield increase depends on the degree of deterioration in the crop rout zone
(as a result of salt accumulation and the rise in water table) before improvements.

47.     The economic and financial analysis (Section 3.3) shows that the benefits from improved
drainage infrastructure resulted in higher returns from cropping and increased farmers’ income.
Also, from the country’s economy perspective, there are clearly positive results. Based on the
project M&E field-collected data, the net value of production in the project areas has increased by
more than 30 percent with the new and/or improved drainage systems mainly as a result of
productivity gains.

PDO - To identify and oversee the resolution of environmental issues resulting from the
discharge into the open drains of untreated industrial and domestic wastewater in the area:
Modest
48.     The project showed some improvements in identifying the sources of pollution, in
monitoring activities, and in building the capacity of the EPADP. However, no major executive
steps have been taken to resolve or mitigate the pollution problems. Although there are a wide
variety of stakeholders involved in water quality, environmental monitoring, and pollution control,
few resources have been allocated from the project actions for the proper handling of this critical
issue. A list of project activities related to the environmental aspects is given in Annex 2. The
focus on higher-level issues that are external to the project, such as identifying and overseeing the
resolution of environmental issues, has diluted the efforts of handling environmental interventions
specific to the project targets (Annex 2).

3.3    Efficiency
The efficiency to achieve the PDOs is rated as Substantial.

49.     The net value of production in the project areas has increased by more than 30 percent with
the new or improved drainage systems—from about LE 4.9 billion to LE 6.6 billion—mainly as a
result of productivity gains.

50.     The economic rate of return (ERR) of the investments was estimated at 36.6 percent and
the net present value (NPV), with a discount rate of 10 percent, at LE 7.2 billion (US$960 million).
The benefits from maintaining this physical infrastructure resulted in significant returns and the
amount invested is clearly justified. The incremental benefits both from the point of view of
farmers’ incomes and from the country’s economy perspective are clearly positive and results are
robust against major risks. Impacts measured by a systematic monitoring process of representative
project pilot areas confirmed a consistent and almost homogeneous positive impact even under the
most adverse scenarios (see details in Annex 3). These estimates do not take into account all the
expected benefits from the investments, including those derived from a strengthened
implementation capacity of the EPADP or from the environmental benefits developed through
project activities.

51.    Based on the M&E Unit data, the project impact was analyzed by estimating the
incremental net benefits captured by the benefited farmers through their cropping activities. The
average prices for 2015 were used for the analysis. Physical and financial results were estimated
and introduced in crop and farm budget models to represent the ‘with’ and ‘without’ project



                                                 14
scenarios as drainage was improved in their fields and crop yields increased. Farm models were
used both to assess the impact of the project on beneficiaries’ income and to check their capacity
to pay for the cost recovery of the investment financed with the project. The improvement in soil
condition as a result of better drainage, less waterlogging, and lower salinity by itself improved
crop productivity and the net return from cropping.

52.     Yield increases were confirmed with the systematic monitoring data collected. Current
costs of the subsurface drainage works were valued by the EPADP at LE 2,882 (US$384) to LE
3135 (US$418) per fed depending on the region (using 2015 costs). Since fiscal investments are
being recovered from beneficiaries through the land tax mechanism over a 20-year period, free of
interest, the debt service was included in the farm budgets. The project allowed not only an increase
in farmers’ incomes but also the recovery of most of the capital investment costs.

53.     Average drainage improvement investment costs were between US$800 and US$1,200 per
ha while the incremental benefit generated two to three years after works were completed is more
than US$500 per ha per year. As noted above, this compares very favorably to other areas for
example in Sub-Saharan Africa irrigation development costs (similar type of works) are in the
order of 15,000 US$/ha. Net income per cultivated fed has increased by 10 to 200 percent as a
result of the combined effects of higher yields with similar costs of production (Annex 3). The
project’s investments allowed not only higher farmers’ incomes but also the recovery of the capital
investment costs. However, it should also be mentioned that the project was not efficient from the
timing point of view as NDPII took 10 years for completion instead of 7 and the AF took 5 years
for completion instead of 3, which was due to factors discussed earlier in this report.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
54.     The project was fully successful in achieving its two main PDOs in terms of improving the
drainage infrastructure in about 1 million fed, avoiding loss of crop yield, increasing agricultural
production and improving rural income (Section 1.2). The efficiency was substantial based on the
low cost per ha and the significant benefits derived, although the project took more time than
anticipated. It was less successful with respect to identifying and addressing environmental issues.
Overall, the project objectives, design, and implementation were and remain relevant and
consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with the Bank’s current country
and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals. Shortcomings related to institutional reform
and delays in implementation that affected the project render the overall outcome rating
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

55.     Poverty impacts. The current costs of the subsurface drainage works were valued by the
EPADP at LE 2,882 (US$384) to LE 3,135 (US$418) per fed depending on the region: Nile Delta,
Middle, or Upper Egypt. The investments are being recovered from beneficiaries (smallholders,
on average 2 feddan per beneficiary, this is 0.8 ha/beneficiary) through the land tax mechanism
over a 20-year period, free of interest. However, for the purposes of this ICR, it was assumed that
these costs were recovered in 10 years, interest free, so annual payments per year were assumed


                                                 15
to be about LE 300 (US$40) per fed. Even in this scenario, the net margin per farm after repayment
would be roughly 6 to 13 percent higher than before the improvement.

56.     Gender aspects. Female farmers are heavily engaged in agriculture, particularly during
sowing, harvest, and post-harvest work. Recently, females are becoming members of WUAs and
Water Boards. It is assumed that around 442,500 women benefited from the project improvements.
In the meantime, 10,570 CUAs were formed with a total of 463,500 members. The EPADP does
not collect gender-disaggregated data on the members of the CUAs, so it is difficult to verify the
participation of women. It is generally stated that women’s engagement in the boards is still limited
in terms of numbers, which is mainly attributed to cultural social barriers.

57.     Consultation and engagement with farmers. During implementation, the EPADP
worked persistently to enhance the participation approach with farmers. Preconstruction
consultation was introduced to avoid future objections and ensure the wider consensus and
acceptance to the project. The Drainage Advisory Service (DAS) conducted pretender seminars,
which resulted in a total of four official events/symposiums carried out during various stages of
each of the drainage works contracts, namely pre-tender, before implementation, during
implementation, and after completion. A grievance redress mechanism used by the EPADP
indicated that complaints due to crop compensation were trivial compared with the total number
of complaints related to other reasons (Annex 2).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

58.     The establishment of the CUAs promoted by the DAS as soon as construction is completed
has negligible impact as the CUAs remain weak and with an unclear role. To scale up farmers’
participation within an integrated water management approach, the MWRI is promoting the
establishment of IWRMDs and Water Boards at the secondary canal level. The project made a
contribution toward this end by piloting two Secondary Canal WUAs under the Water Boards
Project (see section 2.2) and provided training to the members of the association on drainage design,
construction, and maintenance work. Although, the new institutional developments are important
sector issues for long-term sustainability, they are still immature and face many challenges. It will
take more effort and time till they become effectively operational.

59. Local and overseas training of EPADP staff covered a wide range of themes, including
institutional reform, land and water management, design and construction aspects, and user
participation (Annex 2). However, the impact on overall capacity of the EPADP is unclear.

60.    The EPADP did not implement the AF agreement of appointing regional coordinators to
follow up the progress of the civil contracts and to enhance the flow of information between the
drainage regions (sectors) and the HQ. Some attempts to establish the Steering Committee to
oversee the project implementation with representatives of relevant ministries did not materialize
as agreed due to alleged lack of response of some of the proposed ministries.

61.     The establishment and empowerment of the Environmental Unit will have sustainable
benefits on future EPADP operations as it will enhance the EPADP’s environmental capacity and
coordination with other agencies regarding pollution control related to disposal of wastewater in
open drains. It will streamline environmental issues as an integrated part of EPADP operations.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

62. None.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
63.     The EPADP conducted a beneficiary survey in four project areas provided with subsurface
drainage in the Nile Delta, involving a sample of 96 farmers (annex 5). The questionnaire included
a set of questions covering parameters focusing on drainage and other parameters related to the
general status of water management in these areas. The results summarized in table 2 indicate
general satisfaction with the drainage improvements and its impact in terms of controlling water
table levels and reducing soil salinity. However, farmers’ views were divided about crop damage
compensations. They were also less happy with the irrigation water quality and mostly unhappy
with the maintenance of open drains and with the responses to their complaints. The least
satisfaction was about the awareness services and performance of the Water Boards.This confirms
the general findings of this ICR that the infrastructure targets haven been met by the project (being
EPADP an engineer focused institution) but the institutional setup for proper operation and
maintenance remains a challenge.

                      MWRI Services                              39%           51%          10%



4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
64.    Most of the infrastructure for subsurface drainage is buried and its deterioration rate is very
low. Although maintenance requirements for subsurface drains are limited, surface open drains
need regular weed cleaning and desilting. However, in general, the risk is considered as Moderate
because the EPADP has acquired considerable experience in maintenance of both subsurface and
surface drainage and keeps an annual budget line item for maintenance even under budgetary
constraints.

65.    The institutional setup for the maintenance of the drainage network is still under discussion.
There have been some initiatives to transfer drainage maintenance to joint irrigation and drainage


                                                  17
districts. This has been done with USAID support as well as with the IIIMP project. However,
there are mixed results. This is a sector issue and the MWRI is currently reviewing the policy and
its implementation problems.

66.     The EPADP has revised the processes and responsibilities related to crop compensation
several times during the project lifetime, acknowledging that this issue is critical to maintain
credibility with farmers. Significant improvements have occurred (Annex 2), but payment of
compensations is taking too long. The reasons for the delays derive from the associated long
processes involving surveying of damages, validation of land ownership, review of the financial
balance of each farmer, and involvement of several institutions other than the EPADP such as the
Survey Authority, the MOF (Taxation Authority), and the agricultural cooperatives. Continued
payment of crop compensation after the end of the project represents a lower risk as it is confined
to a few uncompleted contracts financed under the AF.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
67.     The Bank carried out a comprehensive analysis for the project design, which resulted in a
good Quality at Entry. Most of the issues observed at completion were already detected and
considered during its design. The Bank performance at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory on
the basis of having adequately considered most of the performance assessment criteria, including:
(a) the strategic relevance and intervention approach; (b) its technical, financial, and economic
aspects; (c) the poverty, gender, and social development aspects; (d) the institutional
implementation and its M&E and fiduciary arrangements; and (e) the foreseen Bank inputs and
processes for preparation and supervision. However, the environment aspects identified as project
objectives were not considered in the key performance indicators neither in NDP2 and AF. In
addition, the environmental objectives were too ambitious and exceeded the mandate and capacity
of the EPADP. The original project also contemplated use of KfW grant funding to assess private
sector participation in the pipe factories and Netherlands funding for training of EPADP staff.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
68.      Supervision continued at the rate of at least twice a year. Aide memoires and management
letters addressed most critical implementation issues. The attention of task team leaders during
implementation seemed to focus more on the infrastructure development than on the nonstructural
activities. During the AF, the bidding process did not start until effectiveness on August 5, 2011,
which was in fact delayed first by the 2010 parliamentary election and then by the turmoil that
started on January 25, 2011. This caused major procurement delays in contract management during
the AF period, particularly delaying the first payment by the Bank till March 2012 (seven months
after effectiveness). Procurement training was organized only at the beginning of each project.
This had practical implications as considering the high turnover of EPADP staff, some of the
recently recruited staff had never received proper training. In addition, the project had a high


                                                18
turnover of task team leaders (six) during the 15 years. The impact of not privatizing the pipe
factories should have received more focus, particularly the recommendations of the private sector
specialist that was deployed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
69.     Combining the ratings of Bank performance at entry and the Quality of Supervision, the
overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
70.     The Moderately Unsatisfactory rating is based on the shortcomings in creating an enabling
environment for implementation of the institutional and management proposals of the project.
Government ownership and commitment to achieve the development objective was high as
drainage of irrigated lands remained a high government priority. Attempts continued to introduce
integrated water resource management and to involve the beneficiary/stakeholders, although with
varying degrees of success. The reasonable level of productive consultation between the ministries
and organizations involved in project preparation and implementation was commendable but
insufficient. The government maintained a good relationship with partners and donors such as
KfW, European Investment Bank (EIB), Islamic Development Bank, and AfDB and is currently
preparing a new drainage project. Coordination exists between relevant ministries (MWRI,
Finance, Agriculture, and Environment) but could be more effective. Several issues did not receive
the expected support of the government such as: (a) timely effectiveness of the AF phase; (b) the
approval of the law for Water Boards; (c) the enabling environment for privatization of pipe
factories; (d) the procurement of the MIS; and (e) the formation of the agreed Steering Committee
for the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
71.     The implementing agency, EPADP, showed sufficient implementation capacity and a good
relationship with the relevant government agencies (MWRI, MOF, and Ministry of Environment)
as well as with their development partners (IBRD, KfW, and AFAD). Consultation with farmers
started at the early pre-tender stage through implementation and after completion and hardware
components were well-developed. However, certain shortcomings characterized the
implementation process, including the following: (a) although involvement of farmers has been
enhanced and brought forward to the early stages of the process, formal establishment of the CUAs
should be brought forward to the early stages of construction; (b) the five regional coordinators as
mentioned in the PAD were never appointed; (c) no focal point was assigned for social issues; (d)
nonperforming contracts were not cancelled on time, particularly under the AF; (e) contracts were
awarded to contractors without the right qualifications (the committee that reviews the equipment
of the contractors was not operational for the last few years); (f) procurement of plastic powder,
equipment, and spare parts was not on time; (g) the M&E Unit just undertakes M&E of the


                                                19
groundwater level, soil salinity, and water quality but lacks the analytical skills to use the data
collected in decision making; (h) there is no M&E at regional offices; and (i) the MIS envisioned
in the project does not function properly.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
72.      Given the scale and multiplicity of the PDOs and operations and the fact that the bulk of
the PDOs were achieved, the overall borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
The PDOs of increasing productivity in about 1 million fed and increasing the income of more
than half a million farmers (mostly low-income, small-scale farmers) have been achieved. The
NDPII first phase was completed satisfactorily with full disbursement of the funds. However,
several shortcomings, especially under the AF phase, could not be ignored, but many of these were
attributable at least partially to the political turmoil prevailing in the country during the last several
years. The government also failed to proceed with the privatization of the pipe factories and with
the ratification of laws supporting the establishment of Water Boards.

6.      Lessons Learned

73.    While lessons learned are important to Bank-wide operations, they are particularly
important to Egypt’s drainage program.

Institutional Support
74.    Considering that irrigated agriculture provides livelihood for 55 percent and directly
employs 30 percent of the population in Egypt, I&D structures are of such importance that their
sustainability and impact on the rural economy remain a central issue. Thus, integrated
management of I&D on sound institutional and financial arrangements should not be left as an
unresolved issue. This requires the support of the MWRI and all the institutions in the sector, not
only the EPADP.

75.     Irrigation and drainage go together in all countries of the world (except in some parts of
Bulgaria and some schemes of France due to the difference in construction period between I&D).
Egypt is the only case where there is one institution for irrigation and another for drainage. This is
a particularly unusual case due to the key role played by drainage to prevent salinization in most
of the delta. In recent years (2000), there has been some effort to integrate operation and
management of I&D into one organization at the district level. Further analytical works should be
done in order to move forward I&D in Egypt in a more integrated approach. This is particularly
necessary at branch canal level.

76.     Reform actions that are new for the drainage practiced in Egypt should include alternatives
that will avoid turning the intended reforms into constraints if the reform option is not effective.
The case of privatizing the plastic pipe production was a typical example. Given that this is a
strategic reform action involving policy and institutional changes, the AF design should have paid
more attention to the issue.




                                                   20
Implementation Capacity
77.     Project design should be realistic and appropriate to the institutional capacity of the client,
taking into consideration the qualifications and skills of the staff. Since most of the EPADP staff
had an engineering background, the EPADP proved to be less efficient in environmental and
socioeconomic issues. Operations that require expertise outside EPADP capacities should be
wisely designed and responsibilities well-defined. Risks and mitigation measures should be
identified.

78.       In spite of the fact that the EPADP staff had several overseas training programs, the EPADP
is still following the approach of a centralized public institution focusing mainly on infrastructure.
They should follow lessons learned in modern management of large-scale organizations. The
changes/reforms within the EPADP need to come from inside and from the EPADP staff who
should have had much more exposure to international best practices that could have been financed
by the project. In addition, the EPADP needs multidisciplinary staff rather than being managed
mostly by engineers.

79.     The EPADP field staff as well as the contractors’ staff need more training on modern
project management approaches, including interaction with end users and client satisfaction. The
EPADP should have the right trainers with such knowledge, skills, and experience. In addition,
international training and exposure of EPADP staff to such requirements should be a priority.

80.     The contractors’ capacity in terms of machinery, equipment, and trained personnel should
represent important factors in bid evaluations based on hard evidence. The EPADP should
reestablish its time-motion evaluation of contractors’ machinery based on monitoring, field-testing,
and continuous updating of its database on drainage machinery available within the contracting
sector. The EPADP should also use its training facilities to improve the skills of the contractors’
personnel and allow only certified machine operators to work on its projects.

Lessons for Bank Team and Management for the Future
81.     Development objectives of operations that share responsibilities among several institutions
other than the client should not be too ambitious. The expectations should be realistic and
consistent with the role and mandate of the EPADP.

82.     Capacity building and institutional support if considered important and reflected in the
objectives, should also be reflected in the key performance indicators even if mainly financed
through parallel means. This is essential so that the implementing agency gives the deserved
attention.

83.     Training provided on procurement and contract management should be sufficient and
conducted regularly for the client staff, particularly considering the high turnover of staff. It should
reach the regional staff and not be limited to the HQ staff. In a long project, as in the case of NDPII
(15 years), staff movement because of position changes or retirements should be expected.

84.     Close monitoring of contractors’ performance on regular basis is important. M&E regional
staff should have been appointed to report on problems delaying the progress of works and to
coordinate timely actions. Contracts showing persistent delays should have been cancelled early
enough to allow rebidding without further delays. No exception should be given to the public


                                                  21
sector contractors. The performance history of these companies should have been taken into
account before awarding them any new contract.

85.    One of the most important lessons learned is to complete the tendering process as early as
possible, particularly toward the end of the project, to have enough time to complete the tendering
and bidding requirements on time and to re-tender in case of failure due to some reasons. Awarding
more than one contract to the same bidder without considering the current performance, work load,
and technical and financial capacity to implement additional contracts leads to overloading of
contractors and repeated nonperformance. This should be avoided for future interventions, to
ensure smooth project implementation.

86.    Supervision should be more proactive toward the implementation of the nonstructural
components of the project, especially those activities aiming at institutional development of the
implementing agency. When necessary, adequate changes should have been considered at Midterm
Review and restructuring of the project should be done. Key performance indicators should have
been included for these objectives.

87.    Since the privatization of the plastic pipe factories proved not politically workable, the
Bank should encourage and support the EPADP to carry out diagnostic analyses of the causes and
opportunities. The private sector should be engaged and fears of monopolies and financial risks
should be analyzed and appropriate regulatory measures proposed, including risk sharing by both
the government and the private sector.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
88.     On crop compensation. Since the start of AF-NDPII, contractors have been paying
compensation to the affected farmers promptly as stipulated by law and according to the updated
price lists of the Agricultural Department. The Bank agreed to pay back the amount of
compensation from the loan amount. From its side, the drainage directorates kept close supervision
on the contractors’ performance in paying the compensation. A fine of 10 percent is imposed on
the contractor in case the compensation is not paid to the affected farmers within the duration of
the four months. Information should be made available in the agriculture associations, with the
names of farmers, amount of crops affected, and the due compensation. Farmers are given a period
of two weeks to submit any complaint regarding the estimated value of the compensation. They
are allowed to appeal on the calculation of the area damaged. Farmers are able to use a grievance
redress mechanism. The same procedure will continue after the end of the project with the
exception that the compensation to the contractor will be paid directly from government funds.

89.     On the NDPII outcome. The project was highly successful in achieving its PDOs. It
resulted in high revenue compared with the paid amount and increased farmers’ income in addition
to the positive impact on the national economy due to increased agricultural productivity.

90.    Donor support. Despite many challenges and lessons learned, it became clear how NDPII
was a success through the productive cooperation and partnership between the EPADP and the
donors and how it was helpful for the farmers’ community and the economy in Egypt. So the
EPADP recommends continuing this productive cooperation in preparing and implementing a third


                                                22
phase of the National Drainage Project to complete covering all targeted areas across Egypt and to
maximize the benefits of the project.

(b)       Cofinanciers
91.    The KfW generally concurs with the Bank’s conclusions presented further to the ICR on
NDPII.

92.     The PDOs of the project remain highly relevant in the context of the Egyptian irrigation
sector. The systematic expansion, rehabilitation, and replacement of the vast drainage
infrastructure embracing the entire Nile Valley and Delta on a national scale is indispensable for
securing the sustainability of the Egyptian irrigation sector. This is emphasized even more given
the major socioeconomic and, thus political, importance of the irrigation sector with regard to its
employment impact on a significant, largely poor part of the Egyptian population in rural areas.

93.     The defined project development goals have been achieved. In particular, the project has
contributed to increasing agricultural yields of major crops and thus to farm incomes in the
intervention areas. This was achieved through the implementation of appropriate drainage
infrastructure, which lowers the water table to an extent that ensures the avoidance of waterlogging
and salinity on farmland, thus stabilizing agricultural productivity.

94.    The design of the project was partly ambitious and not entirely implemented as planned.
This implies remaining challenges for future drainage investments in Egypt.

95.    In particular, improving the institutional effectiveness and efficiency of the EPADP
remains a challenge:

         At the outset of the project, privatization of drainage pipe factories under the responsibility
          of the EPADP was envisaged. This approach was eventually abandoned by the Egyptian
          government. At the same time, keeping these factories operational at their required capacity,
          and even more at their nominal capacity, was a constant bottleneck. Also, private pipe
          suppliers have not been harnessed effectively to remove this bottleneck. As a result, pipe
          availability has been a structural bottleneck for the implementation of drainage contracts
          in the framework of the project.
         The EPADP’s staff size has almost tripled from a total of about 7,000 to more than 20,000
          since project appraisal of NDPII. This has implications on the EPADP’s cost-effectiveness
          and implies a challenge on its organizational efficiency but also effectiveness.
96.     Beneficiary involvement through Branch Canal WUA, CUA, and Water Boards, the latter
ones so far established on a pilot level, in the planning, monitoring, and maintenance of drainage
infrastructure requires further improvement.

97.    Also, the role of the IWRMDs regarding drainage activities needs to be strengthened and
the coordination between the EPADP and the IMRWDs improved.

98.     Maintenance of open drainage canals remains a major challenge. Illegal waste disposal into
these canals is rife and relevant rules and laws are not enforced. As a result, the canals’ capacity
and, thus their effectiveness, is systematically reduced. At the same time, health risks are inflicted
upon the concerned population. This requires appropriate and constant sensitization campaigns as


                                                   23
well as improved coordination between the EPADP and other relevant authorities regarding
mitigating illegal waste disposal into open drainage canals.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
99. None.

Annex 1. Project Costs and Financing

(a)       Project Cost by Component (in US$ million equivalent)
The original NDPII components at appraisal of the original NDPII are as listed:

         Project Component 1 - US$147.00 million (base cost). Provision of subsurface drainage
          for about 500,000 fed (390,000 fed in the old cultivated lands and about 110,000 fed in the

  Renewal and rehabilitation: areas with old, dilapidated, or malfunctioning subsurface drainage.


During the first stage of NDPII implementation, some changes had been made for the areas
intended to be provided with subsurface drainage system; however, the total area was not changed.
Only in the case of the areas intended to be served with surface drainage remodeling, the total area
increased by about 100,000 fed.

The Board approved the AF for NDPII on March 23, 2010, and the associated changes in project
components are as listed:

          Component 1 - US$15.0 million (base cost). The provision of subsurface drainage to an
           area of 35,000 fed that is already under cultivation and has never had subsurface drainage
           systems before, along with any necessary remodeling to the existing open drainage systems.
          Component 2 - US$23.6 million (base cost). The renewal and rehabilitation of old
           malfunctioning subsurface drainage for about 55,000 fed in old cultivated lands.
          Component 3 - US$1.0 million (base cost). Deepening and remodeling of open surface
           drains in 365,000 fed.
          Component 4 - US$1.2 million (base cost). The procurement of much needed machinery,
           equipment, and spare parts.
          Component 5 - US$1.4 million (base cost). Provision of technical support required for
           strengthening the EPADP’s institutional capacity such as environmental management and
           awareness activities, drainage advisory services, O&M, improvement of EPADP’s MIS,
           and auditing of the project accounts. Finally, no major changes are proposed either in
           project activities or in implementation arrangements.

Upon the GOE’s request, IBRD had approved reallocation of the loan proceeds among different
categories starting from March 2014, as follows:

          US$5 million from the works category to the goods category.
          US$2 million from the unallocated category to the goods category.
          Increase IBRD loan share of expenditure under the works category from 65 to 85 percent.



                                                                       26

12.      Findings of the February 2015 preparatory mission. The regional directorates in the
five regions of the EPADP carry out the procurement process for civil work (pipes are included in
the bill of quantities but are furnished mainly by the pipe factories). The bid evaluation committee
at the HQ of the EPADP does the screening of bids and awarding of contract. Contracts were
signed between the contractors and the regional directors after clearance from the HQ of the
EPADP.

13.    In the AF, the EPADP signed 52 contracts for the approved 90,000 fed (average size
between 1,500 and 2,900 fed), mostly in 2012 after the disbursal of the first payment of the loan.
So there was delay from the AF approval (2010) to the first contracts signed and awarded.

14.   Presently, of the 52 contracts, 20 have completed their works while 32 are still pending.
According to discussions, the main issue is regarding ‘inappropriate procurement process’:

      (a)     Some contracted companies are public and undergo financial and management crises;
      (b)     The lowest bid method was chosen and some of these companies should not have
              qualified;
      (c)     The EPADP also claims that the establishment of bidding committees under Law 89
              (GOE Law) causes delays in procurement;
      (d)     The Bank claims that contracts should have been cancelled if, after two years, the
              company is not performing; and
      (e)     The EPADP claims difficulties in firing a public sector contractor.



Component 4: Procurement of goods (equipment and materials)

      (a) Under the original NDPII Project Agreement completed on December 31, 2011

Procurement of PVC materials
15.     To improve efficiency of procurement of drainage plastic pipe production facilities and
encouraging competition, the EPADP was expected to pursue studies toward commercialization
or privatization of its seven pipe production facilities. A transition period of two years was agreed
upon for provision of PVC/PE raw materials and for synthetic filter materials, through the loan
amount, to avoid any disruption to implementation of the drainage program. Based on this


13
  An area of 20,000 fed was proposed for implementation through AF-NDPII, as needed (see the Results Framework
and Monitoring Arrangements, annex 1b of the project paper).




                                                     31
arrangement, the procedures used under the first NDP14 continued to be followed so as to fully
cover the requirements for procurement of materials for the first year of the project and 50 percent
of the requirements for the second year. Under IBRD financing and during the transition period of
two years, nine contracts were awarded for the procurement of raw materials. The Bank ceased to
provide any funding for the procurement of raw materials for the EPADP’s pipe production after
the transition period.

Procurement of vehicles and equipment
16.    All goods to be financed from the Bank loan proceeds were procured in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans dated January 1999. Basic understanding
has been reached that procurement of goods under the KfW and EIB loans will also be in
accordance with the same guidelines (subject to final approval by the German government and
EIB). Annex 6 of the PAD provides the procedures to be adopted in procurement.

       (b) Under the AF

17.    AF-NDPII provided funds to the EPADP to procure spare parts for loaders and excavators,
spare parts for EPADP pipe factories in Assuit and Aga, four emergency pump units, 30 flushing
machines, environmental and monitoring equipment, and hardware and software for installation
and improvement of the MIS. The procurement method varied according to each item—ICB, direct
contracting, or shopping.

Component 5: Institutional support for the EPADP

18.    The project provided support to the EPADP through provision of utility vehicles;
equipment for field investigations, computers, Geographic Information System (GIS) equipment,
laboratory and office equipment, and additional equipment required for the maintenance of open
drains and subsurface drains; and TA for such specialized studies as privatization of pipe
manufacturing facilities, MIS, GIS, M&E, integrated water and drainage users associations, and
overseas as well as local training for EPADP staff.




14
     The EPADP has agreed with the Bank and the KfW that the clauses of adjudication should be retained as in the
     original Bank bidding documents and that the contract document will clearly state in the Bill of Quantities that bid
     prices include all overhead alternatives for civil works. Also, it was agreed that for any case, the lowest cost
     alternative may be provided by the contractor for purchasing the pipes from any EPADP facilities which have not
     been privatized. These were the alternatives:
         BOQ1: Pipes being provided by the EPADP pipe production facilities (permitted during the first two years
            after effectiveness for the Bank loan)
         BOQ2: Contractor provisions pipes according to the EPADP standards from a third party, with payments
            being made to cover cost of pipes through the civil works contract
         BOQ3: Supply of PVC/PE powder and other materials for production of pipes to the EPADP pipe
            production facilities, which are not privatized, through the civil contract (the last two cases for the period
            after the end of the first two years of Bank loan effectiveness).


                                                            32
A. Privatization/commercialization of the pipe factories

19.    The EPADP had gone through a lengthy process to define an adequate approach to turn its
pipe production facilities into independent self-financed entities as described by the following
steps:

        Consultation with representatives of the private sector working in the field of plastic pipe
         industries to explore their interest and discuss their ideas about the privatization of the
         EPADP’s pipe factories. Meanwhile, a study was prepared by the EPADP’s pipe factories
         directorate to separate the pipe factories’ assets needed for the production process from
         other assets. The results of the study were shared with the representatives of the private
         sector and they paid visits to the factories.
        The EPADP board decided that the EPADP should start the legal procedures needed for
         selling the pipe factories, and the minister approved the decision on November 12, 2002.
        In March 2003, a meeting was held with a representative of the business sector, the Bank
         mission members, the EPADP chairman, and senior staff to discuss the methods and
         procedures of privatization. An agreement was reached to transfer the factories to the I&D
         holding companies,15 Sinai (North Egypt factories) and Toshka (Upper Egypt factories), as
         a first step toward full privatization. A letter was sent with the findings of this meeting to
         the minister of the MWRI to take the necessary actions, including issuance of a presidential
         decree to approve transferring the EPADP pipe factories as subsidiary companies.
        A special evaluation committee composed of MWRI senior staff and the holding
         companies’ senior staff studied the modalities of the transfer and assessed the pipe factories’
         assets. The evaluation committee delegated the Institute of Mechanical Research under the
         MWRI to make a study on the state of the production lines. The institute completed its
         study and submitted the report to the EPADP and the evaluation committee reviewed the
         findings.
        The committee’s final report was finalized and was expected to be presented to the
         minister of the MWRI by February 28, 2006, who in turn would submit it to the prime
         minister for approval by April 2006.

20.     Nevertheless, a number of developments had stopped the transfer of ownership of the pipe
factories to the holding companies. For instance, in October 2006, the cabinet had decided to
liquidate the Sinai holding companies. Earlier, in June 2006, a high-level judicial committee from
the state council found that transfer of the ownership to the holding companies is illegal and would
result in detrimental consequences to the EPADP and the future of drainage projects. Thus the
committee ruled that selling the factories to the private sector is not a valid option due to the
associated risks. The report of the committee had identified a number of other options for
reforming the EPADP pipe factories such as:

        Establishing a company with the EPADP holding the majority of the capital retained; and




15
   Two holding companies were established under the MWRI and chaired by the MWRI minister in the early 2000s
to take over services implemented by the MWRI that could be transferred to the private sector.


                                                     33
      Delegating the management of the pipe factories to a private operator through a
       management contract or through a concession.

21.     The EPADP decided not to move further toward privatization of its plastic pipe factories
during the rest of the NDPII Project and through the AF phase. Nevertheless, the EPADP accepted
that contractors can supply plastic pipes from private companies. Although, it is currently limited
to about 8–10 percent of the 80 mm lateral plastic pipes demand, it represents a shift toward more
involvement of the private sector in pipe production, which can grow bigger in the future.
Currently, only two private companies with limited capacity are available.

22.     Findings of the February preparatory mission. There are seven factories/plants for pipes
spread across the country. All except one produce PVC pipes. The factory at Aga produces PE
pipes (initially supported by Canadian Development Agency). Some factories only produce
laterals; others produce both laterals and collectors. The one visited by the mission at Tanta was
built in 1981. It produces both lateral and collector pipes but at the time of the visit, only the
collector machine was operational. Laterals used in Egypt are of 80 mm diameter while collector
diameters range from 6”, 8”, 10”, 12”, 14”, to 16”. Pipe factories do not directly sell their products.

23.      Pipe sales to contractors is managed from Cairo; so is purchase of powder as well as pipe
delivery to contractors. The Central Department for Factories receives sale requests for pipes
(length and diameters) from contractors and sends instructions to the nearest factory after receiving
the full payment. When the instructions are issued, the Central Department takes into consideration
the capacity of each factory and when necessary directs the sale order to another factory. The
Central Department updates the delivery plan every 10 days. Pipes are sold only to contractors
who have signed contracts with the EPADP.

24.    The pipe factories have frequent problems with spare parts. They need approximately 25
days to receive new parts as disbursement is centrally managed. Many pipe production machines
are old and need replacement and modernization. Finding spare parts for such old machines is
troublesome.

B. Private sector participation (PSP) in maintenance activities

25.     The EPADP moved forward to identify opportunities of decentralization and privatization
of the maintenance work through (a) identification of options for efficient utilization of its heavy
equipment used in self-implemented maintenance work through the private sector; (b)
identification of options and approaches to involve the private sector in the maintenance of small
open drains and pipe drainage, including privatization of its owned maintenance capabilities (that
is, maintenance centers and equipment); and (c) reorganization of its Drainage Departments and
centers to cope with the vision and objective of institutional reform and to rely more on the private
sector in implementing the maintenance work while focusing more on monitoring, regulations,
and advisory service.

26.     The Bank agreed to provide the necessary TA to help the EPADP formulate a strategy and
action plan to reach these targets. Accordingly, a consulting firm (Messrs. SDA) was selected as
the engineering consultant for the task. The consultant started the assignment (cost LE 175,000;
duration 10 months) in March 2005, which was finalized satisfactorily and a workshop was held


                                                  34
on November 15, 2005, to discuss the findings and provide recommendations on the report. The
recommendations of the workshop had been incorporated in the study final report.

27.     The next steps after the completion of the study considered the possibility of implementing
the strategy of PSP in maintenance on a pilot scale. The activity was carried out through joint
support from NDPII and the Second Maintenance of Drains Project (MDPII) financed by the KfW.
Additional resources for the pilot activity beyond those provided by MDPII were shared between
NDPII and the EPADP. The consultancy assignment, financed by the Bank, was concluded with
the development of prequalification procedures for different categories of open drains maintenance
contracts, training of EPADP staff on the application of these procedures, and follow-up on the
application of these procedures in five general directorates (East Monufiya, Kalyoubia, South
Sharkiyah, Beni Sweef, and Assiut).

28.     Implementation of the findings of the study started with advertisements in the newspapers
in July 2006 calling for the registration of contractors for selection of the best-qualified contractors
to participate in maintenance works. MDPII prepared sample contracts for different categories of
open drainage maintenance works (very small, small, medium, and large). The tendering process
was to start for 11 large, 4 medium, 7 small, and 2 very small contracts.

C. Crop compensation

29.     The compensation for lost crops is based on the crop compensation system that is employed
in diverse number of projects in Egypt. During the project lifetime, the length of the compensation
processes and the weaknesses in the monitoring system have been repeatedly flagged as a
challenge.

30.    The legal framework that regulates the compensation for crops used to be the Ministerial
Decree No. 358 issued by the MWRI, July 31, 2008, and updated by Ministerial Decree No. 564
issued in May 2013. The decree has been updated in response to complaints from the farmers
concerning the low value of the crops and the extended duration between the occurrence of the
damage and the payment of compensation.

31.    The new ministerial decree increased the value of crops with various percentages to fit the
increase in market value. Price increase ranges between 10 percent in certain crops to 100 percent
in others. The decree stipulates the formation of a compensation committee, the disclosure of
information, and grievance rules. It also states a duration of a maximum of four months until
farmers receive compensation from the date of the damage occurrence.

32.     According to the EPADP records, an amount of LE 51,214,908.22 has been paid as
compensation until May 2015. The compensation decree gives the farmers the chance to object to
the value of the compensation after publishing the final list of farmers to be compensated and the
amount of compensation for one month in the agriculture cooperatives.  

33.     Despite the progress made, there is a concern that the follow-up on the remaining
compensation after the end of the project will depend entirely on the availability of government
funds. This represents a potential risk for timely payment of the compensation. However, this risk
is low since payment of crop compensation to the farmers remains a contractual condition between



                                                  35
the EPADP and the contractor who will not receive his payment for completed work until the
compensation is paid.

Grievance redress mechanism here is no structured unified method for receiving

34.    The EPADP is widely using the frequent seminars conducted by the DAS as the key
modality for listening to the complaints, concerns, and requests of farmers and working on
providing suitable solutions. In the meantime, farmers sometimes resort to sending written
complaints to the directorate when the problems are not resolved promptly on the ground. The
received complaints, concerns, and requests are registered.

35.    The DAS handles the complaints by referring them to the relevant department and
following up on how each is being resolved. As an evidence for resolving the complaints, a written
signed acknowledgment is obtained from the complainant/requester. Complaints are diverse and
not limited to drainage. For example, a large number is related to shortage of irrigation water, the
value of taxes, and pollution.

36.   According to the EPADP records, and as indicated in the table below, the number of
complaints related to crop compensation received during July 1, 2014–June 30, 2015 is trivial
compared to the total number of complaints/requests and concerns received.




D. Institutional reform

37.      Within the overall institutional reform (IR) strategy of the MWRI, the EPADP went
through the reform process. The goal was to promote decentralization and participation that
increase efficiency and effectiveness of all functions and activities undertaken by the ministry and
its affiliated authorities and departments. The main elements of the reform vision were (a)
integration of the O&M functions of I&D at both the district and directorate levels; (b) formation
of WUAs at Meska,branch canal, and district levels; and (c) enhancement of the role of the private
sector. The focus on O&M was supported by a project called LIFE funded by the United States
Agency for International Development. IIIMP has also contributed to this process. The IR efforts
within the EPADP were focused on ‘awareness raising’ among staff and ‘user participation’.



                                                36
Human resources

38.     The main activity was training of staff (in Egypt and overseas) on the concept and
implementation of IR that improve governance and bring efficiency to the functions and operations
of the institution. In addition, three internal workshops were held to discuss the prospects of IR
within the EPADP.

Awareness

39.    The DAS of the EPADP is the key department mandated with communication and
engagement with farmers. The department is in charge of raising awareness among farmers
regarding the importance of the project, informing farmers about the possible crop damage and
compensation, and gaining their support and acceptance during project implementation. In
response to the political and social changes in the country and to enhance the farmers’ level of
ownership of the project, the EPADP worked to enhance the consultation approach with farmers
to avoid future objection and ensure consensus and acceptance of the project before commencing
any actual work.

40.     One key measure included the introduction of an early pre-tender seminar in each contract
area. The pre-tender seminars are conducted by the DAS and are added to the series of
consultations that the DAS conducts during various stages, namely pre tender, before
implementation, during implementation, and after completion. The EPADP also sometimes
complements the consultation activities with other tools like surveys and questionnaires. Data
collected from the EPADP shows that symposiums, awareness meetings, and questionnaires were
conducted in most of the project areas. All events are carefully documented and archived by the
DAS.

Farmers’ participation

41.     Establishment of Branch Canal WUAs is a policy issue of the MWRI to engage relevant
stakeholders in I&D in an integrated manner. It started with a Dutch-funded project in Fayoum
where the EPADP was one of the involved actors. Under the umbrella of the Dutch-financed Water
Boards Project, eight secondary canals Water Boards have been established; El-Fadli, Al Sakhawi
(Kafr El-Shiekh), Bahr El-Hossan, Del Al Mosallmia (Sharkiyah), El-Rash El-Gharbia, branch
number 6 (Behira), Al Sahel Canal, and Salmia El Baharia (Upper Egypt). Two of these boards
are located within the Bank-financed NDPII areas (El-Fadli and Bahr El-Hossan). Each Water
Board command area was chosen in such a way as to represent a particular combination of I&D
set-up (that is, areas without irrigation improvement but with subsurface drainage, areas without
subsurface drainage but with irrigation improvement, and areas with both irrigation improvement
and subsurface drainage).

42.     Furthermore, a KfW project was financing the establishment of two other Water Boards in
areas where both irrigation improvement and subsurface drainage were implemented (Besentway
and Hamami located in the Western Delta). In these areas, the EPADP engineers conducted the
exercise of participatory design and management. Members of these 10 Water Boards received
training on all drainage related activities.




                                               37
43.    The Directorate General for DAS promoted users’ participation in activities related to
drainage both within and outside the context of Water Boards. The NDPII financed the
procurement of equipment and the cost of producing bulletins, posters, television films, televisions,
video cassette recorders, and so on, to educate and raise awareness among users.

44.     While the activities were successful, it was clear that the absence of a full legal status
threatens the sustainability of these institutions. The MWRI was in the process of issuing a new
I&D law that includes clauses to empower and provide the legal status to the Water Boards. The
draft of the new law is pending the election of a new parliament following the January 25
Revolution. Once enacted, the law will enable the transfer of some government mandates to the
Water Boards.

E. Environmental issues

45.     One of the PDOs was to identify and oversee the resolution of environmental issues
resulting from the discharge of untreated industrial and domestic wastewater into the open drains
in the project area. The project’s achievements related to the environmental issues are listed:

      Establishing the Environmental Unit and building its capacity. The Environmental Unit is
       now well established and undertakes its assigned tasks.
      Training courses, local and overseas, were provided to enhance the capacity of the
       Environmental Unit staff, in addition to on–the-job training provided by the environmental
       consultant assigned to the project.
      Major sources of pollution into the open drains were identified. The EPADP conducted
       site-specific environmental reviews in 10 priority areas and recommended measures for
       pollution abatement. The project also identified the need for priority actions to upgrade the
       environmental conditions at El Khadrawia Drain. This requirement, although it took a long
       time, has been addressed by another Global Environment Facility project (The Enhanced
       Water Resources Management Project) currently being implemented.
      The EPADP carried out a study titled ‘Covering of Agricultural Drains in Residential Areas
       in Egypt’, which has concluded that covering of open drains is not the best solution due to
       high costs and the lack of participation from the communities. This conclusion is important
       for rationalizing the efforts for reducing environmental pressures on open drains.
      The water quality monitoring network in open drains has been improved throughout the
       implementation of the project.

46.    The following issues, specific to the project activities, could have been more effectively
handled by the project:

      The safeguards instrument (EMP) focused on the higher-level external issues and did not
       identify the requirements for managing higher risk interventions, such as the disposal of
       dredged materials from open drains and construction of siphons.
      These requirements had been recognized during the Bank’s supervision as the supervision




                                                38
          mission in June 2007 16 emphasized that contractors, taking safety measures into
          consideration, should prepare an Environmental Impact Assessment for any works and
          that the EPADP should include environmental provisions in the standard tender
          documents. This requirement was implemented in 2009 before the close of NDPII.
         The AF used the same safeguards instrument as NDPII; however, it would have been more
          effective if an Environmental and Social Management Framework had been used to
          identify interventions/locations of the project that would have needed more thorough
          analysis of impacts.

F. MIS

47.    To improve the flow and sharing of information, the EPADP, through its Directorate
General of Information Systems (DGIS), managed to undertake the following actions to improve
information management:

         In March 2003 (using Dutch funds), prepared a MIS-dedicated module for Planning
          and Follow-up functions. The DGIS employed a firm (since 2004) to administer
          and maintain the installed system.
         Engaged a short-term consultant to assist the DGIS in improving and extending the
          MIS by evaluating its status and assessing future needs, preparing bidding
          documents to purchase needed hardware and software, and providing advice during
          bid evaluation and implementation of the contract.
         Formed a Steering Committee to identify needs, coordinate operations, and follow
          up on implementation.
         The implementation status on December 31, 2011 stood as follows:
         (a) Applications and management systems were developed.
         (b) Hardware and basic software were delivered and installed in the HQ and the regions.
        Training of system managers and administrators on operating systems was completed in
          a total of 1,710 man-days. In addition, training was provided for the end users within the
          EPADP’s departments and units (400 trainees; 1,060 man-days) on the various MIS
          applications.

48.      Findings of the preparatory February mission. The MIS is an important management
tool. Its development started in 2007 but it is still not satisfactorily functioning. The MIS package
includes the hardware, software, applications, and training. The cost of installation was
US$850,000, with an additional US$100,000 running cost. Training was done for staff and end
users (over 270 people; 8–10 people per regional directorate). The trained staff were subject to
high rotation, ending in different assignments.

49. The MIS includes the following applications:




16
     Aide-Memoire of follow-up mission June 3–12, 2007.



                                                 39
        FM (fixed assets, storage, procurement, payments, and so on). The application is 100
         percent readily available but not operational. It is claimed that the employees prefer
         manual processing of transactions.
        HR (personnel and payroll data); partly operational.
        GIS (includes surface and drainage systems, evaluation, drawings archive, and so on).
        Drainage machinery and equipment (registry of machines, status, and so on) used in
         evaluating bids.
        Planning, evaluation, and follow-up database; (application is 97 percent complete).
        Communication registry of regional affairs (communications between HQ and regional
         directorates).
        General archive.
        Videoconference facilities between the regional directorates and HQ are functional but
         not often in use.
50.     The only fully functional application in use as on February 2015 is the GIS application;
several applications need extra work. The MIS is still in the guarantee phase and negotiation was
going on between the EPADP and the contractor to finalize the work. The Directorate General for
MIS prepared a 6-month plan for providing support and follow-up for the regional offices. The
total number of staff of the central MIS Department is 33 persons; among them, only 5 are skilled.

51. The main constraints facing the MIS Department are as listed:

   (a)   Lack of maintenance cost after the end of the guarantee period;
   (b)   Lack of TA (AF-NDPII did not include provision for TA);
   (c)   Lack of overseas training;
   (d)   Outdated servers and terminals slowing down the operation; and
   (e)   Fast turnover of staff
G. Staff training

52.     The EPADP staff training had been undertaken using the national budget as well as through
the INTESP. As of June 2011, the EPADP arranged for training of about 13,500 persons
(equivalent to 137,450 man-days of training) at about 25 different training centers, covering a very
wide spectrum of training themes (technical, legal, administration, financial, computer science,
language, and so on). Furthermore, 36 engineers attended a seminar and three study tours and 14
persons attended a two-week training course for the trainers on Land and Water Management. In
addition, as of October 2004, KfW provided funds, through its MDPII/RDNQ project, for 3,830
man-days of in-country training and 84 man-days of overseas training provided to 690 trainees
(trainers and trainees) on at least 30 themes. The in-country training is about 50 percent complete
while the overseas training is 100 percent complete.

53.     The EPADP benefited from a central safeguards training workshop that was delivered by
the Bank in October 2013. The Bank also provided training in September 2014 to the teams
engaged in handling environmental and social safeguards. In addition to the team of the
Environmental and Monitoring Department of the EPADP, teams from the DG-DAS and relevant
staff engaged in contract management and crop compensation benefited from the training. The
training aimed to build capacity and strengthen the level of awareness of the participants from


                                                40
three governorates on the Bank’s environmental and social safeguards issues. The training also
aimed to help the targeted participants set a plan to reflect on the safeguards issues that they had
learned and improve the project implementation and supervision.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

I.     Introduction and Background
1.      Under the National Drainage Program of the GOE, the EPADP provided a command area
of 6.4 million fed with subsurface drainage as well as periodic rehabilitation of the old deteriorated
subsurface drainage networks. This program included remodeling of 7.2 million fed of surface
open drains to maintain necessary depths for effective functioning of the subsurface drainage.
About 5.9 million fed (92 percent) had been provided with subsurface field drains and open drain
systems serving 7.2 million fed (100 percent) were improved and remodeled.

2.      Under this program, the NDPII PAD planned cost was US$278.4 million, to be
implemented between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2011. Its main objectives were to (a) increase the
agricultural productivity of about 0.8 million fed of irrigated land by improving drainage
conditions through enhanced evacuation of excess irrigation water with subsurface drains into
existing open drains and (b) avoid yield and production losses on this land, which would result if
waterlogging and soil salinity problems were to persist. Other project objectives included building
capacity in the EPADP through institutional support, TA, and training activities. The project also
aimed to assist in identifying and addressing the environmental issues resulting from the discharge
of untreated raw industrial and domestic waste into a few open drains in the project areas. As the
NDPII achieved most of its objectives, an AF from IBRD started in August 2011 and was
completed in March 2015. The AF aimed to increase the agricultural productivity of about an
additional 90,000 fed of irrigated land.

3.      The NDPII PAD and the AF Project Paper (PP) included estimations of an ex ante NPV
and ERR for the proposed investments based on estimation of expected benefits at the level of the
major crops being grown in the five main regions (East, Central, and West Delta; Middle Egypt;
and Upper Egypt). The NDPII PAD estimated an ERR of 23 percent and an NPV of LE 607 million
(at year 2000 constant prices) while the AF PP estimated the ERR at 24 percent and the NPV at
LE 195 million.

4.      For this ICR, the results indicators were re-estimated based on the increasing crop yields
information gathered by the EPADP M&E Unit during implementation. The scenarios
representing the ‘with’ and ‘without’ project situations were estimated for comparing updated
projections of expected benefits with the project investment costs valued at the time of the analysis
(2015 values). The scenarios were built based on the M&E Unit data of the yield changes observed
in sampled areas where yields were monitored before and three years after improvements. Since
no control area was monitored by the M&E Unit, the ‘without project’ scenario was assumed to
be similar to the ‘before’ situation remaining unchanged.

5.      The continuous monitoring data provided by the EPADP M&E Unit shows that as a result
of the drainage improvements, the water table has been lowered to an average of about 1 m below
ground level. Three years after completion, with the improved drainage and decline in salinity,
crop yields of the subsurface drainage area were reported by the M&E Unit to have increased by
amounts from 9 percent to 24 percent, depending on the crop type, while the cost of the subsurface
drainage is being recovered from farmer beneficiaries through the land tax mechanism.




                                                 42
6.      This annex presents an ex post economic and financial analysis (EFA) of the NDPII and
its AF investment, valuing the main achievements and impact to estimate the results indicators. At
project closing, the overall investment shows an ERR of 36.6 percent and an NPV of LE 7.2 billion.

II.     Assumptions for the Analysis
7.      The methodology applied for structuring the evaluation scenarios was similar to the one
used for the EFA prepared for the NDPII PAD and the AF PP at their appraisal stages. ‘With
project’ and ‘without project’ situations were modelled. Causal assumptions about costs and
benefits and the required technical coefficients and parameters supporting the crop budget analysis
were based on current (2015) field and cost estimations observed. Results being obtained from
investments were valued using (a) financial (or market) prices for assessing the farmer results’
perspective (farmers’ income improvements and poverty alleviation effects) and (b) economic
(border or shadow) prices to assess the project impact from the country’s social and economic
perspective.

8.      All project costs under the NDPII and its AF for the improvements of the drainage systems
and the project support activities from 2002 to 2015 were included even when not all their benefits
were quantified. Tables in annex 1 summarize the actual project investments and its sources of
financing in current terms. However, since current U.S. dollars spent in 2002 and in 2015 are very
different in real terms, all project costs were inflated by an annual rate of 10 percent per year,17
which corresponds to the average discount rate in Egypt for 2002–2015. The estimated NPV of
the NDPII and its AF project investments during 2002–2015, inflated with a 10 percent annual
rate, was US$601.5 million in constant 2015 values (US$571.2 million under NDPII and US$30.3
million under the AF).

9.      This investment amount was checked with the EPADP’s estimates of the 2015 costs for
improving the drainage systems per fed under the project. Table 3.1 shows the estimates for the
main project regions. After multiplying the average costs by the fed improved under the project,
the total cost of improving the 1,024,747 fed (expressed in 2015 constant value terms) is US$403.2
million. By adding the additional US$80 million spent on equipment, materials, spare parts, inputs
for the pipe factories, some environmental activities, and institutional support—also expressed in
2015 value terms (US$204.9 million), the total project costs would have reached US$608.1 million

10.     The project benefits quantification was based on data derived from the NDPII monitoring
activities and the performance indicators of the improved drainage systems (effect on groundwater
table and soil and water salinity), and its impact on agricultural production. During project
implementation, the M&E Unit of the EPADP selected 14 sample areas for monitoring the project
impact. A substantial number of observation wells were drilled in the sample areas; soil and water
samples were taken and sent for analysis to one of the EPDAP’s five regional soil and water
laboratories; and data concerning crop production and yields were seasonally collected. For
measuring yield and modeling crop production data, the EPADP contracted the Central
Agricultural Economic and Statistic and financed this operation from its own budget. The data on
physical and impact monitoring were transmitted to the EPADP’s M&E Unit for analysis to
produce monitoring reports comparing the situation before and after the installation and/or
improvement of the drainage system. Tables 3.2 and 3.3 show the average increases in crop yield
after implementation of new subsurface or rehabilitation of deteriorated drainage networks within
the project sampled area.

III.     Financial Analysis
11.      Average crop yields before and after the project improvements show the estimated
average increased productivity for the major crops, the resulting gross revenue, the input and labor
costs involved in both scenarios, and the net revenues per fed before and after labor costs. Based
on the M&E Unit data, the main project impact was analyzed by estimating the incremental net
benefits obtained by the benefitted farmers through their cropping activities, as water drainage in
their field was improved and crop yields increased. Average prices for 2015 were used. Physical
and financial results were estimated and introduced in crop and farm representative budget models
with FARMOD18 to represent the ‘with’ and ‘without’ project scenarios. Farm models were also
used to assess the impact of the project on beneficiaries’ income and to check their capacity to pay
for cost recovery of the investments financed with the project. Table 3.4 presents the main typical
crops, as well as the parameters and values used for the financial analysis.

            Note: Yield increases are based on a yield development period of three years. An average
            increase of 15 percent indicates that improvement works are completed in year 1 and that
            about 7.5 percent yield increases would follow in each of the subsequent two years.

   Detailed tables showing average budgets per crop (or typical farm) are presented in Tables 1 to 14 (crops) and 15
to 17 (farms) in the file ICR_NDP2_EFA.xls (in project files). In each table, the ‘existing technology’ column
represents the ‘without the project’ scenario while the ‘new technology’ column represents the ‘with the project’
situation. The resulting income, after labor costs, provides an estimate of the average incremental net benefit that is
being attained for each of the main crops being grown in the project areas (or benefitted farms).

12.     The expected productivity gains and values shown in table 3.4 are estimated averages for
the project’s five main irrigated regions where more than 1 million fed with improved drainage
were developed under the NDPII and its AF. These crop budgets are the basis for estimating the
financial and economic benefits of the completed drainage improvements. Yields were assumed
to increase at least by about 10 to 12 percent while net income per cultivated fed has increased by
10 to 200 percent as a result of the combined effects of higher yields with similar costs of
production. The improvement in soil condition as a result of less waterlogging and lower salinity
by itself improved crop productivity. Yield increases were confirmed with the systematic data
collected by the M&E Unit. Overall averages have been taken from all sites for each crop, both
for the three-year average before improvement (base year) and for the three years after project
improvement. All crops produced and inputs used have been valued at mid-2015 farm gate prices
as reported by farmers during the field visits.

13.     Farm budgets representing the typical rural household production systems were also
prepared. Primary sources of income including off-farm employment sources, farming production
costs, on-farm self-consumption, and repayment of the investment cost of project subsurface
drainage improvements (about LE 3,000 invested per fed)—in 10 years without interest charges—
and other relevant parameters were used. The expected impact of the improvements on the family
income of farmers and their capacity to pay for full recovery of the investment are summarized in
table 3.5.

14.     As shown in table 3.1, current costs of the subsurface drainage works were valued by the
EPADP at LE 2,882 (US$384) to LE 3,135 (US$418) per fed depending on the region: Nile Delta,
Middle, or Upper Egypt. The investments are being recovered from beneficiaries through the land
tax mechanism over a 20-year period, free of interest. However, for the purposes of this analysis,
it was assumed that these costs were recovered in 10 years, interest free, so annual payments per
year were assumed to be about LE 300 (US$40) per fed. Even in this scenario, the net margin per
farm after repayment would be roughly 6 to 13 percent higher than before the improvement.

15.     These models confirm the financial positive impact of the NDPII interventions and the
increase on beneficiaries’ family incomes under the prevailing cropping patterns. As shown in
table 3.5 (and in tables 15 to 17 in the appendix in project files), the project’s investments allowed
not only an increase in farmers’ income but also the recovery of a significant portion of the capital
investment costs. Income increases for smaller farms are proportionally lower because they are
more dependent on off-farm sources of income that are not affected by the project interventions.
In addition, the improved drainage condition of soils facilitates the diversification to higher-value
crops which could improve even further the results of the project interventions.

IV.      Economic Analysis
16.     Conversion to Egyptian pounds assumed an exchange rate of LE 7.83 for US$1.
Conversion factors (CFs) for shadow pricing were applied for energy costs, based on estimates
taking into account the high levels of existing subsidies on Egypt’s energy prices (CFs were 3.07
and 2.15 for diesel and electricity costs, respectively).20 For fertilizers, a CF of 1.08 was used. For
mechanized operations of all types, a CF of 0.95 was adopted. Economic prices for other traded
inputs and outputs were considered to be in line with their border prices and were not expected to
show major variations in the future. No adjustment was considered for the cost of labor; the
average daily rate for labor of LE 75 (US$10) used in the financial analysis was taken as
representative of the shadow value of labor. Following the methodology used in the PAD and the
AF PP, the analysis assumed a 20- to 30-year life span of the subsurface drainage works and has
adopted a 30-year period for calculation of the economic benefits.

17.     The NDPII and its AF improved areas in each of the five regions where the project
intervened (Table 3.6) and the results being obtained by beneficiaries through their production
activities after the project drainage improvements were matched for allowing the assessment of
the project results. The existing cropping pattern for each region was used for the aggregation of
benefits.

18.     Table 3.7 presents the NDPII and its AF economic results. The net value of production in
the project areas has increased with the improved drainage systems from about LE 4.9 billion to
LE 6.6 billion, mainly as a result of productivity gains. The ERR of the investments is estimated
at 36.6 percent and the NPV, with 10 percent as discount rate, at LE 7.2 billion (US$960 million).
These results do not take into account other expected benefits, including those derived from a

   Since the mid-1980s the GOE has moved from an emphasis on state planning and high levels of protection toward
a reliance on private economic activity and trade openness. However, huge energy subsidies still distort market prices
by creating additional advantages to some sectors relative to others. Energy subsidies are estimated to cost billions of
dollars per year.

strengthened implementation capacity of the EPADP or from the environmental benefits
developed through the activities financed under the project. The analysis per region shows similar
results for the five main irrigation regions: the ERR for the Central Delta area was 39.7 percent,
while for the East and West Delta, the ERR was about 34 percent. For the Middle Egypt area the
investments showed an ERR of 38.6 percent, while for the Upper Egypt area, it reached 32.3
percent. Details of results per regions are shown in tables 18 to 22 of the appendix in the project
files.

V.     Sensitivity Analysis and Conclusions
19.     If the drainage improvement investment costs had been 50 percent higher than the actual
costs in 2015 constant values, the overall ERR would still be 24.9 percent (NPV at LE 5.7 billion
or US$760 million). If prices of the main products from irrigated agriculture were to drop by 20
percent from the prices used for the estimated benefits, the overall ERR would drop to 29.2 percent
(NPV at LE 5 billion or US$666.7 million). If both events occurred simultaneously (that is,
investment is up by 50 percent and the price of products is down by 20 percent below estimated
levels), the ERR would be reduced to 19.7 percent (NPV at LE 3.6 billion or US$480 million).

20.     This ICR assessment confirms the economic and financial justification of investments
aiming to improve the drainage systems in irrigated areas in Egypt. The benefits from maintaining
this infrastructure to be functional results in significant returns and is clearly justified; the
incremental benefits both from the point of view of farmers’ incomes and of the country’s economy
as a whole are positive and robust against major risks. Results of systematic monitoring confirm a
solid and almost guaranteed positive impact even under the most adverse scenarios.

INTRODUCTION

Egypt is one of the oldest agricultural countries in the history of mankind. At the turn of the 19th
century, perennial irrigation was introduced in the Nile Delta and Valley.
This led to the rise of groundwater table and consequently, problems of water logging and soil
salinity emerged. Both poor water management and inadequate water table control contributed
significantly to these problems. As a consequent result of these problems the productivity of the
agricultural land decreased. Therefore, a wide drainage network had been installed to improve the
agricultural land, prevent deterioration of its soil structure, and combat water logging and salinity
problems. The EPADP is the responsible entity for implementing the drainage policy of the
Egyptian Government and to this end it prepares the short and long term plans, carries out field
investigations, and makes designs and implements main open drains and subsurface field drains.
It also installs pumping stations and produces drainage materials. Moreover, EPADP is responsible
for carrying out the maintenance of subsurface drainage networks and open drains.
EPADP targets providing a total command area of 6.4 million feddans with subsurface drainage
as well as rehabilitation of the old deteriorated subsurface drainage networks, also remodeling of
7.2 million feddans of surface open drains to maintain required depths for effective subsurface
drainage, and the reclamation of 0.8 million feddans. About 5.9 million feddans (92%) had been
provided with subsurface field drains and open drain systems serving 8.0 million feddans (100%)
were improved and remodeled.
The NDPII was the second time slice of the Government's National Drainage Program of which
the first phase (consisting of about 0.7 million feddans of subsurface drainage) had been completed
under the World Bank-financed NDP (Ln. No. 3417/Cr. No. 2313-EGT) with cofinancing from
KfW (Germany) and the Netherlands and which itself had followed five earlier satisfactorily
executed drainage projects. The project's main objectives were to: (i) increase the agricultural
productivity of about 0.8 million feddan of irrigated land by improving drainage conditions
through evacuation of excess irrigation water with subsurface drains into existing open drains; and
(ii) avoid yield and production losses on this land, which would result if water logging and soil
salinity problems were to persist.
Other project objectives included building capacity of the EPADP through institutional support,
TA and training activities provided under bilateral donors' assistance. In addition, the project has
assisted in identifying and addressing the environmental issues resulting from the discharge of
untreated raw industrial and domestic waste into a few open drains in the project areas.
The NDPII was a cofinanced project by the WB, KfW, Dutch Government, EIB together with the
Egyptian Government. The total project cost was planned at US$ 278.4 million.
This project had been additionally financed by IBRD. The Additional Finance of NDPII was
effected in August 2011 and completed in March 2015.
The Additional Finance aimed to increase the agricultural productivity of about 90 thousand
feddans of irrigated land.

Component 5: Institutional Support US$10.43 Million

Privatization of Pipe Factories;
According to the Minister request at project beginning, meetings were held with representatives of
the private sector in the field of pipe industries to discuss their proposals and ideas about EPADP
pipe factories privatization. A study was prepared by the Pipe Factories Directorate to separate the
pipe factories assets needed for the production process from the other assets. But finally, the
Cabinet issued a decree that the pipes factories remain under EPADP authority.

Private Sector Participation (PSP) in Maintenance Activities
EPADP completed two activities related to PSP in maintenance: a) an inventory of all equipment
owned by EPADP which are used for maintenance work; and b) a study (Dutch funded - INTESP)
to assess the availability and capacity of the local contractors who could implement the drainage
maintenance work at the secondary and the tertiary levels.

The activity was being carried out through joint support from the NDPII and the KfW financed
Second Maintenance of Drains Project (MDP II). The approach, suggested in the activity, would
allow for more involvement of small contractors in maintenance activities and reduce the
dependence on large contractors and EPADP force account. EPADP has already introduced PSP
in the maintenance of subsurface drainage activities through tendering 12 contracts with total
60,000 feddans to be executed by private contractors.

Farmers’ Participation
Under the umbrella of the Dutch financed Water Boards Project, eight secondary canals Water
Boards have been established (total project cost US$ 4.2 million including a GOE contribution of
LE 3.0 million). Furthermore under the Project, KfW has financed the establishment of two more
Water Boards (about US$ 2.0 million including GOE contribution of about US$ 1.0 million) for
areas, which have both irrigation improvement and subsurface drainage.

EPADP’s Institutional Reform Unit (IRU)
A central IRU, linked to the Minister’s Technical Office Sector, plays the leading role in the
development and coordination of implementation of a vision for Institutional Reform (IR) within
MWRI that includes EPADP.

Environment
The unit was established in 2000 as a department belongs to the Planning and Follow up
Directorate of EPADP. EPADP Environmental Unit (EU) is concerned with listing all pollution
sources on the open drains in NDPII areas and take a lot of measurements for water quality in the
open drains in these areas and tried to improve them through the communication and coordination



                                                77
with the other participating parties to find practical solutions for the sewage and industrial wastes
problems, as well as the solid wastes.

Training
EPADP staff training had been undertaken using the national budget as well as through INTESP.
And the total number of trained staff under NDPII was about 13,500 persons (equivalent to 137,450
of man-days training) at about 25 different training centers. A very wide spectrum of training
themes had been covered by all those training activities (technical, legal, administration, financial,
computer science, language, etc.). The total costs of the training provided through INTESP were
about US$0.5 million. In October 2004, KfW provided funds through its MDPII/RDNQ 3-years
project, for training (In country: Euro 67,000 and overseas: Euro 33,000).

M&E
The monitoring activities focused on the performance indicators of drainage system (effect on
groundwater table, and soil and water salinity), and impact on agricultural production. During project
M&E directorate of EPADP selected 14 sample areas for monitoring of NDPII impact.

The next two tables shows the increase average in crop yield after implementation or rehabilitation of
subsurface drainage networks within the project

        MIS
        EPADP, through its DGIS, managed to undertake preparing in March 2003 (using Dutch Funds),
        a MIS dedicated to the Planning and Follow-up functions. EPADP has engaged a short-term
        consultant to assist the DGIS in improving and extending its MIS and preparing bidding documents
        related the hardware and software requirements and providing advice during bid evaluation and
        implementation of the contract. The Consultant has prepared the MIS Implementation bidding
        documents and assisted EPADP in the evaluation of bids. The MIS contract with the Fujitsu
        Company was signed on June 12, 2007. The total period of this contract was extended till
        31/12/2009, then a request was submitted to the WB from Fujitsu to extend the project till
        20/3/2010, with total price US$1.9 million (including the 17 months warranty). Fujitsu has
        completed the infrastructure needed for the project, most of the systems, technical training

       The implementation status till NDPII end was as follow:
    -     Applications : The application of development activities has been achieved and it is operating,
          the following systems: i) The Financial and Equipment Systems; ii) All the systems are
          completed;
    -     Hardware : 100% of the hardware and basic software are delivered and installed in the head
          quarters and the regions;
    -     Training : Training program was rescheduled to match the delays occurred in the beginning
          of implementation. The technical and end-users courses have been completed.


        Drainage Norms & Procedures
        EPADP had completed the following steps in the framework of the Quality Control System Update
        exercise: (i) establishing an inventory of existing norms and procedures; (ii) identifying missing
        norms and procedures; (iii) reviewing and completing of all norms, standards and quality control
        procedures; and (iv) formal approving of norms, standards and procedures by EPADP. After
        completing the above steps by the end of 2004, EPADP had started the process of incorporating the
        norms in its bidding documents and as a consequence, bidding documents (in Arabic) for contracts
        to be financed locally had already been modified.

Benchmarking
EPADP has extended benchmark activities to include financial, operational, socio-economic and
environmental factors with more focused objectives and involvement of all stakeholders.
Benchmarking works were executed in two levels; the first was on drainage area level or on the
sub-center level. The second stage was executed on the drainage centers' level.

        Institutional Support
        The institutional activities that were running under NDPII like (M&E, Environmental Unit
        and MIS system) have continued their activities under additional financing, A new
        institutional activity was established under additional financing like Enhancing Quality
        Control and Quality Assurance in EPADP.

        Enhancing Quality Control and Quality Assurance in EPADP
        The central Directorate of QC&QA was established under additional financing project of
        NDPII. The main objectives are to address and check the criteria to control the technical and
        administrative works of EPADP by assuring their compatibility with the national and
        international quality standards. The final product aims to beneficiaries' (farmers) satisfaction
        through preparing and modifying QC&QA manuals and monitoring the applying of quality
        assurance criteria in the fields of Field investigation and studies, Design, Project
        implementation, Periodical reports and Information systems.

(C)    Comments
       Despite the fact that NDPII was a very successful Project and over -targets have been implemented,
       still Additional Finance of NDPII has not achieved all the aimed targets for the following reasons:

      Factors affecting Results
          Extraordinary political situation of Egypt at the project beginning and security chaos
          Delaying the loan effectiveness and also delaying the first loan payment
          Shortage of Funding of powder for pipes' production and WB refusal to use the
            remaining amount of the loan for the procurement of materials.
          Farmers objections
          Shortage of gasoline and power
          MIS component (upgrade the hardware and network equipment and upgrade the Data
            Center) was one of the main components of Additional Finance of NDPII, but was not
            implemented because the minister of MWRI in 2013 refused to start implementing the
            new phase before the total completion of the first phase that has been done through
            NDPII. Then after settling on using the MIS allocations in upgrading the deteriorating
            servers and hardware, it could not be done regarding the short time left in AF-NDPII.

      Post Completion Operation
          Plans for a new phase of the project has been initiated with the same targets and
             sequence as the other first two phases to continue the implementation of Egypt overall
             target of providing 6.4 million feddans with subsurface drainage and rehabilitation of
             old networks and open drains.
          EPADP will continue the O&M activities through its regional offices and with sharing
             of collectors users associations.
            Pipe lines factories will continue working under the umbrella of EPADP but with
              sharing of private sector.

Lessons learned
     Assuring good sector work prior to appraisal and coordination between donors can be
        very valuable in assisting the borrower to start the project on correct basis and facilitate
        work implementation.
     The project should have a Steering Committee to evaluate the progress of project.
      All staff involved in the project implementation should be aware of the project
        appraisal and its targets.
      Forming groups of beneficiaries to follow subsurface networks performance and
        maintenance, activation of collector users associations.
      Environmental assessment for project areas must be done before tendering for
        contractors.
      Including environmental factors as main part in contractors' contracts.
      Funding environmental management plan implementation instead of consultants and
        studies only.
      Detailed and specialized economical assessment contains all information concerning
        agricultural productivity, productivity per Fadden and cultivation cost comparing other
        chances, should be done for the project areas during the whole project time by
        supporting the Monitoring and Evaluation Directorate.
      The necessity of establishing a unit for project management including a social
        specialist and economic specialist.
      Project areas must be awarded early as possible to complete execution before project
        closing.
      Beneficiaries' objections have been decreased after the new procedure followed by
        EPADP to hold advisory symposia before project implementation by Drainage
        Advisory Service directorate of EPADP, about the importance of subsurface drainage
        and its incomes.
      Other precautions were taken that cause lowering the beneficiaries complains like the
        period of 4 months for compensation, periodic reevaluation of compensation list and
        bind contractors to warehouse pipes before implementation.
      The delay of crop compensation payment was overcame by bank payment
      Increasing of bank's financing percentages leads to better results.
      The bank should train EPADP staff on bank procedures and policies all through the
        project.
      Both planning and the subsequent O&M of drainage management programs and use
        of data, should be the basis of the entire development process.
      Sustainable government commitment is crucial for smooth project implementation.
      Capacity building is essential. The project also showed the time and effort needed to
        build capacity of EPADP.
      When preparing a project like MIS, timing should be precisely considered as
       preparation procedures (tendering, retendering, evaluation …..) are taking more time
       from the project implementation time that is mostly calculated on the technical
       implementation time only.
      There should be overseas training for the supervisors of the MIS project of MIS
        department in order to benefit from the actual application of the up to date systems in
        this field.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

KfW generally concurs with the World Bank’s conclusions presented further to the ICR on
NDPII.
The development objectives of the project remain highly relevant in the context of the
Egyptian irrigation sector. The systematic expansion, rehabilitation and replacement of the
vast drainage infrastructure embracing the entire Nile valley and delta on a national scale
is indispensable for securing the sustainability of the Egyptian irrigation sector. This is to
emphasize even more given the major socio-economic, and thus political, importance of
the irrigation sector with regard to its employment impact on a significant, largely poor,
part of the Egyptian population in rural areas.
The defined project development goals have been achieved. In particular the project has
contributed to increasing agricultural yields of major corps and thus to farm incomes in the
intervention areas. This was achieved through the implementation of appropriate drainage
infrastructure, which lowers the water table, to an extent ensuring the avoidance of water
logging and salinity on farm land, thus stabilizing agricultural productivity.
The design of the project was partly ambitious and not entirely implemented as planned.
This implies remaining challenges for future drainage investments in Egypt.
In particular improving the institutional effectiveness and efficiency of EPADP remains a
challenge:
      At the outset of the project privatization of drainage-pipe factories under the
       responsibility of EPADP was envisaged. This approach was eventually abandoned
       by the Egyptian government. At the same time keeping these factories operational
       at their required capacity, and even more at their nominal capacity resulted in being
       a constant bottleneck. Also, private pipe suppliers have not been harnessed
       effectively to remove this bottleneck. As a result pipe availability has been a
       structural bottleneck for the implementation of drainage contracts in the framework
       of the project.
      EPADP’s staff size has almost tripled from a total of about 7,000 to more than
       20,000 since project appraisal of NDPII. This has implications on EPADP’s cost
       effectiveness and implies a challenge on its organizational efficiency but also
       effectiveness.
Beneficiary involvement through Branch Canal WUA, CUA and water boards, the latter
ones so far established on a pilot level, in the planning, monitoring and maintenance of
drainage infrastructure requires further improvement.
Also, the role of the IWRMD regarding drainage activities needs to be strengthened and
the coordination between EPADP and the IMWD improved.
Maintenance of open drainage canals remains a major challenge. Illegal waste disposal into
these canals is rife and relevant rules and laws are not enforced. As a result the canals’
capacity, and thus their effectiveness, is systematically reduced. At the same time health
risks are inflicted upon the concerned population. This requires appropriate and constant
sensitization campaigns as well as an improved coordination between EPADP and other

relevant authorities concerned, to the effect of mitigating illegal waste disposal into open
drainage canals.
