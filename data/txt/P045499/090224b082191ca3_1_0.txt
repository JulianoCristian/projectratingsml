                         has been completed, benefiting about 45,730 farm families. Over 90 percent of the loan has been committed and over 22 percent of the total additional loan has been disbursed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Overall, project implementation continues to improve. All sub-surface drainage contracts are under implementation. About 54 percent of the project target area (of 93,300 feddans)
                         has been completed, benefiting about 45,730 farm families. Over 90 percent of the loan has been committed and over 22 percent of the total additional loan has been disbursed.
