Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project's main objectives are:(i) to increase the agricultural productivity of about 0.8 million feddans of irrigated land by improving drainage
 conditions through evacuation of excess irrigation water with subsurface drains into existing open drains; and(ii)to avoid yield and production losses
 on this land, which would result if waterlogging and soil salinity problems were to persist.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?
 Yes

 Board Approved Revised Project Development Objective (If project is formally restructured)PHRPDODEL
 1) Increase the efficiency of drainage of about 1 million feddan of irrigated land, (2) increase agricultural production and improve rural income, and
 (3) to identify and oversee the resolution of environmental issues resulting from the discharge into the open drains of untreated industrial and
 domestic waste water in the project area.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project is scheduled to close on March 31, 2015. The recent mission (conducted during October 26 to November 6, 2014) has initiated the ICR
 (Implementation Completion and Results Report) preparation process and agreed on the ICR mission during February 2015.
 Overall, project implementation continues to improve. About 71 percent of the project target area (of 90,000 feddan of subsurface drainage
 improvements) has been completed, benefiting about 60,000 farm families. In terms of financial progress, over 85 percent of the loan proceeds has
 been committed and about 55 percent disbursed.
 Contract management continues to be a challenge. Most state-owned contractors have poor performance track record. Recent Bank mission agreed
 with the client to focus on contract management, including close follow up of works contracts and resolving issues without further delay. Moreover, the
 sustainability of the MIS (management information system) which is a critical component of the overall drainage improvement program in Egypt, in
 which the Government has already spent over 10 million Egyptian Pounds from the project is in great danger unless urgent decision is taken to
 upgrade the sytem. The recent World Bank mission advised the Government to urgently upgrade the MIS.
