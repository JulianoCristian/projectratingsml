Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. A number of useful lessons can be learned from\n            Pakistan's experience with bank restructuring and\n            privatization including the following: 1. NCB reforms could\n            not be carried out without strong government's support\n            and commitment. 2. Public sector banks must undergo cost\n            restructuring before privatization to bring their\n            cost/income ratios in line with private banks.  3. In order\n            to secure a good price for a bank sale, the bank must be\n            recapitalized so that it is able to meet the minimum capital\n            adequacy requirement.  4. Downsizing requires bank\n            management to identify excess manpower in the labor force.\n            5. A formulaic instead of subjective approach should be used\n            to minimize contention, send signals to stakeholders (staff,\n            unions, government officials and politicians) about the\n            intent to change the culture, and ease the legal process. 6.\n            The stock of NPLs must be dealt with through major\n            amendments to loan recovery laws and implementation of\n            government-induced recovery drives.  7. The government must\n            bring in professional management teams from outside to\n            restructure and turn around the failed banks.  8. For\n            privatization to succeed, the government should avoid\n            unrealistic timelines, conduct the sale transparently, lay\n            out clear road maps, launch targeted road shows, and\n            establish a track record to widen investor interest. 9.\n            Restructuring of failed banks is costly but is necessary.\n            The high costs reflect the cumulative costs of\n            mis-governance and poor management."}, "docdt": "2005-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
