               FOURTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                               Credit and Program Summary



Borrower:         The Republic o f Benin.

Amount:           SDR 26.3 million (US$40 m i l l i o n equivalent).

Terms:            Standard IDA terms; 40-year maturity with 10-year grace period.

Description:      The proposed operation constitutes the Fourth Poverty Reduction Support
                  Credit (PRSC) to Benin and the first o f a new series o f three PRSCs.
                  (PRSC4-6) designed to assist the Government o f Benin in implementing i t s
                  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), launched in December 2002.
                  PRSC series are an integral part o f the Bank Group’s Country Assistance
                  Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board o f Executive Directors on July 3,
                  2003. The proposed credit builds on the foundation o f the progress achieved
                  during the first three PRSCs. The overall objective o f the proposed PRSCs i s
                  to support implementation o f Benin’s PRSP and the attainment o f i t s goals,
                  including progress toward reaching the MDGs. Specifically, PRSC 4 would
                  provide support for implementation o f the Government’s reform agenda in
                  the following areas: (i)improving the policy environment for private
                  investment and infrastructure; (ii)pursuing progress toward the MDGs by
                  improving access to basic services and ensuring greater efficiency o f public
                  expenditures on human capital formation; and (iii)           promoting better
                  governance through financial management, c i v i l service and justice reforms.

Benefits:         The proposed PRSC-4 i s expected to have a significant positive impact o n
                  poverty reduction. First, through components designed to improve the
                  business climate and private sector development, the proposed operation
                  would promote economic growth. Second, the strengthening o f public
                  financial management i s expected to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness
                  o f public resources in the delivery o f development services and in reaching
                  the MDGs. Third, equitable development i s an explicit objective o f the
                  PRSP, and the PRSC supports it through components emphasizing access to
                  basic services (such as health, education, water and rural transport).

Risks:            The risks for this operation include: (i)   obstacles to the reform agenda; (ii)
                  weak capacity to implement the reforms; (      iii)

                  currency rates; and (iv) constraints to economic diversification. IDA i s
                  supporting the Government in implementing measures to mitigate these risks
                  by: supporting i t s consistent application o f formal procedures and grounding
                  reforms in participatory processes as well as in the dynamics laid out in the
                  PRSP; enhancing dialogue with the Government, donor coordination and

                 FOURTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                    1. INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document proposes the first o f a new series o f three Poverty Reduction
Support Credits for Benin (PRSCs 4-6), designed to support implementation o f the
Government’s PRSP. The first series o f PRSCs for Benin focused o n improving economic
growth and governance through reforms in the business environment, justice, agriculture and
infrastructure, and through public expenditure management reforms in key sectors, such as
health, education and water. The proposed second series will deepen the focus on improving the
policy environment o f private investment, including supporting completion o f the reforms in the
cotton sector, and infrastructure. The series will also continue to support Government’s measures
to pursue progress toward the MDGs by improving access to basic services and ensuring greater
efficiency o f public expenditures on human capital formation and to promote better governance
through financial management, civil service and justice reforms.

2.     The reform policies supported by this new series are embedded in and aligned with
Benin’s Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP 11). The underlying PRSP covering the
period 2007-2009       and the accompanying Joint Staff Assessment Note (JSAN) will be
considered by the Executive Board on June 14, 2007. An Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) for the PRSC 1-3 series will be completed during 2007, but the preliminary lessons
learned from that PRSC series are taken into account in the design o f this follow-up series, and
more particularly o f PRSC-4.

3.     The design o f the series and especially the design o f PRSC-4 benefited from large
consultations with various stakeholders under the Government’s leadership, and included close
coordination with a group o f donors, who provided budget support to Burkina on PRSP
implementation. This consultative and harmonized approach minimizes the burden on scarce
government capacity and ensures government ownership o f the supported reforms.

                                  2. COUNTRY CONTEXT

4.      Located in the Gulf o f Guinea next to Nigeria in West Africa, Benin i s a small and poor
country with a population o f 7.6 million and a per capita income o f US$510 in 2005. The
country has achieved a successful transition since 1989 from a Marxist-Leninist state towards a
pluralist democracy and a market economy. Following the 1989 fundamental political change,
the country has enjoyed a relative political stability and democracy has been greatly strengthened
with presidential elections regularly taking place with a peaceful transfer o f power. Important
structural reforms have also been undertaken and growth rates averaged around 4.7 percent
annually during the last decade, resulting in modest increases in per capita incomes as well as
improvements in human development. Nonetheless, poverty remains widespread and per capita
income i s below the Sub-Saharan average.

5.     The economy remains heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, in particular cotton
and transit trade with Nigeria, while the informal sector accounts for more than 90 percent o f


                                                7
non-agricultural employment and close to 70 percent o f non-agricultural GDP. The agricultural
sector accounts for about 32 percent o f GDP and provides nearly 70 percent o f the country’s
workforce while cotton i s the major primary export commodity with about 65 percent o f total
exports over 2003-05. Transit trade with Nigeria i s estimated to represent between 6.5 and 7.5
percent o f GDP and explains the vulnerability o f the economy to trade policy changes in i t s
neighboring and main trade partner.

6.      Benin held presidential elections in March o f 2006, and a new government was installed
in April. In M a y 2006, the new Government organized a conference to launch the work on the
new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), announcing the terms o f reference and the
thematic groups assigned to prepare the new document. In October 2006, the Government
announced the strategic orientation for i t s development plan for 2006-201 1, specifying that these
strategic choices will form the framework o f the revised PRSP. Thus in 2006, the Government’s
program continued to be guided by the first PRSP, reviewed by IDA and Fund Boards in March
2003, while a new PRSP (PRSP 1     1) was adopted in April 2007.

                          2.1     RECENT      DEVELOPMENTS
                                       ECONOMIC

7.      Benin’s macroeconomic performance has been broadly on track over the past years but
economic activity has been adversely affected by major external shocks since 2004. Real GDP
growth rate averaged 5 percent over 2000-03 (compared to 4 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa)
aided by the positive effects o f regional trade liberalization. However, in 2004-2005, poor
performance o f the cotton sector under declining international prices and more vigorous efforts
by Nigeria to reduce unofficial imports from Benin led to a slowdown o f economic activity (3
percent in 2004 and 2005) and a decline in exports. Economic growth recovered to 4.1 percent in
2006 reflecting a rebound in cotton and services sectors. Despite the increases in the
international prices o f o i l and in the regional food prices caused by draught in neighboringNiger,
inflation was broadly contained, averaging 2.9 percent over the 2003-2006 period. Although
inflation has remained low, Benin’s competitiveness weakened due to the appreciation o f the real
effective exchange rate (4.9 percent as a result o f the depreciation o f the U S dollar against the
Euro to which the C F A i s pegged) and delays in the implementation o f key structural reforms.

8.      Despite a 10 percent decrease in exports volumes and higher o i l prices, the external
current account deficit (excluding current official grants) narrowed from 8.6 percent o f GDP in
2003 to 7.1 percent o f GDP in 2006 as a result o f lower formal sector o i l imports and weaker
capital goods imports. Consequently, the overall balance o f payments improved slightly from -
0.4 percent o f GDP to 4.7 percent o f GDP over the same period. As a result, Benin contributed
positively to the net foreign assets o f the regional central bank with gross reserves averaging 14.7
months o f imports.

9.      Fiscal consolidation has been a major achievement through the early 2000s. Between
2004 and 2006, fiscal revenue has been maintained at about 16.5 percent o f GDP. Over the same
period, total government expenditures increased from 20.6 percent o f GDP to 21.5 percent o f
GDP due to the increase in poverty-reducing outlays in line with the implementation o f the
Poverty Reduction Strategy. Despite these developments, fiscal discipline has been broadly
maintained with an overall budget deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding grants)
contained to about 4 percent o f GDP in 2004-2005. This was primarily achieved by cutting
domestically financed capital expenditures and non-priority current expenditures.

10.     The fiscal situation weakened further in early 2006 with the accumulation o f domestic
arrears and the temporary surge in exceptional spending procedures (OPs) -- through cash
advance accounts or without prior authorization - to 15 percent o f total spending in 2006. The
new government introduced measures when it took office to improve the budgetary situation and
public expenditure management. These included setting up a treasury committee to monitor tax
collection and budget execution more closely, restoring normal budget execution procedures, and
keeping strict control o f extra-budgetary expenditures. As a result, the overall budget deficit (on
a payment order basis and excluding grants) was maintained at 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2006.

 11.   During 2000-2006, in line with PRSP priorities the Government progressively increased
the budgetary allocation for basic services, although the scope for large increases in priority
public spending has been limited by lower than anticipated fiscal revenues. The share o f total
budget appropriations allocated to basic education, health and rural water increased from 26.0
percent on average in 2000-2002 to 28.7 percent over 2003-2005. The Government has also
maintained allocations to priority sectors in the 2006 revised budget (about 30 percent o f total
budget) and has allocated primarily the MDRI resources to these sectors. However, the major


                                                            9
constraints faced by the sector ministries in budget execution, namely long delays in spending
execution, cuts into domestically-financed investments and high volume o f payment arrears,
have limited the implementation o f sector programs and consequently the progress towards
achieving objectives set out in budget-programs.

12.    The 2007 budget, adopted last December, reflects the orientations o f PRSCII and pursues
the overall reforms in public expenditure management, while making a special effort to raise the
level and quality o f social expenditures, increase absorptive capacity, and enhance resource
management in these sectors.

               2.2     MACROECONOMIC
                                OUTLOOK AND DEBT
                                               SUSTAINABILITY

13.      The Government’s macroeconomic framework over the period 2007-09 i s consistent with
the objectives o f accelerating growth and reducing poverty significantly. Under the assumption
that the Government i s successful in deepening institutional and policy reforms and tackling
difficulties in the cotton sector and other structural problems, economic growth i s expected to
progressively recover from 3.4 percent in 2004-2006 to 5.1 percent in 2007-2009 while inflation
would be limited to less than 3.0 percent on average.

14.     Economic growth would be driven by a rebound in cotton production initiated by the
completion o f the reforms in the sector, a higher trade volume with Nigeria following the
progressive lifting o f trade restrictions in this country and by an increase in transport activities
underpinned by a resumption o f traffic at the Port o f Cotonou as new investments helped restore
the port’s regional competitiveness. Growth performance would also be sustained by an
ambitious public works program that would bring the investment-to-GDP ratio to 22.0 percent in
2007-09 from 18.9 percent in 2004-06. The external current account deficit would narrow from
7.4 percent o f GDP on average over 2004-06 to 6.0 percent on average in 2007-09. The overall
fiscal deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding grants) would widen from 3.6 percent o f
GDP on average over 2004-06 to about 4.3 percent o f GDP in 2007-09 due to the
implementation o f social and development expenditures in the context o f PRSP 1            1. Total
government expenditures would increase by about 2.0 percentage points o f GDP over the period
under review, supported by higher revenue and MDRIresources.

 15.     In March 2003, Benin qualified for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Debt cancellation under HIPC initiative and prudent borrowing
policy helped the country to maintain i t s external debt situation on a sustainable path. The
external debt-to-GDP ratio decreased from 58.3 percent in 2000 to 42 percent at end 2003. Benin
i s also one o f the first 19 countries that have graduated from the H I P C Initiative and have
received 100 percent cancellation o f their eligible debt under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), effective as o f July 2006. Benin’s eligibility to the MDRI reflects its
satisfactory recent economic performance, progress in implementing its Poverty Reduction
Strategy and improvements in public expenditure management. Total debt r e l i e f from IDA, the
IMF and the African Development Bank amounts to approximately US$1.1 billion or 23.2
percent o f 2006 GDP (60 percent o f which provided by IDA). MDRI reduced total public debt to
 13 percent o f GDP at end-2006. However, as stated in the updated Debt Sustainability Analysis
(IMF EBS/06/146), although the risks to medium-term debt sustainability are estimated to be



                                                 10
moderate, i t i s important that the Government continue to conduct a prudent borrowing policy
and rely on concessional loans or grants.

16.    The external financing requirements are estimated at US$217 million in 2007, resulting
in an estimated total financing gap o f US$112 million after projected debt relief (including
MDRI resources). This gap i s expected to be more than fblly covered by disbursements expected
from the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and annual disbursements from multi-year
budget support programs from the African Development Bank (US$2 1.4 million); the European
Union (US$20.9 million), and other development partners (USS19.5 million). This US$40
million equivalent for PRSC 4 would constitute part o f IDA’S contribution to filling the
remaining gap.

                             2.3               OF PROGRESS UNDER PRSP 1
                                       ASSESSMENT

17.     Benin’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was endorsed by the IDA and IMF
Boards in March 2003. The First Annual Progress Report (APR) on the PRSP implementation
was discussed among stakeholders at a conference in February 2005 and reviewed by the IDA
and IMF Boards in June 2005. The Second Annual APR was presented by GOB at a conference
in September 2005, followed by an exchange with development partners. A similar conference
to discuss the Third APR was held in September 2006.

 18.    In September 2006 the Government presented the conclusions o f a study that evaluated
the PRSP implementation during the period 2003-2005. This study showed that Benin’s PRSP
implementation benefited particularly from an institutional framework that was established for
the implementation o f the PRS and from a broad-based participatory process at the national level
during formulation o f the strategy. However, the study observed rather mixed progress in
achieving most o f the PRS goals, and noted weaknesses in the poverty diagnosis and analysis o f
obstacles to private sector development. I t recommended the following: (i)       strengthening the
participation o f civil society, the private sector and beneficiaries during the preparation o f the
second-generation PRSP, and extending this participation systematically into the implementation
and monitoring phases; (ii)      improving the monitoring and evaluations (M&E) system; (iii)
sharpeningthe PSD focus o f the strategy; and (iv) improving the poverty profile.

19.     With respect to progress in reducing poverty during the PRSP period, the incidence o f
monetary poverty slightly decreased from 28.5 percent in 2002 to 27 percent in 2005. The
incidence o f non-monetary poverty was also estimated using a composite indicator derived from
the D H S surveys and the 2002 Census. The incidence o f non-monetary poverty is estimated to
have decreased from 48.9 percent in 2002 to 39.6 percent in 2005. Although these data show
positive trends with regard to the MDG poverty target, they should be considered with caution
because they are based on estimations and as such are entitled to methodological weaknesses.’
This points out to the necessity o f establishing a reliable baseline for measuring poverty and
against which progress can be tracked. In this regard, the National Statistical Institute i s carrying
out an Integrated Household Survey on Living Conditions. The new information from this survey
will be used to refine the poverty profile.



 Weaknesses include difficulties with comparability across surveys sampling and weighting.
20.      Although some progress has been realized in increasing geographical access to health
services from 78 percent in 1998 to 86 percent in 2004 and the utilization rate o f health services
from 34 percent in 2001 to 37 percent in 2005, recent trends suggest that Benin may not be able
to reach some MDG targets in the health sector. Indeed, maternal mortality decreased from 498
per 100,000 live births in 1996 to 474.4 in 2002 but this progression would be insufficient to
reach the MDG target set at about 137 per 100,000. Communicable diseases remain the leading
cause o f morbidity and mortality within the general population. Malaria alone i s the most
common and most deadly disease: in 2004, the incidence rate o f malaria was 133.8 per 1,000
within the target population, while i t reached 500 per 1,000 among infants o f 0-1 1 months and
218 per 1,000 among children aged 1-4 years. Other causes o f morbidity and mortality are
anemia, diarrhea, respiratory infections, and malnutrition. However, recent progress in reducing
child mortality from 146.4 per 1,000 live births in 2002 to 105 in 2005 suggests that the country
i s on track to reach this MDG target. For HIV/AIDS, the prevalence rate decreased from 4.1
percent in 2001 to 2.1 percent in 2005; as a result, prospects for achieving the HIV/AIDS-related
MDG target are good.

21.      Achieving the health sector MDGs will require, among others: (i)   increasing health sector
financing to priority interventions, such as those aiming at boosting child survival (the
Government has recently decided to provide free health care to children under five and the M O H
i s defining the modalities for i t s implementation) and reducing maternal mortality; (ii)
                                                                                          provision


                                                             12
o f adequate financing and increased coverage for essential child and reproductive heath services
at decentralized and community levels; (   i ii)
                                               development o f a global incentive policy (including
financial incentives, training, professional promotion and career development plan) to encourage
deployment o f health personnel to remote and underserved areas; (iv) improved financial access
for the poor to quality health services; and (v) strengthening the public and private sector
partnership for providing quality health services to the poor, especially for those in remote areas.

22.     Prospects for meeting the education goals are better than those for the health sector but
reaching the targets remains a challenge. The gross enrollment rate in primary education
increased from 90 percent in 2001/02 to 94 percent in 2004/05, while the completion rate has
risen from 46 to 54 percent during the same period. Girls’ participation improved with a gross
enrollment rate progressing from 76 percent in 2001/02 to 83 percent in 2004/05 while their
completion rate increased from 34 to 42 percent. However, the primary education completion
rate remains l o w (estimated at 55 percent in 2006) because o f high repetition and drop out rates.
Although the Education for All Fast Track Initiative i s expected to accelerate progress toward
universal primary school completion, an average annual increase o f the magnitude o f 5.0 percent
needed to reach the MDG will be challenging and this MDG target i s likely to be reached only
for boys. W h i l e gender differences in education have been on a falling trend, particularly at the
primary level, the 2005 goal o f parity in primary and secondary education has not been met and
will not be reached by 2015 without reinforced effort. Overall, enhancement o f the ongoing core
reforms and sharp acceleration o f the current trends are needed for the sector to achieve i t s
development goals.

23.     The Government has made significant progress in increasing access to potable water to
the rural population from 35 percent in 2002 to 45 percent in 2006 and the water facilities’
functionality rate has improved from 75 percent in 2002 to 85 percent in 2006. The execution o f
the 2006 program budget has been satisfactory, with 1,787 water points being constructed and
446,750 additional people gaining access to potable water. Since 2002, the sector’s capacity has
been multiplied by three. As a result, Benin i s on track to reach the MDG for rural water supply,
i.e. providing 67.5 percent o f the population in 2015. This means that 6.3 million Beninese
living in a rural or semi-urban environment would gain access to potable water by 2015, against
2.5 million people in 2004. That new prospect regarding the MDG i s the result o f the successful
programmatic approach implemented in partnership with the Bank and other donors. The
Government has also taken strong measures to improve the execution capacity o f the sector that
has more than doubled between 2001 and 2004. Although Benin is on track to reach the MDG
for rural water supply, maintaining these trends will require substantial resources for new
construction and maintenance, along with community participation to improve the quality o f
service.

24.     Under the first PRSP, governance in all i t s dimensions became a central cross-cutting
reform area. In particular, the use o f sectoral program budgets, organized within a medium term
expenditure framework, has become the core system for planning, implementing, and monitoring
development programs, as well as the means for delegating spending authority to the line
ministries and to decentralized levels o f Government. A series o f reforms in internal and
external financial controls, as well as in procurement, ensures that the budget i s implemented
according to what was adopted by the National Assembly. While the recent political transition
led to a surge in spending by payment orders (PO) rather than by standard budget procedures, the


                                                 13
internal control system succeeded in bringing this information to light. Throughout this episode,
budget system staff continued to improve the new budget system and are regularizing the PO
spending.

 3. BANK GROUP’S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S POVERTY REDUCTION
                              STRATEGY

25.    The government reform program i s described in PRSP Iand 1      1. IDA has provided
support through PRSCs-1-3 for the implementation o f PRSP Iand will continue to support PRSP
I1through the proposed new series o f PRSCs.

                              3.1     PROGRESSUNDER PRSCS 1-3

26.    The period o f the first series o f PRSCs saw progress in a number o f areas, as listed
below. Progress on targeted reform measures and related quantitative indicators are summarized
in Annexes 3 and 4.

27.      One o f the most fundamental achievements under the first series o f PRSCs has been the
maintenance o f macroeconomic stability. Despite unfavorable economic shocks, the fiscal
deficit, tax revenues, and inflation have all been maintained within targets set by UEMOA and
IMF-supported programs. The negative shocks, however, have had the effect o f slowing
economic growth, and the share o f private investment in the economy has not grown.
Nevertheless, the new private sector development policy, making use o f the recent DTIS,
Investment Climate Assessment, and Doing Business reports, identified a set o f reforms needed
to improve the business climate. W h i l e the strategy was being prepared for adoption, several of
the included reforms - customs computerization and facilitation, tax administration reform, land
tenure rights - advanced as part o f the 2006 implementation agenda.

28.      Similarly, important strategic decisions have been taken on the nature o f government
involvement in the cotton sector, on i t s regulatory framework, and on how to enforce this
framework within the agreed protocol for private operation o f the sector. The result has been a
more productive organization o f cotton input supplies and output production. Next, the
development o f the rural road strategy established a precedent for extensive consultations with
stakeholders in order to set a road construction plan that serves farmers’ needs. However, the
institutional framework for implementing the plan was delayed during the electoral period.
Progress in the energy sector had long been stalled due to a lack o f critical strategic decisions on
management o f the electricity company. Finally, in 2007 a strategy was chosen and a program to
improve the company’s financial and technical efficiency, as well as to reduce black-outs, i s
being put in place. The budgetary, administrative and judicial reforms have all given new l i f e
and form to the Government’s anti-corruption strategy, adopted in 2005, but re-endorsed by the
new administration in 2006.

                                    3.2     LINKTO THE CAS

29.   The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS for FY04-07, Report No. 26054-BENY
approved by the Board in July 2003) envisages the use o f PRSCs as the key IDA instrument for
supporting the main planks o f Benin’s PRSP, addressing the Government’s request for donor


                                                 14
harmonization around a common set o f measures in key reform areas, and for increasing the
share o f budget support in donor assistance.

30.     PRSC-4 would be the first o f a proposed new series o f three PRSC operations
(PRSC 4-6). The PRSCs would provide programmatic support for implementation o f the
Government’s reform agenda in the following areas: (i)     improving the policy environment for
private investment and infrastructure; (ii) pursuing progress toward the MDGs by improving
access to basic services and ensuring greater efficiency o f public expenditures o n human capital
formation; and ( iii)
                    promoting better governance through financial management, c i v i l service and
justice reforms.

                   3.3                  WITH OTHER
                           COMPLEMENTARITY        BANKACTIVITIES

3 1.    The CAS recognizes the PRSCs as the main instrument for providing program support.
Three operations provide complementary financial and technical assistance in the areas
supported by the PRSCs 4-6. These are: the Private Sector Development Project (1999), the
Electricity Services Delivery Project (2004) and the Energy Sector Development Technical
Assistance Project (2007). The Private Sector Development Project i s helping improve the
business climate, foster public/private sector consultations, and remove administrative barriers to
private sector growth and exports. It includes components to advise and finance transactions
related to the privatization o f Benin Telecom and to the establishment o f a telecom regulator. A
follow-up operation i s being prepared to continue support in these areas. The Energy and
Electricity Projects are designed to improve electricity supply, extend i t s availability to under-
served areas and improve the management and financial sustainability o f the sector. They also
include components to provide for private participation in the electricity sector and to establish
an energy sector regulator. Thus, utility sector reforms will be supported by these investment
credits, while the PRSC series will maintain i t s focus o n the development and adoption o f
regulatory regimes.

             3.4                      WITH OTHER
                         COMPLEMENTARITY                 PARTNERS
                                                DEVELOPMENT

32.     The proposed PRSC series and PRSC 4 complement or leverage the support o f other
development partners. The specific areas for IDA support have been identified in close
coordination with other development partners, aiming for synergy with their respective
interventions and building on IDA’S comparative advantage in these areas. These donors will
continue to collaborate closely during implementation o f the program supported by the proposed
operation, especially through the joint PRSP and budget support reviews.

33.      IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely on the identification o f the respective
institutions’ areas o f focus. The IMF will continue to focus o n macroeconomic issues. In that
context, the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, which was
approved in August 2005, addresses issues related to fiscal consolidation and structural reforms
that are keys to maintaining macroeconomic stability and fostering growth. The first annual
PRGF review was completed in November 2006. IMF and IDA staffs have also collaborated in
supporting the Government for the preparation o f PRSP I1 in close coordination with other
donors.




                                                15
34.     The teams o f IDA and the African Development Bank have increased their efforts to put
in action in Benin the Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) which was signed between the two
organizations in 2002. This led to a better coordination o f their respective activities in the
country and the organization o f joint missions in health, education and rural water sectors as well
as the sharing o f documentations. For 2004-05, the AfDB prepared a budget support program
loan in close coordination with IDA to finance the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Support
Program (PRSSP) in Benin. This program loan, equivalent to US$33.5 million, together with a
grant equivalent to US$1.44 million, was approved on December 10, 2003 and became effective
on August 9, 2004. The content and conditionalities o f this program loan were aligned with the
PRSP and coordinated with PRSC 4 prior actions. On public procurement reform, the AfDB and
IDA teams have enhanced the coordination o f their technical advice, leading to the selection o f
joint sets o f conditionalities and prior actions. The two teams plan to continue to work closely on
public expenditure management reform, public procurement reform, internal and external
controls, and capacity building. I     n July 2006, the AfDB approved a second budget-support
program loan (PRSSP I      I )equivalent
                               ,         to US$21.6 million to support continued implementation o f
the PRSP. The preparation o f PRSC 4 was closely coordinated with the IDA team as well as with
other donors providing budget-support to Benin (see below).

35.     Close coordination with donors providing budget support to Benin (AfDB, EU, Denmark,
the Netherlands, and Switzerland) i s helping improve alignment o f support to Benin’s
PRSPMTEF. The main objectives o f this coordination are to: (a) support the implementation o f
Benin’s PRSP through the Government budget cycle, while moving toward a common
assessment framework; (b) reduce transaction costs; (c) enhance the predictability o f resource
flows; and (d) conduct joint reviews at both the macro and sectoral levels. In October 2006, a
Memorandum o f Understanding ( M o w was discussed between the Government and the
development partners providing budget support to consolidate this cooperation. This M o U
translates the desire o f the Government and development partners to ensure that budget support
becomes the key instrument o f their cooperation in the implementation o f the PRSP and related
sectoral strategies and policies, and to ensure a good coordination o f the various donor
interventions.

36.     Building on the results achieved in these areas in the recent past, hrther steps continue to
be taken to enhance the harmonization process. First at the sectoral level; between June and
September 2006 joint Government-donors reviews were carried out in the core sectors o f rural
water, health, education, agriculture, transport and justice: These reviews led to concrete
recommendations and agreements aimed at sharpening the existing strategic framework and
increasing the effectiveness o f service delivery in these sectors. Second efforts have also been
deployed by the Government and the donors to activate thematic working groups established in
the context o f the PRSP implementation. Third; the identification mission o f the PRSC-4 (in
September 2006) was carried out in the context o f the second joint mission o f the main donors
that are providing budget support, and included other donors supporting the PRSP
implementation. The mission’s results included: (a) discussions and revisions o f the existing
common policy matrix as well as the main performance indicators; (b) the formulation by donors
o f coordinated comments on the PRSP progress report as well as discussions and agreements on
advancing towards the finalization o f the PRSP 1     1, and (c) discussions on improvements in
budget execution, through improved dialogue between sectoral ministries and the MDEF,
capacity strengthening o f all involved with public expenditures, and a closer monitoring. Fourth


                                                16
in December 2006, all donors endorsed the ten-year education plan and the request of the
Government o f Benin to j o i n the EFA/FTI. Finally, during the pre-appraisal mission (in
February 2007) the donors, under the coordination o f the European Union, provided comments
on the draft PRSP 11.

                                    3.5   LESSONS
                                               LEARNED

37.    PRSC-4 will be based on the foundations laid during the implementation o f Benin's first
PRSP. The new series o f operations will also take account o f lessons learned during the first
three PRSCs which are detailed below.

38.    First, the PRSCs benefited from adopting a programmatic approach in reaching the
MDGs. However, the equity focus o f the operations needed to be increased. Therefore, in the
design o f the service delivery components, PRSC-4 intensified the targeting o f rural and
underserved areas.

39.     Second, the dialogue should also be broadened to include more stakeholders - outside
Government and outside the capital in order to improve program quality, PRSP monitoring and
results-orientation. Therefore, for PRSC-4, messages from government-led PRSP consultations,
broad-based surveys such as the poverty survey and the governance survey, were used to inform
sector strategies. The decentralization component focused on the role o f local client feedback on
service delivery, which has now been incorporated in the PRSP I1monitoring system.

40.    Third, the success o f sectoral programs depends critically on the hnctioning o f the
budget system. Therefore, under PRSC-4, the dialogue between sector ministries and the finance
ministry was improved and institutionalized, and the program for budget systems reform was
designed to reflect the needs o f the spending ministries.

41.    Fourth, joint donor support for a common package o f reforms closely aligned with the
PRSP remains an important factor in the quality o f the overall program, and in simplifying the
dialogue between Government and donors. Nevertheless, donor coordination can always be
improved, especially in view o f proposals for a joint donor protocol for Benin.

                             3.6     ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

42.     The proposed series o f PRSCs benefits from several analytical reports completed in
FY04-FY06. In the area o f private sector development, these include: (i) an Investment Climate
Assessment which identified the major impediments to private sector development and i t s results
will be used to develop a realistic growth strategy led by the private sector; (ii)
                                                                                  the findings o f
the Annual Doing Business indicators which also provided an input to the preparation o f the PSD
strategy; (iii)a FIAS Land Market Study which examines ways to improve the access o f the
private sector to industrial, commercial, and residential property; (iv) the Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS) develops an integrated strategy to enhance Benin's integration into
regional and global markets and presents recommendations for improving trade competitiveness;
and (v) the Financial Sector Review which provides a diagnosis o f the financial system in Benin
and identifies issues that need to be addressed for the financial system to support economic
growth.



                                               17
43.     In the areas o f public infrastructure, a series o f studies on port operations to increase port
productivity were conducted in 2005-2006, including a Development Plan to Enhance Port
Productivity, completed in 2006, which provides an action plan for implementing agreed options
o n port restructuring; and the National Rural Transport Strategy, completed in 2006, which will
be used to design the multi-year sector investment program.

44.      In the social sectors, a Country Health Status Report, completed in 2006, is helping
inform the health component o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy thanks to a better understanding
o f health-related determinants o f poverty, Also, the Ten-Year Education Plan, completed in
2006, presents the government plan qualifying the country for the Education for All Fast Track
Initiative and access to the Catalytic Fund.

45.        In the area o f governance, the ongoing Governance and Anti-Corruption Survey aims to
provide the analytical underpinnings for the policy and institutional reforms on governance and
for updating the Strategic Anti-Corruption Plan. A report on the household section o f the survey
was completed in 2006 and the remainder o f the survey has been launched. Also, a study on
C i v i l Service Reform (“Current Status and Future Opportunities”), completed and discussed with
the Government in 2006, provides an assessment o f the civil service strengths and weaknesses as
well as options for future reforms. Two additional recent studies have provided input into the
design o f the PRSC series: the Action Plan for Decentralization o f Spending Authority to Branch
Offices, an input for the definition o f the actions to be pursued to strengthen the decentralized
units; and the ongoing Public Expenditure Review, which examines progress made and future
challenges in the areas o f governance, decentralization, and the integration o f related measures in
programs across sectors.

                       4. THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM AGENDA

46.     The mixed progress made in implementing the PRSP and the recent economic
developments highlight the fragility and the vulnerability o f the economy to external shocks
because o f i t s heavy dependence on cotton and trade with Nigeria and show that reducing
poverty and achieving the M D G s remain a significant challenge. Thus, the Government i s
putting a renewed emphasis in i t s new PRSP (PRSP 1 1) on accelerating and sustaining economic
growth and strengthening policies designed to improve coverage, quality and delivery o f basic
services. This will in turn require deepening reforms in public sector governance and capacity
building.

47.    To make Benin’s economy more resilient to external shocks and reinvigorate growth, the
new Government has prepared a long-term strategy that emphasizes accelerated growth. The new
accelerated growth strategy was presented to the development partners in October 2006 during a
high level meeting chaired by the Minister o f Development, Economy and Finance.
Implementation o f the long-term strategy will be supported over the next few years through the
new PRSP and through implementation o f the comprehensive multi-sectoral PSD strategy,
adopted in the form o f a letter o f sector policy in September 2006. The strategic orientations
announced in October 2006, the results o f the new household survey, reports from the thematic
groups, and the results o f participatory exchanges with citizens were used to prepare the PRSP I1
which was adopted in April 2007.

48.     The PRSP I1is accompanied by a detailed program o f priority actions, which specifies a
large number o f measures, investments, and projects, as well as targets and monitoring
indicators, in line with the objectives laid out in the strategy. This companion document to the
PRSP provides the plan for putting the PRSP into operation.

49.      The Government’s agenda for 2007-2009 as detailed in the PRSP I1 encompasses the
following pillars: (i) accelerating growth and developing infrastructure; (      ii)reinforcing human
capital; and (iii)promoting good governance and equitable development throughout the country.
In order to accelerate growth, the strategy aims to diversify sources o f growth, notably in
agriculture; increase access to credit, especially in the rural sector; accelerate land tenure reform;
and improve regional integration. I t also targets an improvement in the private sector
environment through facilitating tax, customs and port administration, and developing the export
institutional framework. Accelerating growth will also require improving the physical
infrastructure both through new investments and establishment o f appropriate regulatory
institutions. Measures to this effect are included in the action plan o f the PSD strategy. T o
strengthen the policy environment for private sector development and investment, the
Government has put in place a Presidential Investment Council. Accelerating growth will also
require speeding up and successfully completing structural reforms in the cotton sector, the port
and utilities.

50.     To strengthen human capital, the Government plans to improve the institutional
framework for basic services, including improvements in personnel management, budgetary
management, and raising the quality o f infrastructure for service delivery. The strategy also
focuses o n increasing aid to localities and reducing the cost o f services for households. To
complement these measures, the Government intends to improve the governance structure by
reforming the public administration, strengthening the judicial system, and improving the
efficiency and transparency o f public spending and public services.

51.     The program for equitable development i s centered on the Government’s strategy for
decentralization. This strategy has two main planks. First, i t aims to increase financial transfers
to localities and increase training for local officials in order to better support local budgets and
development plans. The second plank takes up investments in regional development centers that
would provide infrastructure serving the development needs o f several communities in a given
region. I t i s noteworthy that, in the PRSP’s monitoring and evaluation plan, an important role i s
given to local officials, an acknowledgement o f their close-up view o f service delivery and
progress in the poorer communities.

52.     The priorities for 2007 and progress o n these are detailed below.

              4.1     PILLAR I : ACCELERATE
                                          SUSTAINABLE           ECONOMICGROWTH

4.1.1   Private Sector-Led Growth

53.    After validating the recommendations from a variety o f diagnostic studies o n the business
climate (including the DTIS, ICA, Doing Business, and FIAS land tenure study), in September
2006 the Government adopted the Letter o f Development Policy for private sector and an action
plan for i t s implementation. Three working groups on core issues (agribusiness,



                                                 19
transportatiodtransit, local entrepreneurship) were formed based on the strategy’s priority
outcomes, they are acting as drivers o f the reform process and will assess progress made in these
areas. A Technical Advisor on PSD issues was appointed in the Ministry o f Finance. H e i s in
charge o f coordinating all Government PSD related reforms. Also, in February 2007 the
government launched the Presidential Investors Council (PIC), which gathered about fifteen
national and international business leaders around Benin’s President.

54.     The main strategic areas o f the strategy include reforms in: land tenure, judiciary, port,
customs and tax systems, business regulation, and the financial sector. Progress has already been
made in these areas: (i)  the government-has undertaken actions on land market reform (e.g. pilot
programs to convert living rights into property rights); (ii) some key operations in the port have
been subcontracted to the private sector with positive outcomes in terms o f service levels to end
users; (iii) there i s now an active private/public cooperation in sorting out issues around the
certification o f agricultural products (following the self-imposed ban on shrimp exports to the
EU); (iv) the Government has recently accelerated discussions with Nigeria to resolve trade
issues; and (v) several improvements were made in customs policy and a draft proposal o f a new
corporate taxation framework was prepared.

55.    While progress on these actions i s being made, bottlenecks remain and additional specific
reforms are being designed or are being pursued in several o f them. Their purpose i s to:

     0   Accelerate land market reform. The government reform program touches on a number o f
         elements, including fees on registering/transfening land titles (currently 12 percent o f the
         property value), converting living rights to property rights, securing and digitizing land
         titles, auctioning prime government land, harmonizing the urban and rural land codes,
         and expanding the current system o f simplified property tax (Rkgime Foncier Urbain).
         Land market reform is one o f the four areas o f focus for the Millennium Challenge
         Account.

     0   Accelerate judiciary reform. First, it should be noted that land market reforms will help
         to alleviate the current burden on the court system o f land disputes (70 percent o f all
         disputes). As part o f the on-going ten-year legal and judiciary reform program, the
         government i s introducing reforms to improve the transparency and accountability o f
         court decision. These reforms are discussed in more detail in the section on governance
         reforms below. Judiciary reform i s one o f the four areas o f focus for the Millennium
         Challenge Account.

         Overhaul customs systems. Key priorities in this area are making the one stop shop at the
         port operational, completing the computerization o f transactions, limiting cash payments
         and discretionary powers, relying on selective and rigorous inspection procedures,
         removing blockades on roads and preventing smuggling through Togo. Custom reform i s
         one o f the four areas o f focus for the Millennium Challenge Account.

     0   Undertake comprehensive tax reform. Tax policy and administration are ranked the top
         two issues by surveyed formal companies (ICA). More taxes are being levied on an
         increasingly smaller number o f formal companies. Moving out o f this vicious circle will



                                                  20
        require lowering rates and simplifying tax policies together with reforming the tax
        administration to increase the tax base.

        Reform business registration and licensing. It s t i l l takes 8 procedures and 32 days, and i t
        costs twice the average annual income to register a business in Benin. The government
        could reduce these numbers while lobbying among the OHADA to drastically reduce the
        minimum capital requirement.

        Implement the financial sector strategy. The main objective o f the Government's
        financial sector strategy is to help increase private sector access to financial services by:
        (i) improving competition in the banking sector as well as SME access to loans; (ii)
        improving supervision o f the insurance sector and availability o f insurance products for
        low-income populations and farmers; (      iii)undertaking the restructuring o f the pension
        system based on results o f actuarial study; (iv) implementing the national microfinance
        policy and improving supervision and sustainability o f the sector.

        Consolidate the institutions created to support the private sector. There are many critical
        issues which are industry specific and which will require an active public/private
        dialogue to resolve. The first critical area where such cooperation i s needed i s the
        government certification in ago-business ahead o f new and more stringent requirements
        to access the EU market. The second critical area is the provision o f agricultural services
        to farmers in the high potential crops - this will require in particular more cooperation
        between the Ministry o f Agriculture and the Ministry o f Industry. Finally, active
        investment promotion will be needed to attract international investors in these new high
        potential export areas. Such investors will be essential to help resolve policy and
        infrastructure issues along these value chains.

4.1.2   Infrastructure Services

56.      Energy. Over the last year Benin has experienced power supply shortages o f up to 60
percent (70 MW) o f demand due to low water level at the Akosombo Dam's reservoir (Ghana),
from which Benin imports about 47 percent o f its power, and problems in the management and
operation o f the "Societe Beninoise d'Energie Electrique" (SBEE) and the "Communaute
Electrique du Benin" (CEB). The key problems at CEB and SBEE are poor and non-transparent
financial management, lack o f coherence on investment decisions, weak sector regulation and
lack o f clarity about the adequacy o f current tariffs. Recent changes in key staff at the Ministry
o f Energy have contributed to weakened technical and management capacity in the sector.
Redressing those changes will be critical to the implementation o f the Government's new sector
reform strategy and improved governance in the sector.

57.      W h i l e some important achievement were made under the first PRSP in terms o f rural
electrification, urban connections and improvement in electricity bill collections, limited
progress was made on the policy and regulatory aspects (ie., tariff indexation was approved but
not implemented, a sector regulatory system was devised but not approved, the agreed upon
concession process o f SBEE was delayed for more than 2 years and, subsequently, proved not
viable due to lack o f private sector interest in SBEE). In mid-2006 the new government
indicated its intention to accelerate the power sector reform process through a 2-stage approach


                                                  21
which would, first, achieve an effective improvement o f the technical and financial performance
o f SBEE and, second, would open-up the sector for new power generation investments by the
private sector. That approach was validated in January 2007 through a sector-wide stakeholder
consultation workshop. The workshop agreed on the implementation o f a 2-to-3 year
monitorable reform program o f SBEE to improve i t s technical and financial performance and i t s
governance structure. By end April 2007 the Government plans to formalize the reform
program, which i s expected to contain the vision for the sector, the SBEE’s reform program, and
a road map for the approval o f the new electricity code and the setting-up o f the sector regulator.
The SBEE reform program should include the introduction o f a new management team operating
within private sector principles and the establishment o f clear and monitorable performance
indicators. By the completion date, the program o f actions i s expected to result in: (i)    overall
improved efficiency in the power sector; (ii) a reduction o f blackouts to below 5 percent; and (iii)
SBEE achieving a sustainable financial position. Already, the Government has taken important
measures, including the change in management at CEB and the establishment o f an oversight
finance committee at SBEE. In parallel to that, the government, SBEE and the Bank have agreed
on a set o f performance indicators to closely monitor the SBEE evolution. Also, since the
worsening o f the power supply situation in the second h a l f o f 2006, the government identified
the need to accelerate and scale-up power generation investments. The government’s ability to
address regulatory shortcomings will be critical to establish a conducive environment for the
mobilization o f private sector investments in generation capacity.

5 8.      Telecommunications. Given the extent o f Benin Telecom’s operational and financial
difficulties, the Government o f Benin has decided to phase the company’s privatization in two
steps. Step one would involve a restructuring and step two would bring Benin Telecoms to the
point o f sale by mid-2008. Regulatory texts and authorization to set up a regulatory body have
been established, but Government s t i l l needs to adopt the terms o f reference and sign the
contracts o f international f i r m s to advise it on: (i)
                                                         preparation o f the privatization o f the telecom
company and (      ii) how to implement the regulatory framework, including the authority,
jurisdiction and competencies o f the new regulator. These contracts were finalized in early 2007
and the staffing o f the interim regulatory agency followed soon after. New regulations and
enforcement mechanisms are needed in the telecom sector to restructure the public operator,
 ensure fair access to i t s network and prevent unlicensed operators in the mobile telephone sector.

59.      Port. At the port, customs fbnctions have been computerized, and a new central clearance
window now handles transactions for the various port services and for customs duties. A report
on port clearance times has been completed and an action plan to reduce these delays has been
validated. Through a number o f studies, including the DTIS and dedicated studies o f port
operations, extensive plans for improving port operations have been developed and validated.
Investment in improved port operations i s the largest component o f the US$300 million M C C
grant to Benin. These investments should allow for private participation in the management o f
the port. Three studies have been commissioned to that end. The study financed by the Dutch
Cooperation focuses on improving the flow o f merchandise at the port. The study provides a
series o f performance indicators which could be easily monitored once the interface between the
two software packages used in the computerized operations (Siguce and Sydonia) i s completed.
In addition, IDA sponsored a study performed by the Las Palmas Port Authority focusing on
institutional reforms and required investments that will allow the port development in the short,
medium and long term. The third study has been commissioned by the Millennium Challenge


                                                   22
Corporation and focuses on the assessment o f the infrastructure and equipment required to
increase the port capacity, while improving security and facilitating clearance procedures.

60.     In addition, other improvements o f port operations would involve: (i)  making provision
for electronic payments at the one stop shop; (       ii)reviewing zoning laws and infrastructure
around the port to facilitate traffic and parking; (iii)
                                                       increasing the autonomy o f the management
structure; (iv) improving docking infrastructure and W h e r dredging the sea; and (v) completing
feasibility study for the new port taking into account increased capacity o f the existing port
following the suggested administrative reforms and targeted investments.

4.1.3   Agriculture and Cotton

61.     Agriculture i s a significant contributor to growth and is thus a natural tool for poverty
reduction in Benin. Importantly, agricultural value added has been declining sharply and it has
proved to be very volatile in the past two decades. Agriculture stood at 31 percent o f GDP in the
mid eighties, 34 percent in the mid nineties and about 32 percent in 2005. Clearly, economic
growth and sustained poverty reduction are unlikely to be achieved without stimulating sustained
agriculture productivity and diversification. Another problem comes from weak budget
execution and the relatively l o w part o f the budget which i s allocated to rural development. Only
5.8 percent o f the 2007 budget is allocated to rural development.

62.     Under the previous PRSCs, a number o f actions have been taken to improve agricultural
production and productivity: (i) M A E P drafted a result-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
framework and developed a road-map for i t s execution by the newly created M&E unit at
MAEP; (ii)   a strategy for agricultural advisory services was drafted and 320 extension agents
have been added to provide advisory service primarily (through not exclusively) to cotton
farming households; (iii)   Presidential decrees establishing a new regulatory framework to
reorganize the different professional families involved in the cotton sub-sector and foster
disciplined competition were adopted; and (iv) much effort was devoted to support the
privatization o f SONAPRA assets.

63.     Cotton plays a fundamental role in the social and economic development o f Benin. There
are about 300,000 cotton producers in the country supporting the welfare, directly and indirectly,
o f about 3 million people. Cotton i s grown by about 35 percent o f farm households. After a
major liberalization in the 1990s, a new institutional framework was established to handle inputs
and ginning for the mixed public and private participation in the sector. However, dyshnctions
in the operation o f the new framework and the consequent disruptions to the input market caused
a sharp decline in output in the 2005/2006 season.

64.       The government has made efforts to resume the fbnctioning o f the cotton sector as well
as to encourage producers and other interests at stake to work towards i t s development and
renewed competitiveness. Several communications were issued by the Council o f Ministers to
r u l e against the main dyshnctions in the sector, such as excessive arrears borne by producers,
untimely provision o f quality inputs, non payment o f seed cotton, and parallel marketing. The
success o f these communications in establishing the h c t i o n i n g o f the cotton framework
agreement can be seen in that the production o f cotton seed rebounded considerably (300,000
tons compared to 190,000 tons last year).


                                                 23
65.     Progress has also been noted in ensuring proper marketing o f the 2006-2007 campaign, in
line with the framework agreement and timely availability o f inputs for the 2007-2008 campaign.
In fact, since 2000 when the current phase o f the cotton sector reform begun, the current 2006-
2007 cotton commercialization campaign i s the very first one progressing without dissidence. All
cotton commercialization participating ginning companies have been receiving seed cotton
through the CSPR circuit. In addition, the contracts for the 2007-2008 agricultural inputs
delivery have been awarded so that the inputs will be timely distributed to the cotton producers.

66.     After re-establishing the productive functioning o f the sector, the Government adopted a
new option for state divestment o f ginning facilities that continue to process about half o f
Benin’s cotton, alongside private operators who handle the other half. The Government’s choice
was made after examining the approaches taken in neighboring cotton-producing countries. The
new option would create a new, privately-managed company that would take control o f
SONAPRA’s ginning assets and be co-owned by the private companies that won the bid for the
assets in 2004, along with the workers’ union, producers and the State. Since then, Government
has been working to ensure ownership for the new approach by consulting with sector
stakeholders and ensuring their agreement. Government chose this option because it met with the
widest agreement among stakeholders. Implementation o f the new option i s expected to be
completed by the beginning o f the next ginning season. To ensure that the process will be
completed as planned, the government i s implementing the roadmap leading to the new company
in consultation with the stakeholders. As a first step, the Government i s assessing the financial
value o f SONAPRA’s industrial assets and following the legal procedures for creating the new
company.

67.     Beyond cotton, the background studies needed to design the national strategy for
agriculture services have been finalized, paving the road for the completion o f a sound strategy.
The current system o f monitoring and evaluation has been diagnosed and a roadmap for the
design and implementation o f a new system was recently endorsed by the Ministry of
Agriculture. Considerable efforts were also devoted to the identification o f new contributors to
agricultural growth and the design o f strategies which could promote them. Based on in-depth
analytical work noted above, the Minister o f Agriculture adopted plans to develop nontraditional
supply chains, such as pineapple, cashew nuts and fish farming. The Government has also been
working on alleviating the main bottlenecks preventing the development o f these three sub-
sectors by contracting agreements for the production o f certified seeds and updating the quality
management and monitoring system.

4.1.4   Rural Transport

68.     The transport sector i s a major employer, contributing directly about 8 percent o f GDP,
while affecting the growth, productivity and competitiveness o f all other sectors. It also serves to
open up untapped production potential and reduce poverty (rural in particular) by raising the
accessibility o f rural populations to basic economic and social services, and by improving quality
and reliability o f access to markets. However, isolation o f rural communities remains a major
challenge for Benin. The road network consists o f around 18,500 kilometers, o f which 65 percent
are rural roads. Those nearly 12,000 kilometers o f rural roads are aimed at serving 55 percent o f
the population living in rural areas. When analyzing the accessibility to the transport system



                                                 24
(measured by the Rural Access Index-MI2), it results that with a RAI o f 32 percent, 68 percent
o f the population or more than 2.5 million people are currently isolated, without reliable access
to social and economic services. Furthermore, during the rainy season, many roads in rural areas
are closed or remain impassable which increases the percentage o f isolated people. This makes it
difficult and costly to provide services to the affected rural inhabitants on a reliable basis. Thus,
improved access remains a high priority in the country.

69.     The major achievement to date i s the completion and adoption o f a National Rural
Transport Strategy. Following the experience derived from the implementation o f the Rural
Roads Strategy (Stratbgie des Pistes Rurales) in 1997, the government formulated a broader
approach. The four cornerstones o f the strategy are: (i)    to improve rural roads that provide access
to social services and economic opportunities; (       ii)to promote intermediate means o f transport
(IMT) and rural transport services (RTS); (      i ii)
                                                     to maintain the rural road network; and (iv) to
strengthen the capabilities o f the different institutions dealing with rural road infrastructures. The
Strategy was formally approved by the Government (Conseil de Ministres) in March 2006.
Under the strategy, the Government rehabilitated 320 km o f rural roads in 2006 (as compared to
the 200 km planned) but postponed the maintenance o f 300 km to 2007 because o f the budget
shortage. In addition, the new institutional framework for the management o f supply roads and
the related regulations were approved by the inter-ministerial Council in March 2007. This
framework ensures the coordination between the Ministries involved in the management and
financing o f rural roads and a representation o f the Municipalities.

Focus of the ProposedPRSC-4 and Follow-on Operations

70.     The proposed PRSC-4 supports improvements in the policy environment for private
investment and infrastructure through three prior actions related to the PSD strategy, cotton
sector reforms and rural transportation services: (1) implementation o f the PSD strategy with a
focus on the core actions set for 2006 in the areas o f land markets, taxation, customs
administration, the duty-free area, and in the area o f the newly selected agricultural product lines;
(2) implementation o f remaining reforms in the cotton sector, which include: (a) ex-post analysis
o f the first campaign under the regulatory framework; (b) consolidation o f all the cotton
producers’ associations; (c) starting a gradual removal o f restrictions on cottonseed exports; (d)
signing a written protocol defining the roadmap for the new option for privatizing SONAPRA;
and (e) confirming the termination o f the previous privatization process, accompanied by an
accord with the bidders, and begin protocol implementation; and (3) updating the institutional
framework for the management o f supply roads, and preparation and adoption o f the new
regulations.

71.     With respect to PRSC-5, it will continue to: (a) support private sector development
through measures to simplify procedures in tax administration, company creation, international
trade, land tenure, and micro-finance; as well as (b) complete privatization o f the SONAPRA
industrial base; and (c) authorize private sector investment in new generating capacity in the
electricity sector. As discussed in para 3 1, the above measures will be complemented by support
provided by IDA under the Private Sector Development Project (1999), the Electricity Services

  T h e RAI measures the number o f rural people who live within two kilometers (typically equivalent to a walk o f 20-25 minutes)
o f an all-season road as a proportion o f the total population. An “all season road” i s a road that i s motorable all year round b y the
prevailing means o f rural transport (typically a pick-up or a truck which does not have four-wheel-drive).

                           4.2   PILLAR 11: IMPROVE
                                               BASIC SERVICES

 4.2.1 Rural Access to Safe Water and Sanitation in R u r a l and Semi-urban Areas

72.     Access to improved water supply and sanitation, accompanied by effective hygiene
education, can be effective in improving both health and productivity, improving the quality o f
life and providing increased opportunities for education and employment, particularly for women
and girls. Access to potable water and sustainable water resource management are amongst the
main priorities o f the PRSP I1 and the 2007-2009 Government Priority Action Program (PAP).
The objective o f the government i s to reach the Millennium Development Goal, i.e. providing 67
percent o f the population with access to potable water by 2015. The program for water supply
aims specifically at: (i) increasing access and equity to water supply, with a special focus on
rural areas, and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the sector expenditures; ii)empowering
rural municipalities to help them ensure progressively their full responsibility in the field o f
water supply and developing public-private partnership for the implementation and management
o f the water supply systems; and (iii)   creating the environment to facilitate the use and the
integrated management o f water, land and other related resources in order to maximize the social
and economic benefits without compromising the sustainability o f the critical ecosystems.

73.     The Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) implemented by the Directorate o f Water (DGE)
with the support o f IDA and other donors i s efficient. The administrative and financial
deconcentration o f the DGE made good progress in 2006: 29 percent o f the budget is delegated
to the department level against 23 percent in 2005. Over 90 percent o f the contracts for technical
studies, social mobilization activities and civil works are now procured at departmental level.
Procurement delays at departmental level are satisfactory with an average process time o f about
77 days against at least 300 days at the central level where no improvement has been recorded. In
addition, transfer o f responsibility from the central administration to the municipalities i s
progressively becoming a reality in the rural water sector, in particular for investment planning,
contracting and management o f the water services.

74.     Progress has been made in implementing other core policy actions. The “Small Towns
Water Initiative” to provide potable water for two million people living in 500 localities with a
population o f between 2,000 and 25,000 inhabitants was launched in 2006. The manual of
procedures i s available. The donor-pooled fund i s fully established and 15.9 million Euros are
already committed. The framework agreement o f the initiative was signed officially between the
Ministry o f Finance and donors (EU, DANIDA, AFD and KFW) in March 2007. Ten water
supply systems are managed under PPP arrangements by small scale private operators recruited
by the municipalities, using transparent and competitive contracting processes to promote
efficient pricing as well as effective technical and commercial operations. The draft Water Law
i s expected to be transmitted to the National Assembly in M a y 2007.

75.    The Government has continued to make significant progress in increasing access to
potable water to the rural population from 36 percent in 2003 to 45 percent in 2006. The
execution o f the 2006 program budget has been satisfactory. Benin constructed 1.787 water


                                                26
points and 446,750 additional people gained access to potable water against about 100,000 in
2002. Water facilities functionality rate has also improved from 77 percent in 2003 to 87 percent
in 2006.

76.     Building on the positive trend in the rural water supply sector and in close collaboration
with other donors, the Government plans to strengthen the sector wide approach, stimulate
donors’ harmonization and alignment with country system and support the implementation o f the
Directorate o f Water 2007-2009 program-budget. The policy measures aim at accelerating the
whole cycle o f services delivery while moving towards full decentralized planning, execution
and management o f water services by the municipalities. Other Government objectives include:
(a) improving water systems management and sustainability through the implementation o f local
PPP in small towns (with at least 15 percent o f the piped water supply systems managed under a
PPP arrangement by small-scale private operators under contract with rural municipalities by
February 2008); (b) increasing the functionality o f the water supply system through the
implementation o f the “old pumps replacement accelerated program” to replacelrehabilitate at
least 1,000 pumps, for which spare parts are no longer available; and (c) implementing the new
legal, institutional and policy framework for the integrated management o f water. I t i s expected
that in 2007 the new water law will be approved by Parliament.

4.2.2   Improving Access to Quality Health Services

77.     To achieve the MDGs o f reducing child and maternal mortalities and to provide quality
health services to the poor, expenditures in the health sector will need to be increased. Benin has
had access to substantial donor resources to tackle the burden posed by severe pandemics such as
HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.

78.      The development o f the sector has, however, ~h              hampered by the -persistent
inefficiency o f the public health system and the poor quality o f services provided in public health
facilities. This may explain partially the steady decrease in the use o f public services observed
from 2003. For the time being, Benin has a fair good number o f hospital beds at central and
regional levels (3 beds per 10,000 inhabitants) and an acceptable number o f health centers (1
center for 15,000 inhabitants). But over 25 percent o f the available regional beds are not
operational and the regional hospitals have bed utilization rates ranging from 10 to 20 percent.
This inefficiency i s also exacerbated by the uneven distribution o f the health personnel, notably
o f the medical doctors whose numbers vary from 45,000 inhabitants per doctor in northern
department to 1,243 inhabitants per doctor in the city capital and i t s neighborhoods. Other issues
are the weak capacity within the MOH, both at central and decentralized levels, including for
result-oriented budget preparation and implementation, the lack o f experienced personnel
(especially para-medical personnel) in health facilities in the poor, remote rural areas, and the
insufficient collaboration with the private sector in planning and delivery o f health services
countrywide.

79.    As part o f the decentralization policy, the M O H has improved the resource allocation
method based on poverty, health determinants and performance criteria developed in 2005, and
have used i t to prepare the 2006 program budget. The Health Sector Policy Document 2007-2016
has been finalized and discussed with partners in development. The 2006 budget has been
executed at 68 percent (commitment basis), above the execution rate o f other sectors during the


                                                 27
same year. Also, the MOH has signed decentralized management contracts with three health
districts. A preliminary assessment has been conducted to pave the way for the signing o f
performance contracts between the M O H and its central and decentralized entities. This process
i s part o f a result-based management approach that the Ministry has adopted to make health
services and facilities more responsible and accountable o f their performance.

80.     Some notable progress has also been registered in improving the access to and the use o f
health service: The inventory o f the private health facilities, which has been underway since
2003, has been finally completed and the legal framework governing the provision o f health
services by the private sector has been disseminated countrywide among the sector stakeholders.
In December 2006, the Government granted free access to health care for children under five.
Through this measure, the government expects to halt the decrease in the use o f health services
by this vulnerable group observed over the two past years and subsequently reduce mortality in
this group. The MOH has also adopted a national strategy to reduce maternal and neonatal
mortality rates for the period 2006-2010. The objectives and goals o f this strategy have been
integrated in the Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2007-2009 and in the Health Sector
Policy Document 2007-2016. The preparation o f the human resources development strategic plan
has been completed and the next step for the M O H is to make it operational during the period
2007-2009. Some delays have however been encountered to complete the
constructionhehabilitation works o f health facilities initiated in selective poor remote areas.

81.    To make health services more affordable to people, the MOH has streamlined the
financing mechanism o f health service delivery to the poor. Furthermore, the M O H has finalized
a health mutual insurance schemes development plan with the view o f promoting throughout the
country health insurance and contributing to reduce the burden o f health spending on poor
households.                                                        ~       ~
                                   ~       ~         ~     ~
                    ~      ~




82.     During 2007-2009, the Government intends to put reforms initiated since 2002 under past
PRSCs on a sustainable path. Consequently, in line with the priorities outlined in the National
Health Policy Document 2007-2016, the Government intends to increase coverage o f priority
health services, especially the use o f curative health services by children under five, and an
increased access and use o f quality services by the poor and most vulnerable groups. More
specifically, Government priorities include:

83.      Progress to improve the overall management o f the Health Sector achieved over the past
five years will be strengthened through the implementation o f the Health Policy and Strategy
Document 2007-2016, with an emphasis on the rationalization o f the health section o f the MTEF
to have a result-oriented framework. The system o f decentralized management contracts will be
extended to more health facilities in all the 34 health districts in order to help improve their
performance in the delivery o f quality health services. The M O H will also introduce the system
o f performance contracts to be signed with i t s central and decentralized structures, to make them
primarily accountable o f their performance and hence increase their efficiency. The role of
communities in the organization and management o f care and health services will be
strengthened through a more systematic involvement o f health committees (Comitks de SantC) at
the decentralized levels.




                                                28
84.     Improve access, quality and use o f health services by the poor and most vulnerable group.
The MOH will implement measures to improve access to health facilities especially in poor,
remote rural areas with the completion o f ongoing constructionhenovation works and equipment
o f health centers, along with the deployment o f needed health personnel with the policy of
granting incentives to personnel servicing in underserved areas. The supply o f health services
will be increased with the signing o f PPP agreements with private health facilities that have
technical capacity to provide care to poor and most vulnerable groups. Efforts will be sustained
to reach optimal immunization coverage (at least 90 percent) for all antigens in all the country’s
communes. Given the limited progress made in reducing maternal and child mortalities,
emphasis will be put on programs aimed at strengthening care to children under five and
improving quality and efficacy o f antenatal care and deliveries; the ultimate goal i s to reduce
maternal and neo-natal mortalities by % in 2016. There will be a scaling-up o f community-based
health and nutrition services for children under two and pregnant women based on a community-
level package o f essential nutrition services and Integrated Management o f Neonatal and
Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) and household food security strategies.

85.    Make good quality health services more affordable to people. This objective will be
achieved by implementing countrywide the policy o f free care to children under five decided by
the government at the end o f year 2006, extending to all health districts the benefits o f the
financing mechanism o f health service delivery to the poor, and promoting mutual health
insurance schemes in selective health districts to alleviate the charges o f health care on some
vulnerable groups.

4.2.3   Improving Access to Quality Education

86.     In December 2006 the Government endorsed a ten years education plan and i s now part
o f the Education for AllEast Track Initiative (EFA/FTI) to accelerate the achievement o f the
MDGs. The plan provides the framework for achieving agreed education outcomes, using a
common set o f measurable benchmarks to track progress and harmonizing donors’ commitment
to a predictable long term financing to ensure a more sustainable education development. The
2007 education budget represents 24.9 percent o f the national budget and the share o f primary
education in the education budget represents 49.6 percent in line with the EFA priority.

87.     K e y challenges in the sector include: (i) the persistence o f strong geographic and social
disparities in the provision o f education services; (ii)
                                                        the lack o f decentralization at the municipal
level and the weak participatory school management; (          iii)the financing and instruments to
transfer resources to the school level in order to implement the gratuity and reduce schooling
costs for l o w income families; (iv) the recruitment, training and career development o f teaching
staff; and (v) the mismatch between the outputs o f the education and training system and the skill
needs o f the economy.

88.     To promote access to education, in October 2006 the Government announced the full
gratuity in primary education. The teacher training policy has been finalized and i s being
implemented. 1,018 contractual teachers were recruited by October 2006 and 982 positions were
filled by December 2006. These teachers have been redeployed throughout the districts
contributing to reduce disparities. Two teachers training institutions (ENI) have been renovated
and a first promotion o f 600 teachers graduated from these ENI. The procurement for the


                                                 29
evaluation o f this first year o f teacher training i s ongoing. Also, the National Girls Education and
Training policy has been adopted and the targeted programs are being implemented. A medium
term action plan to scale up these programs s t i l l remains to be elaborated. The action plan to
improve students’ achievement i s being implemented with the sub-cycle approach at level CE 1
CE2, 30 schools are experimenting multi-grade teaching i d 948 teachers, 29 inspectors and 27
advisers have been trained for this purpose. The participatory management o f schools i s in place
in 26 municipalities but the regulatory framework s t i l l needs to be finalized to scale up the
initiative. The procurement o f the institutional audit o f the Ministries in charge o f the education
sector i s on going. The preparation o f the Education Country Status Report (CSR) has been
initiated on February 20, 2007. The mechanism for the orientation and regulation o f students
flow s t i l l remains to be defined.

89.     The main objectives o f Government are to: (i)      improve service delivery to increase
access, retention and learning achievement in basic education, the promotion o f girls’ education
and the training and recruitment o f qualified teachers; (ii)     strengthen the governance and
efficiency o f the education system through a better management and redeployment o f teaching
staff, a more efficient financing and management o f schools, and academic and administrative
support; and (iii)  re-orient post primary education and training in order to better respond to the
skills needs o f a more diversified economy.

90.     To achieve these objectives the Government will focus on:

        e       improving access, completion rate and quality o f basic education through: (i)   the
        implementation o f a program budget within the priorities o f the ten years action plan and
        the Fast Track initiative; ( ii)
                                       the recruitment o f 1,000 contractual school teachers annually
        and their redeployment for a better distribution within and across districts; (iii)      the
        scaling up o f the action plan to promote girls education; (iv) direct school financing to
        ensure gratuity, particularly in underserved areas; and (v) the development o f teachers
        training institutions to graduate a total o f 2,200 teachers by 2009.

        e       improving the efficiency in the provision and management o f educational services
        through: (i)the reduction o f drop out and repetition rate, the reorganization o f curriculum
        and the extension o f the program o f multi-grade schools; (          ii)the promotion o f
        participatory school management; and (iii)       an institutional audit o f the education
        administration.

        e        improving the capacity o f the education and training system to respond to the
        needs o f the economy, in particular at post primary education level through: (i)           the
        regulation o f enrollment between levels o f education and the orientation o f a larger share
        o f enrollment into vocational training; (ii)the revision o f the regulatory, institutional and
        policy framework o f vocational training and higher education to pilot the system and
        better respond to labor market demand; (    iii)the preparation o f a Country Status Report to
        identify options and propose priorities for the education sector; and (iv) the development
        o f training in the private sector and apprenticeship programs.




                                                  30
Focus of the Proposed PRSC-4 and Follow-on Operations

91.     The proposed PRSC 4 supports pursuing progress toward the MDGs by improving access
to basic services and ensuring greater efficiency o f public expenditures on human capital
formation through three prior actions: (a) the initiative “water in semi-urban centers” financed
through a donors-pooled fund i s operational and 10 water supply systems have been built and are
managed under PPP arrangements; (b) completion o f the inventory o f the private health facilities
and dissemination o f the regulations governing the provision o f health services by the private
sector; (c) implementation o f the redeployment plan (redeployment and decentralized recruiting
to fill 1,000 new contractual positions in primary schools) for public school teachers and
improve teacher distribution throughout the districts.

92.    With respect to PRSC-5, i t will continue to support achievement o f the MDGs through
measures to hrther expand the management o f village water supply systems (at least 15 percent)
under a local PPP arrangement, the development o f at least three community based health
insurance schemes, the extension to 10 additional health districts o f the benefit o f the financing
mechanism o f health service delivery to the poor, the gratuity o f health care for targeted
vulnerable groups, and evaluation o f the impact o f the Teacher Redeployment Plan and
continued redeployment and decentralized recruiting to fill 1,300 new contractual positions in
primary schools.

                      4.3                       GOOD
                              PILLAR 111: PROMOTE   GOVERNANCE

4.3.1   Performance-based Public Expenditure Management

93.     In December 2005, the Government adopted a policy framework for Results-Oriented
Budget Management (GBAR for Gestion BudgCtaire AxCe sur les RCsultats). The GBAR
strategy was based on the 2005 C F A A update and other public financial management reviews,
including recent PERs and PEFA assessments. Since 2005, the PEFA PFM Performance
Measurement Framework has been used by major donors and the Government as a common pool
o f information for measuring and monitoring PFM performance progress, and a common
platform for dialogue. The objective i s to use results-based budget management as a means to
ensure service delivery and efficient use o f public expenditures. In April 2006, the Government
adopted an operational action plan for implementing the policy and measuring progress.

94.     Reforms in budget management have long been at the center o f improving efficiency and
program management in PRSP sectors, specifically by means o f sector program budgets. These
have established the role o f sector ministries in setting priorities, and through their
implementation and evaluation, they have provided a better view o f the effectiveness o f sector
programs - information that can be used for hture planning. While targeting the management o f
service delivery, GBAR also intends to raise fiduciary standards by improving public
procurement and financial management. The government hopes to be able to lighten the burden
o f ex ante spending controls by strengthening ex post controls through budget reporting and
audit. The GBAR strategy also plans to provide the means for finance and technical ministry
staff to respond to budget performance reports. To this end, the strategy encompasses civil
service reforms, including reform o f local administrations and budget decentralization.



                                                31
95.     Despite the need to enforce strict adherence to formal budget procedures, and consequent
delays in budget execution and difficulties in the fulfillment o f sector budget objectives,
Government largely succeeded in meeting the objectives o f the 2006 program budgets for
priority sectors. It further submitted a 2007 budget in line with PRSP objectives. The budget
scenarios presented in the new PRSP demonstrate improved capacity in budget preparation.
Progress has also been made in producing and reviewing sectoral budget performance reports.
However, despite substantial achievements in budget system reforms, the 2004-05 episodes o f
unexpected revenue shortfalls, delays in spending execution, and surges in OPs exposed a
number o f remaining weaknesses in the public financial management system. Government has
also recognized disparities in the mastery o f tools for budget planning, budget execution, and for
monitoring and evaluation, especially at decentralized levels. The GBAR strategy notes that for
the budget system to achieve i t s objectives, weaknesses in human and institutional capacity will
need to be overcome. The finance ministry and technical ministries have recently intensified
their exchange o f information on the types o f obstacles hindering the execution o f sector budgets
and the greatest needs for capacity building in budget management systems.

96.       The Government’s program o f reforms includes the following pillars:

      0   Improving macroeconomic framework building and tax administration. This component
          includes the adoption o f tools to allow more flexible development o f multi-sectoral
          budget frameworks as well as improvements in revenue forecasting and efficiency o f the
          tax and customs systems.

      0   Strengthening public financial and results-oriented management. This component
          emphasizes budget reporting and accounting, treasury management, transparent
          procurement, and budget deconcentration.

          Strengthening internal and external financial control. This component supports audit
          systems and institutions, the finance commission o f the National Assembly, and the
          relations among these institutions.

          Accelerating administrative reforms: This component includes improvements in
          managing the wage bill, recruitment, service delivery, and revision o f public
          administration to better adapt it to results-based management.
4.3.2     Budget Execution and Accounting

97.     The ambitious public finance reform program has increased accountability in sector
ministries and transparency in accounting and financial information. The main reforms include:
(i) modem information and communication tools for authorized officers and the public; (    ii )
                                                                                              a
unified single budget for both operations and investments; and (iii)
                                                                   a new budget nomenclature.

98.    Under PRSC1-3, the Integrated System o f Public Financial Management (SIGFIP)
became operational and ensures greater transparency in the management o f public resources.
The new nomenclature facilitates budget presentation and identification o f expenditures for
poverty reduction. IDA has addressed the risk associated with the excessive use o f exceptional
procedures by conducting, with other donors, audits o f those expenses (in 2004 and 2006) and by


                                                32
following up on an agreed action plan. IDA has encouraged the involvement o f internal and
external auditors in these ad hoc audits to ensure on-the-job training and adequate follow-up.

99.          Despite these improvements in the reliability o f the overall budgetary system, there are
s t i l l weaknesses in monitoring resources allocated in the budget (internal and external resources)
and in accounting. The integration o f donor-funded projects and grants in the budget i s not
comprehensive yet. The main obstacle continues to be the problem o f consolidating all
information on donor activities across all ministries, so that line ministries report on all
expenditures regardless o f the source o f funding. The C A A should be able to record all
externally funded loans and grants. In the context o f donors' joint support, the EU has conducted
a study on budget comprehensiveness, and recommendations were made to the Government to
set up an appropriate framework for including donors' support in the budget. IDA is closely
following-up on the implementation o f the action plan with the Government.

100. Serious efforts were made to improve the quality o f the accounting and reporting system
accounts and the entry balances. The reliability o f financial reports has improved since 2006 with
the interface between SIGFIP and ASTER. However, the credibility o f the accounting system i s
undermined particularly by long delays in the production o f financial reports. This situation i s
mainly due to the lack o f qualitative and quantitative accountants. The Ministry o f finance has
started addressing the problem with the plan o f recruiting 100 staff at the DGTCP (Accountant
General Directorate).

101. Progress was made in public expenditure control and should be sustained with the
Government's commitment and donors' support. Expenditure commitment controls are in place
and limit commitments to approved budget allocations. The use o f exceptional procedures has
been drastically limited by the new Government which has taken appropriate and effective
measures. The remaining challenge i s to prepare a plan for budgeting in the following years 'OPs'
that were paid without budget allocation. However, certain bottlenecks in spending procedures
hindered the execution o f some sector program budgets. Government is working with these
ministries and all major donors to develop a revised PFM reform program aimed at facilitating
execution while maintaining financial accountability for use o f public resources. The new PFM
reform program should address the main weaknesses and risks, and the Government has
demonstrated considerable commitment to it. AfDB and The Netherlands are providing support
to implement the main actions regarding the P F M reform.

4.3.3   Internal and External Controls

102. Under the adoption in 2006 o f a decree regulating internal control, the Financial
Inspection Department (IGF) has been strengthened and professionalized. In September 2006, a
decree was signed to organize the internal control framework. The decree has given a crucial role
o f coordinating internal controls to the Inspection Gherale d'Etat (IGE) which reports to the
Head o f State, while IGF coordinates the activities o f internal audit o f sector ministries.
However, IGE will need more resources to play i t s new role. The IGF, with the on-going
assistance o f the AfDB and Denmark, should be able to increase i t s effectiveness by: (i)  focusing
on high risk areas including municipalities and decentralized structures; (ii)     coordinating with
DIVID; and (iii)   producing a consolidated report o f activities. The IGF i s operational for at least



                                                  33
the most important central government entities and undertakes some systems review (at least 30
percent o f staff time).

103. The internal control reform has enhanced cohesion between existing bodies and better
management and coordination by the Financial Inspection Directorate. However, the Inspection
and Internal Audit Directorates still do not have adequate resources, and their control activities
are limited. Regarding external control, the Chamber o f Accounts i s s t i l l under the Supreme
Court in spite o f the WAEMU provision for independence. Changing the status o f the Chamber
o f Accounts into a Court o f Auditors requires modifying the Constitution, which i s difficult to
envisage. Moreover, the Chamber o f Accounts had been focusing more on performance audit,
leading to delays in the preparation o f the annual budget audit report and limiting i t s impact.
Finally, the Parliament has limited means to control the budget execution, and the Government
can, to some extent, depart from what was approved by Parliament. The Government i s working
with donors to increase independence and capacity o f the Chamber o f Accounts. Support
provided jointly by AfDB and The Netherlands should help increase the effectiveness o f internal
and external controls.

 4.3.4 Public Procurement

104. A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) prepared by the Bank in 1999, and
adopted by the Government in 2002, concluded that the procurement system in Benin shows a
significant number o f deficiencies linked to legal and institutional weaknesses, to an
environment not conducive to effective procurement, political interference, lack o f
accountability, as well as non-compliance with the existing procedures. The latter i s because
rules and regulations not widely known, there i s a lack o f local capacity to handle procurement in
an efficient manner and misuse o f existing mechanisms. I           n June 2003, the Government
established a procurement reform steering committee comprising representatives from the public
and private sectors and civil society that finalized in 2004 a detailed three-year action plan for
procurement reform. The plan takes into account the recommendations o f the CPAR and is in
line with: (i) the WAEMU’s Procurement Directives, adopted by the Council o f Ministers in
2005 in the context o f the Regional Procurement Reform Program supported by IDA and other
donors (AfDB, EU) and (ii)        the Baseline Indicators (BIs) developed and adopted by
OECD/DAC/WB and most o f the developing countries. The development objectives o f the
procurement reform in Benin comply with the; (i)       Code for Transparency in Public Financial
Management adopted by the Council o f Ministers o f WAEMU in December 2005, which, among
other objectives, aims at harmonizing and modernizing procurement across the member states in
conformity with good international practices; and (ii) the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

105. The policy and oversight entity, independent o f execution and comprising representatives
from the public and private sectors and civil society, namely the National Regulatory Agency for
Procurement (Commission Nationale de Rkgulation des Marches Publics - CNRMP) i s now
hnctional with adequate material and human resources to deal with i t s duties but i t s t i l l needs to
be provided with adequate budget to ensure good and timely implementation o f i t s action plan.
The central entity responsible for controlling the quality o f public procurement transactions,
namely the National Directorate for Public Procurement (Direction Nationale des MarchCs
Publics - DNMP) i s still short o f qualified staff to ensure efficient and timely control, and the
persistence o f an additional control committees (ComitC de Validation - C V et Groupes de


                                                   34
Support au CV) for controlling the decisions made by the DNMP increase seriously the delays o f
activities’ control. The procurement units’ staff i s responsible for procurement activities below a
threshold (US$200,000) without any internal control which has increased cases o f
fraudcorruption. I   n addition, procurement under projects financed by donors continues to be
handled outside the procurement units that have been set up in the ministries, regional
administrations and municipalities. Finally, capacity to handle procurement in all these entities
is limited, hence there is an urgent need to provide ongoing hands-on training in procurement
while waiting for the Government to adopt and implement a national strategy on capacity
building in public procurement.

106. A draft procurement Code, complying with the WAEMU’s Directives on public
procurement and delegation o f public services, has been prepared by the CNRMP and will be
submitted to the Council o f Ministers by April. The Code deals with: (i)              delays in the
procurement process by removing CV’s control; (ii)      increase o f cases o f fraudcorruption at the
ministries and municipalities level by setting up an internal and effective control within these
entities. The CNRMP at the same time launched the preparation o f the regulations to accelerate
the implementation o f the new code as soon as i t i s approved by Parliament. In addition, in
December 2006 the President issued a new directive which defines response times for each actor
who intervenes in procurement transactions to reduce the time o f the procurement process.
Finally, the CNRMP has evaluated, on the basis o f the Baseline Indicators (BIs) developed by
OECD/DAC/WB, the present quality o f the public procurement system indicators and made
recommendations for prioritizing certain activities o f the action plan to ensure steady progress of
the procurement reform. A new CPAR will be programmed only during the next CAS period to
allow for the implementation o f the new procurement code and restructuring o f the institutional
set-up for procurement in conformity with the new WAEMU Regional Directives on legal and
institutional frameworks. While waiting for the next CPAR, a comprehensive assessment of
progress will be made on the basis o f the OECD/DAC baseline indicators.

107. The Government agenda i s to: (i)         harmonize i t s procurement code and the applicable
regulations in conformity with WAEMU’s Directives on public procurement and delegation of
public services; (ii) assess progress o f the quality o f i t s public procurement system on the basis
o f the indicators developed by OECD/DAC/WB and make recommendations for improvement;
(iii) develop and adopt a national strategy on capacity building in public procurement and start
the training o f trainers (CNRMP, DNMP, CPSMP) ; (iv) carry out a feasibility study on an
integrated procurement management system (SIGMP) and set up the said system ; (v) prepare
standard bidding documents; and (vi) carry out audits on procurement compliance for at least
four key ministries and the three municipalities with specific status and continue to handle
complaints in a transparent and efficient manner.

4.3.5   Strengtheningthe Legal and Judicial Sector

108. The justice system in Benin i s weak and remains plagued with corrupt practices. The
insufficient number o f courts, judges and other members o f the legal profession, and their
inadequate geographic distribution are only some o f the elements that contribute to centralization
and congestion o f the activities o f the courts and an excessive slowness o f the judicial process.
As such, in parallel with a program o f construction o f additional courts, the ten-year reform



                                                 35
program o f the M J C R I provides for the yearly recruitment o f a minimum number o f judges and
clerks.

109. The Government recognized the importance o f an effective and efficient judicial and
legal system as a key factor o f economic growth and stability. With IDA’S support, in 2001 the
government prepared and adopted a ten-year Integrated Program for the development and
modernization o f Benin’s legal and judiciary systems. This Integrated Program focuses
particularly on reinforcing the Ministry o f Justice itself, the court system, the penitentiary
system, human rights and modernization o f the country’s legislation. Key planned reforms
include:

        e       Improving capacity o f the Ministry of Justice by encouraging a better organization
        o f the Ministry, ensuring the recruitment and training o f staff and the provision o f the
        necessary equipment.

        e       Improving sewice delivery o   f the courts by rehabilitating existing court buildings
        and constructing new courts, reforming the status o f the greffiers (court clerk’s office),
        better training for judges and clerks, and providing equipment for the courts.

        e       Modernization o    f the penitentiary system by improving the infrastructure and
        living conditions o f the prison system, providing training facilities in prison and support
        for social integration o f inmates.

        e      Ensuring protection of human rights by modernizing the legal framework,
        providing support to NGOs and building awareness among the population o f their rights.

 110. While signs o f progress in the internal coordination and communication o f the various
divisions o f the M J C R I have started to appear, enabling a better internal review o f the status o f
the activities o f such divisions, as well as better communication with the donors, implementation
o f the MJCRI’s ten-year reform program continues to progress slowly, with deferral o f activities
from year to year. The weak internal capacity, lack o f leadership and coordination, and chronic
insufficiency o f funds within the M J C R I seem to be the main bottlenecks in this area.

111. The M J C R I has made some notable progress in setting up a viable M & E system. The
collection o f basic data, the identification o f relevant output indicators, and the establishment o f
a system o f data collection has been set up under PRSC 2 and PRSC 3, resulting in a complete
legal and judicial data information system. This system, which should enable the MJCRI to be
able to effectively calculate 80 percent o f the indicators identified in the M J C R I budget program
for the year 2006-2007 calculated on the basis o f current statistics (other than by investigation or
survey), i s an essential tool to enable the MJCRI to better identify its priorities and adapt i t s
reform program as necessary.

4.3.6   Decentralization

112. The main decentralization option chosen by the country - as stated in a set o f laws
adopted in 1999 - i s to create a single level o f local governments with autonomy in essential
services delivery and to reinforce a central government structure at the department level that will


                                                  36
be able, in compliance with decentralization laws, to: (i)   provide communes with technical
support; and (ii)
                be the prime focus o f interaction between the central State and communes. It i s
an opportunity for an administration traditionally centralized and characterized by top-down
decision-making. If well-designed and well-implemented, i t could improve service delivery and
increased downward accountability.

113. While some progress has been achieved, there are still difficulties in implementation and
progress is slow. There are uncertainties created by the interpretation o f texts and laws on the
powers and prerogatives o f the local public administrations, and a lack o f a clear institutional
framework to support implementation. The core issues are: (i)     lack o f an overall organizational
framework for implementation and a concrete action plan, including human resources
strengthening activities and lack o f clarity on the framework for fiscal decentralization; (ii)lack
o f cooperation between key actors (the mayors, the prkfets and the heads o f deconcentrated
branch offices); (iii)lack o f a strategy and agenda to increase budget transfers to municipalities
and improve their o w n revenues; and (iv) lack o f monitoring and evaluation o f the progress o f
the reform.

4.3.7   Public Administration

114. The civil service statute today in force dates to 1986, i.e. a text enacted before the
political and economic liberalization o f the 1990s, which in particular features automatic career
advancement regardless o f performance. The wage bill i s under control, but liabilities are
building up. The wage bill as a percentage o f recurrent expenditure i s around 40 percent. The
risk associated with such a percentage i s the crowding-out o f non-wage recurrent expenditures
such as goods, services and maintenance, and o f capital expenditures. Despite the overall cost of
the wage bill for the country, salaries do not succeed in retaining skilled professionals. However,
in order to get an accurate picture o f civil servants compensations, one needs to take a look at the
complex - and far from transparent - system o f non-salary or fiinge benefits, which can increase
base salary by a significant percentage, partly on a discretionary basis. One consequence o f
years o f recruitment freezes following the fiscal crisis o f 1989 i s a skewed age distribution o f the
civil servants. The forthcoming retirement o f many civil servants - many o f which belong to the
categories A and B - needs to be planned for. It is also an opportunity to adopt strict and
transparent recruitment rules in order to strengthen the civil service. Strategic planning and
enforcement o f transparent recruitment rules are thus top priorities, which must also take into
account the need to redress the geographical imbalance in civil servants’ distribution across the
country.

 115. Deconcentration o f some key human resource management processes to the education
ministries i s effective, and i t s positive evaluation is the basis for planning further deconcentration
to more line ministries (with necessary capacity building in parallel, since the evaluation
highlighted this as a weakness o f the previous process). The directory o f j o b descriptions and
recruitment conditions for high level technical positions was finalized and validated, providing
the administration with an important instrument to promote merit-based recruitment, provided
this instrument i s disseminated and i t s use monitored. In addition, a decision was taken to
overhaul the FUR, the integrated payroll and human resources database, following an audit
highlighting the weaknesses and structural constraints o f the existing system.



                                                   37
116.    The government reform agenda includes the following:

        e      Overhaul o f the existing FUR into a fully operational integrated human resources
        management system (Personnel Control and Information System): Following the audit o f
        the FUR, the Council o f Ministers authorized to proceed with the next steps: feasibility
        study and project document drafting. The system will be a deconcentrated instrument
        integrating all HR management data, and including a forward-planning capability. This
        should be budgeted for in the 2008 budget and deployed by 2009.

        Implementation of forward staffplanning (incl. medium t e r m recruitment policy): there i s
        a need to plan and elaborate a multi-annual recruitment policy based on various criteria
        such as quantity, quality, short or medium-term, financial resources and the missions and
        objectives. The key point is to identify the needs within each sector and geographical
        area and anticipate the retirement o f civil servants. Capacity for elaborating this type o f
        strategy already exists in certain ministries (e.g., education). I t should be built
        immediately in other large ministries, to allow the human resources management
        directorate to design and monitor a strategic recruitment policy. A decision was taken to
        appoint a human resources manager in each ministry, and a consultant is being hired to
        elaborate a recruitment policy and a procedures manual.

        e      Strict enforcement of technically sound and transparent recruitment rules:
        Remarkable progress has been made in establishing a directory o f j o b descriptions and
        recruitment conditions for high level technical positions, and progress describing all
        statutory jobs is ongoing. These directories will be the basis for processing all future
        recruitments. A monitoring mechanism needs to be set up to ensure that the instrument is
        properly used.

        e       Continuing the deconcentration of H M the results o f the evaluation of the
        delegation o f personnel management to three pilot ministries are positive.
        Deconcentration to more line ministries will be pursued, accompanied by tutoring from
        the MTFP and capacity building for the staff. Discussions are already ongoing with the
        health and agriculture ministries. However, assistance and training needs were poorly
        budgeted for.

        e      Strengthening coordination o     f reforms: the creation o f a Ministry for
        Administrative and Institutional reform aims at addressing the lack o f coordination
        between important reforms being designed or implemented in the country (including
        decentralization and public finances). So far, this ministry i s lacking the budget and
        powers necessary to hlfill i t s mandate and allow i t to make significant progress in
        implementing i t s action plan by 2009.
4.3.8   Transparency and Anti-Corruption

117. The Government recognizes the negative impact o f poor governance and corruption on
economic growth and development in the country. Activities related to the preparation and
implementation o f a multi-sector governance and anticorruption strategy (GAC) have been o n
target. The World Bank Institute has provided technical assistance to the government for the


                                                 38
preparation and implementation o f a Governance Diagnostic Survey. The diagnostic survey will
provide the government with qualitative and quantitative data o n the state o f governance and
corruption in Benin. A Steering Committee headed by the Inspector General o f Finance and
comprised by civil society and government agencies representatives has been leading the
diagnostic survey process. The diagnostic survey has been carried out at three levels, household,
private sector and public officials. A report on the findings o f the Survey i s being prepared and
will be nationally disseminated through participatory workshops led by the IGF/MRAI with the
objective o f obtaining recommendations from key stakeholders that will be used by the
government to update the G A C strategy.

Focus o f the Proposed PRSC-4 and Follow-on Operations

118. The proposed PRSC-4 supports government’s efforts at promoting better governance
through financial management, civil service and justice reforms by including the following prior
actions: (a) submit the 2007 budget law to the National Assembly in line with revised MTEF
ceilings and PRSP priorities; (b) achieve the targets set in the 2006 program-budgets in priority
sectors/programs; (c) submit to the Council o f Ministers the Procurement Code and the
application regulations revised in compliance with UEMOA Directives No.04 and
05/2005/CM/UEMOA regarding public procurement and assignment o f public services; (d)
submit to the National Assembly the 2002 draft “Loi de Rbglement” and complete verification o f
the 2003 draft “Loi de Rbglement”; (e) adoption by the Council o f Ministers o f the “R6f6rentiel
de Hauts Emplois Techniques” (upper level management position reference repertory) and the
monitoring mechanism, designation o f the members o f the monitoring body and submission o f
nominations to the Council o f Ministers; and (0 recruit 40 additional judges and 30 additional
court clerks and have such 40 judges start their training at the ENAM.

119. With respect to PRSC-5, it will continue to support the above reform areas through the
following measures: (a) submission o f the draft 2008 Budget Law to the National Assembly in
line with revised MTEF and PRSP priorities; (b) implementation o f the 2007 budget programs
for priority sectors including the monitoring and evaluation actions; (c) set up o f the integrated
public procurement management system (SIGMP); and (d) submission o f the 2003 and 2004
central budget audit reports to Parliament.

                           5. THE PROPOSED PRSC-4 CREDIT

120. The proposed operation i s the first in a series o f three annual PRSCs (PRSCs 4, 5 and 6)
which will support the Government’s PRS implementation along with other IDA instruments,
including investment credits. This section outlines the overall framework o f the new series and
describes the proposed PRSC-4.

         5.1    THEOVERALL FRAMEWORK
                                  OF THE NEWSERIES OF PRSCS 4,s AND 6

121. The overall objective o f the proposed PRSCs i s to support implementation o f Benin’s
Strategy for Growth and Poverty reduction (PRSP 1  1) adopted in April 2007 by the Government.
The first series o f PRSCs for Benin focused on improving economic growth and governance
through reforms in the business environment, justice, agriculture and infrastructure, and through
public expenditure management reforms in key sectors, such as health, education and water. The


                                                39
proposed second series will deepen the focus on improving the policy environment for private
investment, including supporting completion o f the reforms in the cotton sector, and
infrastructure. The series will also continue to support Government’s measures to pursue
progress toward the MDGs by improving access to basic services and ensuring greater efficiency
o f public expenditures on human capital formation and to promote better governance through
financial management, civil service and justice reforms. This will respond to requests from the
Benin public for improved quality o f public services and more transparency in the use o f public
resources, as well as from donors in need o f fiduciary standards to facilitate continued budget
support. The PRSC 4-6 i s complemented by more specific investment credit in the areas o f
competitiveness and growth, energy, rural development, environment and forestry.

5.1.1   Development Objectives

122. The development objectives o f the new PRSC series are to support the acceleration o f
real growth and the reduction o f the incidence o f poverty in Benin through the following three
pillars:


        (i)
          improving the policy environment for private investment and infrastructure;

        (ii)pursuing progress toward the M D G s by improving access to basic services and
        ensuring greater efficiency o f public expenditures on human capital formation; and

        (iii)
            promoting better governance through financial management, civil service and justice
        reforms.

123. Several reasons underpin the choice o f policies to be supported by the new PRSC series
in Benin. The focus on improving the policy environment for private investment reflects the
findings o f the Investment Climate Assessment, and the 2007 Doing Business Report. These
reports highlight specific weaknesses related to the business climate and heightened the
authorities’ awareness o f the main impediments to private sector growth and the need to address
them. In addition, the recent Diagnostic Trade Study provides additional insights on reforms
needed to raise Benin’s competitiveness, reduce economic vulnerability and diversify the
economy and exports. The continued focus on social services reflects Benin’s goals on progress
toward the MDGs and the need to increase poverty reduction efforts by strengthening the
effectiveness and equity o f service delivery through results-based management and institutional
capacity building. The continued focus on governance will help improve transparency,
accountability and efficiency in budget processes, enable decentralized structures to generate
resources commensurate with their mandate and enhance medium-term planning visibility for
sectoral program budgets.

5.1.2   Results Framework

124. The Government’s development objectives to which PRSC 4-6 will contribute and the
outcome indicators that will be used to assess progress are presented in Annex 1. The outcome
indicators covering the 2006-2010 period are consistent with the PRSP I1monitoring indicators.

                      5.2    PRIOR ACTIONSFOR THE PROPOSED PRSC-4

125. PRSC-4 would support selected reform measures in the Government’s program o f
reforms described in section 4 and in its Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) (Schedule 1) that
are deemed essential for i t s success. The rationale for their selection has been discussed in the
previous section. These measures are largely in l i n e with agreements reached under PRSC-3 and
consistent with the Government’s PRSP 1   1. Compliance with these prior actions as defined in the
English version o f the Financial Agreement forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the
proposed operation.

126. The prior actions for PRSC-4 are derived from triggers that were identified during the
preparation o f PRSC-3. There have been some limited adjustments to take into account,
exogenous factors not under control o f the Government, or capacity constraints that have
affected the speed o f program implementation. Some prior actions needed to be better qualified
to become monitorable.

                             Box 1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
'rinciple 1: Reinforce Ownership
:he new PRSC4-6 series builds o n the foundation o f the progress achieved during the first PRSP as w e l l as o n the
haft o f the Second PRSP. A draft Second PRSP document was produced in January 2007 by Government after
horough discussions with sector ministries, c i v i l society, the private sector and unions, and in close coordination
vith a l l o f Benin's financial and technical partners; it was adopted in April 2007. The program supported by the
'RSCs, developed in concert with Government and other donors, works with them t o promote the development o f
:overnment strategies in various sectors, and subsequently t o rely j o i n t l y o n measures derived f r o m these
,trategies, which have also been endorsed in the new PRSP.

I n the sensitive issue o f private participation in public utilities services, the approach taken under the PRSCs has
)een to work with the pace set by the new Government as it works t o ensure ownership by the different
itakeholders i n the telecom and energy sectors. For telecom, the n e w Director o f the public telecom company
ield a public meeting in December 2006 t o lay out the n e w timetable for privatization o f the company. F o r
:nergy, Government convened a conference among a l l stakeholders in January 2007 t o agree o n a new strategy
'or the sector and for eventual private participation in segments o f the market. Subsequently, a formal energy
iector strategy was adopted based o n the agreements o f the conference.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and otherfinancialpartners on a coordinated accountability
%amework.
The PRSC4 support is summarized i            n a policy matrix. Donors are consulted closely to ensure consistencies
imongst interventions. Sustained discussions with donors that are providing budget support operations (AfDB,
EU, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland) are helping to improve alignment o f support to Benin's
PRSPMTEF. In October 2006, an M o U was discussed between the Government and the development partners
x o v i d i n g budget support t o consolidate t h i s cooperation. T h i s M o U includes a proposed j o i n t matrix o f proposed
reforms with related indicators. I t translates Government and technical and financial development partners desire
to ensure that budget support becomes the k e y instrument o f their cooperation in the implementation o f the PRSP
2nd related sector strategies and policies, and to ensure a good coordination o f the various donor interventions. A
me-day workshop was held among a l l donors in February 2007 to improve t h i s MOU and adherence to the Paris
Declaration.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities o    f Bank support to country
 circumstances
As with the preceding operations, PRSC-4 i s aligned with the government's budget, although for 2007 i t s
disbursement will not take place until mid-2007 (project's preparation was delayed due to the presidential election
in early 2006 and resulting changes in the administration). In October 2006, the Government announced i t s
strategic orientation for i t s 2006-201 1 Development Plan. These strategic choices formed the framework for the
new PRSP o n which this operation i s based.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
IDA's policy matrix uses a set o f key prior actions for PRSC-4 which are embedded in a results framework with
specific targets, in coherence with the PRSP objectives. K e y prior actions are focused o n critical steps t o support
ongoing policy reforms in the areas o f sustainable economic growth, improved service delivery, and improved
governance and public sector management. This approach helps overcome institutional bottlenecks for priority
sectors, and strengthen institutional capacities, with support o f other donors and IDA's ongoing operations.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support.
As agreed with Government, joint PRSP Reviews and joint Budget and Appraisal missions take place yearly. T o
ensure timely feedback into the policymaking and budget processes, efforts have been made by the Government
and the donors to coordinate various review processes around the PSRP implementation, leading to a successful
coordination o f the review o f the latest Annual Progress Report with the budget preparation timetable, and with
preparation o f donors' budget support operations. Through the PRSP donor coordination, sector and thematic
technical groups have been set up which meet regularly.




                                                                 46
                           6. PRSC-4 IMPLEMENTATION

                               6.1                 PROCESS
                                       PARTICIPATION

128. The design o f this new PRSC series, and more particularly o f the first o f the three
proposed operations (PRSC-4), benefited from broad stakeholders consultations
conducted by the Government as part o f PRSP I1preparation. The PRSP was developed
with extensive participation at two stages. First, representatives from civil society joined
the thematic groups that drafted the document; these thematic texts were based on
sectoral analyses and included poverty diagnostics. Second, representatives from various
localities, unions, and the private sector were invited to examine and comment on the
draft document.

                         6.2         POVERTY AND   SOCIAL IMPACTS

129. The proposed PRSC-4 i s expected to have a significant positive impact on poverty
reduction. First, through components designed to improve the business climate and
private sector development, the proposed operation would promote economic growth.
Second, the strengthening o f public financial management i s expected to enhance the
efficiency and effectiveness o f public resources in the delivery o f development services
and in reaching the MDGs. Third, equitable development i s an explicit objective o f the
PRSP, and the PRSC supports i t through components emphasizing access to basic
services (such as health, education, water, rural transport) as well as those pursuing
aspects o f fiscal decentralization.

130. The country team conducted a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis on the Cotton
Sector in Benin (Report No. 29951-BJ). This analysis was used to support the design o f a
plan to stabilize incomes for cotton farmers, including the level and structure o f subsidies
when world prices or exchange rates are unfavorable. Also, in 2006 the Government of
Benin (Obsewatoire du Changement Social; Ministere du Developpement de 1'Economie
et des Finances) undertook a PSIA on land reform with technical support from UNDP.
This analysis fed into the land tenure reform component o f the Private Sector Letter o f
Development Policy, whose implementation is part o f the PRSC program. I t was noted
in the justification for this component, that converting living permits into ownership
rights was o f critical importance for the poor, and especially for those looking for ways to
secure credit for small enterprises.

                  6.3     SUPERVISION,             & EVALUATION
                                           MONITORING

131. The Ministry o f Development, Economy and Finance will be responsible for
overall implementation o f the proposed PRSC-4. The Committee for Economic and
Structural Programs in the Ministry will lead the Government's technical team with
representatives o f the Ministries o f Finance, Agriculture, Transport, Commerce,
Education, Health, Civil Service, Justice, and Decentralization.

132. To ensure timely feedback into the policymaking and budget processes, efforts
have been made by the Government and the donors to coordinate various review process


                                             47
around the PSRP implementation, leading to a successful coordination o f the review o f
the latest Annual Progress Report and o f the new PRSP, with the budget preparation
timetable, and with preparation o f donors’ budget support operations. The review took
place in September 2006 along with the second annual joint mission o f donors in
Cotonou. Thus, PRSC-4 supervision missions will take place together with the PRSP and
other donors’ budget support reviews.

133. The Government has agreed that reviews o f the PRSP, PRSC, and other budget
support operations will be based on the sectoral performance indicators and targets set
out in sector program budgets. Joint Govemment/donor reviews o f PRSC sector
programs (rural water, health, and education) were carried out in September/October
2006 and were further discussed during the pre-appraisal mission. The results o f these
sector reviews feed into discussions o f the Annual Progress Reports and o f budget
preparation.

134. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the PRSC will continue to be
based on the M&E system developed earlier for the PRSP. Although it needs
strengthening, progress has been made by the Government with donor support to build
the capacity o f organizations tasked with the responsibility o f collecting, analyzing and
disseminating data and other information. Detailed results o f the 2002 census provided
useful information for improving poverty diagnosis and strengthening poverty analysis
while a new household survey was launched in the context o f the PRSP I1preparation.

135. However, some problems remain and need to be addressed to achieve a more
efficient system. In their joint comments on the last PRSP implementation progress
reports, donors have underlined the continued lack o f reliable data for a number o f
indicators which prevented a more in depth evaluation o f the impact o f past policies, and
did not allow for measuring progress towards reaching specific PRSP targets. Donors
therefore agree with the conclusion o f the progress report on the necessity to put in place
a mechanism for the regular and systematic collection o f data for the PRSP M&E
indicators. Data related to commercial exchange with Nigeria, civil service salaries and
domestic debt is also scarce.

 136. At the sector levels, monitoring and evaluation u n i t s established in line ministries
have begun to play their role. However, the preparation work underscored that, while the
evaluation culture i s increasing along with the PRSP implementation, the disparity in
level and depth o f existing capacity remains high. Not all sectoral units are functional. It
i s the same for the departmental M&E committees. Broadly, three ministries/institutions,
namely Health, Environment and OCS (the central agency for monitoring PRSP
indicators), meet the criteria o f readiness and have a high capacity to carry out M&E
work. Education and Transport ministries have medium capacity.

 137. The functioning and effectiveness o f the existing coordination and monitoring
institutional arrangement have increased over time since the Government, in liaison with
the donors, adopted texts to further clarify roles and responsibilities o f the main structures
involved. In particular, the collaboration between the two main technical arms o f the
system, i.e. the Permanent Secretariat o f the National Committee for Development and


                                              48
the Fight Against Poverty (SP-CNDLP) located in the Ministry o f Finance and Economy,
and the Observatory o f Social Conditions (OCS) under the Ministry o f Planning, became
more smooth and effective. A three-year activity program has been developed by OCS to
address the main M&E and capacity needs and i s being supported under a well
coordinated donors’ effort. This includes the execution o f a sizeable household survey
whose first set o f results planned for June-July 2007 will help improve poverty diagnosis
and analysis. These steps have allowed for improvement in the quality o f documents
produced such as the social monitoring table, the PRSP progress reports, progress on the
M D G s and the preparation o f the methodology on the integrated poverty surveys
(EMICOV).

                                6.4            ASPECTS
                                       FIDUCIARY

138. The Government’s policy framework for Budget Management (GBAR) was based
on the 2005 C F A A update and PEFA assessments. Following the C F A A
recommendations, PRSC-3 included as a prior action the adoption o f a decree regulating
internal control, which strengthened the Financial Inspection Department and organized
the internal control framework. Government also adopted a detailed action plan for
procurement reform base on the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR).
The plan i s in line with: (i)  the WAEMU’s Procurement Directives, adopted by the
Council o f Ministers in 2005 in the context o f the Regional Procurement Reform
Program supported by IDA and other donors (AfDB, EU); and (ii)       the Baseline Indicators
(BIs) developed and adopted by OECD/DAC/WB. Submission to the Council of
Ministers o f a new procurement code i s a prior action for PRSC-4. In 2006, IDA has
addressed the r i s k associated with the surge in use o f exceptional procedures by
conducting, with other donors, audits o f those expenses (in 2004 and 2006) and by
following up o n an agreed action plan. IDA has encouraged the involvement o f internal
and external auditors in these ad hoc audits to ensure on-the-job training and adequate
follow-up. During PRSC-4 preparation, the Bank has continued i t s dialogue with
Government on fiduciary standards and has found the implementation o f i t s program and
i t s commitment to P F M reforms to be satisfactory. The fiduciary environment was found
to be adequate to proceed with the operation.

139. The Central Bank o f the West African States (BCEAO) is the common central
bank o f the West African countries, including Benin. In 2005, the IMF staff carried out
an on-site safeguards assessment o f the B C E A O and found that progress had been made
in strengthening the BCEAO’s safeguards framework since 2002 when the last safeguard
assessment was undertaken. The BCEAO now publishes a fbll set o f audited financial
statements, and improvements have been made to move financial reporting closer to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO has
improved the explanatory notes to the financial statements and fbrther changes are
scheduled for the next fiscal year, with a view toward a gradual alignment with
International Accounting Standard (IAS), as adopted internationally by other central
banks. Furthermore, an international audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms
have been established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and follow-up on
internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened. The external auditor
has apprised the Board o f Directors o f the B C E A O o f the quality o f internal controls in


                                              49
June 2003. IMF staff identified a number o f areas where further steps would help solidify
the progress made in recent years. The main recommendations relate to: (i) improving the
external audit process by adopting a formal rotation policy and further enhancing the
transparency o f the financial statements by adopting IFRS in full; and (ii)
                                                                           enhancing the
effectiveness o f the internal audit function by further strengthening the reporting to
management o f the BCEAO.

                         6.5               AND AUDITING
                                 DISBURSEMENT

140. The operation would consist o f a single tranche credit o f US$40 million
equivalent to be available upon effectiveness and disbursed on the basis o f a withdrawal
application be disbursed immediately upon effectiveness. The proposed operation will
follow IDA’Sdisbursement procedures for development policy credits. The untied budget
support will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development
program and not tied to any specific purchase and no procurement requirements will be
needed. Once the credit becomes effective, the proceeds will be deposited by IDA into a
Government account at the Central Bank which forms part o f the country’s foreign
exchange reserves; and as a due diligence measure, IDA will obtain confirmation from
the government that the amount o f the credit has been accounted for in the country’s
budget management system. The proceeds o f the Credit will not be used to finance
expenditures excluded under the Agreement. If, after being deposited in this account, the
proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing
Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to either: (a) apply the corresponding amount
to eligible, or (b) refund the amount directly to IDA. No dedicated account i s required.

                           6.6                ASPECTS
                                  ENVIRONMENTAL

141. The proposed development policy Credit supports mostly economic governance
and sector reforms that are not expected to have a significant environmental effect. The
potential environmental and social effects associated with the proposed PRSC-4 are
mainly related to the rural water, rural transport, energy, health, and education sectors.

 142. Extensive Environment Assessments and Social Analysis were undertaken during
the preparation o f PRSC1-3 to identify possible positive and negative linkages between
the PRSC support and environmental and social impacts. I t also took into account the
environmental and social analysis undertaken for other Bank operations. W h i l e PRSC
support i s not expected to have any significant negative environmental or social impacts,
the analyses focused on the environmental and social issues facing Benin and the
capacity o f national and local public sector agencies roles and responsibilities to manage
them.

143. PRSC-4 continues to draw on the Environmental Assessment and Social Analysis
undertaken for PRSC1-3. The Ministry o f Environment, Housing and Urban
Development adopted a Medium-Term Strategic Plan in 2002 that highlighted the main
environmental objectives in the sector. The Environment Directorate and the Benin
Environmental Agency share the responsibility and objectives o f the Ministry in the areas
o f environmental management and environmental assessment. This mandate focuses on


                                            50
the country’s major environmental threats. I t evolves around the following activities: a)
strengthening and deepening the regulatory framework, b) developing environmental
compliance and enforcement tools for environmental impact assessment, c) protecting
coastal resources and controlling coastal erosion, d) controlling urban transport pollution,
e) increasing access to urban sanitation and drainage services. To this end, small
environmental units within key line ministries have been established and trained in
identifying and implementing measures for mitigating any adverse environmental or
social impacts o f public investment programs. The units are charged with implementing
their respective Environmental and Social Management Plans, and will continue to
oversee their activities. Benin’s environmental compliance is supported by the
environmental management activities in several investment projects supported by the
Bank in the sectors o f energy, forestry, cotton, or malaria. The Benin Environmental
Agency (ABE) has overall responsibility for ensuring that EAs are carried out for all
projects in accordance with national standards.

144. Under the Ministry o f Environment and Natural Protection (MENP) ABE i s the
focal point for carrying out in-depth environmental impact assessments. Environmental
compliance certificates and environmental management plans, for environmental impact
assessments are designed by ABE, ratified by the MENP and then sent to every DDEPN
and to every sector focal points and ABE put them on the online environmental database.
Each DDEPN follows the environmental management plans relative to the operations,
which are executed within the territories o f i t s Department. Discussion with the sector
focal points are made compulsory when a project execution i s related to more than one
sector (road, power line, etc.). Sector focal points and regional focal points send monthly
reports to ABE. ABE analyzes these monthly reports and sets up a quarterly meeting with
both the sector focal points and the regional focal points in order to organize the national
report on environmental monitoring. The national report summarizes the main elements
for PGE monitoring, sector by sector, with relevant recommendation. ABE elaborates an
annual report, which i s sent to both sector and regional focal points and shared on line.

145. The reforms in the Rural Water sector mainly aim at increasing water supply
access and equity, improving sustainability o f the existing facilities (including the
piloting o f PPPP arrangement in small towns. The Ministry o f Energy and Water
Resources had adopted appropriate measures to deal the potential environment and social
issues associated with the planned investments. I t was agreed that these measures
including carrying out o f mandatory fill EIA for small dams, control o f wastewater and
mud around wells, and compliance with the requirements pertaining to the minimum
distance between wells and latrines will continue to be enforced by the existing
functional EL4 unit o f the ministry.

146. The risks for this operation include: (i)    obstacles to the reform agenda; (ii)
                                                                                     weak
capacity to implement the reforms; (iii)  vulnerability to commodity and currency rates;
and (iv) constraints to economic diversification.

147.     Obstacles to the reform agenda. Interests favored under the old regime may
resist to the reform agenda and risk reversals, in particular when the Government seeks to
improve transparency and fiduciary standards. During the March 2007 parliamentary
elections the party o f the President did not win a majority and will need to establish
alliances in the National Assembly. This might oblige the Government to make
compromises when i t comes to implement the reform agenda and could delay the process.
The team has worked to mitigate these risks by supporting the Government in its
consistent application o f formal procedures and by grounding reforms in participatory
processes as well as in the dynamics laid out in the PRSP.

148. Weak capacity to implement the reforms. Several sectors have encountered
difficulties in working with the national budget system in order to implement sector
programs. As a result the execution rate i s l o w in some sectors. The finance ministry
needs to maintain a dialogue with the line ministries in order to remove any obstacles
posed by operation o f the budget system. Certain reforms, including justice and
decentralization, suffer from struggles for control o f the reform within the Government.
Finally procurement procedures are s t i l l slow. The team will continue to use means
available through dialogue donor coordination and technical assistance as a way to
concentrate energies in a unified direction.

149. Vulnerability to commodity price and currency rate fluctuations. Benin’s
economic growth remains vulnerable to external shocks. I             n particular, Benin i s
vulnerable to fluctuations o f world prices for cotton and oil, and to the appreciation o f the
Euro to which the CFAF i s pegged at a fixed rate against the U S dollar. Since cotton i s
the main export product o f the economy, l o w international prices hurt the country’s
performance and negatively affect the rural population. The potential fiscal impact o f
continuous low cotton prices i s also significant. This risk is mitigated by specific
measures envisioned in this operation and follows operations in the energy sector to open
the market to new producers, in agriculture to diversify production, and in cotton to
improve the marketing o f the cotton production.

150. Constraints to economic diversification. Diversification i s the cornerstone of
Government’s policy to stimulate economic growth. Nevertheless, the new sources of
growth are limited to some activities like transit, tourism, agricultural crops with high
potential and services and to the capacity to attract investors. To mitigate this risk and
accelerate the diversification process, the PRSC 4-6 focus on improving the policy
environment for private investment and infrastructure, opening sectors and markets to
new potential investors and providers, developing new agricultural production and
improving the regulatory framework, governance and transparency.

           IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article I V Consultation with Benin

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 06/140
December 12, 2006

1.     Public Information Notices (PINs) form part o f the IMF's efforts to promote
transparency o f the IMF's views and analysis o f economic developments and policies.
With the consent o f the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive
Board discussions o f Article IV consultations with member countries, o f i t s surveillance
o f developments at the regional level, o f post-program monitoring, and o f ex post
assessments o f member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also
issued after Executive Board discussions o f general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.4

 2.    On November 27,2006, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 concluded the Article I V consultation with Benin.

Background

3.      Economic performance has been relatively subdued since 2003 after a decade o f
high growth. Slow economic growth has reflected limited progress in addressing core
economic vulnerabilities and delays in implementing crucial growth-supporting structural
reforms, against a backdrop o f an appreciating real effective exchange rate and, more
recently, a sizable deterioration in the terms o f trade. Real GDP growth fell to 2.9 percent
in 2005 largely because o f weakness in the cotton sector, which contributes an estimated
10 percent to total value added, and because investment demand was affected by election-
related uncertainties. Inflation spiked upwards owing to strong food demand from crisis-
afflicted Niger and high o i l prices.

4.      Benin has lost over 60 percent o f competitiveness gains from the 1994
devaluation o f the CFA franc-more than in most other West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by
another 2 percent in 2005 due to unfavorable price developments. Moreover, as world o i l
prices surged and the f.0.b. price for ginned cotton declined 35 percent, the terms o f trade
deteriorated by about 16 percent in 2005. Nonetheless, the current account deficit,
excluding grants, continued to moderate, reflecting lower formal sector o i l imports
stemming from management weaknesses at SONACOP (Benin's oil-importing
monopoly) and weaker capital goods imports.

5.    Notwithstanding hrther delays in structural reforms, a turnaround in cotton
production is helping to revive growth in 2006. Growth i s also benefiting from Port o f
Cotonou reforms and ongoing improvements in trade relations with Nigeria. Real GDP
growth i s expected to rebound to 4.5 percent in 2006. Inflation i s projected to ease to 2%



  Under Article I V o f the IMF's Articles o f Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. O n return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion o f the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
o f the Board, summarizes the views o f Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities
                                                           55
percent by end-2006 and the current account deficit (excluding official grants) i s
expected to decline further to 7 percent o f GDP.

6.      The narrowly defined primary budget deficit i s projected to meet the program
target o f 0.4 percent o f GDP (0.9 percent, including Multilateral Debt R e l i e f Initiative-
funded outlays) in 2006. Fiscal prospects have benefited from expenditure and revenue
measures introduced in the second quarter o f 2006. These measures include the
institution o f a treasury committee to monitor more closely revenue collection and
spending execution under the supervision o f the finance minister, and strict adherence to
expenditure execution procedures. With technical assistance from the World Bank, the
new administration has initiated an audit o f the new domestic payments arrears that came
to light in 2006; the audit report and a plan to settle certified arrears are to be completed
by end-2006.

7.      Broad money rose by over 22 percent in 2005, considerably more than nominal
GDP. I n response, the B C E A O increased the reserve requirement ratio in Benin by 400
basis points, to 15 percent, in mid-2005, the highest level in the WAEMU. Broad money
and private sector credit growth has subsequently eased and i s projected to slow to a pace
closer to trend in 2006.

8.      In 2006, Benin received debt relief o f US$1.112 billion (25 percent o f 2005 GDP)
under the Multilateral Debt R e l i e f Initiative; this has reduced the country's total external
public debt to about 13 percent o f GDP. The assistance will partly be allocated to priority
sector spending in education, health, and infrastructure.

9.      Over the medium term, the government's economic policies aim to accelerate
growth while keeping inflation low. Assuming a favorable external environment and a
continuing recovery o f cotton production, the medium-term macroeconomic framework
calls for annual real GDP growth o f 455-534 percent in 2006-08, in line with performance
before Benin's recent slowdown. Inflation i s expected to be contained within the
WAEMU limit o f 3 percent, which would prevent further real exchange rate appreciation,
while the external current account deficit narrows to 6.5 percent o f GDP by 2008. The
narrowly defined primary budget deficit (including MDRI-fimded outlays) would be
eliminated in 2008.

10.     A key element o f the authorities' structural reform agenda i s to reinvigorate
stalled privatization o f the utilities, port, and cotton sectors. Under the cabinet-approved
disengagement strategies, the government would: (i)            complete its withdrawal from
commercial activities in the cotton sector by mid-2007; (ii)        bring to point o f sale the
state-owned electricity company by the end o f August 2007; and (iii)       start operations o f

Executive Board Assessment

11.     Executive Directors welcomed the rebound in growth in 2006, which in part
reflects a recovery in cotton output. Directors commended the adoption o f a growth

                                               56
strategy by Benin's authorities that aims at strengthening the fiscal position and
rekindling structural reforms. They stressed the importance o f addressing core economic
vulnerabilities to accelerate growth, reduce poverty, and help achieve Benin's Millennium
Development Goals. Structural reforms will also be essential to counter the long-term
decline in competitiveness and overcome absorptive and institutional capacity
constraints. Directors also encouraged the authorities to seek concessional financing from
development partners for their economic program.

12.    Directors stressed that long-term fiscal sustainability i s crucial to sustained
economic growth and poverty reduction. They commended the authorities for measures
taken to reverse recent fiscal slippages and emphasized the importance o f adherence to
the convergence criteria under the Growth and Stability Pact in the West African
Economic and Monetary Union.

13.     Looking ahead, Directors were encouraged by the government's commitment to
improving revenue and expenditure administration, which they considered essential to
achieving fiscal consolidation and providing space for increased pro-poor spending. They
underscored the need to strengthen revenue performance through improved tax and
customs administration and urged the authorities to implement the recommendations of
recent Fund technical assistance on revenue management. Directors underscored the need
for strict observance o f expenditure execution procedures. They also noted the envisaged
orderly settlement o f overdue obligations to civil servants and stressed that this, together
with appropriate containment o f the wage bill, was essential to provide space for priority
spending. Directors took note o f the authorities' efforts to restore the medium-term
financial viability o f the civil service pension fund, but regretted the lack o f visible
progress so far. They commended the authorities for their implementation o f the April
2006 ban on the use o f ad-hoc Treasury Payments Orders, which had boosted extra-
budgetary outlays in the past, and encouraged the authorities to enhance public
expenditure management, especially as regards expenditure tracking.

14.     Directors noted that Benin's financial system appears mostly sound and welcomed
the completion o f reforms to address governance and portfolio weaknesses in some
banks. However, they recommended continued efforts to reduce nonperforming loans and
vigilance to avoid the risks related to the substantial loan concentration in a limited
number o f sectors and companies.

15.    Directors cautioned against a borrowing policy that would put external debt
sustainability at risk in the post-MDRI era. Directors advised that, as new borrowing
space opens up, particular attention be given to the concessionality o f new loans, cost-
benefit analyses o f envisaged investment projects, and appropriate assessment o f the
absorptive capacity o f the economy. In this context, Directors regretted that the outgoing
administration had gone against the advice o f i t s debt committee and guaranteed a non-
concessional loan to the state-owned telephone company.

16.    Directors welcomed the authorities' renewed commitment to enhancing external
competitiveness through reforms in the parastatal sectors. They emphasized the crucial
importance o f bolstering the viability o f Benin's cotton sector, and welcomed the
announced government withdrawal from industrial and commercial activities in the sector
by mid-2007. Directors stressed the need for an adequate regulatory framework in the
energy sector to encourage private sector involvement. They expressed concern about the

                                             57
slow pace o f reforms in the telecommunications sector, and welcomed the announced
strategic assessment o f the telecom parastatal in preparation for i t s privatization.

17.     Directors strongly encouraged the authorities to pursue reforms aimed at
addressing weaknesses in the judicial system, modernizing land tenure, and facilitating
access to credit for small and medium sized enterprises.

1 . The present development policy letter describes the reform program sustained by the
fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) which aims to support the
implementation of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP 1   1) adopted by the
Government in February 2007. This Strategy sets out the broad economic and financial
orientations for the 2007-2009 period.

2. This letter follows, in a continuing process, on that dated 28 July 2006. It describes
the medium-term actions that the Government intends to execute in order to effectively
implement the PRSP I1 by focusing on the measures that will increase the efficiency and
the impact of public spending and which will essentially contribute towards improving
the public services, in particular for the poorest populations. The matrix containing the
updated policies and measures supported by the PRSC and prepared in conjunction with
the International Development Association (IDA) and other development partners,
notably the European Union, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, France and
Germany, is annexed to the present letter. This matrix summarizes and specifies the
contents of the present letter.

3. The matrix of the policies and measures reflects the effort in defining priorities on
the basis of the budgetary constraints identified in the 2007-2009 Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the institutional constraints affecting the absorption
capacity of the Administration. The execution of the actions and the fulfillment of the
outcomes indicated in bold in the matrix, are considered essential for the success of this
reform program. These actions and outcomes are thus preliminary measures to
the PRSCa

1. Context and recent developments

4. The Government of Benin had developed and adopted a Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS) in December 2002. This Strategy, which included the 2003-2005 period, aimed a t
ensuring that progress in economic growth would result in a tangible improvement in
the living conditions of households and in a significant reduction in poverty. At the end
of the implementation period of this Strategy, the Government, together with the
Technical and Financial Partners (TFP), agreed to consider 2006, the year of the
development of the new Strategy, as a transitional period.

5. Within the scope of the preparation of the new Strategy, which took place within a
context of a change in government a t the conclusion of the March 2006 Presidential
elections, the Government proceeded firstly with an evaluation of the 2003-2005 PRS.

6. The implementation of the 2003-2005 PRS enabled: (i) the achievement of
noticeable progress a t an institutional level and in the execution of the reforms; (ii) the
recording of considerable results insofar as sustainable development is concerned. A t an
institutional level, significant progress was made in the generalization of the
participatory approach for the development and implementation of the multisectoral
strategies, as well as for the follow-up -evaluation strategies. With regard to the
implementation of the reforms, the 2003-2005 PRS constituted the first frame of
reference for structuring and coordinating the participation of the TFPs in support of the
Government programs, and in directing them more efficiently towards the fight against
poverty. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) served, in a significant manner,
                                            66
as an instrument of dialogue between Government and the investors. It enabled them
to develop the practice of joint missions and joint budgetary support and to adopt two
economic and financial programs supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
As regards sustainable development, the implementation of the 2003-2005 PRS enabled
the achievement of concrete results insofar as the improvement in the living conditions
of the populations is concerned.
7. However, the provisional and partial results from the national household living
standards measurement survey (EMICOV) conducted by the Government within the
scope of updating the poverty profile for the development of the Strategy in the fight
against poverty, revealed that, although the living conditions of the populations
regarding basic social services (health, education, safe drinking water) have shown
relative improvement, monetary poverty, which is determined through the final
household consumer expenditure, has deteriorated. Drawing lessons from that which
precedes, the Government undertakes to (i) improve the overall and sectoral
competitiveness of the economy; (ii) intensify the diversification of the economy; (iii)
improve the quality of life of the population; and (iv) to reduce poverty in a significant
manner.
8. Moreover, despite the numerous reforms implemented, there is no choice but to
accept that the results fall short of the objectives set in terms of growth and poverty
reduction. Similarly, it was noted that in order to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) by 2015, more vigorous actions need to be carried out. This relative
counter-performance is explained by: (i) insufficient attention given to the issues of
diversification and growth, in particular boosting the private sector and the development
of sectoral and regional growth poles; (ii) the underestimation of the role played by
human capital in the growth and poverty reduction process; (iii) the underestimation of
the internal resistance of the public administration in the face of the changes entailed in
results-based management principles and in good governance; and (iv) the little
involvement of local communities in the development process.
9.    It was within this context that the Government defined its medium-term
development vision which was to turn Benin into an emerging country. This vision is
upheld by the following six strategic orientations: (i) to rebuild an Administration in the
service of the general interest and the promotion of the private sector; (ii) to reorganize
the macroeconomic framework and to maintain its stability; (iii) to promote economic
revival; (iv) to develop economic and social infrastructures; (v) to strengthen human
capital; and (v) to ensure balanced and sustainable development of national territory
through basic development.
10. These strategic orientations trace the broad outlines of the Government’s medium-
term vision of development for the 2006-2011 period. The variation of this vision in the
short-term will be achieved through the PRSP 11. This Strategy operationalizes this
vision of development and the major actions are documented in the Priority Action
Program (PAP) which provides the link between the Strategy and the budget programs.


11 . I n order to strengthen the experiences of the PRS and to implement adequate
reform programs to achieve the objectives retained in the 2007-2009 PRSP 1  1, the
Government requested and obtained a fourth PRSC (PRSC-4).




                                            67
2. The 2007-2009 reform program

12. The PRSP I1 is structured around five (05) broad strategic axes namely:

Axis 1: Growth acceleration
Axis 2: Infrastructural development
Axis 3: Strengthening human capital
Axis 4: Promotion of good governance
Axis 5: Balanced and sustainable development of national territory

13. I n addition to the measures aimed at strengthening the macroeconomic framework,
the achievement of the objectives of growth for poverty reduction, in particular those
associated with the social indicators, shall form part of a special focus in the sectoral
programs that will continue to be executed in the results-based management logic.
Moreover, the National Assembly approved the 2007 bill of finances in accordance with
the 2007-2009 MTEF and with the priorities of the PRSP I1 in domains such as
agriculture, supply of safe drinking water in rural areas, health, basic education,
environment and urban planning, forestry management and transport. Similarly, the
operationalization plan of the Results-based Budgetary Management Reform Framework
(CaR-GBAR) was developed and its implementation commenced with the Results-based
Budgetary Management Reform Support Project (Pro-ReGAR), supported by the
European Union, and the monitoring institutions supported by the African Development
Fund and the Kingdom of Denmark.

                  2.1. Axis Iof the PRSP 11: Growth acceleration

14. The Government adopted an economic policy based on the pursuit of accelerated
growth in view of the significant reduction of poverty. I n this context, the private sector
is called to play an important role to drive this growth. I n order to attain this, four
priority action areas are retained: (i) the stabilization of the macroeconomic framework;
(ii) the dynamization of the private sector; (iii) the diversification of the economy; and
(iv) the promotion of regional integration.

15. During the 2003-2005 period, economic growth experienced a bear tendency and
remained below the intended objective. I n 2006, however, we note an upturn in the
economy with a growth rate of 4.1% compared with 2.9% in 2005. The Government
intends to implement various reforms aimed a t increasing the growth rate to around 7%
by 2009.

16. Thus, the Government sets as its objective achieving a growth rate of 6% in 2007,
6.8% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009. I n order to achieve this, it plans to increase the public
investment rate of 4,6% of the GDP in 2006 to 8,6% of the GDP in 2007; 9,5% in 2008
and 9,9% in 2009 whereas private investment would be 13,6% of the GDP in 2006;
1s0/o in 2007; 15% in 2008 and 15,3% in 2009. Thus, the total investment rate would
increase from 18.1% of the GDP in 2006 to 23.6% of the GDP in 2007; 24.4% of the
GDP in 2008 and 25.2% of the GDP in 2009.

17. Similarly, the inflation rate would be maintained within the 3% limit provided for by
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence pact, whereas
the deficit of the current balance would decrease from 6.2% of the GDP in 2006 to 5.8%
of the GDP in 2007; 5.5% of the GDP in 2008 and 4.9% of the GDP in 2009.
                                            68
18. The total State expenditure should, in accordance with the basic scenario of the
PRSP 1 1, increase from 22.1% of the GDP in 2006 to 24.4% of the GDP in 2007; 25.0%
in 2008 and 2009. On average, this should increase to 24.8% of the GDP during the
2007-2009 period compared with the 20.9% in 2004-2006. This increase in public
expenditure would be partially covered by the increase in the total State revenue which
is projected a t 17,6% of the GDP in 2007; 18% of the GDP in 2008 and 18,1% of the
GDP in 2009 owing in particular to the implementation of the measures aimed at
increasing the efficiency of fiscal recovery. Thus, the Government intends to (i)
strengthen the financial administration capacity; (ii) expand the tax base; (iii) seek
alternative sources of revenue; (iv) secure and equip the financial administration; (v)
improve the non-fiscal revenue collection; (vi) reconstitute State property; and (vii)
intensify the struggle against tax evasion. After all, the overall deficit would be
contained on average at 6,7% of the GDP during the 2007-2009 period compared with
3,6% obtained during the 2004-2006 period.

19. I n view of these income and expenses projections of the 2007-2009 PRSP 1        1, the
financing requirements are projected a t FCFA 49,5 billion, FCFA 93,8 billion and FCFA
72,2 billion in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively. The 2007 financing requirements
would be fully covered by the budgetary support of the World Bank (FCFA 20 billion),
the European Union (FCFA 11.7 billion), the African Development Bank (FCFA 12 billion)
and the other development partners (FCFA 5.8 billion). The Government envisages
introducing a correcting bill of finances in the National Assembly for consideration in the
2007 budget for, on the one hand, those actions not provided for, but retained by the
PRSP I1 and its PAP and, on the other hand, certain measures such as the obligatory
loan stock, taken during the year.

20. The acceleration of economic growth in a sustainable manner presupposes private
sector development which must result in an increase in private investment and in the
improvement in the competitiveness and modernization of this sector.                  The
implementation of the PRSP I1 during the three first years enabled the following
provisions to be taken: (i) reinforcing public/private sector dialogue; (ii) improving the
business environment; and (iii) strengthening the public-private partnership for
infrastructural development. Within this perspective of private sector development, the
Government places a particular emphasis on: (i) the impetus of the creation of new
SMEs; (ii) the promotion, strengthening and dynamization of the existing SMEs; (iii) the
development of micro-enterprises; and (iv) the improvement in the intermediary
financing in favor of this sector. To this end, the national micro-financing fund was
created. As regards the development of the craft industry and of tourism, the
Government intends: (i) to improve the institutional and regulatory structures and the
training system of the participants; (ii) to promote the artisans and the artisanal
products a t both national and international level; (iii) to reinforce the professional
capacity of the artisans and participants in the tourism sector; (iv) to promote access to
credit for micro-enterprises within the crafts sector; and (v) to enhance the value of
tourist sites and other tourist resources.

21. The Government launched the implementation of the private sector development
strategy through reforms in land, in the Industrial Free Zone and in taxation. I n this
way; it (i) introduced a bill on property tax to the National Assembly; (ii) prepared a
draft alignment letter as regards property tax reform; (iv) developed a collection of laws
on tax rebates; (v) set up a committee responsible for defining the broad orientations of

                                            69
a development taxation, and (vi) continued with the improvement, paving and
electrification of the Industrial Free Zone.

22. I n order to strengthen the capacity of the private sector participants, the
Government trained players from the new agricultural sectors (cashews, pineapples,
mushrooms, and halieutics) on the rules of hygiene, good agricultural practices and the
traceability of export products. It also put in place an integrated framework for the
promotion of commercial activities and created the Presidential Investment Council (CPI)
which is a platform for direct trade between national and international investors and the
President of the Republic. The Council’s first session was organized in February 2007
and a session of this institution will be held every six months. It envisages the
preparation of a new support project to the private sector together with the support of
the IDA, which is aimed a t improving competitiveness and realizing opportunities for
growth.

23.    Moreover, faced with the difficulties noted in carrying out the various
disengagement operations of the State, which remain essential for the implementation
of Benin‘s PRSP 11 , the Government is convinced of the necessity of strengthening the
public-private partnership in order to facilitate its pursuit in full transparency. The
Government further hopes that, together with the support of the development partners,
the Strategy may be implemented in the three priority sectors being: the industrial
instrument of SONAPRA, telecommunications and energy. The objective is to create
conditions that will enable the operators and private investors to participate in the
development of the priority sectors cited above under various forms (privatization,
concession, contracting etc ...). I n this way, the Government intends to pursue the
various disengagement operations of the State which are underway.

24. I n fact, taking into consideration the very fragile financial situation of the Benin
Electrical Energy Company (SBEE), the Government put an interim management
structure in place in order to stabilize the financial situation of this company. Within this
scope, an accounts management committee responsible for ensuring a more rational
management of the financial resources, was put in place and is functional. The State
envisages disengaging itself from the SBEE a t the end of this two year interim
management period which aims a t improving the performance of this company. This
disengagement by the State must take the form of concessive contracting. As regards
the telecommunications sector, the Government carried out significant reforms to bring
all the operators within the sector in line with the standards, and to stabilize the
financial situation of BENIN TELECOM SA. It also appointed the members of the
Transitional Regulatory Council from the telecommunications sector. The audit of the
financial statements and the strategic analysis of this enterprise will enable the
Government to decide on the State‘s disengagement strategy. The Government is
pursuing structural reforms in the other sectors and has paid particular importance to
the disengagement of the State from SONAPRA’s industrial activities. As regards the
port reforms, the Government proceeded with the computerization of the customs’
operations and carried out studies aiming to identify the provisions to be taken for (i)
the improvement in the flow of goods to the port; (ii) the definition of the institutional
reforms and the identification of the investment needs for the medium- and long-term
development of the port. A study dedicated to the infrastructural and equipment needs
required for increasing the port capacity, has been financed. The Government intends
to implement the results of these studies in order to improve the competitiveness of the
Cotonou port.

                                             70
25. The Government is aware of the fact that economic reforms alone are not enough
to drive economic growth and to reduce poverty. Moreover, the cotton industry, a key
contributor to economic growth, has experienced a decrease in production during the
past few years which is attributable to both malfunctioning a t a procedural level, as well
as a weakening in international exchange rates. Thus, in order to achieve accelerated
growth, the Government undertakes to carry out the diversification of the economy.
The five growth poles upon which the Government places a particular emphasis are: (i)
textiles; (ii) agribusiness; (iii) building, civil engineering and construction materials; (iv)
tourism, the craft industry and culture; and (v) transport, logistics and international
trade.

Agricultural sector

26. The priorities established in the various strategic documents of the rural sector are
commensurate with those of the PRSP 1        1. They thus constitute a good framework for
the development of the agricultural sector. The Government is aware of the inadequacy
as regards the technical and financial support given to the institutions of the sector for
implementing these strategies. I n order to improve the overall management of the
sector, the Government has committed to fundamental reform to enable the agricultural
sector to truly play its role as the driving force behind growth. Thus, the Government’s
policy is to target public investments more efficiently in order to inject enthusiasm into
the private initiatives in this sector and to meet the priorities of the PRSP 11.

27. The Government intends to improve agricultural productivity and production. Its
activities program includes the entire sector, notably the sub-sectors of agriculture,
stock-breeding and fishing. This program aims to (i) promote and develop the
agricultural sectors and (ii) to ensure the food and nutritional security of the
populations. I n the short-term, the Government undertakes to (i) promote the research
and popularization of high-yield seeds, plants and sires; (ii) develop improved
technologies associated with stocking, preserving and converting agricultural, animal
and halieutic products; (iii) strengthen the intervention capacities of the training
structures; (iv) strengthen the technical and organizational capacities of the producers
and of the training structures; and (vi) ensure the supply of specific inputs.

28. The reorganization of this overall management of the agricultural sector in fact
enables the Government to (i) put in place in a participatory manner, a national
structure of agricultural services; and (ii) to finalize, together with the private sector, a
support program for the development of new sectors namely cashews, shea, pineapples,
palm oil, rice and fishing (shrimps).

30. Likewise, the Government intends to implement a support program for the
installation of agricultural infrastructure and equipment. This program consists of (i)
opening up of the production zones; (ii) the development of low ground and irrigated
areas; (iii) the improvement in the conditions associated with the stocking, preservation
and conversion of products in order to limit the post-harvest losses and to bring added-
value to the producers; (iv) the development of agricultural mechanization; and (v) the
management of water destined for agricultural, pastoral and halieutic purposes.




                                              71
Cotton industry

30. Faced with the vulnerability of the industry due to various external shocks and their
consequences for the national economy, an adequate mechanism is needed in order to
resolve, in a sustainable and efficient manner, the problems associated with promoting
agriculture in the hope of seeing the emergence of other industries with development
potential and sources of growth. To this end, a policy document and a five-yearly action
plan were developed to redefine the mission of the National Society for Agricultural
Advancement (SONAPRA) in order to henceforth play the original role assigned to it.
Thus, in the absence of appropriate mechanisms for taking into account the risks, all
efforts by the participants concerned are destroyed. To avoid the disaffection on the
part of the producers vis-&vis the agricultural industries due to income fluctuation from
one campaign to the next, the State had to settle the outstanding payments of the
cotton producers in 2006.

31. The State’s disengagement process from the industrial instrument of SONAPRA is in
progress. The Government intends to maintain all industrial instruments within a
company currently being created whose value will be equal to the total value of the
share constituting the total of all SONAPRA’s industrial assets. It envisages initiating the
re-evaluation of the industrial instrument of SONAPRA prior to the creation of the limited
company whose capital will be held by the private sector, the producer, the workers,
and by the State. The Government intends to achieve this operation before the start of
the 2007-2008 marketing campaign.

             2.2. Axis I1 of the PRSP 11: Infrastructural development

32. Infrastructure constitutes a significant lever for promoting economic growth and
development. The transverse nature of infrastructure has considerable delaying effects
on the development of all activity sectors. Within this scope, the Government places a
particular emphasis on the realization of infrastructure in the energy, hydraulic,
sanitation and transport (land, river, maritime, aviation and rail) sectors. This
infrastructure will be realized through large programs namely: (i) the roads program that
will ensure improved urban, rural and inter-State mobility of people and goods, as well
as access of the populations to the basic socio-community services; (ii) the management
program of the modes of transport aimed a t increasing the efficacy of the ground,
maritime and air transport systems; (iii) the housing and construction program that will
promote the offer of administrative buildings, economical and public housing a t lower
cost for a greater number of people; and (iv) the urban management support program
aimed a t sustaining the local economic development of urban centers and improving
access of the populations to the basic services.


Rural transport

33. The objective pursued in this sector is to improve transport in the rural sphere in
view of increasing rural communities’ access to basic social services, to markets and to
production zones. The National Rural Transport Strategy (SNTR) adopted on 22 March
2006, serves as the basis for the rural transport program. Thus, the sector has an
investment and maintenance program running over several years as regards rural roads
and an institutional framework for the implementation of this strategy. I n 2007, the
Government intends to improve the overall management of the rural transport sub
                                            72
sector. It updated the institutional framework for the management of rural roads and
prepared and adopted the new regulations pertaining to such roads. It undertakes to
develop the roads used for rural transport by giving priority to the execution of the
following work: (i) development of the Bassila - Manigri - Wari Mar0 road; (ii)
elimination of the critical points on the rural roads in Atacora, Donga, Borgou, Alibori,
Mono, Atlantique and OukmC; (iii) development of 504 kilometers of rural connected
roads (Pob&kCtou-Illara 250 kilometers and Djougou-N’dali 254 kilometers); (iv) the
rehabilitation of 240 kilometers of secondary roads for rural transport in the Zou
department, the Collines, the Plateau and the Couffo, to construct culverts and to deal
with the critical points on the Adja Ou&r&Ouinhi axis. The selection of priority
communes by the Government as regards the execution of this work was carried out by
taking into account the criteria of accessibility to health centers, schools, agricultural
products and to the markets. Likewise, an emergency roadwork program for roads and
rural roads within the scope of the cotton marketing campaigns was put in place.
Surveys pertaining to the execution of road infrastructures will be conducted during
2007.

Safe drinking water in rural environments

34. The implementation of the development strategy for rural water and sanitation
services (PADEAR) during the past decade resulted in considerable progress in this
domain. However, recent statistics reveal that about two thirds of the rural population
in Benin does not have access to safe drinking water. The obstacles to the development
of the sector are: (i) deficiencies in the annual achievement of water points compared
with the average of 1.350 required to achieve the MDGs; (ii) the long delays in
mobilizing the financial participation of the communities; (iii) the insufficiency of national
capacity as regards financial and human resources; (iii) the multiplicity of the decision-
making poles as regards the management of water resources.

35. The Government is optimistic as regards the achievement of the MDGs in this
sector. I n fact, the sector has doubled its capacity for creating water points between
2002 and 2006. Improvement in planning and budgetary execution, as well as
substantial support by several investors, has created this dynamic to increase and
ensure the performance of the sector. Similarly, the Government intends to pursue its
efforts towards improving: (i) access by the rural populations to safe drinking water; (ii)
the management of water points; (iii) the management of water resources; (iv) the
supply of water and sanitation services in urban and remote areas.
36. For a more efficient management of the sector, the 2006-2008 budget program of
the Minister of Mines, Energy and Water places the emphasis on: (i) the creation of new
works and the rehabilitation of water points; (ii) the replacement of manually-operated
pumps; and (iii) logistical support to the decentralization of the departmental services of
the Minster of Mines Energy and Water. The Government adopted an action plan
including a program of activities and a detailed schedule for the professionalization of
water management conveyance systems and for the development of the local Public
Private Partnership (PPP). It intends to strengthen the capacity of the actors in the
chain of expenditure execution of the sector in order to control the budget execution
procedures and to improve the overall performance of the sector. I n this context, the
Government undertakes to (i) guarantee the availability of water of an acceptable
quality and quantity so as to meet the needs of all users within an integrated resources
management framework; (ii) optimize the costs to the State and to the populations by
enhancing the efficiency and the capacities of the various actors; (iii) contribute to the
                                             73
actions associated with the water sector by sectors other than that of safe drinking
water; and (iv) to increase the rural public transport rate from 41% in 2005 to 46,3% in
2007.

Sanitation

37. Progress has been noted on account of the support activities brought to the
sanitation sector. However, sectoral studies in the domain highlighted several problems
related to rapid urbanization. It concerns in particular disorderly urbanization,
inadequate management of the towns due to the lack of capacity in communal
management and in the financial resources necessary for adequately meeting the
growing demand for services, as well as a shortage of sanitation infrastructure for
rainwater, waste water drainage and the elimination of solid waste.
38. Within this scope, the Government undertakes, through the Urban Management
Program to: (i) develop urban planning documents such as the main town planning
schemes and the main urban development plans, (ii) build and improve urban roads in
the main towns of Benin and in the secondary towns; (iii) make land and residential
property more secure; (iv) to identify and service sites for public housing; (v) promote
real estate operations in order to increase the provision of decent accommodation and
finally, (vi) to invest in sanitation infrastructure in the towns and in the rural areas.

            2.3 Axis I11of the PRSP I1 : Strengthening human capital

39. The sustainable acceleration of growth for poverty reduction cannot be achieved
without the development of human capital. It should be noted that knowledge, know-
how and interpersonal skills play an important role in increasing productivity and in
reducing poverty. Thus, in the implementation of a development policy, the
Government intends to promote basic education, intensify professional training in
relation to the growth poles, to improve the accessibility and the quality of health and
nutrition services and to reinforce social protection.

Education sector

40. The education sector is the vehicle for transferring social values and for developing
competencies necessary when building a country. The Government opted for basic
primary education for all by 2015 in conformity with the MDGs by ordering free school
fees and a contribution towards kindergarten and primary schools for the 2006-2007
start of the academic year. A particular emphasis has also been placed on kindergarten
training, vocational and technical training and the functional elimination of illiteracy
amongst youth and adults. I n order to achieve this, the Government intends to allocate
more resources to this sector, to innovate and promote the short-term training
procedures and by means of apprenticeship and to train a specialized and qualified labor
force. It undertakes to (i) increase the access, execution and the quality of basic
education; (ii) improve the efficacy in the offer and management of educative services;
(iii) improve the response of both the education system and training to the requirements
of the national economy; (iv) promote school attendance amongst girls and to keep
them in the academic system; (vii) afford priority to the issue of mentalities in the sense
of the advent of a citizen of a new kind filled with a spirit of initiative and development;
(viii) develop partnership programs with allies in view of training in their countries for
upper level managers and technicians for the administration and private sectors; (ix)
                                            74
reduce the illiteracy rate to 50% by emphasizing the literacy of women and the
development of national languages.

41. The Government’s educational policy enabled Benin to gain access to the Fast Track
Initiative in 2007. This admission of Benin is the crowing achievement of the positive
evaluation and endorsement of the 2006-2015 Education Sector Decennial Development
Plan by the group of Technical and Financial Partners working in the field of education.
Thus, Benin will benefit from the support of the Fast Track partnership to carry out its
program for quality primary education by 2015 for the benefit of all children, both girls
and boys.

42. Indeed, improvement in the quality of education and reduction in the existing
disparities remain significant challenges to overcome in the future. Thus, the
Government undertakes on the one hand, to pursue the efforts initiated since 2004 to
improve accessibility, training and the quality of basic education, and on the other hand,
to strengthen the management efficacy in the provision of basic education services. To
this end, the following essential elements will be pursued in 2007: (i) the increase in the
completion ratio of primary school girls from 42% in 2005 to 45%; (ii) the increase in
the primary school completion ratio from 54% in 2005 to 56%; (iii) improvement in the
pupil/teacher ratio from 50% in 2005 to 48,70% and (iv) improvement in the gross
enrollment ratio (primary) from 94,6% in 2005 to 98%. The Government intends to
pursue the recruitment, training and allocation of teachers in such a manner as to
overcome the teaching staff shortages and to eliminate the disparities between the
regions. It intends to see to an increase in the share of the education budget within the
State Budget and to allocate a more significant share of the resources allocated to
primary education teaching.

Cultural Sector

43. The culture of the nation is an important development instrument. Beyond youth,
adults and women literacy, which put the focus on national language, the government
whish to promote cultural heritage by: (i) rehabilitating, improving and maintaining
historical sites, monuments and museums; (ii) stimulating and supporting initiatives
from enterprises to fund cultural initiatives; (iii) encouraging the movie industry; and (iv)
increasing the influence of culture as a mean for development.

Health sector

44. On the whole, the health sector programs have increased in quality and are based
both on the PRS, the MDGs and the Development Policies and Strategies of the health
sector. Efforts are made in particular to reduce infant and maternal mortality and to
combat the primary diseases which are malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The
Government has carried out several actions for the protection of the population and the
poorest peoples regarding their access to quality health and nutrition services. It
concerns in particular (i) improvement in the accessibility and quality of health and
nutrition services; (ii) the promotion of maternal health and the reduction of infant
mortality; (iii) ensuring the supply of pharmaceutical products and medical consumables;
(iv) the prevention of HN/AIDS; (v) the struggle against malaria and other endemic
diseases; (vi) the implementation of the transfusion safety policy; (vii) the development
of the supply of a regional health reference; (viii) the development and the equipment
of health infrastructures and (viii) carrying out an inventory of private health training
                                             75
and the dissemination of the new regulations governing the provision of health services
by the private sector.

45. However, the continuing high rates of maternal and neonatal mortalities constitute
one of the major concerns with regard to the country's ambitions of attaining the MDGs,
The Government intends to highlight the following major challenges: (i) the
identification and the implementation of interventions in favor of the most poor; (ii) the
improvement in the quantity and quality of human resources, their improved allocation
across the national territory, as well as a greater staff motivation; (iii) the sustainability
of the sectoral benefits including the functioning of the Health Centre Management
Committees (COGES); (iv) the struggle against the main diseases being malaria,
tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, as well as malnutrition particularly amongst children between
the ages of 0 to 5 years; (v) the implementation of the national strategy for the
reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality/ (vi) the quality of care and an effective
use of the health services; and (vii) equipment maintenance and the specific
reinforcement of governance in this sector.


46. During 2007, the focus will be to: (i) ensure that quality health services are made
more accessible to the population, to improve the overall management of the sector and
to improve the accessibility, quality and utilization by the poor and by vulnerable groups
of the basic quality services; (ii) renovate, equip and provide in personnel, the health
centers in the districts of the poor un-serviced areas and to develop in a participatory
manner, a broad framework for strengthening the public-private partnership; (iii)
implement a program to pilot the incentive arrangements in the five underprivileged
health areas; (iv) evaluate the transition communities and to make use of the
conclusions to expand this experience in the 34 health centers; (v) evaluate the
execution of the financial mechanisms promoting access by the poor to health services
in the 10 heath zones. Similarly, the Government is dedicated to improving (i) the
health services attendance rate from 37% in 2005 to 40%; (ii) the health services
attendance rate (0-5 years) from 76% in 2005 to 79%; and (iii) the medically-assisted
(medical and or paramedical staff) childbirth rate from 76% in 2005 to 77%.

Social Protection

47. The Government is aware of the fact that the family is the starting point as regards
the training of human capital which is indispensable to growth and to poverty reduction.
It agreed for the 2007-2009 period, to promote the family and women and to reduce the
inequalities between the sexes, to ensure the independence of women, to strengthen
social welfare and to promote mutual health insurance companies. Thus, the
Government intends to (i) improve the living conditions of families, protect and preserve
the family, foster peace and social stability and the strengthen the capacities of the
institutions promoting the family; (ii) promote the health, education and training of girls
and of women, to improve the respect for the legal status of women, to enhance the
status as regards work and cultures that are favorable to their self-fulfillment; (iii)
facilitate access by women, especially the poor, to micro-finance, to improve women's
access to land and to reinforce literacy amongst women; (iv) improve the socio-
professional integration of handicapped persons, to support the elderly in order to age
actively, to take responsibility for the destitute and the HIV/AIDS victims and other
incapacitating diseases and to strengthen the capacities of the structures working
towards the development of solidarity; (v) promote micro-insurance, to create incentive
measures for the use of mutual health insurance companies, to encourage communal
                                             76
mutual health insurance companies and to create an awareness amongst the population
of the advantages of membership such insurance.

           2.4. Axis I V of the PRSP I1 : Promotion of good governance

48. The Government has made the quality of good governance one of the pillars upon
which Benin must establish its PRSP 11. I n addition, it intends to improve and accelerate
the actions carried out in the areas of justice, public finance management, the fight
against corruption and the reform of the administration and the civil service.

Judicial reform

49. The improvement in the functioning and in the access to the legal system
represents a major concern to the Government. Thus, in the pursuit of the
implementation of the legal reform program, the Government intends: (i) to improve the
performance of the legal systems through an efficient, credible and accessible justice,
(ii) to put in place a penitentiary administration that will foster the safety of the citizens
and the social reinsertion of the prisoners and (iii) to reinforce the protection of human
rights, of childhood, of youth and of all vulnerable populations. The Government is
dedicated to improving (i) the average ratio of the number of prisoners (those charged
and those accused) awaiting sentence in relation to the total number of convicted
persons in order to bring it under 300% for the year 2006 and for it to continue to
decrease thereafter; (ii) the average duration of preventative detention for it to be less
than lO0/o in relation to 2006 and for it to continue to decrease thereafter; (iii) the rate
of the number of files settled compared with the number of files pending and the
number of files registered at the court during the year concerned in order for it to
increase to a rate higher than 50% in 2007, 60% in 2008 and 70% in 2009; (v) the
number of civilian prisoners in accordance with the international norms to increase this
figure from seven (07) out of eight (08) in 2007, eight (08) out of nine (09) in 2008 and
nine (09) out of nine (09) in 2009.

50. The Government shall continue to ensure the recruitment of forty (40) legal
auditors and thirty (30) clerks of the court per year to resolve the problem of staff
shortages in these categories. It further intends, in 2007, to (i) define a true
recruitment policy on the basis of an in-depth study of the staff and of the long-term
requirements for the courts and for the ministry responsible for justice and for the
courts, (ii) execute in a satisfactory manner, the budget schedule, (iii) undertake reform
measures of the prison system, (iv) pursue the implementation of the ongoing training
policy of the magistrates and the auxiliary clerks of the court and the ministry officials
responsible for justice, (v) to ensure the follow-up by staff of the data and indicators of
the justice sector in order to better orientate the authorities during decision-making, and
(vi) to take the necessary measures to launch the reorganization of the ministry.

Budgetary reform

51.    With its goal of increasing expenditure within the scope of transparent
management, the Government of Benin is determined to pursue the implementation of
the reform of its budgetary system. This reform aims to : (i) introduce results-based
budgetary management by means of clearly-defined budget programs which are
consistent with a medium term expenses framework; (ii) delegate the responsibility for
public expenditure management until now executed by the Minister of Finances, to the
                                             77
sectoral ministers through to the devolved levels of administration whilst striving for a
reinforced fiduciary framework (sound budgetary management); and (iii) to rationalize
and computerize the expenditure channel.

52. Since the start of this budgetary reform, significant progress has been achieved in
the areas of program formulation, budget preparation and execution and the
preparation of performance reports owing to supervision of the key institutional reforms
and to an intense effort aimed a t strengthening capacity. I n view of restoring respect
for financial orthodoxy, the Government took significant measures including (i) the
limitation of recourse to exceptional procedures for public expenditure execution; (ii) the
acceleration of the regularization of the advances made; and (iii) the progressive
discharge of the State's debt towards its creditors.

53. The fulfillment of the objectives retained in the PRSP I1 would require the
mobilization of the resources necessary for the realization of the investments provided
for. Also, the Government intends to strengthen the financial control through (i)
modernizing and rendering more secure the customs documents for the fight against
intellectual fraud; (ii) the intensification of controls in view of controlling border traffic;
(iii) expanding the tax base; (iv) reinforcing the tax inspections; and (v) securing and
equipping customs and excise.

54. To ensure the desired outcome of the use of these resources for growth and
poverty reduction, the Government intends to: (i) improve the management, supervision
and transparency in public expenditure through the pursuit of the computerization
process and the payment of expenses, strengthening the capacity of the payment
services, the institution of market price lists of the prices applicable to public
expenditure, the extension of the SIGFIP, strengthening the capacity of the general
management for budget and the users of the SIGFI; (ii) the optimal allocation of
resources in accordance with the macro-economic framework and the priorities of the
PRSP I1 through ensuring consistency with resources policy of the MTEF and the
rationalization of the subsidies granted by the State; (iii) the creation of an environment
favorable to results-based management through the extension of this management to all
ministries and institutions, the integration and preparation of the budget in the SIGFIP
and the organization of a government seminar on results-based management.

Procurement Reform

55.      I n order to improve the fiduciary environment, the various reforms carried out by
the Government as regards the conclusion of government contracts, enabled a new
institutional framework to be put in place, in view of: (i) increasing transparency and
efficacy insofar as the procurement is concerned; (ii) modernizing the procedures
associated with procurement; (iii) putting in place an independent monitoring system to
reduce corruption in public contracts. The Government developed a draft code for
government contracts based on WAEMU guidelines. This draft code which was
submitted to the ministerial committee is currently under evaluation and shall be
submitted to the National Assembly for approval. Similarly, the Government undertakes
to: (i) adopted a national strategy for reinforcing the capacities as regards the
conclusion of contracts and to carry out a feasibility study on an integrated management
system for government contracts (SIGMP) and to initiate the implementation process of
this system; (ii) to develop the Invitation to Tenders (TTT) and the evaluation reports;
(iv) to proceed with the reviews relating to conformity of the procedures for the
conclusion of government contracts for a t least three ministers and three municipalities
                                              78
and (v) to strengthen the capacities of the actors involved in the system for the
conclusion of government contracts in order to reduce the timeframe for such conclusion
to 57 days to supply contracts, 70 days for services contracts and 78 days for works
contracts.


Reform of control and internal auditing

56. Improvement in the quality of expenditure cannot be effective without reinforcement
of professional practice of the agencies of internal control. These practices must be
consistent with performance related management. Consequently the Government has
carried out a complete overhaul of internal auditing agencies. This reform was marked
by the creation of the National General Inspectorate (IGE) responsible for carrying out
a t a national level the coordination of the activities of the internal auditing agencies and
the transformation of the Departments of Internal Auditing (DIVI) of the ministries into
General Ministerial Inspectorates (IGM). I n addition, the Government has also initiated
with the support of the Technical and Financial Partners several projects for the purpose
of building the technical and material capacities of the auditing agencies and intends to
extend the activities of the General Financial Inspectorate (IGF) to the control of budget
expenditure with a view to studying the use of budget credits and the results obtained.
The overall objective is to ensure improved coordination of auditing activities.

57. Similarly, the Government has established a Support Project for Auditing Institutions
(PAIC) in order to reinforce, rationalise and increase the effectiveness of internal
auditing with simplified procedures and an improved definition of the responsibilities of
the various structures of control. I n 2007, the Government plans: (i) to offer
international technical assistance to performance related management, to organise
topic-based training and information technology training, to equip the Financial Auditing
Department both at central and regional levels, and to organise short training courses
abroad for the employees of the Department of Financial Control; (ii) to offer the
General Financial Inspectorate technical assistance in areas related to managing the
Treasury, tax administration, customs administration, financial auditing, the economy
and the management of public finance, to offer technical assistance for the General
Ministerial Inspectorate in drawing up a guide to technical and organisational audits in
three different areas of specialisation, to organise topic-based and information
technology training courses, and to organise short training courses abroad, for the
employees of the General Finances Inspectorate.

Strenghtening of external auditing

58. The Government plans to continue to reinforce external auditing. I n this context the
Department of National Accounting will carry out performance audits on the execution of
budget programmes based on the performance reports of the ministries taking part in
the PRSP 11.


59. The Government has drafted and submitted to the Department of National
accounting for its consideration the Payment Bill for the financial years 2002, 2003 and
2004. I n addition, the Department of National Accounting has been instructed that the
procedure to consider the Bill for the financial years 2002 2003 and 2004 should be
accelerated and sent to the National Assembly for its consideration. The Department of
                                             79
National Accounting intends to strengthen its role of legal supervision and has scheduled
for the year 2007 an audit of eight (08) municipalities.


60. To this end, specific resources will be mobilised for the Department of National
Accounting to enable it to build its capacities in performance auditing, to update its
auditing methods and to consolidate its experience. Consequently, the Government
intends (i) to give the Supreme Court technical assistance to draft the information
technology guidelines for the Department of National Accounting; (ii) to organise topic-
based training courses and information technology training courses.

Fighting corruption

61. I n the context of the promotion of good governance and the strengthening of the
constitutional state, the Government has adopted a strategic plan to fight corruption
based on the following five priority areas : (i) the energising of the system of control
through the adoption of an anti-corruption law; (ii) the fostering of administrative and
institutional reforms; (iii) capacity building of the activities of civil society and the private
sector; (iv) the creation of an environment inimical to corruption; (v) the reinforcement
of the duty to be accountable and the fight against impunity. The first study on
governance and corruption which will enable the establishment of a reference base to
follow progress of the implementation of the Strategic Anti-Corruption Plan, and to bring
it up to date, has been carried out. This study was carried out nationwide cover and
looked a t households, employees of the public sector and managers of private sector
enterprises. The Government, through the study’s follow-up committee, will take all the
necessary steps to ensure the distribution of the results of this study.

Administrative reform and reform of the Civil Service

62. The introduction of results-based management requires that more flexible
administrative structures be established in conjunction with a policy of human resources
management in public administration, in particular the development of remuneration
based on results and the establishment of the decentralization of responsibility for
recruitment and management of staff. However, an appropriate administrative reform
based on pehormance is needed, as well as clarification of the legal framework of the
duties and responsibilities of civil servants against a background of a competent,
integrated, effective, politically neutral and objectively impartial public service, in order
to offer quality service to the public.

63. The reform of human resources management undertaken by the Government
proposes in particular that the profile be matched to the job and that an effort be made
to keep competent civil servants appointed to manage and evaluate programs in their
posts a considerable period. I n this context, the Government has adopted a system of
reference for top jobs for the appointment in Cabinet of administration officials. It has
also adopted a follow-up mechanism for the system of reference and appointed
members of the monitoring committee.

64. To achieve rational management of administration staff, the Government has
established the Unique File Reference (UFR) which ensures exact knowledge of numbers
of paid civil servants, better management of government staff and limitation of the
circulation of fraudulent documents of appointment or promotion. An audit of the UFR
has revealed the need to set up an Integrated Human Resources Management System.
                                               80
The government plans to carry out the necessary studies for the implementation of the
system which constitutes an essential tool for quantitative and qualitative management
of human resources of an administration for development.

65. I n 2004, the Government delegated by decree the responsibility for administrative
activity by their staff to the Ministers for Education and set up a technical framework for
integration and coordination of the administrative reforms composed of Permanent
Secretaries of the ministries. An evaluation of this trial delegation process has been
conducted and the lessons learned will be put to use in the context of subsequent new
delegations which the Ministry of Public Service intends to carry out to assist ministries
with large staff numbers such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Farming and Fishing (MAFF)
and the Ministry of Health (MH).

66. The Government believes that the priority area and crux of reform lie in the overhaul
of the statutes for government officials so that they are compatible with the demands of
performance related management. To this end, it proposes to design a communication
plan for the purpose of bringing all the partners, particularly social partners, to
participate in the new method of performance related management. Completing this
remodeling will enable: (i) the definition of a salary policy which motivates employees
through recognition of merit and performance, as well as of a new system of career and
salary management for State employees, and (ii) the implementation of an appropriate
recruitment policy.

67. Overall, in order to achieve management of human resources which is consistent
with the results-based management of public finances, the Government proposes to
establish and implement a sliding program of medium and long-term reform consistent
with the reform of public finances. To this end in 2007 it will adopt the staff recruitment
policy, and will pursue the preparation and adoption of a new statute for the civil service
which introduces elements of performance related management.

   2.5 Element V of the PRSP 11: Balanced and Sustainable Development of
                             National Territory

68. The acceleration of growth and the reduction of poverty entail taking into account,
first the issue of regional disparities with a view to increased territorial equity in the
distribution of social and economic investment, and second considering the environment
in order to ensure the durability of natural resources. Consequently the Government
intends to ensure (i) the sustainable development of regions and localities; (ii) the
creation of poles of development and growth; and (iii) the protection of the
environment, natural resources and the living environment. Decentralization, the
protection of the environment and the improvement of the land constitute the chief tools
which need to accompany the implementation of sartorial policies adopted in this
context.

Decentralization and devolution

69. The Government plans to pursue the process of decentralization which began in
December 2002 to ensure grass roots development. At present, issues related to (i) the
transfer of skills; (ii) the provision of funding for municipalities; (iii) capacity building for
local communities with respect to budget management; (iv) the availability of human
resources in both quality and quantity and the passing of specific laws governing staff

                                               81
operating in local communities are major issues of concern which the Government
intends to solve as a matter of urgency.

70. I n addition, to increase the efficiency of administration at community and
departmental levels, the Government has drafted the Strategy Document for the
Implementation of the Reform of Territorial Administration which deals with the two
main areas of decentralization and devolution. Various studies intended to identify
practical steps to be taken to ensure effective and efficient (i) transfer of skills and
resources to the municipal authorities and (ii) capacity building of local communities,
have been carried out. The Government intends to organize in 2007 a forum on
decentralization to determine the status of the first mandate of the communal councils
and to determine the actions to be implemented to put its decentralization strategy into
operation. It also plans to promote intercommunality as a grassroots development tool.

Forestry management

71. The sustainable management of listed forests and surroundings areas is an
important element in the poverty reduction strategy. The rational management of
natural resources will make it possible in the long run to reverse the process of
degradation of the national woodland heritage which rural populations depend upon for
their survival. The option chosen for this purpose is the implementation of mechanisms
to give increased responsibility to grassroots communities and the promotion of
alternative income generating activities which do not involve the destruction of the
forests. The basic goal of the Program to Manage Forests and Surrounding Areas
(PGFTR) is the sustainable management of 22 Forest areas and it has three elements
which are: (i) institutional support and capacity building; (ii) participatory development
of forests and surrounding land; and (iii) sustainable management of wood and
environmental impacts.

72. Finally, the Government proposes to implement the following action plan: (i) to
apply a favorable taxation system for firewood and charcoal produced from managed
forests; (ii) to complete the separation of the State from the industrial branch of the
National Timber Office (ONAB); (iii) to continue the implementation of plans to develop
forests; (iv) to build environmental management capacities; (v) to strengthen the
system for taking the environment into account in sartorial policies and in the taxation
system; and (vi) to promote the integrated management of natural resources especially
water and forest resources. There will also be an effort to extend community
management of forest resources, to improve forestry production and operation
techniques and promote alternative income generating activities.

 3. Mechanism for the coordination, monitoring of the implementation of the
             impact of the program supported by the PRSP I 1

Coordination of the Program supported by the PRSP I 1

73. The Program will continue to be conducted under the supervision of the Ministry of
Development, Economy and Finance through the ministerial committee including the
ministers responsible for the areas of concentration of the PRSP I1 and those whose
departments are involved in poverty reduction. Its Secretariat is conducted by the
Economic and Structural Reforms Programs Monitoring Unit (CSPRES) which is replacing
the Permanent Secretariat of the National Commission for Development and the Fight
against Poverty (SP/CNDLP).

Follow up to the implementation of the program supported by the PRSP II

74.     The Government is aware of the shortcomings of the monitoring mechanism of
the PRS 2003-05 and is determined to resolve them in an effort to achieve more
effective monitoring of the PRSP 1      1. To this end, it proposes: (i) to give more
responsibility to the sartorial ministries as well as to the central statistical production
agencies in the various areas of activity and (ii) to simplify the institutional mechanism
of coordination in order to improve the synchronization of the technical follow-up with
the administrative follow-up. The Government is also committed to making the
decentralized monitoring agencies operational in order to improve the appropriation of
the PRSP I1 by the people, and the participatory process and consequently improving
the quality of the services and the effectiveness of the policies and programs.

75. The PRSP I1 will be monitored through budget programs performance reports from
the sartorial ministries and the annual PRSP I1 implementation reports. The Bank will
also carry out joint reviews with the other partners in development. Regular dialogue
will be maintained between the signatories to the Program.


Possible development of the program supported by the PRSP I1

76. I n agreement with IDA, the Government intends to finalize the preparation of PRSP
11-4 and PRSP 11-5 during 2007. Thus the Government will take all necessary measures
to implement measures and action scheduled and selected in this context.

77. The Government believes that these policies and measures constitute an important
step in fulfilling the PRSP I1 medium-term objectives. Consequently it is seeking the
assistance of the World Bank through the establishment of financial support for its
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy.

Introduction

1. La presente lettre de politique de developpement decrit le programme de reformes soutenu
par le quatrieme Credit d’Appui a la Reduction de la Pauvrete (Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC)), qui vise a appuyer la mise en euvre de la Strategie de Croissance pour la Reduction de
la Pauvrete (SCRP), adoptee par le Gouvernement en fevrier 2007. Cette strategie prksente les
grandes orientations economiques et financieres pour la periode 2007-2009.

2. Cette lettre fait suite, dans un processus glissant, a celle en date du 28 juillet 2006. Elle decrit
les actions que le Gouvernement entend exCcuter sur le moyen terme afin de mettre en ceuvre
effectivement la StratCgie de Croissance pour la Reduction de la Pauvrete en se concentrant sur
les mesures qui permettront d’accroitre I’efficacite et I‘impact des depenses publiques et
contribueront essentiellement a ameliorer les services publics en particulier pour les plus
pauvres. I I est joint, en annexe a la presente lettre, la matrice des politiques et mesures
actualisees appuyees par le PRSC, preparee en collaboration avec I’equipe de I‘IDA et les autres
partenaires au developpement notamment I’Union Europkenne, le Danemrk, la Suisse, ies Pays-
Bas, la France et I‘Allemagne. Cette matrice resune et specifie le contenu de la presente letre.

3. La matrice des politiques et mesures reflete I’efFort de definition des priorites sur la base des
contraintes budgetaires identifiees dans le Cadre de Depenses a Moyen Terme (CDMT)
2007-2009 et des contraintes institutionnelles qui affectent la capacitk d’absorption de
I’Administration. L‘execution des actions et la realisation des resultats indiques en caracteres
gras dans la matrice sont considerees comme essentielles pour le succes de ce programme de
reformes. Ces actions et r6sultats sont donc des mesures prealables au PRSC-4.

1. Contexte et Bvolution recente

4. Le Gouvernement du Benin avait elabore et adopt4 en dCcembre 2002 une strategie de
reduction de la pauvrete. Cette strategie qui couvrait la periode 2003-2005 visait a s’assurer que
les progres en matiere de croissance economique se traduiraient par une amelioration tangible
des conditions de vie des menages et une reduction significative de la pauvrete. Au terme de la
pkriode de mise en czuvre de cette strategie, le Gouvernement a convenu avec les Partenaires
Techniques et Financiers (PTF) de retenir I’annee 2006, annee d‘ilaboration de la nouvelle
strategie, comme une periode transitoire,

5. Dans le cadre de la preparation de la nouvelle strategie, qui est intervenue dans un contexte
de changement de rPgime a l‘issue de I’election presidentielle de mars 2006, le Gouvernement a
d’abord procede a une evaluation de la Strategie de Reduction de la Pauvrete 2003-2005.

6. La mise en e u v r e de la SRP 2003-2005 a permis : (i) de realiser des avancees notables sur le
plan institutionnel et dans I’execution des &formes ; (ii) d‘enregistrer des resultats non
negligeables en matiere de developpement durable. Au plan institutionnel, des avancees
importantes ont ete faites dans la generalisation de I’approche participative pour Yelaboration et
la mise en ceuvre de strategies multisectorielles ainsi que pour le suivi- evaluation des strategies.
En ce qui concerne la mise en ceuvre des reformes, la SRP 2003-2005 a constitue le premier
cadre de reference pour structurer et coordonner les interventions des PTF en appui aux
programmes du Gouvernement, et les orienter plus efftcacement vers la lutte contre la pauvrete.
De facon notable, le Document de Strategie de Reduction de la Pauvrete (DSRP) a servi
d’instrument de dialogue entre le Gouvernement et les bailleurs de fonds. 1          I a permis de
developper la pratique des missions conjointes et des appuis budgetaires conjoints, d’adopter
deux programmes economiques et financiers appuyes par le FMI. En ce qui concerne le
                                                                                               3118


developpement durable, la mise en ceuvre de la SRP 2003-2005 a permis d’atteindre des
rksultats concrets en matiere d‘amelioration des conditions de vie de la population.


7. Toutefois, les premiers rksultats de I’Enqu6te Modulaire Integrke sur les Conditions de Vie des
Menages (EMICOV) menee par le Gouvernement dans le cadre de la mise a jour du profil de
pauvrete pour I‘elaboration de la nouvelle strategie de lutte contre la pauvrete ont revel6 que,
bien que les conditions de vie des populations, apprkhendees par rapport a I’acc6s aux services
sociaux de base (sante, kducation, eau potable), se soient relativernent am&lior6es, la pauvrete
monetaire determinee a partir des dkpenses de consomrnation finale des menages s‘est
degradee. Tirant lecon de tout ce qui precede, le Gouvernement s’engage a : (i) ameliorer la
competitivite globale et sectorielle de I‘econornie ; (ii) intensifier la diversification de I’economie ;
(iii) amkliorer la qualit6 de vie de la population ; et (iv) reduire de facon significative la pauvrete.

8. Par ailleurs, malgre les nombreuses reformes qui ont kt6 mises en ceuvre, force est de
constater que les resultats sont en de@ des objectifs fixes en terme de croissance et de
reduction de la pauvrete. De m&me, il est note que pour atteindre les Objectifs du Millenaire
pour le Developpernent (OMD) en 2015, des actions plus vigoureuses doivent @tre menees.
Cette relative contre-performance s’explique par : (i) une attention insuffisante accordee :aux
questions de diversification et de croissance, notarnrnent la relance du secteur prive et le
developpement des p6les de croissance sectoriels et regionaux ; (ii) la sous-estimation du r81e
que joue le capital humain dans le processus de croissance et de reduction de la pauvrete ; (iii)
la sous-estimation des resistances internes de I’Administration publique face aux changements
qu’irnpliquent les principes de la gestion axPe sur les resultats et de la bonne gouvernance ; et
(iv) la faiblesse de I’implication des communautes locales au processus de developpement.

9. Dans ce cadre, le Gouvernement a defini sa vision de developpement a rnoyen terme qui est
de faire du Benin un pays emergent. Cette vision est sous-tendue par les six orientations
strategiques ci-apres : (i) reconstruire une Administration au service de I‘interGt general e t de la
promotion du secteur prive ; (ii) assainir le cadre rnacroeconornique et maintenir sa stabilite ;
(iii) promouvoir le renouveau economique (iv) developper les infrastructures econorniques et
sociales ; (v) renforcer le capital humain ; et (vi) assurer le developpement equilibre et durable
de I’espace national a travers le developpement a la base.

10. Ces orientations strategiques retracent les grandes lignes de la vision de developpement a
moyen terme du Gouvernement sur la periode 2006-2011. La declinaison de cette vision dans le
court terme se realisera a travers la SCRP. Cette strategie operationnalise cette vision de
developpement, et les actions majeures sont consignees dans le Programme d’Actions
Prioritaires (PAP) qui assure la liaison entre la strategie et les budgets programmes.

11. Afin de renforcer les acquis de la SRP 2003-2005 et de mettre en ceuvre les programmes de
reformes adequats pour la realisation des objectifs qu‘il a retenus dans la Strategie de
Croissance pour la Reduction de la Pauvrete 2007-2009, le Gouvernement a demande et obtenu
un quatriPme credit d’appui a la reduction de la pauvrete (PRSC-4).

2.      Le programme de reformes 2007-2009

12. La Strategie de Croissance pour la Reduction de la Pauvrete (SCRP) est structuree autour de
cinq (05) grands axes strategiques a savoir :
                                                                                           4/18


Axe 1 : Acceleration de la croissance
A x e 2 : Developpement des infrastructures
A x e 3 : Renforcement du capital hurnain
A x e 4 : Promotion de la bonne gouvernance
A x e 5 : Developpement equilibrk et durable de I‘espace national

13. En plus des mesures visant a renforcer le cadre macrodconornique, la realisation des
objectifs’de croissance pour la reduction de la pauvrete, en particulier ceux lies aux indicateurs
sociaux, fera I’objet d’une attention particulikre dans les programmes sectorieis qui continueront
a @tre executks dans la logique de gestion axee sur les resultats. Par ailleurs, I’Assernblke
Nationale a vote le projet de loi de finances 2007, conforme au Cadre de Dkpenses a Moyen
Terme (CDMT) 2007-2009 et aux priorites de la SCRP dans les domaines tels que I’agriculture,
I’approvisionnement en eau potable en milieu rural, la sante, I’kducation de base,
I’environnement et I’assainissement urbain, la gestion foresti&-e et le transport. De meme, le
plan d’opkrationnalisation du Cadre des RPformes de la Gestion Budgetaire Axee sur les
RCsultats (CaR-GBAR) a kte elabori et sa mise en oeuvre a demarre avec le Projet d’appui a la
Reforme de la Gestion Budgetaire Axke sur les Resultats (Pro- ReGAR), soutenu par I’Union
Europeenne, et le Projet d’Appui aux Institutions de ContrBle, soutenu par le Fonds Africain de
Developpement et le Royaume de Danernark.

2.1. Axe Ide la SCRP : AccCIeration de la croissance

14. Le Gouvernement a adopte une politique economique axee sur la recherche d‘une croissance
accelerke en vue de la reduction significative de la pauvretk. Dans ce contexte, le secteur prive
est appele a jouer un rBle de premier plan pour impulser cette croissance. Pour y parvenir,
quatre domaines d’actions prioritaires sont retenus : (i) la stabilisation du cadre
rnacrokconomique ; (ii) la dynamisation du secteur privk ; (iii) la diversification de I’4conornie ;
et (iv) la promotion de I’intkgration regionale.

15. Sur la pdriode 2003-2005, la croissance economique a connu une tendance baissibe et est
restke en d&a de I’objectif visk. On note cependant en 2006 une relance de I’kconomie avec un
taux de croissance de 4,1% contre 2,9% en 2005. Le Gouvernement entend mettre en ceuvre
les differentes reformes envisagees en vue du relivernent du taux de croissance de 7% environ
a I‘horizon 2009.

16. Ainsi, le Gouvernernent se fixe pour objectif d‘atteindre un taux de croissance de 6% en
2007;     6,8% en 2008 et 7,5% en 2009. Pour ce faire, il prevoit de porter le taux
d’investissement public de 4,6% du PIB en 2006 a 8,6% du PIB en 2007 ; 9,5% en 2008 et
9,9% en 2009 tandis que I’investissement prive serait de 13,6% du PIB en 2006 ; 15% en
2007 ; 15% en 2008 et 15,3% en 2009. Ainsi, le taux d’investissement total passerait de l8,1%
du PIB en 2006 a 23,6% en 2007 ; 24,4% en 2008 et 25,2% en 2009.

17. De merne, le taux d‘inflation serait maintenu dans la lirnite des 3% prevue par le pacte de
convergence de I’UEMOA, tandis que le deficit de la balance courante passerait de 6,2% du PIB
en 2006 5,8% en 2007 ; 5,5% en 2008 et 4,9% en 2009.

18. Les dkpenses totales de I’Etat devraient passer, conformkment au scknario de base de ia
SCRP, de 22,1% du PIB en 2006 24,4% en 2007 ; 25,0% en 2008 et 2009. En moyenne, elles
s‘elheraient a 24,8% du PIB sur la periode 2007-2009 contre 20,9% sur la pkriode 2004-2006.
Cette hausse des dkpenses publiques serait partiellement couverte par I’augmentation des
recettes totales de I’Etat qui sont projetkes a 17,6% du PIB en 2007 ; 18% en 2008 e t 18,1%
en 2009, grdce notamment a la mise en e u v r e des rnesures visant a accroitre l’efficience du

                                                              1 7
                                                                                              5/18


recouvrement fiscal, Ainsi, le Gouvernernent entend : (i) renforcer les capacites des regies
financieres ; (ii) elargir I’assiette fiscale ; (iii) rechercher les sources alternatives de recettes ;
(iv) securiser et equiper les regies financikres ; (v) amkliorer le recouvrement des recettes non
fiscales ; (vi) reconstituer le domaine prive de I’Etat ; et (vii) renforcer la lutte contre la fraude
fiscale. En definitive, le deficit global serait contenu en moyenne a 6,7% du PIB sur la periode
2007-2009 contre 3,6% obtenu sur la periode 2004-2006.

19. Compte tenu de ces projections de recettes et de dhpenses de la SCRP 2007-2009, le besoin
de financement est projete A 49,5 milliards FCFA, 93,8 milliards FCFA et 72,2 milliards FCFA
respectivement en 2007, 2008 et 2009. Le besoin de financement de 2007 serait entikrernent
couvert par les appuis budgetaires de la Banque Mondiale (20 milliards FCFA), de I‘Union
Europeenne (11,7 milliards FCFA), de la Banque Africaine de Developpement (12 milliards FCFA)
et des autres partenaires au developpement (5,8 milliards FCFA). Le Gouvernement envisage
d’introduire a I‘AssembEe Nationale un projet de Ioi de finances rectificative pour permettre de
prendre en compte au budget de I‘annhe 2007, d‘une part, les actions non prevues au budget
mais retenues par la SCRP et son Programme d‘Actions Prioritaires, et d’autre part, certaines
rnesures telles que I’emission d‘emprunt obligataire, prises au cours de I’annee.

20. L’acceleration de la croissance economique de facon durable suppose le developpernent du
secteur prive qui doit se traduire par I‘augmentation de I‘investissement privd, I’amklioration de
la competitivite et la modernisation de ce secteur. La mise en ceuvre du PRSC pendant les trois
premieres annees a permis de prendre les dispositions pour : (i) le renforcement du dialogue
secteur public/secteur prive ; (ii) I’arnklioration de I’environnement des affaires ; (iii) le
renforcement du partenariat public-prive pour le developpement des infrastructures. Dans cette
perspective du developpement du secteur prive, le Gouvernement met un accent particulier sur :
(i) I‘impulsion de la creation de nouvelles Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (PME) ; (ii) la
promotion, le renforcement et la dynarnisation des PME existantes ; (iii) le dhveloppement de la
micro-entreprise ; e t (iv) I‘amelioration de I’intermediation financikre en faveur de ce secteur. Le
fonds national de la microflnance a kt6 mis en place A cet effet. En ce qui concerne le
developpernent de I’artisanat et du tourisme, le Gouvernement entend : (i)ameliorer les cadres
institutionnel et reglementaire et le systeme d’encadrement des acteurs ; (ii) promouvoir les
artisans et les produits artisanaux au plan national et international ; (iii) renforcer les capacites
professionnelles des artisans et des acteurs du secteur du tourisme ; (iv) promouvoir I‘accis au
credit pour les micro-entreprises du secteur de I’artisanat et (v) valoriser les sites touristiques et
a utres ressou rces tou ristiques,

21. Le Gouvernement a entame la mise en euvre de la strategie de developpernent du secteur
prive a travers les reformes dans le domaine du foncier, de la Zone Franche Industrielle et de la
fiscalite. Ainsi il a : (i) introduit a I’Assemblee Nationale un projet de loi sur le foncier ;
(ii) elabore un projet de lettre de cadrage de la reforrne fonciere ; (iv) klabore un recueil de
textes sur le credit d’impbt; (v) mis en place un comite charge de definir les grandes
orientations d’une fiscalit6 de developpement et (vi) poursuivi les travaux d’assainissement, de
pavage et d‘electrification de la Zone Franche Irdustrieile,

22. Pour renforcer les capacites des acteurs du secteur prive, le Gouvernement a forme les
acteurs des nouvelles filikres agricoles (anacarde, ananas, champignons, halieutiques) sur les
rkgles d’hygikne, les bonnes pratiques agricoles et la tracabilite des produits 2 I‘exportation. I I a
en outre mis en place un cadre integre pour la promotion des activites commerciales et Cree le
Conseil Presidentiel de I’Investissement (CPI) qui est une plateforme d’echanges directs entre les
investisseurs nationaux et internationaux et le President de la Republique. Une session de cette
institution aura lieu chaque semestre. La premiere session du conseil a et6 organisee en fkvrier
2007. Le Gouvernement envisage de prkparer, avec l’appui de I’IDA, un nouveau projet d’appui

                                                                     n
                                                                                             611 8


au secteur prive visant I’amelioration de la competitivite et la realisation des opportunites de
croissa nce.

 23. Par ailleurs, face aux difficult& enregistrees pour la realisation des differentes operations de
dbsengagement de I‘Etat qui, du reste, demeurent essentielles pour la mise en w v r e de la
SCRP du Benin, le Gouvernement est convaincu de la necessite de renforcer le partenariat
public-prive pour faciliter leur poursuite dans la transparence. Aussi, souhaite-t-il, avec I’appui
des partenaires au developpement, sa mise en ceuvre dans trois secteurs prioritaires que sont :
I’outil industriel de la SONAPRA, les telCcommunications et I’energie. L‘objectif est de creer des
conditions qui permettront aux operateurs et aux investisseurs prives de participer, sous
diverses formes (privatisation, concession, affermage, etc.), au developpement des secteurs
prioritaires cites supra. Ainsi, le Gouvernement entend poursuivre les differentes operations de
desengagement de I’Etat en cours.

24. En effet, tenant compte de la situation financiere trks fragile de la Societe Beninoise
d’Energie Electrique (SBEE), le Gouvernement a mis en place une gestion de transition pour
assainir la situation financiere de cette societe. Dans ce cadre, un comite de gestion de
tresorerie ayant pour mission de veiller ?  I une gestion plus rationnelle des ressources financiPres
a ete mis en place et est fonctionnel. L‘Etat envisage de se desengager de la SBEE a I’issue de
cette pkriode de gestion transitoire de deux ans qui vise a ameliorer les performances de cette
societe. Ce desengagement de I‘Etat devra prendre la forme d’un affermage concessif. S’agissant
du secteur des telCcornmunications, le Gouvernement a men6 d‘irnportantes reformes pour
ramener tous les operateurs du secteur aux normes et assainir la situation financiere de BENIN
TELECOM SA. I I a en outre nommP les membres du Conseil Transitoire de Regulation du secteur
des telecommunications. L‘audit des &tats financiers et I’analyse strategique de cette entreprise
permettront au Gouvernement d’arrher la strategie de desengagement de I’Etat. Le
Gouvernement poursuit les reformes structurelles dans les autres secteurs e t en accordant une
attention particuliere au desengagement de I’Etat des activites industrielles de la SONAPRA.
En ce qui concerne les reformes portuaires, le Gouvernement a procede a I’informatisation des
operations de dkdouanement et realisb des etudes visant a identifier les dispositions B prendre
pour : (i) I’arnelioration du flux de marchandises au port; (ii) la definition des reformes
institutionnelles et I‘identification des besoins d’investissement pour le developpement du port B
rnoyen et a long termes. Une etude consacree a I’evaluation des besoins en infrastructures et
equipements necessaires pour augmenter les capacites du Port a et6 lancee. Le Gouvernement
entend mettre en ceuvre les resultats de ces etudes afin d’ameliorer la competitivitC du Port de
Cotonou.

25. Le Gouvernement estconscient du fait que les reformes kconomiques seules ne suffisent pas
pour impulser la croissance economique et reduire la pauvrete. Par ailleurs, le coton qui
contribue essentiellement B la croissance economique a connu au cours de ces dernikres annkes
une diminution de la production like B des dysfonctionnements au niveau de la filikre et a la
baisse des cours internationaux. Ainsi, pour atteindre une croissance acc&Ieree, le
Gouvernement s’engage a realiser la diversification de I‘economie. Les cinq pdles de croissance
sur lesquels le Gouvernement mettra un accent particulier sont : (i) le textile ; (ii)
I‘agroalirnentaire ; (iii) les bstiments, travaux publics et materiaux de construction ; (iv) le
tourisme, I’artisanat et la culture ; et (v) le transport, la logistique et le commerce international.

Secteur agricole

26. Les priorites etablies dans les diffbrents documents strategiques du secteur rural sont en
adequation avec celles de la SCRP. Elles constituent donc un bon cadrage pour le
developpement du secteur agricole. Le Gouvernement est conscient de I’insuffisance des appuis
                                                                                             7/18


techniques et financiers accordes aux institutions du secteur pour la mise en Quvre de ces
strategies. Pour ameliorer la gestion globale du secteur, une reforrne de fond a kt6 engagke par
le Gouvernement afin de permettre au secteur agricole de jouer veritablement son r61e de
moteur de la croissance. Ainsi, la politique du Gouvernement est de mieux cibler les
investissements publics afin de dynamiser les initiatives privees dans ce secteur et de repondre
aux priorites de la SCRP.

27. Le Gouvernement entend arneliorer la productivite et la production agricoles.
Son programme d’activites couvre tout le secteur notamment les sous-secteurs de I’agriculture,
de I’elevage et de la p@che.Ce programme vise : (i) la promotion et le developpement des
filieres agricoles ; (ii) la securite alimentaire et nutritionnelle des populations. A court terme, le
Gouvernernent s’engage a : (i) prornouvoir la recherche et la vulgarisation des semences, plants
et geniteurs performants ; (ii) developper les technologies arneliorees de stockage, de
conservation et de transformation des produits agricoles, anirnaux et halieutiques ; (iii) renforcer
les capacites d’intervention des structures d’encadrement ; (iv) renforcer les capacites
techniques et organisationnelles des producteurs et des structures d’encadrement ;
(v) promouvoir I’entreprenariat agricole ; et (vi) assurer I’approvisionnernent en intrants
specifiques.

28. En effet, la reorganisation de la gestion globale du secteur agricole permettra au
Gouvernement de : (i) mettre en place de facon participative une structure nationale de services
agricoles ; et (ii) finaliser avec le secteur prive un programme d’appui au developpement de
nouvelles filieres a savoir I’anacarde, le karite, I’ananas, le palmier a huile, le riz et la psche
(crevettes).

29. De msme, le Gouvernement entend rnettre en oeuvre un programme d’appui A la mise en
place d’infrastructures et d’equipements agricoles. Ce programme consiste : (i) au
dksenclavement des zones de production ; (ii) a I’amenagement des bas-fonds et perimetres
irrigues ; (iii) a I’amblioration des conditions de stockage, de conservation et de transformation
des produits en vue de limiter les pertes post-recolte et d’apporter une valeur ajoutee aux
producteurs ; (iv) au developpement de la mecanisation agricole ; et (v) a la maitrise de I’eau a
des fins agricoles, pastorales et halieutiques.

filiere coton

30. Face a la vulnerabilite de la filiere du fait des differents chocs exterieurs et de leurs
consequences sur I’economie nationale, un dispositif adequat s’impose pour resoudre de
maniere durable et efficace I‘ensernble des problemes lies a la promotion agricole pour esperer
voir a moyen et long terrnes, l’emergence d’autres filieres porteuses de developpement et
sources de croissance. A cet effet, un document de politique et un plan d’actions quinquennal
ont et6 elabores pour recentrer la mission de la Societe Nationale pour la Promotion Agricole
(SONAPRA) afin qu’elle joue desormais le r61e originel qui hi est dkvolu. Ainsi, en I‘absence de
mecanismes appropries pour la prise en compte des risques, les efforts des acteurs concernis
sont annihiles. Pour &iter la desaffection des producteurs vis-a-vis des filieres agricoles du fait
de la variation de leur revenu de campagne en carnpagne, I‘Etat a d        Q solder en 2006 les
irnpayes des producteurs de coton.

31. Le processus de desengagement de I‘Etat de I’outil industriel de la SONAPRA se poursuit. Le
Gouvernement entend maintenir tout I‘outil industriel dans une societe en cours de creation. Un
cabinet international est en cours de recrutement, avec I‘appui de la Banque Mondiale, pour
I‘evaluation de I‘outil industriel de la SONAPRA a ceder. La socikte anonyme sera creee par la
suite et son capital sera detenu par les privks, les producteurs, les travailleurs et I’Etat. Le
Gouvernement entend achever cette operation avant le debut de la campagne de
commercialisation 2007-2008.

2.2. Axe I1de la SCRP: Dhveloppement des infrastructures

32. Les infrastructures constituent un levier important pour promouvoir la croissance
6conomique et le developpement. Le caractere transversal des infrastructures a des effets
d’entrainement notables sur le developpement de tous les secteurs d‘activites. Dans ce cadre, le
Gouvernement met un accent particulier sur la realisation des infrastructures dans les secteurs
de l’energie, de I’hydraulique, de I’assainissement et des transports (terrestre, fluvial, maritime,
aerien, et ferroviaire). Ces infrastructures se concretiseront a travers de grands programmes i
savoir : (i)le programme routier qui assurera la meilleure mobilite urbaine, rurale et inter-Etats
des personnes et des biens ainsi que I’acds des populations aux servlces sociocommunautaires
essentiels de base ; (ii) le programme gestion des modes de transport qui vise 6 rendre plus
efficace le systeme de transport terrestre, maritime et aerien ; (iii) le programme habitat et
construction qui fera la promotion de I’offre de bdtiments administratifs et de logernents
economiques et sociaux a moindre coOt pour un plus grand nombre de populations ; et (iv) le
programme appui a la gestion urbaine qui vise a soutenir le developpement kconomique local
des centres urbains et ameliorer l’acces des populations aux services de base.

Transportrural

33. L’objectif poursuivi dans ce secteur est d’ameliorer le transport en milieu rural en vue
d’accroitre I’acces des communautes rurales aux services sociaux de base, aux marches et aux
zones de production. La Strategie Nationale de Transport Rural (SNTR), adoptee le 22 mars
2006, sert de base au programme de transport rural. Ainsi, le secteur dispose d’un programme
pluriannuel d’investissements et d’entretien en matiere de pistes rurales et d‘un cadre
institutionnel de mise en czuvre de cette strategie. En 2007, le Gouvernement entend ameliorer
la gestion globale du sous-secteur transport rural. Ainsi, il a mis a jour le cadre institutionnel
pour la gestion des pistes rurales, prepare et adopte la nouvelle regulation des pistes rurales. I I
s’engage a amenager et a entretenir les pistes pour le transport rural en accordant la priorit6 a
                                                                                 -
la realisation des travaux (i) d’amknagement de la piste Bassila - Manigri Wari Mar0 ; (ii)
d’elimination de points critiques sur routes rurales dans I‘Atacora, la Donga, le Borgou, I‘Alibori,
le Mono, I’Atlantique et I’Oueme ; (iii) d’amenagement de 504 kilom6tres de pistes rurales
connexes (Pobe-ketou-Iilara et Djougou-N’dali) ; (iv) de rehabilitation de 240 kilometres de
routes secondaires pour le transport rural dans le departement du 201.1, des Collines, du Plateau
et du Couffo ; de construire de dalots et de traiter les points critiques sur l’axe Adja Ouere-
Ouinhi. Les communes dans lesquelles le Gouvemement accorde la priorite de realisation de ces
travaux ont ete choisies en tenant compte des cridres d’accessibilite aux centres de sante, aux
&coles, aux produits agricoles et aux marches. De meme, un programme d’urgence de refection
de routes et pistes dans le cadre des campagnes de commercialisation du coton a ete mis en
place et des etudes pour la realisation des infrastructures routieres seront faites au cours de
I’annee 2007.

Eau potable en milieu rural

34. La mise en ceuvre de la strategie d’assainissement et de developpement du secteur de l’eau
et de I‘assainissement en milieu rural (PADEAR) au cours de la derniere decennie s’est traduite
par des progres substantiels dans ce dornaine. Cependant, les statistiques recentes revelent
qu’environ deux tiers de la population rurale au Benin n‘ont pas acces a I‘eau potable. Les
obstacles au developpement du secteur sont : (i) I‘insuffisance des realisations annuelles de
points d’eau par rapport a la moyenne de 1,350 requise pour atteindre les OMD ; (ii) ies longs
                                                                                            911 8


delais de mobilisation de la participation financiere des communautks ; (iii) I’insuffisance des
capacitks nationales en ressources financieres et hurnaines; (iii) la mukiplicit6 des p8les de
decision pour la gestion des ressources en eau.
35. Le Gouvernement est optimiste quant a la realisation des Objectifs du Mlllenaire pour le
Dkveloppement (OMD) dans ce secteur. En effet, le secteur a double sa capacite de creation de
points d’eau entre 2002 et 2006. L’amelioration de la planification et de I‘execution budgetaire
ainsi que le soutien significatif de plusieurs bailleurs de fonds ont c r G cette dynamique pour
augmenter et assurer la performance du secteur. De meme, le Gouvernement entend poursuivre
ses efforts en ameliorant : (i) I‘acces des populations rurales A I’eau potable ; (ii) la gestion des
points d’eau ; (iii) la gestion des ressources en eau ; (iv) I’approvisionnement en eau et les
services d‘assainissement en zone urbaine et periurbaine.
36. Pour une gestion plus efficiente du secteur, le budget programme 2006-2008 du Ministkre
des Mines, de I‘Energie et de I’Eau met I’accent sur : (i) la creation de nouveaux ouvrages et la
rehabilitation de points d’eau ; (ii) le renouvellement du stock de pompes a motricite humaine ;
(iii) I’appui logistique a la deconcentration des services departementaux du Ministkre des Mines,
de I‘Energie et de I‘Eau. Le Gouvernement a adopt6 un plan d’action incluant un programme
d’activites et un calendrier detailles pour la professionnalisation de la gestion des systkmes
d’adduction d’eau et pour le developpement du Partenariat Public-Prive (PPP) local pour la
gestion des systkmes d’adduction d’eau. I I entend renforcer les capacites des acteurs de la
chaine d’execution des depenses du secteur pour la maitrise des procedures d‘execution du
budget et I’amelioration des performances du secteur. Dans ce contexte, le Gouvernement
s‘engage a (i) garantir la disponibilitk de I’eau en qualite et en quantite acceptables pour
satisfaire tous les usagers dans un cadre de gestion integree des ressources ; (ii) optimiser les
coots pour I‘Etat et les populations en renforgant I’efficience et les capacites des differents
acteurs ; (iii) contribuer aux actions liees au secteur eau des secteurs autres que I’eau potable ;
e t (iv) amkliorer le taux de desserte rurale de 41% en 2005 a 46,3% en 2007.

Assainissement

37. Des progres ont et6 constat& au titre des activites d’appui au secteur de I’assainissement.
Cependant, les etudes sectorielles dans le domaine ont mis en evidence plusieurs problkmes en
correlation avec I’urbanisation rapide. I I s’agit notamment d‘une urbanisation desordonnke, une
gestion deficiente des villes due aux rnanques de capacite en gestion communale et en
ressources financikres necessaires pour repondre adequatement a la demande croissante de
services et une insuffisance des infrastructures d’assainissement des eaux pluviales, d‘kvacuation
des eaux usees et des dechets solides.
38. Dans ce cadre, le Gouvernement, a travers le programme de Gestion Urbaine, s‘engage a :
(i) Claborer des documents de planification urbaine tels que les plans directeurs d’urbanisme, les
schemas directeurs d’amknagement et d’urbanisme , (ii) amenager et assainir les voies urbaines
dans les principales villes du Benin et dans les villes secondaires ; (iii) proceder a la securisation
foncikre et residentielle ; (iv) identifier et viabiiiser des sites d’accueil de logements economiques
et sociaux ; (iv) promouvoir les operations immobilieres pour accroitre I’offre de logements
decents et enfin (v) investir dans les infrastructures d’assainissement dans les villes et en milieu
rural,

2.3 Axe I11de la SCRP : Renforcement du capital h u m a i n

39. L‘acceleration durable de la croissance pour la reduction de la pauvrete ne saurait &re
obtenue sans le developpement du capital humain. I I a et6 note que le savoir, le savoir-faire et
le savoir-6tre jouent un r81e important dans I‘augmentation de la productivite et la reduction de
la pauvrete. Ainsi, dans la mise en muvre d’une politique de developpement, le Gouvernement
                                                                                          10118


entend faire la promotion d’une Pducation de base, renforcer la formation professionnelle en
relation avec les p8les de croissance, ameliorer I’accessibilitC et la qualit6 des services de sante
et de la nutrition et renforcer la protection sociale.

Secteur de l2ducation

40. Le secteur de I‘education est le vecteur de transmission des valeurs sociales et de
developpement des compCtences pour la construction d’un pays. Le Gouvernement a opt4 pour
I’education primaire de base pour tous d’ici 2015 conformkment aux OMD en decretant la
gratuitC des frais de scolaritk et de contribution aux cours maternel et primaire pour compter de
la rentree 2006-2007 dans le secteur public. Un accent particulier est egalement mis sur les
activitCs de la formation a la maternelle, la formation professionnelle et technique, et
I‘alphabCtisation fonctionnelie des jeunes et des aduites. Pour ce faire, le Gouvernement
entend allouer plus de ressources a ce secteur, innover et promouvoir les filieres de formation
de courte duree et par apprentissage pour former une main-d’czuvre specialisee et qualifiee. I I
s‘engage a (i) accroTtre I’accks, I’accomplissement et la qualit6 de I’Cducation de base ; (ii)
ameliorer I‘efficacite dans I’offre et la gestion des services Cducatifs ; (iii) amkliorer la reponse
du systkme educatif et de formation aux exigences de I’economie nationale ; (iv) promouvoir
une Cducation de dkeloppement ; (v) renforcer I’enseignement supkrieur pour former des
cadres de haut niveau capables d’impuiser un rCel developpement ; (vi) promouvoir la
scolarisation des filles et leur maintien dans le systeme scolaire ; (vii) accorder une priorite a la
question des mentalitks dans le sens de i’avenement d’un citoyen de type nouveau animC d’un
esprit d’initiative et de developpement ; (viii) developper des programmes de partenariat avec
des pays amis en vue de la formation dans ieurs pays des cadres et techniclens de haut niveau
pour I‘administration et le secteur prive ; (ix) reduire le taux d‘analphabetisme a 50% en mettant
I’accent sur I’alphabetisation des femmes et le dCveloppement des langues nationales.

41. La politique educative du Gouvernement a permis au Benin d’@tre admis a I’Initiative Fast
Track (Initiative de Mise en E u v r e AccelerCe de I‘Education pour Tous) en 2007. Cette
admission du Benin a I‘Initiative Fast Track est le couronnement de I’4valuation positive et de
I’endossement du Plan Decennal de Developpement du Secteur de I‘Education 2006-2015 par
I‘ensemble des Partenaires Techniques et Financiers ceuvrant dans le domaine de I’education.
Ainsi, le Benin b4neficiera de I‘appui du partenariat Fast Track pour la realisation de son
programme pour un enseignement primaire de qualite d’ici 2015 au profit de tous les enfants,
filles comme garGons.

42. En effet, I’amelioration de la qualite de I’education et la reduction des disparites demeurent
des defis importants relever au cours des annCes a venir. Ainsi, le Gouvernement s‘engage
d’une part, a poursuivre les efforts entamCs depuis 2004 pour ameliorer i’accessibilite, les
apprentissages et la qualit6 de I’Cducation de base et d’autre part, a renforcer l’efficacitk des
prestations et de la gestion des services dans I’enseignement de base. A cet effet, Ies objectifs
essentiels suivants seraient poursuivis en 2007 : (i) le relevement du taux d’achhvement du
primaire des files de 42% en 2005 A 45% ; (ii) le relevement du taux d’achevement du primaire
de 54% en 2005 a 56% ; (iii) I’amelioration du ratio eleves/maftre de 50 en 2005 a 48,70 et (iv)
I’amelioration du taux brut de scolarisation (primaire) de 94,6% en 2005 a 98%. Le
Gouvernement entend poursuivre le recrutement, la formation et la repartition des enseignants
de maniere a combler les deficits en personnel enseignant et a faire disparaitre les disparitks
entre les regions. I I entend veiller a I‘augmentation de la part du budget de I’education dans le
Budget de I’Etat et a consacrer une part plus importante des ressources allouees a I’education a
I’enseignement primaire.
                                                                                           11\18



Secteur de la culture

43. La culture est un vecteur important de developpement. Outre I‘alphab6tisation fonctionnelle
des jeunes, des adultes et des femmes notamment, mettant I’accent sur le developpement des
langues nationales en vue de reduire le taux d’analphabetisme, le Gouvernement entend
revaloriser le patrimoine culturel. 1 1 s‘agit (i) de restaurer, d’amenager, de developper et
d’entretenir les sites et monuments historiques ainsi que les musees ; (ii) d’encourager et de
soutenir les entreprises et les initiatives de creation culturelle ; (iii) d’encourager la creation
cinematographique e t (iv) de faire rayonner toutes les composantes de la culture, facteur de
developpement.

Secteur de la sa&

44. Dans I’ensemble, les programmes du secteur sante gagnent en qualit6 et s’inspirent a la fois
de la Strategie pour la Reduction de la Pauvrete, des OMD et des Politiques et Strategies de
developpement du secteur de la sante. Des efforts sont fournis notamment pour reduire la
mortalit4 infantile, maternelle et pour lutter contre les principales maladies que sont le
paludisme, la tuberculose et le VIH/SIDA. Le Gouvernement a men6 plusieurs actions allant dans
le sens de la protection de la population et des plus pauvres par rapport a leur acc& aux
services de sante de qualite et de la nutrition. II s’agit notamment de (i) I’amelioration de
I‘accessibilite et de la qualit6 des services de sante et de nutrition ; (ii) la promotion de la sant6
maternelle et la reduction de la mortalite infantile ; (iii) la sCcurisation des produits
pharmaceutiques e t des consommables medicaux ; (iv) la prevention du VIH/SIDA ; (v) la lutte
contre le paludisme et les maladies endemiques ; (vi) la mise en ceuvre de la politique de
securite transfusionnelle ; (vii) le developpement d‘une offre de sante de reference a vocation
regionale ; (viii) le developpement et I’kquipement des infrastructures sanitaires
et (viii) le recensement des formations sanitaires privees et la dissemination de la nouvelle
rhglementation regissant I’offre de services de la sante par le secteur privk.

45. Cependant, les taux encore eleves de mortalite maternelle et neonatale constituent des
preoccupations majeures au regard de i‘ambition du pays d’atteindre les OMD. Le Gouvernement
entend relever les principaux d6fs ci-apres : (i) I’identification et la mise en ceuvre des
interventions en faveur des plus pauvres ; (ii) I‘amelioration des ressources humaines en
quantite et en qualite, leur meilleure repartition sur le territoire national, ainsi qu‘une plus
grande motivation du personnel ; (iii) la perennit6 des acquis sectoriels y compris le
fonctionnement des Comites de Gestion des centres de Sante (COGES) ; (iv) la lutte contre les
principales maladies que sont le paludisme, la tuberculose, le VIH-SIDA, de m@me que la
malnutrition notamment chez les enfants de 0 a 5 ans ; (v) la mise en e u v r e de la Strategie
nationale de reduction de la mortalite maternelle et neonatale ; (vi) la qualite des soins et une
bonne utilisation des services de sante ; et (vii) la maintenance des equipements et le
renforcement specifique de la gouvernance dans ce secteur.

46. Au cours de I’annee 2007, 11 s’agira de : (i) rendre les services de sante de qualit4 plus
accessibles a la population, ameliorer la gestion d’ensemble du secteur et amkliorer
I‘accessibilite, la qualite et I’utilisation par les pauvres et les groupes vulnerables des services
essentieis de qualite ; (ii) renover, equiper et pourvoir en personnel les centres de sant6
d‘arrondissement de zones pauvres non dessetvies et developper de maniere participative un
large cadre pour le renforcement du partenariat public-prive ; (iii) mettre en ceuvre un
programme pour piloter les arrangements d’incitation dans cinq zones de sant6 defavorides;
(iv) faire une evaluation des relais communautaires et exploiter les conclusions pour elargir cette
experience dans 34 centres de sante; (v) effectuer une evaluation de I’execution des
                                                                                            12/18


mecanismes financiers devant favoriser I‘acces des pauvres aux services de sant4 dans 10 zones
sanitaires. De meme, le Gouvernement s’emploie a ameliorer (i) le taux de frequentation des
services de sante de 37% en 2005 a 40% ; (ii) le taux de frequentation des services de sante
(0-5 ans) de 76% en 2005 a 79% ; et (iii) le taux d’accouchements assistes par un personnel
medical et/ou paramedical de 76% en 2005 a 77%.

Protection sociafe

47. Le Gouvernement est conscient du fait que la famille est le point de depart de la formation
du capital humain Indispensable a la croissance et a la reduction de la pauvrete. II a retenu pour
la periode 2007-2009 de faire la promotion de la famille, de la femme et de reduire les inegalites
entre les sexes, d’assurer I’autonomisation des femmes, de renforcer la protection sociale et la
promotion des mutuelles de santk. Ainsi, le Gouvernement entend (i) ameliorer les conditions
d’existence des familles, protkger et preserver la famille, promouvoir la paix et la stabitit4 sociale
et renforcer les capacites des institutions de promotion de la famille ; (ii) promouvoir la sante,
I‘education et la formation de la fille et de la femme, ameliorer le respect du statut juridique de
la femme, valoriser la prise en compte du travail et des cultures favorables a I‘epanouissement
de la femme ; (iii) faciliter I’accb des femmes, surtout les plus pauvres, a la micro finance,
ameliorer I’acces des femmes a la terre et renforcer I‘alphab6tisation des femmes ; (iv) ameliorer
I’integration socio-professionnelle des personnes handicapees, soutenir les personnes de
troisieme 8ge pour un vieillissement actif, prendre en charge les indigents et les victimes du
VIH/SIDA et d’autres maladies invalidantes et renforcer les capacitks des structures oeuvrant au
profit du developpement de la solidarite ; (v) promouvoir la micro-assurance, creer des mesures
incitatives pour I’installation des mutuelles de santk, encourager les mutuelles communautaires
de santd e t sensibiliser la population sur les avantages d‘une appartenance a une mutuelle de
sante.

2.4. Axe 1V de la SCRP : Promotion de la bonne gouvernance

48. Le Gouvernement fait de la qualite de la gouvernance I‘un des piliers sur lesquels le Benin
doit enraciner sa SCRP. Aussi, entend-t-il approfondir et accelerer les actions entreprises dans
les domaines de la justice, de la gestion des finances publiques, de la lutte contre la corruption,
de la reforme de I‘administration et de la fonction publique,

Rkforme judiciaire

49. L‘amelioration du fonctionnement et de I’acces au systkme juridique et judiciaire constitue
une preoccupation majeure pour le Gouvernement. Ainsi, dans le cadre de la poursuite de la
mise en ceuvre du programme de reforme de la justice, le Gouvernement entend : (i) ameiiorer
les performances des systemes juridique et judiciaire a travers une justice emcace, credible et
accessible, (ii) mettre en place une administration penitentiaire qui favorise la skcurite des
citoyens et la reinsertion sociale des detenus et (iii) renforcer la protection des droits de
I’homme, de I’enfance, de la jeunesse et de toutes les populations vulnerables.
Le Gouvernement s’emploie a amkliorer (i) le ratio moyen du nombre de detenu (prevenus et
inculpks) en attente de jugement par rapport au nombre total des condamnes afin qu’il
soit inferieur a 300% pour I’annee 2006 et continue de decroitre les annees suivantes;
(ii) la durCe moyenne de detention preventive afin qu’il soit soit infkrieur a 10% par rapport a
I’annCe 2006 et continue de decroitre de 10% les annees suivantes ; (iii) le taux du nombre de
dossiers reglks par rapport au nombre de dossier en stock et au nombre de dossiers enregistres
au tribunal au cours de I’annee consideree afin qu’il passe a un taux superieur a 50% en 2007,
60% en 2008 et 70% en 2009; (v) le nombre de prisons civiles conformes aux normes
                                                                                            13118


internationales afin que ce chiffre passe a sept (07) sur huit (08) en 2007, huit (08) sur neuf
(09) en 2008 et neuf (09) sur neuf (09) en 2009.

50. Le Gouvernement continuera a assurer le recrutement de quarante (40) auditeurs de justice
et de trente (30) greffiers en 2007 pour la resolution du probleme de I’insuffisance de I’effectif
de ces categories de personnel. I I entend en outre en 2007 : (i) definir une veritable politique de
recrutement sur la base d’une etude approfondie des effectifs et des besoins de long terme pour
les juridictions et I’ensemble du ministere charge de la justice et des juridictions ; (ii) exicuter
de maniere satisfaisante le budget-programme ; iii) engager des mesures de reformes du
systeme penitentiaire ; (iv) poursuivre la mise en ceuvre de la politique de formation continue
des magistrats et greffiers auxiliaires de justice et des fonctionnaires du ministere charge de la
justice ; (v) assurer le suivi des effectifs, des donnees et indicateurs du secteur de la justice afin
de mieux orienter les autorites dans les prises de decisions; et (vi) prendre les mesures
nkessaires pour demarrer la reorganisation du ministere.


R6forme budge‘taire

51. Dans le but d‘accroitre effectivement I‘efficacite des depenses dans un cadre de gestion
transparente, le Gouvernement du Benin est resolu a poursuivre la mise en ceuvre de la
reforme de son systeme budgetaire. Celle-ci vise a : (i) introduire une gestion budgetaire axee
sur la performance au moyen des budgets-programmes clairement definis et coherents avec un
cadre de depenses a moyen terme ; (ii) delkguer la responsabilite de gestion des d6penses
publiques jusque-la executee par le Ministere en charge des Finances aux ministeres sectoriels
et jusqu‘aux niveaux deconcentrks de I’administration tout en ceuvrant pour un cadre fiduciaire
renforce (gestion budgetaire saine) ; et (iii) rationaliser et informatiser le circuit de la depense.

52, Depuis le debut de cette reforme budgetaire, des progres importants ont et6 accomplis dans
les domaines de la formulation des programmes, de la preparation et de I’execution du budget
et de la production des rapports de performance grdce a la conduite des reformes
institutionnelles cles et a un effort intense visant le renforcement des capacitks. En vue de
restaurer le respect de I’orthodoxie financiere, le Gouvernement a pris d’importantes mesures
dont (i) ia limitation du recours aux procedures exceptionnelles d’exicution des depenses
publiques; (ii) I’accel6ration de la regularisation des avances faites aux rkgies ; et (iii)
I’apurement progressif des dettes de I‘Etat envers ses crkanciers,

53. La realisation des objectifs retenus dans le cadre de la SCRP requiert la mobilisation des
ressources necessaires        la realisation des investissements prkvus. Aussi, le Gouvernement

I’adrninistration publique, en particulier le driveloppement de la remuneration selon le rendement
et la mise en place d’une decentralisation de la responsabilite en matiere de recrutement et de
gestion du personnel. Cependant, il faut une reforme administrative appropriee basee sur la
performance, une clarification du cadre juridique des missions et des responsabilites des
fonctionnaires avec comrne toile de fond, une fonction publique competente, integre,
                                                                                        16/18

fonctionnaires payes, de mieux gerer le personnel de I'Etat et de limiter I'introduction dans le
circuit d'actes de nomination ou d'avancement frauduleux. L'audit du FUR a montre la necessite
de mettre en place un Systeme Integrk de Gestion des Ressources Humaines. Le Gouvernement
entend realiser les etudes necessaires pour la mise en ceuvre de ce systeme qui constitue un
outil primordial pour la gestion quantitative et qualitative des ressources humaines pour une
administration de developpement.

65. Le Gouvernement a deleguk en 2004 par decret aux ministeres en charge de I'Education la
gestion des actes administratifs de leur personnel et mis en place un cadre technique

en vue de I'adhesion de tous les partenaires notamment les partenaires sociaux, au nouveau
mode de gestion ax6e sur les resultats. L'aboutissement de cette refonte permettra : (i) la
definition d'une politique salariale motivante par la reconnaissance du merite et de la
performance ainsi que d'un nouveau systeme de gestion de la carriere et de remuneration du
personnel de I'Etat, et (ii) la mise en euvre d'une politique adequate de recrutement.

importante de la strategic de reduction de la pauvrete. La gestion rationnelle des ressources
naturelles permettra d‘inverser a terme le processus de degradation du patrimoine forestier
national dont dependent ies populations en milieu rural pour leur subsistance. L‘option retenue a
cet effet est la mise en czuvre des mecanismes visant une responsabilisation accrue des
communautks a la base et la promotion des activites lucratives alternatives a I’exploitation
anarchique des for&% Le Programme de Gestion des For& et des Terroirs Riverains (PGFTR)
