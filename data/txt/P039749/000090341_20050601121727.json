The lessons\n            learned indicate that an institutional capacity assessment\n            of this project would have identified key constraints which\n            could have been used to strengthen project design, and\n            identified more realistic outcome indicators to more\n            objectively measure achievements. The Bank should be more\n            realistic in what can actually be achieved within a single\n            investment operation. As with previous projects, once\n            monitoring indicators have been agreed to during project\n            preparation, resources should be dedicated to collecting all\n            baseline data. It is important to assess Government\n            commitment to reform initiatives based on clear commitment\n            from both the MOP as well as the sectoral ministry\n            responsible for implementation and not solely from the MOP.\n            For activities that require ongoing financial and other\n            resources after the project closes, dialogue on\n            sustainability arrangements need to be held and agreements\n            incorporated in the project appraisal document during\n            preparation. Closer attention should have been paid to\n            implementing the QAG quality-at-entry (QAE) assessment\n            recommendations of this project which were crucial to\n            implementation success. In relation to the previous\n            recommendation and for all projects in general, QAE\n            assessments should be more dynamic rather than being mainly\n            treated as a standard Bank requirement. In terms of future\n            support of the health sector in Jordan, the Bank needs to be\n            more selective in the areas it chooses to support, focusing\n            on activities where the Bank has a comparative advantage."}, "docdt": "2005-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
