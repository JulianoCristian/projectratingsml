The Health Sector Reform Project supports the first\n            phase of the reform program, and its main objectives are to\n            contain growth in health expenditures, improve health care\n            services, and assure efficiency in the use of physical\n            facilities. The project components include: 1) The\n            rationalization of the investment strategy for health\n            delivery systems, which will directly support economic\n            efficiency improvement. A health facility masterplan will\n            incorporate norms and standards, overall needs, and public\n            and private sector capacity. 2) The development of health\n            information systems, which will provide relevant and timely\n            epidemiological data and improve management information\n            systems for patients record keeping, services, inventory,\n            and personnel. 3) The improvement of private hospital\n            financing will establish accounting standards and adjust\n            budgetary allocations efficiently. 4) The reform of the\n            pharmaceutical sector will promote generic substitution,\n            rationalize the use of drugs, and reform drug procurement.\n            5) A continuing reform process will be addressed, and\n            special studies conducted. Technical expertise recruits will\n            aim at exploring alternative reform proposals."}, "docdt": "1999-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
