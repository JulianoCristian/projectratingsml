However, while objectives\n            surpassed expectations in terms of establishing the legal,\n            and regulatory framework, major issues are still pending:\n            competitiveness will occur only after successful completion\n            of transaction award licenses for the new cellular, and\n            wireless local loop service providers; urban areas'\n            competitiveness should be parallel to the introduction of\n            private participation in the provision of rural services,\n            and based on a competitive tendering process; and, new\n            impetus should be given to the Nepal Telecommunications\n            Corporation (NTC). The lessons suggest that since radical\n            sector reforms are time consuming, the continued involvement\n            in the sector provides the Bank with the opportunity for a\n            strong support to reform. Furthermore, labor unions should\n            be involved at the early stages, to properly address their\n            concerns, and avoid later resistance to change. The\n            acceptance by the Bank of NTC's investment plan, -\n            prior to the Government's agreement to pursue a\n            privatization strategy - was later used by NTC as an issue\n            to delay reforms, prevent competition, and, maintain its\n            monopoly. Therefore, lending should have been contingent to\n            the demonstrated firm commitment from main stakeholders,\n            and, the processing of the Credit, contingent on Government\n            ownership of the reform process."}, "docdt": "2000-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
