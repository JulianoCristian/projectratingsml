objectives of the Channel\n            Maintenance Project are to (i) help increase agricultural\n            productivity through more efficient functioning of the\n            irrigation and drainage network, (ii) introduce relevant and\n            cost-effective methods of channel maintenance, and (iii)\n            strengthen the capabilities of project-related institutions.\n            The traditional system of channel maintenance involving\n            large-scale excavation would be changed by introducing\n            balanced work-cycles of weed mowing, chemical treatment and\n            desilting for various channels.  The loan, itself, would\n            finance the upgrading of the equipment fleet of contracting\n            agencies, including private sector companies; cycle-based\n            maintenance schedules to be introduced over the entire\n            48,000 km network of public channels; and technical\n            assistance for the agencies organized under the Ministry of\n            Irrigation for channel maintenance.  These include the\n            Irrigation Sector, the Weed Research Institute, and the\n            Public Sector Excavation Companies."}, "docdt": "1986-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
