The restructuring paper\n            proposes extension of closing date from March 31, 2013 to\n            September 13, 2013. The extension is necessary to allow for\n            the completion of the ongoing rehabilitation of the feeder\n            roads. Major port reforms have been undertaken resulting in\n            improved operational efficiency at the port; road\n            maintenance funding and management of works have been\n            separated and expected to lead to more effective management\n            of sector expenditures. Increased disbursement activities\n            are expected in the next few months as project activities\n            are completed."}, "docdt": "2013-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
