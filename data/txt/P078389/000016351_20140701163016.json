{"cdata!": "The overall outcome rating of the\n            Infrastructure Development Project for Sierra Leone was\n            judged to be moderately satisfactory.  The Bank and borrower\n            performance ratings were moderately satisfactory.  The risk\n            to development outcome was high.  Several lessons were\n            learned.  Institutional reform takes time and the Bank\n            should continue to be patient with institutions undergoing\n            reform process, especially fragile states like Sierra Leone.\n            Institutional reform consists of change in attitude and\n            always meets with resistance. It took considerable efforts\n            to get the Bills necessary to create the new institutions.\n            Following parliament\u0092s approval, the low capacity in the\n            country made it difficult to operationalize the new\n            agencies. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity\n            in the implementing agencies is key to adequate monitoring\n            of results. The capacity to collect and monitor project\n            performance indicator was weak at the Implementation\n            Agencies. Building capacity for M&E should start at\n            project preparation. Furthermore, the baseline data should\n            be mandatory for collection in the first year of project\n            implementation.  The procurement process remained a\n            significant challenge and delayed project implementation.\n            Preparing Terms of Reference, bidding documents, evaluating\n            and awarding contracts are a specific skills set. The\n            development of such skilled manpower requires special\n            attention to ensure projects are completed on time. In a\n            post-crisis political-economic environment, Governments may\n            find it necessary to retreat on policy reforms where\n            commitments were made. Such retreats may be vital to\n            securing stability and to advance when the political economy\n            permits. In such conditions the Bank may need to re-consider\n            the political economic climate which determines the policies\n            to advance at any given time in its relationship with the\n            Government.   Quality at Entry (QEA) is an important step\n            ensuring project implementation readiness. The civil works\n            bidding documents at were not ready at project appraisal.\n            Considerable time was lost in completing the design of the\n            civil works. This could have been identified at QEA and the\n            delay could have been averted."}, "docdt": "2014-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
