                         The overarching PDO is: to rehabilitate selected priority roads, port and airport facilities of the Recipient; and to support the regulatory and institutional reform and

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Key reforms and works have been implemented under the project resulting in rehabilitated roads, airport and port facilities, in accordance with the project objectives. Major port
                         reforms (successful concession of the Container Terminal) have been undertaken resulting in improved operational efficiency at the port and a transition path to a Landlord port

                         model; sections of the primary road network have been rehabilitated, maintenance funding and management and planning of road works has been separated; and the airport
                         functions at a higher level of operational safety with installation of the NAVAIDS equipment. Feeder roads rehabilitation is under way in the Bonthe and Kono districts with the majority
                         of the contracts substantially completed. While the government initially increased the Road Fund levy to the level agreed under the project, this was rescinded consequent on the
                         financial crisis and its planned reinstatement has been delayed partly due to the elections last year.
