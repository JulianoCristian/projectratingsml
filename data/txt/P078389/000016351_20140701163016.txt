1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Sierra Leone suffered from severe economic contraction and destruction of
transport infrastructure during the period of civil conflict from 1995-99. Following the
start of government efforts (March 1998) to restore peaceful conditions to the country,
the government redirected Bank and Donor programs towards emergency reconstruction
of the road network and restoration of port and airport operations.

2.      The classified National Road System (NRS) is made up of about 4000 kms of
feeder roads, 1900 kms of secondary roads and 2100 kms of primary roads. About 30
percent of the core network is paved and the rest is gravel. Management of all public
roads is the responsibility of the Sierra Leone Road Authority (SLRA). Maintenance of
the road network is financed through a Road Fund (RF) whose receipts come from a fuel
levy, and fees from vehicle and driver licensing. The massive destruction of roads during
the war period hampered movement of people and goods and also cut off some
communities from the rest of the country. Both the primary core and feeder roads were
affected and the government undertook efforts following the end of the conflict,
supported by the donors, to bring the national road network up to a minimum functional
standard. This notwithstanding, many of the core and feeder roads continued in a state of
disrepair and were unmaintainable. The Government’s efforts at the time were severely
constrained by limited budgetary and technical resources.

3.       Queen Elizabeth II (QEII) Port is the principal commercial port in the country and
is managed by the semi-autonomous Sierra Leone Port Authority (SLPA).The Transport
Sector Project (TSP, FY96) supported improvements in infrastructure at the QEII Port,
provided additional equipment and initiated the process of moving the Port to ‘landlord’
status. During the civil conflict, the service port suffered from destruction of all records,
equipment stock and damaged infrastructure. While the TSP helped to restore operations,
and there was an increase in ship calls, there was severe over staffing, low productivity,
institutional capacity constraints and inefficient operations at the port. Deficiencies in
infrastructure and equipment needed to be addressed, including implementation of
internationally recognized environmental, safety and security standards.

4.      Similarly, operations at Freetown International Airport, Sierra Leone’s only
gateway airport, were restored by activities funded under the TSP (rehabilitation of the
arrival and departure terminals, rehabilitation of runway lighting and purchase of standby
electrical equipment) and the performance of the Sierra Leone Airports Authority
(SLAA) improved over the years. But further infrastructure and equipment inputs were
needed to meet internationally-accepted aircraft and passenger security and safety
standards. The runway needed to be strengthened, and the turning loop and taxiway
entrance had to be upgraded to accommodate modern aircrafts. The automatic landing
and communication equipment at the airport were obsolete and needed upgrading.

Rationale for Bank involvement:

5.      Prior to the start of civil unrest, the Bank supported the preparation of a National
Transport Sector Policy (NTSP). Following the end of hostilities, the NTSP provided the
basis for a multi-donor supported Ten Year Transport Sector Investment Plan. The Plan
established priorities for immediate and long term investments, and spelled out key
policy reforms and strategies to address sector management issues for the roads sector,
the port of Freetown, and Lungi International Airport.

6.      Both the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP, 2004) and the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS 3 ) for Sierra Leone FY2006 recognized the importance of
rehabilitating and expanding Sierra Leone’s transport infrastructure in promoting
economic growth and addressing issues of food security and youth employment. The
CAS also emphasized the need for “institutional development and capacity building in
conjunction with investments”. The rationale for the Bank’s assistance was to support the
Government’s efforts for “…effective and coordinated linkages and inventions in the
productive sectors (principally agriculture, fisheries and mining); the infrastructure
sectors (roads and transportation) and the social sectors (health, nutrition, water,
sanitation and education)”.

7.      The Infrastructure Development Project (IDP) was consistent with the 2005 CAS
which confirmed the three pillars of the PRSP. The PRSP specifically included primary
and feeder road development as one of its Poverty Reduction Indicators for Pillar 2:
Promoting pro-poor sustainable growth for food security and job creation. The CAS
noted the need “to rehabilitate the dilapidated infrastructure in the areas of roads, port and
air transport”. The IDP aimed to contribute to the pro-poor economic growth strategy of
the PRSP by facilitating physical access to markets, essential service and development
opportunities over continuous road access, and efficient, economical and safe shipping
and air facilities. The project aimed also to contribute to the PRSP’s objectives of
improving the integration of the country and enhancing overall security, including food
security.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      Original PDO. The PDO, as stated in the Development Grant Agreement (DGA),
of the IDP was to rehabilitate selected priority roads, port and airport facilities of the
recipient; and to support the regulatory and institutional reform and effective
management of the recipient's road, port and airport sectors.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by the original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

10.     The original PDO did not change during project implementation. Both key and
intermediate indicators were revised in September 2011 to help streamline, refine the
results framework and to include the mandatory core sector indicators, introduced in
2009. The team opted for decreasing the number of indicators, by using core transport
sector indicators as a proxy when applicable, or by dropping those that were irrelevant
because they were too focused on the early stage of project implementation. For example,
many targeted results to be achieved “by mid-term”. This resulted in a simplified results
framework (from 9 to 7 key indicators, and 19 to 12 intermediate indicators), with more
specificity and a better focus on the achievement of the PDO. The revised indicators are
shown in Table 1.

Project Restructuring:

11.      The project was restructured twice during implementation to extend the closing
date, first in September 21, 2011 and then March 7, 2013. Grant funds were reallocated
on January 8, 2008, along with additional financing, to meet the funding gaps on civil
works and services. There was another reallocation on January 29, 2010 whereby two
activities under component C (Water and electricity at the airport) were cancelled and
moved to government funding. At the same time the paving of the container stacking
areas at the port was cancelled from the project as it was included in the concessioning
package for the container terminal.

12.       The first restructuring included:

      •   Reallocation of funds: Grant and credit proceeds were reallocated across
          categories to finance: (i) cost overrun in works under Component B (Freetown
          Port Infrastructure and Management); (ii) cost overrun for the supply, installation,
          testing and commissioning of the navigational aids and communications
          equipment under Component C (Freetown International Airport Infrastructure and
          Management); (iii) cost overruns for consultants’ services for Components B and
          C mentioned above; and (iv) consultant services and operating costs of the
          Coordination and Monitoring Unit (CMU) under Component D (Project
          Coordination);

      •   Extension of closing date: The original closing date was extended by 18 months
          from September 30, 2011 to March 31, 2013 to allow for completion of the
          ongoing activities and rehabilitation of the feeder roads;

      •   The revision of the results framework (see 1.3); and

      •   Activities cancelation: Activities under Component C including the provision of
          water and power supply systems at Freetown International Airport were
          cancelled.

13.    The second restructuring was approved on March 31, 2013 and the project closing
date was further extended by 6 months, from March 31, 2013 to September 13, 2013 to
compensate for the delay in starting rehabilitation works on the feeder roads due to
excessive and unusual rainfall which delayed implementation by about three months after
contract award and signing.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     The primary beneficiaries of improved road infrastructure were the rural
communities living along the project roads, and the resident populations of urban areas
including, but not limited to, Makeni, Matatoka, Bo and Kenema that benefited from the
creation of 987,600 man-hour temporary jobs on project sites and better access to social
services and economic markets. The project improved the livelihood of the local
population by creating temporary employment, and improving 270km of rural and 106km

                                               6
of inter-urban connectivity critical to the peace efforts of the government in the aftermath
of the civil conflict.

15.     The Freetown port investment and reform benefited the entire country as it
improved the main interface between Sierra Leone and the world, and facilitated the
importation of food products, and inputs critical to rebuild the economy after the civil
conflict. The concession of the Container terminal also provided government with a
regular revenue stream, and obviated the need for subsidies to the port. Similarly, the
improvements at the Freetown airport benefited directly airline passengers flying to and
from Sierra Leone.

16.     The secondary groups of beneficiaries include the Ministry of Transport and
Aviation (MOT&A), National Commission for Privatization (NCP), SLRA, SLPA,
SLAA and the local construction industry. The project strengthened the capacity of the
ministry, the commission, and the agencies to manage their assets (roads, port and
airport) and improved efficiency by promoting private sector participation, the use of cost
effective designs on feeder roads, and organizational reform of SLRA and SLPA.
Moreover, the project helped the local construction industries improve their technical
skills by emphasizing the role of the technical supervision done by an international
consultant company as an instrument for technology and knowledge transfer. Training
opportunities under the project further supported building the capacity of the staff of all
agencies and the Ministry. The process of concessioning the Container Terminal, the first
such transaction completed by the NCP, created a learning-by-doing experience in
handling private sector related transactions for staff at SLPA, NCP and MOTC, in
addition to providing a stable, annual flow of revenues to the treasury.

1.5 Original Components

18.    The project had four components; the original components and costs are as
follows:

Component A: Road infrastructure and management (US$23.58 million; IDA
US$22.53 million)
19.     It comprised of three sub-components: (A.1) Core Road Network Rehabilitation;
(A.2) Rural and Feeder Roads Infrastructure rehabilitation; and (A.3) Road Sector
Management Support and Reform which includes: (a) establishing an independent road
maintenance fund, reorganizing SLRA and revising its regulatory framework; (b)
supporting SLRA Feeder roads Department for the effective management of the rural and
feeder roads; (c) optimizing the revenue collection function of SLRA; and (d) privatizing
the Mechanical Services Unit (MSU) as a commercial entry.

Component B: Freetown Port Infrastructure and Management (US$10.75 million;
IDA US$6.91 million)
20.     This component comprised of two sub-components: (B.1) SLPA reorganization
including restructuring of SPLA as a landlord port, and outsourcing to the private sector
of all cargo handling operations and services at the port; and (B.2) Freetown Port
Infrastructure and Equipment, including: (a) expansion of the container paved stacking
area; (b) completion of the rehabilitation of outstanding berths; (c) maintenance of
dredging and installation of new fenders; (d) provision of the navigational aids to
improve safety of navigation; and (e) provision of the specialized environmental and
safety equipment.

Component C: Freetown International Airport Infrastructure and Management
(US$9.75 million; IDA US$8.86 million)
21.     Component C had three sub-components: (C.1) Airport Rehabilitation including
strengthening of the Freetown International Airport runway, upgrading in turning loops
and taxiway accesses, installation of the water and electricity supplies, and the
replacement of automatic landing and ground/air communication systems; (C.2)
Updating of the master plan for the development of a new international airport; and (C.3)
Airport Management Support including technical advisory services and training to SLAA
to improve its efficiency and competitiveness.

Component D: Project Coordination, TA services and Training (IDA US$4 million)
22.      This component provided support to CMU, SLRA, SLPA and SLAA for the
coordination, financial management and procurement, environmental and social
management, quality assurance, technical audit and monitoring and evaluation of the
project.




                                           8
1.6 Revised Components
23.    There was no change in the project components. However the scope was
marginally modified with some activities moved to government and private sector
funding, and a corresponding reallocation of proceeds as described in paragraphs 11 and
12 above. The final kilometers of feeder roads improved were also less than the
approximate number noted in the PAD.

1.7 Other significant changes

Additional financing (AF)

24.      An additional grant in an amount of SDR 3,200,000 (US$5.1 million equivalent)
and an additional credit of SDR 3,700,000 (US$5.9 million equivalent) for the project
were approved on July 19, 2008. The AF was necessary to meet the cost overrun on the
core road network sub-component. Indeed, the bid prices received for the two non-rural
roads were 32 to 86 percent higher than the engineer’s estimates. This discrepancy can be
explained by the changing conditions in terms of market prices (increase of up to 80
percent in costs of basic construction materials such as fuel, bitumen, steel and cement)
between the time at appraisal in October 2005 and the bidding process, but also by the
fact that the security situation improved only slowly over the same period of time. The
perceived risk of working in Sierra Leone was reflected in the bid amounts which were
much higher than expected and reflected a premium for the perceived security risk. The
second rationale behind the additional financing was to support the regulatory and
institutional reform and effective management of the recipient’s road, port, and airport
sectors without changing the original scope/design or outcome.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

25.     Project Preparation. The preparation of the IDP was initiated in FY03
(November 2003) for thirty months with support from a PHRD grant (US$1.18 million)
and a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in the amount of US$1.7 million. The project
was approved by the Bank’s Board on December 6, 2005, and became effective on 19
May, 2006. The team worked in collaboration with Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL)
and managed to gather a fair amount of data to support the selection of works, despite the
loss of agency records and data during the civil war. However, the trunk road design and
preparation of bidding documents could not be completed before effectiveness due to low
procurement capacity at SLRA and the CMU. Thus the PPF was canceled soon as the
project became effective.

26.     Project Design. The IDP aimed to address rehabilitation of priority gaps in the
core and feeder road networks, continue restoration of physical infrastructure and
operations at the port and airport, and support institutional rebuilding of the road and port
authorities. The design included: (i) reorganizing road sector management to support
improvements in maintenance of core and feeder road networks; (ii) outsourcing the non-
                                             9
core functions in the Freetown Port and continuing its reorganization towards a ‘landlord
port’; and (iii) enhancing safety and service quality to Freetown international airport
users. The key lesson of prioritizing physical investments supported by institutional
changes was a major consideration in IDP design. In view of the consensus that the
country’s overall political and economic environment was a significant risk, provisions
were made for quality assurance in the areas of procurement, financial and technical audit
through support for the Coordination and Monitoring unit (CMU). Overall, the
components in the project supported the reestablishment of peace and economic growth
through improving road access, facilitating imports and exports of goods and building
materials at the port, and re-establishing regional and global air connection. These were
supported by reform actions which would allow the interventions to be sustained. As
such, the components were both relevant to the needs of post-conflict Sierra Leone and
suitable for inclusion in a transport sector operation.

27.     Quality at entry. The Quality at Entry was not reviewed by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG). The project was prepared in a challenging environment
towards the end of the civil war. There was little or no data on the ground, while
movement around the country was difficult due to the still uncertain security situation
and the condition of the roads. This impacted project preparation and though the
feasibility studies and the designs for the trunk roads were completed, the bid documents
were prepared during project implementation. As a result, when the bid documents were
prepared, there was a disconnect between the engineers’ estimates used in the appraisal
documents and the current market prices. Indeed, market conditions had changed since
appraisal and prices for works and services proved to be significantly higher than
anticipated. With respect to rural roads, only broad criteria for selection of the roads were
identified at appraisal. After effectiveness, it took the project about 36 months to agree on
the selection of feeder roads, improvement standards and specifications, and launch the
procurement process. The process was also impacted by consideration of the size and
capacity of the local contracting industry which was fully engaged in contracts funded by
other donors, including the EU.

Risk assessment and mitigation
28.      The IDP Project Appraisal Document (PAD) defined the overall risk as Moderate
although the risk due to the fragile political and economic environment to the project
development objective was assessed as Substantial. The post-conflict environment turned
out to have a major impact during implementation driving higher costs and low interest
from qualified bidders. The substantial environment risk also affected the government’s
ability to re-instate the fuel levy which in turn impacted maintenance expenditures on the
road network. The challenges of selection of feeder roads in distant provinces and
rehabilitation standards, as well as the weak capacity of the local contracting community
were not identified as a risk but proved to be factors in the slow implementation of the
feeder roads sub-component.




                                             10
2.2 Implementation
29.      Initial delays. The shortcomings of the preparation (works bidding documents)
resulted in significant implementation delays. The low procurement capacity at both the
CMU and IAs added substantially to overall time taken to complete procurement
processes. Furthermore, the country was emerging from civil war, the risk perceptions of
potential bidders were not fully known. These were revealed overtime and through
procurement process. The market assessment of the risk presented in two ways (i) low
number of bids received (ii) high cost of bids which was incorporated as compensation
for the risk. Though contracts for the trunk roads had been awarded, most of the other
activities were either in-process or pending. Following the Mid Term Review (MTR), a
set of corrective actions supported the Implementation Agencies (IAs) to resolve
procurement and coordination issues, and the Coordination and Monitoring Unit (CMU)
proceeded to recruit a procurement specialist. Implementation of activities picked up
subsequently and disbursements improved.

30.     Institutional factors. The CMU was initially located at the office of the Vice-
President, and not in any technical Ministry. This resulted in a tussle between the CMU
and Implementing Agencies (IA) that delayed decision making on activities, especially
on implementation of the institutional reform processes. In 2009, the CMU was
transferred to the Ministry of Transport and Aviation (MoTA) which provided closer,
higher level attention to project administration and this noticeably improved the project’s
performance. The implementation of the IDP was also impacted by the general elections
of 2007 and November 2012. During the run-up to the elections and following the
completion of voting, there were several months of transition as the Heads and Boards of
the IAs (SLRA, SLPA, and SLAA) were dissolved and replaced slowly by the new
government.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design
31.     The PAD’s results framework comprised a list of outcome indicators and
intermediate results for monitoring progress and outcomes specific to each components.
Each implementing agency (CMU, SLRA, SLPA, SLAA) was responsible for data
collection and update of their respective indicators. While SLPA and SLAA updated the
indicators, SLRA was slower in compiling the requisite updates. The indicators were
revised during project restructuring in 2011 – see Section 1.3.

Implementation and Utilization
32.     Implementation. The implementation of the M&E framework was Moderately
Satisfactory. While baseline values were available for all indicators, the government did
not indicate target values for the revised indicators. The monitoring of the indicators was
inconsistent, in particular by the roads agency. SLRA was updating its roads database,
and the data collation and analysis took longer than anticipated and adversely impacted
the update of the roads indicators. Data on the indicators was collected and reported

                                            11
before they were revised (see data sheet) and monitoring efforts by the CMU were more
effective subsequent to their relocation at the MOTA.

33.     Utilization. Following their revision, the selected indicators were relevant and
utilized in monitoring and evaluation of the operational performance of the road, port and
airport sub-sectors.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.    Safeguards. The project was classified as category B and triggered OP/BP/GP
4.01 (Environmental Assessment). Environmental Assessments had been carried out for
each of the roads, port and airport of the project. The major safeguards instruments
prepared and disclosed in the World Bank Infoshop included the Environmental and
Social Assessment Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) for the feeder/rural roads. Institutional capacity for safeguards
implementation was adequate given that consultants were recruited and utilized for
handling the environment aspects.

35.     Procurement. The midterm review rated procurement Moderately Unsatisfactory
and identified the followings bottlenecks: (a) lack of implementation agency’s capacity in
procurement; (b) low interest from bidders; and (c) delayed hiring of a procurement
specialist at the CMU to undertake proper monitoring of procurement activities. In
response, the project team took measures to address the issues. The implementing
authorities were allowed to use external procurement specialists when needed and to
recruit technical specialists. The CMU speeded up the recruitment of a proficient
procurement expert who delivered hands-on training and mentoring to all procurement
staff. At project closing, procurement was assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.

36.     Financial Management (FM). Financial management compliance was rated
Satisfactory. At Mid-Term Review financial management was assessed as Moderately
Satisfactory. Prior to Mid Term Review (MTR), FM review indicated payments were
made without payment vouchers, some SOEs did not have adequate supporting
documents; and interest received in respect to designated (special) account balances were
not treated as prescribed by the Project Implementation Manual. However, the
recruitment of a qualified accountant at the CMU helped to strengthen the financial
management functions, while other accounting support staff received additional training.
Consequently, all necessary financial reports, including Intermediate Financial Report
(IFR) and Financial Management Report (FMR), Quarterly Financial Management
Reports (FMRs) and annual audits were submitted on time for the remaining of the
implementation period.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
37.      The major achievements of IDP are the reforms in the three sub-sectors and the
investments in roads, ports and airport infrastructures. There was significant institutional
build up under the project, particularly in the roads and ports sectors. In the roads sector,
the reorganized SLRA is now contracting out all routine maintenance and is seeking to

                                             12
pilot performance based, multi-year contracts within the transport component of an Urban
Infrastructure project under preparation. Building on the success of the IDP which
supported the process of concessioning the container terminal at the port, the government
has commenced preparation of an integrated, inter-modal transport corridor to be
implemented in partnership with the private sector, including the mining companies. An
initial Port Siting Study has been completed under the IDP and this is being developed
further with support from the International Finance Corporation and Public-Private
Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF).

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of objectives: Substantial

38.     The PDO, design and implementation of the IDP remain relevant to GoSL’s
Agenda for Prosperity (Phase I: 2013 to 2018). The PDO is also closely aligned with the
objectives of the Joint Country Assistance Strategy for Sierra Leone (JCAS, 2010 to
2013), which look for broad based, equitable growth and human development through
private sector development, good governance, prudent management of natural resources
and macroeconomic stability. The cross-cutting themes, Governance and private Sector
development include “strengthening governance institutions, addressing governance
issues in operations, promoting opportunities for private-sector development across all
sectors”, and are supported by the IDP.

Relevance of Design: Significant

39.    The design of the IDP is also found relevant because the components are
consistent with the PDO. The civil works components sought to contribute to the
achievements of the PDO in terms of rehabilitating trunk and feeder roads, runway and
turning loops at the airport, and pavement of the container stacking area (via the
concession contract) and generating temporary employment. The institutional sub-
components sought to improve inclusion of the private sector, operational efficiency, and
governance at the port and road authorities. Implementation arrangements were
appropriate though needed some modification to maximize facilitation aspects for
improved implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall Rating: Satisfactory.

40.     The rating is based on the aggregate of the achievement of the PDO, its indicators
and outcomes as of September 13, 2013. This section assesses the extent to which the
project achieved the objective by outcomes, highlighting each output that contributed to
these outcomes. Details of the outputs are presented in Annex 2. The rating considers the
two parts of the PDO and is assessed along the outcome indicators as follows.

PDO 1 - Rehabilitate selected priority roads, port and airport facilities
                                           13
Outcome 1: Sustainable all-weather access over selected sections of the primary
road network and connecting rural and feeder roads.

41.     This outcome was substantially achieved. The project contributed to improved
road network in the country. The original target of rehabilitating 106 km of core roads
was fully achieved, increasing the percentage of core road network in good and fair
condition by 5 percent. There was also additional contribution of 6 percent increase in
percentage of feeder roads in good and fair condition by the rehabilitation of 270 kms
feeder roads in two Districts (131 km and 139 km in Kono and Bothe Districts
respectively). The revised target of 270 km of feeder roads was fully achieved against the
approximate 400 km number in the PAD (additional funding for rural roads was provided
under the Rural and Private Sector Development project). The actual number of kms to
be improved was identified when the unit costs of improvement became available.
Overall, the share of the rural population with access to an all season rural road within the
project corridor was increased by 153.6 percent.

Outcome 2: Improved efficiency, safety and sustainability of the Freetown Port
operations

42.     The performance at Freetown Port has improved substantially. The container
handling capacity /productivity increased from 64 to 238 TEUs/day (272 percent
increase) due to increased efficiency at the concessioned container terminal. The Port
break-bulk ships handling also increased by 138 percent from 850 to 2,029 ton/day.
Furthermore, both staff cost and annual expenditure reduced due to rationalization of
staff and improved efficiency at the Port. Consequently, there was 63 percent and 41
percent reduction in staff strength and staff cost respectively, between 2010 and 2013.
The reduction in staff costs is higher if the cost of packages provided to retrenched staff
are excluded from the gross staff cost numbers.

Outcome 3: Improved efficiency, safety and sustainability of the International
Airport operations

43.     This outcome was fully achieved. The Lungi International airport now meets the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. The
Airport was certified by ICAO in 2011, and has passed ICAO auditing ever since. This is
largely due to improved safety of aircrafts and passengers at the airport. There has been
an increase in air traffic at the Freetown airport; seven Airlines have regular flights to and
from Freetown, while there are now direct flight to over 12 countries in two continents-
Europe and Asia. In 2011 alone, about 99,181 passengers had entered the country of
which 53 percent or 52,442 were tourists/visitors. These are the outcomes of runways
rehabilitation, widening of turning loops and taxiways accesses, provision of new
illuminated wind sock and installation of new navigational aids amongst other
developments at the airport.




                                             14
PDO 2 - Support the regulatory and institutional reform and effective management
of the road, port and airport sectors

Outcome 1: SLRA: Second generation road maintenance fund was created and
became functional.

44.     This outcome is substantially achieved. The Sierra Leone Roads Authority
(SLRA) Act, 1992, was amended in 2010. SLRA now concentrates on management of
road network, while the Management of RF is now the function of a newly created
Independent Road Maintenance Fund Administration (RMFA). Consequently, there has
been improved accountability and transparency in collection and management of road
funds and revenues. The RMFA’s account is audited annually and report available to the
public. For instance, SLL44.307 Billion (US$10.4m at 1SLL=$0.0002331) was collected
in 2012. The major component of RF is fuel levy that was reduced to USD0.03/liter from
USD0.10/liter to reduce the impact of global increase in fuel prices. There has been a
reduction of 47% in 2012 over what was collected in 2011.

45.     The SLRA now contracts out all its civil works operations, and also intends to
pilot the performance-based contracting to increase the roles of the private sector.
Furthermore, the functions of feeder roads maintenance have been transferred to the
Districts, while SLRA supports building capacity at that level. The relationship between
Maintenance Services Unit (MSU) and SRLA was redefined according to commercial
principles and the backlog of payments due to the MSU was cleared by SLRA. The
ultimate goal is to privatize the MSU and this is underway. Furthermore, a National Rural
Road Policy was adopted which addresses issues of feeder roads design standards and
ownership of feeder roads by District Councils, amongst others.

Outcome 2: SLPA: increase efficiency at the QE II Port and Freetown Airport.

46.     SLPA has improved its performance both in terms of effectiveness and
operational efficiency. Over the course of 2011, total TEUs handled at the Container
Terminal (CT) increased from 45,000 to 55,268 TEUs. The CT concession also provides
regular revenues from the port to the government for the first time ever.

47.     The SLAA management demonstrates substantially improved performance. Key
staff were trained in financial management, procurement, technical maintenance and
environmental management. A PPIAF study on Private Sector Partnership (PSP) options
for the airport, linked to the project, was completed. Subsequently, SLAA implemented
the recommendations of the study which included contracting airport security and
baggage handling to the private sector.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory
48.      The efficiency in achieving the PDO is Satisfactory in terms of economic
justification. An ex-ante cost benefit analysis was done at the appraisal stage for the
investments in the trunk roads. The ex-post analysis reevaluated the investments on the

                                           15
rehabilitation of these roads considering actual rehabilitation costs and traffic levels at the
close of the project. The ex-post Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) is slightly
higher than the ex-ante EIRR for Bo-Kenema and lower for Makeni-Matatoka but above
the 12 percent threshold confirming the economic justification of the investments (Table
1)

49.     The economic analysis at appraisal for the rehabilitation of the Makeni-Matotoka
and Bo-Kenema roads was conducted using the Highway Development and Management
(HDM-4) Model developed by the World Bank. The model simulates life cycle road
conditions and costs and provides economic decision criteria for multiple road design and
maintenance alternatives, based on a survey of road characteristics, traffic, agency and
user costs. The analysis compared the incremental benefits and the investment costs
resulting from the variation in vehicle operating costs between the ‘with’ and the
‘without’ project case. The traffic on Makeni-Matotoka and Bo-Kenema at appraisal was
848 and 610 Vehicles per Day (VDP) respectively. The costs estimate were
US$109,000/km for the Makeni-Matotoka (37km) and US$103,000/km for the Bo-
Kenema road (69 km). The resulting ex-ante Economic Rate of Return (ERR) estimated
was 19.7 and 28.7 percent for the roads respectively.

50.      The ex-post economic analysis was done also using the HDM-4 model and the
same basic assumptions defined at appraisal, using current road user costs, traffic and
taking into account actual rehabilitation costs. The current traffic on the roads is 6,834
vpd on the Makeni-Matotoka road and 5,292 vpd on the Bo-Kenema road, which
represent a substantial increase in traffic since 2004. The actual rehabilitation cost was
US$500,000 per km for both roads, which is higher than the appraisal estimates. The ex-
post EIRR calculated for the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is 17.1 percent
for the Makeni-Matotoka road and 20.4 percent for the Bo-Kenema road. The increase in
project costs was compensated by the increase in traffic, maintaining the good economic
justification of the project. The comparison of IERR at appraisal and after the project is in
table 3 below, while further details are given in Annex 4.

                      Table 3: IERR at Appraisal and Completion
Road                              IERR % at appraisal            IERR % at completion
Bo-Kenema (69km)                  19.2                           20.4
Makeni-Matotoka (37km)            28.7                           17.1

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

51.     Given that the project is rated as having high relevance, substantial efficacy and
satisfactory efficiency, the overall rating is assessed as satisfactory. The project met its
physical targets for the trunk roads, and substantially met its institutional reform
objectives. The summary of the assessment is provided in Table 4 below.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

52.      There was no study on poverty impacts or gender aspects undertaken during the
preparation of the project. However, the project facilitated the provision of social services
and economic opportunities, created temporary jobs in construction, reduced transport
costs and travel time, increased revenues to the general budget and supported economic
activities in Sierra Leone. For instance, there

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.    The three Authorities that were co-signers of the Development Grant Agreement
are now transformed institutions, with improved thinking of management and senior staff
on business processes. Notable progress was achieved in: (i) implementing cost effective
design standards on rural roads; (ii) strengthening government’s capacity, notably NCP
and SLPA, to undertake PPP transactions; and (iii) rebuilding technical capacity through
learning by doing and training for technical and managerial staff at the three IAs and the
MOT.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

54.     There were no noticeable, long lasting negative impacts and on the positive side,
at least three practices from the project, namely, cost effective design standards,
concession of the CT, and rehabilitated roads have received wide recognition by road
users and the public at large. The project has set the stage for a wider discussion and the
possible implementation of different contractual modalities extending the participation of
the private sector in the transport sector.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

This is a Core ICR and does not require a Beneficiary Survey or Stakeholder Workshop.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
Rating: High

55.    The overall risk to development outcomes is rated high despite the tangible
progress in infrastructural improvement on the roads, ports and airport, as well as the

                                             17
reforms at SLRA and SLPA. The government needs to continue to show commitment
and ownership of the reform process in order not to jeopardize the sustainability of the
success recorded under the project. GoSL is to ensure that the fuel levy is gradually
increased to meet road maintenance requirements. The road funds ensure sustainability of
road investment by guaranteeing availability of funds for regular road maintenance.
Although the RMFA is fully established, it faces operational challenges and therefore
requires technical support and capacity development to improve management and
relationship with stakeholders. The government should ensure commitment to the process
of making the Freetown port to ‘landlord’ status. Furthermore, the commercialization of
activities at the airport should be sustained transparently.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

56.      The Bank performance during project entry was moderately satisfactory. The high
quality analysis under the earlier financed Bank Project, TSP, was used to prioritize
investment activities supportive of the CAS and the Government PRSP. These were
packaged for ease of implementation to achieve the project objectives. The engineering
design for civil works in the roads, port and airport sub-components were substantially
completed, but the bidding documents were not ready at appraisal or effectiveness.
Consequently, the assumptions for providing estimates for these works in the appraisal
documents proved to underestimate significantly the market prices and environmental
risk. Furthermore, the criteria for selection of rural roads were reached at appraisal, but
the list of roads and standards of construction was not agreed; this took significant time to
resolve during implementation. Overall the Bank performance at ensuring quality at entry
was Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

57.     The quality of implementation support missions is assessed as Satisfactory. The
project implementation support team was constructive in addressing issues that were not
resolved during project preparation. The aide memoires were meticulously done and
appropriately summarized their findings, while flagging issues to senior Government
officials and Bank management. It should be noted that the Team showed adequate
management skills at handling conflicts and resistance to changes regarding the reform of
SLRA and SLPA.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
58.    The ICR rates the overall Bank performance as Moderately Satisfactory given the
Moderately Satisfactory quality at entry and Satisfactory quality of supervision. The
project design was relevant and most preparation aspects were carried out in a
professional manner, with moderate shortcomings. The Bank was very responsive at
                                             18
every stage of the project, despite the fragile state of Sierra Leone, a country just coming
out of civil unrest. The project concept was very good and met the needs of the country.
The supervision team was very proactive to bring back the project on track leading up to
and after the Mid-term review. Nonetheless, the inability to conclude the bidding
documents for civil works, non-identification of feeder roads under the project and non-
availability of standards for feeder roads contributed to delays where the project closing
date was extended by 24 months. Furthermore, the Bank could not agree with
government targets on some of the indicators which made it difficult to measure
performance. In addition, the revision of the results framework done in 2011, 5 years
after effectiveness could have been done much earlier. All these justify the Bank
performance rating of Moderately Satisfactorily.

(b) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.     The GoSL commitment was Moderately Satisfactory. The project required
fundamental reforms in road and port sub-sectors at a time of uncertain political and
economic environment. These reforms took place because the Government succeeded at
rallying support for their ambitious reform agenda through the Government Agenda for
Change (2007-2012). Yet, the port reform remained stalled in Parliament and the
legislative adoption could not be completed before project closure. The Government did
not succeed at increasing the fuel levy and judged that the political environment was not
favorable to this measure.

(b) Performance of Implementing Agencies (CMU, SLRA, SLPA, SLAA)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.    The performance of implementing agencies varied, depending if a reorganization
of the agency was planned. For instance, activities for SLAA did not involve
reorganization and performed well although it was challenged for identifying the right
contractors. Whereas, for SLRA and SLPA, their reorganization required considerable
dialogue between the Bank Implementation Support Team, the government and CMU. It
took significant time and efforts to convince top management and senior staff of the
implication of the planned reforms. Lastly, and as mentioned before, all implementing
agencies were weak in reporting and monitoring progress.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned

61.    Institutional reform takes time and the Bank should continue to be patient
with institution undergoing reform process, especially fragile states like Sierra
Leone. Institutional building should be conceived as a progressive undertaking that
needs to be nurtured. Institutional reform consists of change in attitude and always meets
with resistance. It took considerable efforts to get the Bills necessary to create the new

                                            19
institutions. The processing of getting the reform bill through parliament took a long
time. Following parliament’s approval, the low capacity in the country made it difficult to
operationalize the new agencies. All these should have been factored in at the project
preparation stage. The M&E capacity in the implementing Agencies is key to adequate
monitoring of results. The capacity to collect and monitor project performance indicators
was weak at the IAs.

62.     The M&E capacity in the implementing Agencies is key to adequate
monitoring of results. The capacity to collect and monitor project performance indicator
was weak at the IAs. It took effort to reconfirm data collection on indicators, and
sometimes it was challenging to get the IAs to monitor these indicators. Building capacity
for M&E should start at project preparation, Furthermore, the baseline data should be a
priority that if not available before project effectiveness, should be mandatory for
collection in the first year of project implementation.

63.     Procurement was the weak link in project implementation. The procurement
process remained a significant challenge and delayed project implementation. Preparing
Terms of Reference, bidding documents, evaluating and awarding contracts are a specific
skills set. The development of such skilled manpower requires special attention if
projects are to be completed within reasonable time in Sierra Leone.

64.     When commitment meets political reality. The fuel levy surcharge was one of
the key covenants GoSL committed to, as part of the Bank grant. In a post-crisis political-
economic environment, Governments may find it necessary, indeed imperative to retreat
on policy reforms where commitments were made. Indeed, such retreats may be vital to
securing stability and to advance when the political economy permits. In such conditions
the Bank may need to re-consider the political economic climate which determines the
policies to advance at any given time in its relationship with Government.

65.    Quality at Entry (QEA) is an important step ensuring project
implementation readiness. The civil works bidding documents at SLRA, SLPA and
SLAA were not ready at project appraisal. It took considerable time to complete the
design of the civil works, thus considerable time was lost. This could have been identified
at QEA and the delay could have been averted.

                               Annex 3. Economic Analysis

1.      Introduction. An ex-post economic evaluation was carried out for the two core
roads (Makeni-Matotoka and Bo-Kenema roads) rehabilitated under the project using
HDM-4. These two roads were rehabilitated with the aim to deliver significant benefits to
economic activities and improve people’s quality of life in Sierra Leone. It is however
difficult to quantify all accrued benefits resulting from road investment and therefore is
not captured in the analysis. Nonetheless, travel time and cost of journey are expected to
reduce substantially in the project areas.

2.      Although the impact of road investment on socio-economic developments is not
straight forward to estimate, the cost-benefit analysis was applied to evaluate the
Economic Rate of Return (EIRR) for the two roads. The impact of road investments can
be measured in terms of direct benefits, indirect benefits, and induced benefits. Direct
benefits are the direct positive impact on the road users such as savings in vehicle
operating costs (VOCs), travel time savings, reduced accident costs due to the upgrade of
the roads, and possible savings in road maintenance costs. These are quantifiable usually
and can be expressed in monetary terms, making it easier to establish them to a good
degree of accuracy. On the other hand, the indirect benefits refer to those benefits that do
not impact directly on the road user and have a wider impact. These include employment
opportunities that are related to road investments. Induced benefits refer to those benefits
that can be attributed to local economic development as a result of road investments.
These include enhanced self-sufficiency, improved access to markets for agriculture
produce, improved access to social services such as healthcare and educational facilities
among others.

Road Infrastructure Investment

3.      Economic and Financial Analysis. The economic analysis was completed for the
two roads separately – Makeni-Matotoka (37 Km) and Bo-Kenema (69 Km) roads. The
costs of the roads were US$7.54 million and US$12.3 million respectively.

4.       Demand analysis. A 7-day traffic count surveys was conducted separately along
the two roads in 2013 and the average was calculated to obtain an annual average daily
traffic (AADT) figures. The AADT for Makeni-Matotoka road was 6,834 vehicles per
day (vpd), while the AADT for Bo-Kenema road was 5,292 vpd. The traffic volume by
type of vehicle is presented in Table 1 below. The assumed average growth rates used for
the analysis are - three percent for cars, 4.5 percent for other non-articulated vehicles, and
five percent for trucks similar to the figures used previously.

5.     User Benefits. The quantification of road user benefits was computed on the basis
of savings in travel time and vehicle operating cost, increase in frequency of the road
usage; provide access to the road areas. The economic benefits obtained in the analysis
represent the low-end of total realizable benefits.

6.      Cost. The unit costs for individual intervention strategies were provided into the
highway design and maintenance model (HDM) to perform economic analysis for the
defined road work options. The various costs and prices obtained were computed in both
financial and economic terms. While financial costs were composed of current market
prices, taxes and duties; economic costs represented the real cost to the economy of the
resources actually used in providing the materials and services.

7.      Economic Analysis. The economic analysis was carried out so as to help in
evaluating the benefits of improving the roads under the Infrastructure Development
Project (IDP). The road condition data, the appropriate unit costs for rehabilitation and
maintenance operations, and the appropriate costs for vehicle operation parameters were
fed into the HDM program to determine the economic returns of investments on each of
the roads. The analysis period was carried out using a discount rate of 12 percent.

8.      The HDM program was used to calculate economic rate of return (IERR) for each
of the road works as indicated in table 2 below.

Port Infrastructure Investment

9.     Although there was no economic analysis before and after the project for the
investments at the port, the benefits resulting from the investments are enormous. The
paved container stacking area was expanded while specialized Navigation Aids
equipment was installed at the port among others. Since after the investment, the
container handling operations and bulk handling capacity has improved while there has
been savings in ship turn around at the port.

Airport Infrastructure Investment

10.     The investment at the Freetown International airport was not subjected to an
economic analysis. There was no economic analysis during appraisal. The investment at
the airport included rehabilitation of taxi-way and turning loop, new automatic landing
and ground/air communications systems, training of aviation personnel among others.
The investment has paid off because the airport is certified by ICAO having met the
safety and security international standards.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR

A. Context

1.      At the time of IDP design, Sierra Leone was in the process of completing the post
conflict emergency phase program and had developed its first full Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) (December 2004). The PRSP had three pillars: (i) promoting good
governance, security and peace; (ii) promoting pro-poor sustained growth for food
security and job creation; and (iii) promoting human development. The Pro-poor growth
strategy (pillar 2 of PRSP, the basis of the project) focused on putting to use under-
utilized capacity in the agricultural and mining sectors, expansion in manufacturing and
service sectors and rehabilitation and maintenance of essential infrastructure, which were
recognized as the essential enabling environment for all the remaining sectors. Growth in
agriculture was and is strongly oriented towards accessibility to food security, markets
and development. These developments were also expected to address the need for
generation of employment. The roads in fair and good conditions were at less than 25.9
percent of the primary roads. There was urgency for SLRA through support of
development partners to bring the core and feeder road networks up to minimum standard
and under programmed periodic and routine maintenance with funds from fuel levy to be
managed by an independent road fund agency. There were also urgent demands to for
investments and institutional reforms in the port and air transport sub-sectors.

B. Original Project Development Objectives

2.      The overarching objective of the PDO was to rehabilitate selected priority roads,
port and air facilities of Sierra Leone, and to support the regulatory and institutional
reform and effective management of Sierra Leone’s roads, port and airports sectors. The
original Project Development Objective (as per DGA) remained unchanged throughout
the Project's implementation period.
C. Assessment of Outcomes

3.       The project was highly relevant to the country’s development objectives, global
priorities and the Country Assistance Strategies. The Project was also highly relevant for
the Joint Assistance Strategy for Sierra Leone (JAS, 2010 to 2013), prepared jointly by
the Africa Development Bank Group (AfDB), the World Bank and International Finance
Corporation.

4.      Achievements of all three PDOs of IDA were substantial. Completion of the
rehabilitation of 100 percent of the planned 106 km primary roads contributed to the
overall increased of the quality of the road network. With additional roads rehabilitated
with the support of other development partners, the share of roads in good and fair
condition of total paved road network increased to 90 percent compared to 25.9 percent
in 2010. Second generation road maintenance fund was created and became functional.

5.    Port break-bulk ships handling increased from 850 tons/day to 2,029 ton/day or
139 percent increase. Container handling capacity /productivity/ increased from

                                           32
64TEUs/day to 238TEUs/day or 272 percent increase. These are substantial achievement
considering that at the same time staff of SLPA had decreased from 1,552 to 680
employees

6.       The country now attracts airline services from different regions of the world.
Seven Airlines have regular flight to and from Freetown and the country has direct fight
to over 12 countries in two continents. For 2011, about 99,181 passengers had entered the
country of which 53 percent or 52,442 were tourists/visitors. In 2012 results in tourist
overnight stay was 418,110 showing that improvement of the airport has boosted the
tourist industry.

D. Efficiency (need the information from SLRA)

7.     The IERRs for the two rehabilitated primary roads Bo-Kenema road (69km) and
Makeni-Matotoka road (37km) were assessed twice, at appraisal and after cost escalation
increased the bid prices from the appraisal estimate by US$8.69 million. In both cases the
IERs estimates were found to be robust. At appraisal, IERRs were 28.7 percent and 19.2
percent and were reappraised to be 27.4 percent and 16.1 percent. Final appraisal was
20.4 percent and 17.1 percent respectively for the two road sections.

E. Impacts

8.      The global objectives of poverty reduction, food security, employment generation
and gender participation were met. Better access to market their produce to the nearest
urban centers and were able to bring farm inputs and other products to their homestead
easily. A total of 987,631man-days were created in all the civil works activities in which
people were employed and of which 37 percent were female. The institutional impact was
also positive. Each institution is now more compact and better organized than at the start
of the project. Perhaps the most important achievement of the project is the project’s
transformational impact on the management and staff of SLRA, SLPA and SLAA. Staff
is now more likely to embrace changes. Now, Road funds are more streamlined. SLPA,
having shed its significant redundant labor force and have improved its surplus from
operation and container terminal concession. It is making steady progress to make
Freetown Port a landlord port. SLAA is now making significant contribution to the
tourist industry of Sierra Leone and is looking forward to expand the scope of its
operation through public-private arrangement.

F. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

9.      The risk to development outcome is overall modest. This assessment is based on
the capabilities attained by the three institutions--SLRA, SLPA and SLAA. Under IDP,
these institutions were strengthened through (a) reorganization; (b) changes in attitude of
staff on the role of private sector as means of achieving effective infrastructure
management; (c) adoption of sustainable polices with enhanced revenue sources; and (d)
training of senior and top management.


                                            33
G. Bank Performance

10.    Overall, Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory. The project
implementation support team remained constructive in addressing issues that were not
resolved during project preparations. The reform outcomes at the two institutions- SLRA
and SLPA required management skills at handling conflicts and resistance to changes and
commitment to objectives with extraordinary patience, which the staff provided.

H. Government Performance

11.     The Government of Sierra Leone commitment was satisfactory. The project
required undertaking fundamental reforms in the way the transport sector is to operate at
a time when the political and economic environment risks were assessed by the Bank as
substantial. Through the Government Agenda for Change (2007-2012), the Government
created the climate for the reforms to succeed including changes of top management
where necessary, while fully cognizant that the inevitable insecurity that come with
change for people that has seen tumults changes for nearly a decade. Practically all the
objectives of the project are achieved and where there were short fall it was not at all for
lack of commitment but due to time needed to create the conditions under which lasting
reforms could be made. Time lost for election also contributed to delays in
implementation. The Government’s retreated on the fuel levy. However, this was a
temporary retreat necessary until favorable condition is created to increase the fuel levy
that safeguard programmed regular periodic and routine maintenance.

I. Lessons Learned

12.     Reducing the time to complete the project life cycle-The Government of Sierra
Leone’s PRSP or Agenda for Prosperity (2013-2018) shares the World Bank strategic
objectives of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. It would be useful
to remind ourselves that one of the lessons of IDP could have valuable lesson for the
World Bank’s strategic goals of end extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.
In principle, projects serve as development instruments of transforming inputs into
outputs and subsequently into outcomes and benefits to the targeted population. The
outcome of each project could contribute incremental value to economic growth, equity
or transform institutions to operate at higher productivity or chart new paths of
transformation. The shorter the time necessary to complete the project cycle the greater
the impact on rate of economic growth or equity and the shorter the time needed to end of
poverty with stability. The longer the time to complete a project life cycle the smaller
would be the project’s impact on growth and equity. In the case of IDP it took 98 months
from identification to completion and end warranty period for Bo-Kenema road (69km)
and 95 months and for Makeni-Matotoka road (37km). A breakdown of the project life
cycle by activities shows that the actual construction periods to the total project lifecycle
(identification to completion of warranty period) was 24.2 percent and 26.5 percent
respectively. Clearly, there is a case to be made to find out which of the activities in the
project cycle were contributing to 75.8 percent and 77.5 percent of these road sections.
Clearly, there is need to work out methods to shorten the time of the project life cycle.

                                             34
The same would apply to achieving institutional reform and capacity building type
projects.

13.    Procurement the weak-link in the project implementation-When examining
the implementation experience of Sierra Leone IDP, navigating procurement process
remained a significant challenge. Preparing TOR, bid documents, evaluating and
awarding contract are skills that need mastering. The development of such skilled
manpower at country level requires special attention if projects are to be completed
within reasonable time.

14.     Relationship of investment and reform in a single project-In designing
projects one can focus (i) primarily on investment to create growth; (ii) combine
investment and reform to create both growth and enhance productivity; or (iii) prepare
reform to enhance institutional capacity in a separate project. The preferred way of
packaging a development project depends on the specific circumstance of the country in
question. Reforms to be effective require considerable time for institutional and attitude
changes to take place; while project designed to stimulate economic growth such as
infrastructure could take less time. The choice which project to design would depend both
on the urgency of the issues to be address and also on the balance of forces in the political
economy of the country. Under IDP, the jury is out whether packaging both reforms and
investments in the same project was a wise decision given that roads were urgently
needed to impact agriculture growth.

15.     When commitment meets political reality-The fuel levy surcharge was one of
the key covenants GOSL committed to, as part of the Bank grant/credit. In a post-crisis
political-economy environment, Governments may find it necessary, indeed imperative to
retreat on earlier policy reforms commitments. Indeed, such retreats may be vital to
securing stability and to advance when the political economy situation permits. In such
conditions, Bank may need to re-consider the changing political economy climate and
advise governments which policies/conditionality to suspend in advance in the interest of
sustainable development.

Annex 8. Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR

                   MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT AND AVIATION

1       Sierra Leone as a post conflict country suffered from severe economic contraction
and destruction of transport infrastructure during the period of the civil conflict.
Following the start of government efforts to restore peace and economic boom, they
redirected the World Bank and other Donor programs towards emergency reconstruction
of the road network and restoration of port and airport operations.

2.     As the Ministry supervising most of the agencies of the road, port and aviation
modes of transport, we want to state that the intervention by your institution was timely
and the project was able to achieve the project development objectives with its design
outcome being achieved. This is because a sound background analysis and project design
was done at the project identification stage.

3.     In totality the project was able to provide satisfactory level of implementation and
quality supervision. As the project implementation support team was proactive and
constructive in addressing issues that were not envisaged during project preparations.

4.     There is currently efficiency in the management of the agencies that implemented
the project. All of which can be attributed to the different capacity building programs
provided under the project. Due to this, the following stands as primary benefits by the
beneficiary institutions and the country as a whole:

   i.      Under the road component: there is now improved management efficiency and
           productivity, reduced travelling time and cost, Improved accessibility and
           mobility to social services and even reduction in repairs to vehicles that ply
           reconstructed roads. We now have a road maintenance fund in place that
           manages the collection and maintenance of roads in the Country. Though
           operationalizing the fund administration and the SLRA still remains a
           challenge for effective budgeting and maintenance of road assets.

   ii.     Under the Port component: there is now improved container handling and
           turn- around time at the port. Improved break-bulk handling and staff
           retrenched to an acceptable level.

   iii.     Under the Airport component: the Airport is now in compliance with ICAO
           mandatory standard and the investment has helped the authority to minimize
           safety risks associated with physical infrastructure and we can now boast of a
           new navigational aids that ensures safe landing of planes and two stand-by
           diesel electric power generators of 650KVA and 800 KVA each. There is also
           improved management efficiency in operating the installed equipment due to
           the manufacturing training that was provided.




                                            36
5.      As always, all projects do have challenges that are generic to them. The
Infrastructure Development Project is not an exception. Therefore, the following are
lessons learnt during implementation:
   i.   Procurement challenges: The procurement of works and goods was a significant
        challenge that delayed project implementation. As it took considerable efforts and
        time to engage a procurement specialist to support the project’s contract
        management. Preparation of TOR, bidding documents, evaluating and awarding
        contracts especially for the feeder roads sub-component were delayed due to
        inadequate capacity to carry out these functions. The development of such skilled
        manpower require special attention if projects are to be completed within
        reasonable time in Sierra Leone.

 ii.    Rating of project tied to submission of audit reports by implementing agencies
        separately. The reporting design that was used we believe was in good faith but
        this later brought challenges in getting the various agencies to comply with the
        reporting deadlines. Given that the CMU was on top of disbursement and
        financial management and had always submitted reports on time; it was unfair to
        tag periodic project rating to audit reports of the SLRA, SLPA and SLAA who
        were not directly involved in the disbursement of funds. It will be necessary to
        limit audit reporting to the disbursing unit or authority with such fiduciary
        responsibility.

 iii.   There was also a challenge in settling the dispute between SLAA and Contractors
        for the rehabilitation of the run way and widening of turning loops. It was later
        noticed that the contractors were very experienced and played around the
        Authority on certain contract issues. This later ended in an arbitration process but
        was later resolved. So, we have now learnt that experienced contractors require
        rigid and thorough terms of contract.

 iv.    Relationship of investment and reform in a single project. Given that reforms
        require institutional changes which strongly depend on both the urgency of the
        issues to be addressed and also on the balance of forces in the political economy
        of the country. Under the IDP, it became a challenge to bring to reality the
        required reforms within the project life. Though most of the intended reforms
        were achieved, but they faced a lot of challenges. So investments and reforms in
        the same project was a wise decision but all these should have been factored at
        project preparation stage given that roads were urgently needed to stir growth.

6.      The fuel levy was one of the key covenants the GOSL committed itself to as part
of the Bank grant. But in a post-crisis political-economy, ruling Governments finds it
difficult to retreat on policy reforms commitments made by previous Governments.
Because such retreats may be vital to securing political stability and economic growth;
the fuel levy was unable to be increased to the threshold in the Financing agreement. It is
vital that the Bank thoroughly asses the political and economic climate before it can
advance such commitments at any time in its relationship with Government

Annex 9. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

                                  European Union (EU)

1. The report on a whole is clear and explicit. It is also clear that the interventions at the
   time were very pertinent to the developmental strides of the country as indicated in
   the GoSL Agenda for Prosperity and aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy.
   Even though as the duration and activities progresses the need for amendment,
   reallocation of funds and redefinition of the indicators became necessary, these
   amendments/ readjustments seem to be well thought-through considering the
   situations at the particular point in time.

2. The small snag with the Road Agency in redefining indicators correlate with the view
   point we also have about the agency regarding their pace in performing some
   rudimentary tasks. We at the EU had been supporting this institution in building its
   management capacity for over a decade and there seem to be room for further
   improvement.

3. Extension of project duration is another common occurrence now for various reasons
   but we are still committed towards impressing upon our partners to endeavour to
   work within timeframes.

4. We truly hope that the establishment of the independent Road Maintenance Fund
   Administration being functional now would improve the maintenance of the roads as
   we have contributed significantly to the road sector in the country primarily in
   rehabilitating and reconstruction.

5. The shortfall of having formulating the project and the relatively long time before
   commencement of work activities is a valid lesson to be learnt because though the
   escalation in costs was astonishingly high, up to 80%in your case, it was similar
   scenario of cost escalation with regards to engineer's estimate for our 'rehabilitation of
   650 Km of feeder roads in four district' project.

6. In all, apart from the International Airport where the water and electricity supply was
   left out, it seems that the restructuring and reallocation contributed towards achieving,
   to some extent, the objectives of the project. The results are good and the benefits
   even though economic analyses were not done for all; the direct benefits as in the
   case of the port are good. The management and support activities including trainings
   and workshops and reduction in staff cost and number would provide these
   institutions with means to continue to be efficient and above all sustainable.

7. The factors that affected the Implementation and outcomes are well noted and they
   could help us in designing, formulating and implementing our own as well as your
   new projects for optimum benefits and smoother implementation.
