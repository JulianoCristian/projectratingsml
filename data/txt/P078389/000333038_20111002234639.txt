                                   Restructuring Paper



A. Summary
1.      This Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director to restructure
the Sierra Leone Infrastructure Development Project (SL-IDP) (Original Grant Number
H191-SL; Additional Grant Number H405-SL; and Additional Grant Number 4469-SL).
The proposed restructuring includes: (i) the reallocation of grant and credit proceeds
across categories; (ii) an 18-month extension of the original closing date from September
30, 2011 to March 31, 2013; (iii) the revision and fine-tuning of the results framework,
and (iv) cancellation of Project activities.

2.      The proposed restructuring will help complete ongoing activities and implement
remaining activities, which are critical for the attainment of the project development
objectives (PDOs), as per the attached letter from the Government of Sierra Leone
(GoSL).


B. Project Status
3.      The SL-IDP was approved on June 12, 2005 with a grant amount of Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) 30,400,000 and became effective on May 19, 2006. An additional
Grant and an Additional Credit in the amounts of SDR 3.2 million and SDR 3.7 million
respectively, were approved on June 19, 2008, and became effective on November 14,
2008, bringing total International Development Association (IDA) financing for the
Project to SDR 37.3 million. As of September 9, disbursements have reached about 73
percent of the total proceeds. Meanwhile, commitments stand at 84.6 percent of total
project funds, with another about ten percent expected to be committed by December
2011.

4.      After an initial slow start, the project has picked up significantly since the mid-
term review in April 2009. This is seen in the progress on implementation of the activities
under the various components. Project achievements thus far include: (i) signing of the
Concession Agreement between the government of Sierra Leone and Bollore Africa
Logistics for the container terminal operation on November 25, 2010, and handover of
the terminal to the concessionaire, Freetown Terminals Limited (FTL) on March 1, 2011;
(ii) completion of the negotiations for the license of the break bulk operations at the port;
(iii) completion of the rehabilitation and strengthening of the Lungi Airport runway on
April 14, 2011; (iv) successful completion of the rehabilitation of the Makeni-Matotoka
and Bo-Kenema Highways and handover of both roads to GoSL by the contractor; and
                                             1
(v) separation of the Road Maintenance Fund from the Sierra Leone Road Authority and
establishment of the Independent Road Maintenance Fund under the Ministry of Finance.

5.       The main outstanding activity is the improvement of feeder roads in the four
districts of Bonthe, Kono, Koinadugu and Kailahun (estimated at US$6.7 million
equivalent in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)). The designs and the bid
documents for feeder roads works are currently being finalized under the oversight of the
Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA). The remaining main activities which are under
implementation are: (i) the installation and commissioning of the Navigational Aids and
Communications Equipment for the Airport (US$3.4 million equivalent), and (ii) supply
and installation of the navigational aids at the sea port. The procurement processes for the
ancillary civil works (estimated at US$2.18 million) and the environment reception
facilities (estimated at US$250,000) have also been completed and contract signature is
pending finalization of the reallocation; capacity building and training activities are also
ongoing.

6.     The ratings for Project Implementation Performance and achievement of
Development Objectives are satisfactory, as documented in the last archived
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) dated September 13, 2011. The project
development objectives continue to be achievable and will be further supported by the
proposed re-allocation of project funds.

7.     Furthermore, overall safeguards compliance is satisfactory and there are no
unresolved legal or safeguard issues. The existing financial management procedures and
guidelines for the Project will remain unchanged in substance, based on the continuing
adequacy and reliance of the financial management systems for the project (staffing,
budgeting, accounting, internal controls, financial reporting and audit arrangements),
having met the minimum requirement for Financial Management under OP/BP10.02.
There are no outstanding audit reports and the interim unaudited financial reports have
met fiduciary compliance. The proposed restructuring will have the same disbursement
categories as the original project. Monitoring of expenditures will continue to be done
through approval and monitoring of implementation of Annual Work Plans (procedure in
place during the original project will continue during the extended period).


C. Proposed Changes

8.     Results indicators: are summarized in Annex 1: Results Framework and
Monitoring. Although the PDO remains unchanged, the results framework is being
revised to include mandatory core sector indicators and refine the wording of the
monitoring indicators.

9.     Cancelled Activities. The proposed changes include a change in the funding for
the following activities within Component C: Freetown International Airport
Rehabilitation and Airport Management Support: (i) water supply system and (ii) power
supply system. The bid price for the civil works at the airport was substantially higher
than the engineer’s estimate and the Client chose to re-scope the works included in the

                                             2
contract. The water supply and power supply systems at Lungi International Airport have
been supported under government funded projects and are no longer part of the funding
under this Project. Indeed, the piped water supply system at Lungi has already been
expanded by the Sierra Leone Water Company (SALWACO) with dedicated supply lines
for the airport. The paving of the container area at the port has been included in the
terminal development activities of the Concessionaire for the Container Terminal and is
funded by the Concessionaire, Freetown Terminals Limited. The Concession was part of
the institutional reforms supported by the project.

10.       Financing

      •   The current allocation of proceeds is as shown in Annex 2, Table 1 and the
          proposed changes in the project costs by components and reallocation of proceeds
          between categories of expenditures are presented in Annex 2, Table 2. Funds from
          savings on the civil works under the roads (on main roads) and airport
          components are being reallocated to areas with shortfalls, mainly civil works and
          consultant services for SLPA, and goods and consultant services for SLAA. There
          are some savings on the training component as training related to operation of the
          navigational aids, at both the airport and port, has been incorporated in the supply
          and installation of these contracts with SLPA and SLAA.

      •   The restructured project includes increased allocations for expenditures (local and
          foreign) to finance: (i) cost overrun in works under Component B-SLPA
          Reorganization and Freetown Port Infrastructure Development; (ii) cost overrun
          for the supply, installation, testing and commissioning of the navigational aids
          and communications equipment under Component C-Freetown International
          Airport Rehabilitation and Airport Management Support; (iii) cost overruns for
          consultants’ services for Components B and C mentioned above; and (iv)
          consultant services and operating costs of the Coordination and Monitoring Unit
          (CMU) under Component D- Project Coordination.

11.   Closing date: This is the first extension of the original closing date of the Project.
While most project activities have been completed, others are being implemented or
remain to be implemented, as detailed in paragraph 5 of this paper. To allow for
completion of the ongoing activities and rehabilitation of the feeder roads, the
government has requested an 18 month extension of the project closing date. It is
recommended that the project closing date be extended from September 30, 2011, to
March 31, 2013.

12.      Implementation schedule: The implementation schedule will be revised to
reflect the extended project closing date of March 31, 2013.
