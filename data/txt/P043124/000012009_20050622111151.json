Lessons are\n            addressed as follows. During project preparation, it is\n            suggested to avoid ambitious development objectives, and\n            inappropriate key performance indicators, particularly, in\n            post-conflict, and ongoing border dispute situations, rather\n            a realistic and modest approach should be followed, through\n            a Project design, built on solid economic and sector work\n            (ESW). This project suffered from a lack of analytical work\n            in the country. Thus, some health sector analyses,\n            particularly on the status of the country's primary and\n            secondary health care, would have helped the project\n            preparation significantly. During project implementation,\n            Project activities succeeded due to key factors, namely, a\n            government highly committed to the project, strong\n            leadership in the Ministry of Health (MOH), a capable and\n            motivated implementing agency, and, the Bank's\n            commitment to country ownership and willingness to help\n            during supervision. However, it was a missed opportunity\n            that during the Project's Mid-Term Review (MTR), the\n            project design problems were not corrected. Lessons\n            regarding Hospital construction indicate that once tender\n            documents for civil works have been finalized, and contracts\n            agreed, changes should only be made if absolutely necessary,\n            by duly and carefully scrutinizing tender documents."}, "docdt": "2005-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
