The\n            project's components strengthen health care services by\n            1) increasing access by building, equipping, and staffing\n            referral hospitals; and by providing equipment, furniture,\n            essential drugs and vaccines, training providers, improving\n            management, and developing national blood bank services; and\n            2) building capacity, improving sectoral planning and\n            management, and the financial sustainability of health\n            programs through training, study tours, pilot interventions,\n            and testing of local level mechanisms to raise, retain, and\n            use additional revenues for health services; and improve\n            project management and implementation."}, "docdt": "1997-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
