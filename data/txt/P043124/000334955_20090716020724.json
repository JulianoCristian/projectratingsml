Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: in post-conflict settings engagement is a\n            means to an end and needs to be accompanied by a sustained\n            policy dialogue to ensure that development gains are\n            realized in the medium term. In the area of HIV/AIDS a\n            demand-driven model of community sub-projects is more\n            appropriate for service delivery interventions that are\n            responsive to local community needs (such as home-based\n            care, support to orphans and vulnerable children) than for\n            preventive interventions targeting stigmatized risk groups\n            or stigmatized behavior. Community activities that are\n            strategically planned and coordinated with the local health\n            authorities can provide an important complement to health\n            facility-based disease control efforts. Disease control\n            projects can be complementary to and need not undermine\n            cross-cutting health system functions. Multi-sector\n            projects, such as HIV/AIDS projects, achieve better results\n            if the sectors involved are strategically chosen according\n            to their comparative advantage in disease prevention and control."}, "docdt": "2009-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
