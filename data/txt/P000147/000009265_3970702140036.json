and overgrazed\n            traditional rangelands.  Specifically, it will: (a) support\n            the Government's long-range land tenure reforms; (b)\n            increase commercial livestock production and improve its\n            efficiency; (c) promote equity through developing assistance\n            programs for small- and medium-scale cattle-holders; (d)\n            encourage improved herd management and range conservation.\n            It will, moreover, strengthen institutions responsible for\n            both livestock development and wildlife management.  These\n            objectives will be achieved through provision of credit and\n            skilled management for the establishment of commercial\n            ranches by individuals and groups according to national\n            policy guidelines.  In addition, they will be met by\n            far-reaching reform of the system of land-use planning and\n            management; upgrading of trek routes; and technical\n            assistance for institutional coordination, training and\n            extension, project management, range ecology, and analysis\n            of pricing, cost-recovery and taxation policy."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
