       construction of a dual-purpose pulp and paper mill with the\n            capacity to produce 100,000 tons per year (tpy) of newsprint\n            or 80,000 tpy of printing and writing paper (or any\n            combination thereof) from bagasse, a by-product of sugar\n            production. Benefits to be gained include the alleviation of\n            India's shortage of newsprint through the introduction\n            of a new technology utilizing a readily-available raw\n            material. The risk of using a new technology would be\n            minimized by the fact that the mill could easily be\n            converted to the production of 80,000 tpy of printing and\n            writing paper from bagasse by a commercially proven process.\n            The risk of an inadequate coal supply would be minimized by\n            the securing of alternative fuels."}, "docdt": "1981-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
