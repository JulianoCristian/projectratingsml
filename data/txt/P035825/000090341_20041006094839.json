The\n            lessons learned indicate that a close link between health\n            system improvements, policy and institutional reforms on one\n            hand, and achieving desired health outcomes on the other\n            hand, should be better reflected in project design and be\n            monitored accordingly. Regular policy dialogue to address\n            the problem of low public financing for the health sector is\n            extremely important. It is important to sharpen focus of the\n            public sector on service priorities in terms of both\n            resources and management. Facilitate development and more\n            engagement of private health sector in delivery of health\n            care to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is\n            necessary. The commitment of the government and the\n            political will for the support of the health project/sector\n            and the reforms played a vital role in the project's\n            achievements. Measuring and monitoring performance is\n            critical for management decisions and to ensure high impact\n            of project activities on the health sector. Development\n            objectives should be clearly defined and measurable. Another\n            lesson learnt is the need to have properly trained financial\n            management staff in place right from the beginning of the\n            project to ensure full financial accountability and adequate follow-up."}, "docdt": "2004-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
