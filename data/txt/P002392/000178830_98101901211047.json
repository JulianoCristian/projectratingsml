It would\n            provide extension and other farmer services, including seed\n            multiplication farm, vehicles and equipment, and improved\n            production, through short and medium-term loans, of 6,000\n            acres of inland swamp rice, 25,000 acres of upland rice and\n            10,000 acres of groundnuts. It would investigate the\n            potential of livestock development in the Northern Province,\n            and would research methods of increasing wood fuel for\n            future expansion of tobacco production. For the Eastern\n            Province, the project would construct 12 market centers,\n            additional staff houses, stores, and offices. In conjunction\n            with improved farmer services it would provide short, medium\n            and long-term credit to increase the production of 1,800\n            acres of inland swamp rice and 36,000 acres of upland rice;\n            would develop 4,200 acres of inland swamp for rice\n            production; and establish 1,000 acres of cocoa and 1,600\n            acres of smallholder oil palm.
