ARTICLE III
Execution of the Project
and other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) Subject to Sub-section (b) of this Section, Articles III and
IV of the Development Credit Agreement are incorporated in, and made a part
of, this Agreement, provided that the terms "Association" and "Credit" whenever
employed in such sections shall be deemed to be references, respectively to the
Bank and the Loan.
(b)   The obligations of the Borrower to consult with and to furnish, or
cause to be furnished, information, documents, plans, reports, records and
statements to the Bank shall be satisfied to the extent performance in respect
of such obligations is rendered to the Association, provided the Development Credit
Agreement shall not have terminated prior to the termination of this Agreement.
The obligations of the Bank to consult with and furnish information to the
Borrower shall be satisfied to the extent such obligations are fulfilled by the
Association.
(c)   So long as any part of the Credit is outstanding, all actions taken,
including approvals given, by the Association pursuant to the Development Credit
Agreement shall be deemed to be taken or given in the name and on behalf of
both the Association and the Bank.
Section 3.02. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making loans to, or with
the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in normal circumstances, special security
from the member concerned but to ensure that no other external debt shall have
priority over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of foreign
exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such member. To that end,
if any lien shall be created on any public assets (as hereinafter defined), as security
for any external debt, which will or might result in a priority for the benefit
of the creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization or distribution
of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso
facto and at no cost to the Bank, equally and ratably secure the principal of,
and interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in creating or
permitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision to that effect;
provided, however, that, if for any constitutional or other legal reason such
provision cannot be made with respect to any lien created on assets of any of
its political or administrative subdivisions, the Borrower shall promptly and at no
cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other charges on, the
Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.


﻿7
(b)   The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any lien created on
property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely as security for payment of the
purchase price of such property; and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course
of banking transactions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after
its date.
(c)   As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means assets of the
Borrower, of any political or administrative subdivision thereof and of any entity
owned or controlled by, or operating for the account or benefit of, the Borrower
or any such subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange assets held by
any institution performing the functions of a central bank or exchange stabilization
fund, or similar functions, for the Borrower.
