INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
NORTHERN AREA PROJECT
The Project Area
A. Description
1.        Geography.  The project area lies between latitudes 8035' and 9020'
North and longitudes 11°45' and 12030' West and comprises the chiefdoms of
Paki Masabong, Bombali Sebora, Makari Gbanti, Gbendembu Gowahun, Safroko
Limba, Sanda Tenraran and Gbanti Kamaranka in Bombali district and Kholifa
in Tobkolili district, amounting to 854,000 acres or 1,334 square miles.
2.        Topographically, there are two major zones: the gently undulating
bolilands at 150' to 250' a.s.l. and comprising 40% of the area; and the
moderately undulating uplands, 200' to 500' a.s.l. extending from the boli-
lands to the escarpment of the north eastern plateau. There are occasional
outliers to the plateaux of inselbergs which rise to around 600' individually
and to around 1,500' in the case of the Katabai hills. Two major rivers,
the Mabole and the Rokel, drain from the plateau and flow through the area
in a south westerly direction. The capital town of Northern Province is Makeni
which lies south center of the project area.
3.        Climate.  The annual rainfall, based on a 32 year average of records
taken at Makeni, is 120.8 inches of which 114.2 falls from May through
November and 6.6 inches from December through April (see Table 1). Rainfall
decreases slightly to the north and north-east, whilst the dry season also
becomes more marked. A notable feature of the dry season is the harmattan -
an intensely drying wind which blows periodically from the Sahara desert
during January and February, accompanied by slight but noticeable falls in
temperature. Over the year, however, temperature fluctuates very little,
varying between a mean of 78'F in August and 83°F in March/April. Hours
of sunshine decrease slightly as one moves from north to south, and the
number of sunshine hours per day declines during the rains to an August low
of around two to three hours, and a February high of seven to eight hours.
Mean day length varies little throughout the year.
4.        Soils.  Geologically, the area comprises the Rokel river series,
which underlies the bolilands, and the granite and acid gneisses which
account for the major part of the project area. Soils are mainly sands and
gravels with a high proportion of lateritic gravel, and are light and free
draining. They are acid to very acid (pH 4.0-6.0) with an associated low
nutrient status. There is a small area of doleritic soil to the north of
the project area.



Volume 2
Annex 1
Page 2
5.        In terms of land use, the main soil types distinguished are uplands,
inland swamps, river terraces and the bolilands. The upland soils are
generally deeply leached of bases and support growth by decomposition of
organic matter. Under natural vegetation, nutrient levels are restored by
litter feed, rain wash, and by uptake of tree roots from mineral soil at con-
siderable depth. Swamp soils are naturally similar to those of the adjacent
uplands, but vary greatly in overall depth and depth of top soil. Top soils
are mainly sandy loams or sandy clay loams tending to dark peaty loams in
the wetter parts, the predominance of the latter being determined by the
water regime of the swamp. Few swamps have a high clay component in the
top soil, and the subsoils are likewise of a coarse sandy texture, overlying
base rocks of weathered granite which in places are visible or near to the
surface. In composition, the river terrace soils have good physical charac-
teristics and a relatively high inherent fertility. The land, however, is
severely invaded by lalang grass (Imperata cylindrica) which is difficult
to control and impedes cultivation. The soils of the bolilands, which cover
over 40% of the project area, are strongly acid (pH 5.0-4.0), of low clay
and high sand content, and low inherent fertility. The bolilands, which
are the principal areas of attention of the provincial agricultural admin-
istration and depend heavily on the services of the government mechanical
cultivation unit, are not included in the first phase development proposals
of the prcject.
6.        Vegetation.  The project area has two distinct ecological zones;
in the south the dense farm bush of the interior plains; and in the north
the derived savannah where the bush is very much more open and grassland
associations of Andropogan and Chasmopodium are more common. The main
species of tree found in the farm bush are Parkia biglobosa, Parinari Excelsa,
Elaeis guineensis, Antiaris africana, and Chlorophora regia. These species,
together with Bauhinia and instrusions of Lophira are also typical of the
savannah area whilst grass lands occur in the bolilands and in some previously
intensively cultivated areas.
7.        Population.  The rural population of the project area is estimated
at 172,000 persons, using the 1963 population census figures and compounding
the estimated growth rate for the area of 1.8%. Of these an estimated 18%
(31,000) are settled in the bolilands. Most of the population is concentrated
along the existing road network in small nucleated villages of 10 to 50
houses. Analysis of the population structure reveals clearly that the pro-
ject is a temporary migration zone which young men leave between the ages
of 15-20 and to which they begin to return after the age of 30. As the
diamond industry declines, and following the levying of a poll tax in
Freetown, and the attraction of development incentives during project im-
plementation, it is expected that population will increase by 2.75% per
annum from 1974 through 1979 to a total of 197,000 persons.
8.        Farm families within the project area are large, comprising ex-
tended family members usually living in a single large hut. A German
Development Institute (GDI) sample survey in the project area, which defined



Volume 2
Annex 1
Page 3
farm household as a unit formed of all persons, related or not, who lived
with a farmer who was responsible for feeding them; found an average size
of 12.2 persons (2.5 men, 2.7 women, 5.2 children and 1.8 other dependents).
On this basis, roughly 14,000 farmers are contained in the project area of
which 1,500 are farming in the bolilands.
9.        There are four major ethnic groups in the project area out of 18
in Sierra Leone:
The Temne:      the largest group who are concentrated in the
central and southern areas.
The Foulah:    the second largest group who are pastoralist and
concentrated mainly in the derived savannah areas
of the central uplands.
The Limba:      who dominate the northern eastern part of the area.
The Loko:       who are concentrated to the north and west of Makeni
Township.
In addition, there are smaller and more dispersed settlements of Mende,
Susu and Mandingo.
10.       The administrative structure of the area is significant because
of the strength and influence of the traditional authority. The project
area comprises 8 chiefdoms administrated by Paramount Chiefs and Chiefdom
Councillors. Each Chiefdom is divided into sections (headed by Section
Chiefs) which are further subdivided into towns and villages (headed
respectively by Town and Village Chiefs). The traditional authority remains
the main political and governing force of the area and it is important that
project administration is integrated within the traditional structure and
that local leaders are intimately involved in the planning process.
11.       Communications. A paved truck road linking Makeni to Freetown has
recently been constructed to a high standard, with overhead pedestrian
walkways, under German technical and financial assistance. The trunk road
south of Makeni to Magburaka is currently being upgraded to the same standard.
A spine road runs north from Makeni through Gbendembu to the Guinea border,
and has feeder road links with important population centers. Due to in-
adequate maintenance and drainage, surface standards are moderate to poor,
but there is a good network of bridges and generally excellent soil for road
surfacing, so that renovation and upgrading do not present major problems.
12.       Services.  Water supplies are generally unsatisfactory in terms of
quality and accessibility. Though some small towns have reticulated supplies
installed by government, a bulk of the rural population have to rely on
streams and wells, many of which are both seasonal and contaminated. During



Volume 2
Annex 1
Page 4
the dry season, villagers often make long hauls for water, and there is a
high incidence of stomach sickness. Simple well installations would have
a significant social and economic impact.
13.       Marketing.  There is an active private sector food crop marketing
system facilitated by a number of municipal markets in the larger centers.
Rice is the staple food grain but per capita consumption appears to be below
the national average and cassava, sweet potato, beans, and groundnuts figure
importantly in the diet. Palm kernel is the most important conventional
cash crop, although some coffee is marketed in Magburaka and Makeni. There
are a large number of small rice mills in Makeni, mostly powered by electric-
ity, the intermittent supply of which prevents the effects of excess capacity
being felt, and possibly even contributes to consumer exploitation through
increased milling costs.
B. Agriculture
14.       Farming Systems.  Upland agriculture in the project area is dominated
by a system of shifting cultivation in which cleared land is cropped for
1 to 2 years and then allowed to revert to a bush fallow of 5 to 10 years.
The bush fallow not only maintains soil structure and restores fertility,
but also reduces weed growth and provides a valuable source of firewood for
villagers. The cycle commences with brushing, clearing and burning of
vegetative cover. Trees are felled at 1 to 2 feet above ground level and
the binding effect of the stumps on the soil, coupled with minimal culti-
vation, reduces erosion risk and allows rapid regrowth under bush fallow
with a root system capable of drawing on mineral resources from considerable
depth. Except where weeds have invaded the land prior to planting, hardly
any preparatory tillage is undertaken though, at planting time, any shoots
springing from the stumps are cut back. Upland rice is planted during the
first cropping year usually with admixtures of other crops such as maize,
sorghum, benniseed, cowpeas and millet. Where land is cropped for a second
year, groundnuts is the dominant crop and is often interplanted with cassava.
Under present dry conditions, shifting cultivation has come under strain
from lncreasing population pressure and a corresponding decrease in the
duration of bush fallow. In addition, the labor demand to annually clear
new areas Lor the upland crops probably constitutes over 50% of the annual
labor output and has major implications on farm productivity.
15.       With rising population pressure on the uplands there has been an
increasing trend towards inland swamp cultivation. As a result, most upland
farmers also cultivate swamp land and an increasing number depend solely on
the swamp land for their livelihood. In order to reduce pressure of culti-
vation on the uplands, swamp development, until recently, received official



Volume 2
Annex 1
Page 5
encouragement from MANR which provided grants to farmers for clearing,
stumping, and constructing water control measures. However, while most
swamps in the area (80%) have been cleared and brought into part cultivation
at some time, effective water control measures are rarely applied and the
rice crop may be subjected to flooding, drying out and heavy weed infestation.
16.       Farm Operations.  The sequence of operations in the farming year
are expressed diagramatically in Table 2. Upland work commences with brush-
ing during February and March and is aimed at having a maximum amount of well
dried vegetation ready to be burned prior to the rains to ensure a layer of
surface ash. After burning, a field hut is usually built which serves as
a temporary dwelling for the family during the growing season. Planting
commences during May, and only after completion of upland planting will
farmers attend the swamp land cultivation.
17.       Swamps are usually tilled in May-June in preparation for rice
planting. An increasing use is made of the soil mounding system which
involves mounding up the swamp at the end of the dry season and spreading
the mounds just prior to transplanting in July. This serves two purposes:
(a) the mounds are used for growing cassava for its leaves and (b) it
assists in reducing weeds in the subsequent rice crop. Seedbeds for trans-
planted rice are sown in June, mostly in well prepared areas around the
villages but increasingly also, on the tops of the soil mounds in the swamp.
Seedlings are transplanted when they are anything from 20 to 60 days old.
Local seed varieties have durations between 170-200 days so that harvesting
is carried out in December and January. The threshing operation tends to
be spread out as subsistence and cash needs require.
18.       There is some divisions of labor by sex, with men doing the heavier
work such as brushing and clearing the uplands, and digging the swamp lands.
Women are concerned with the lighter farm work such as weeding and harvesting
(in which they may be assisted by the men). Children also assist with the
lighter farm work and have the special task of bird scaring when crops are
ripening. An important system of communal labor operates in both the uplands
and the swamp areas. Such labor groups are concerned primarily with the
heavier farm operations and families contribute one person to the group which
circulates in strict rotation around the participants' holdings. Non-
participating families may hire communal labor groups for cash payment with
food provided. The groups operate as efficient labor units which is reflected
in their hire charges which are around (food included) Le 1.00-1.50 per head
per day. Details of the labor capacity of the average farm family in the
project area are given in Table 3.
19.       Pests and Diseases.  A major problem for upland and swamp farmers
is caused by the rodent Agouti or Thryonomys swinderianus, locally known as
cutting grass. Farmers spend a great deal of time erecting palm leaf fences
around swamps to protect their crops, but as yet no really effective method
of control has been devised. Birds, the weaver bird (Ploseuscouculatus) in
particular, are probably responsible for as much loss of crop or even more



Volume 2
Annex 1
Page 6
than rodents. The only control measure effective to any extent is by employ-
ing bird scarers, an operation which makes considerable demands on family
labor from flowering to harvest. Damage can be particularly severe on out of
season crops.
2C.       By far the most important fungal disease is Blast (caused by
Pyricularia oryzae), which affects seedlings (Scorch) and the inflorescence,
although the former occurs more frequently and on occasion can cause severe
damage to nurseries. Local varieties do not appear to be particularly
susceptible but in introducing improved varieties, particular attention
needs to be paid to their Blast resistance. Other fungal diseases such as
Sheath Blight (Corticium), Leaf Scald (Rhyncosporium oryzae), and Brown
Spot (Cochliobolus miyabeanus) occur, but are not considered important.
Serious damage by insects is unusual in Sierra Leone. Stemborers (Sesamia
calamistis) (Chilospecies), Maliarpha seperatella and Siopsis thoracica are
generally recognized as the worst pests, and army worms (Spodoptera exempta
and Spodoptera exigua) occur sporadiacally, but are not yet recognized as
being a serious problem. White tip nematode (Aphalenchoides besseyi), which
had not been recorded before 1965 in Sierra Leone, has recently shown a
marked increase in level of infestation.
21.       Farm Size.  In a recent small sample survey 1/ in the project area,
the proportion of farmers involved in upland and swamp cultivation was as
follows:
23.5% farming swampland only;
55% farming uplands and swamps; and
21.5% farming uplands only.
Total area cultivated per family varies greatly according to family size and
soil fertility, but averages 5 to 6 acres per annum followed by a fallow
period of around 6 years which is considered inadequate to allow complete
restoration of soil fertility. While there has been a steady increase in
swamp farming over the years this has tended to follow, rather than anti-
cipate, marked degradation of vegetation and decline in soil fertility in
the uplands. Swamp holdings vary from 1-5 acres according to dependence
on the swamp as a means of subsistence. Outside of the swamp areas, most
farmers maintain small areas of land under some form of permanent cropping.
These areas are generally of more fertile soils and are located around
houses and on the shoulders of swamps and water courses. Obervation in
the project area suggests that 6.5% of the cultivable uplands and bottomlands
are so cropped, averaging 1 acre per farm family.

only 100 families.

22.       Land Tenure.  Land tenure within the project area is complicated
both by differences between ethnic groups and by evolutionary trends directly
and indirectly resulting from increased land pressure. While it is unlikely
that land tenure problems could significantly affect project actions, their
relevance to long-term development objectives will need to be carefully
assessed during project implementation.
23.       There are three important aspects in the land tenure system
ownership, usufruct and occupation. Land is owned by the community as a
whole and responsibility for primary allocation is ultimately vested in the
paramount chief. Once land has been allocated, either directly to individuals
or indirectly through consanguine groups, the usufruct is both retainable
and inheritable for as long as it is claimed. Actual occupation of the
land is more intrinsic and difficult to formalize, comprises those with land
title and those who have acquired land from title holders. The latter
aquisition is generally short term 1/ and uninheritable, and while it is
referred to locally as "begged-land", it is normally accompanied by cash
or kind transactions.
24.       Superimposed on this somewhat simplified structure are authoritarian
differences between ethnic groups (for example, in the Temne lands, individual
rights tend to dominate the communal rights vested in the chief, whereas
the reverse is true among the Limba people) and trends within ethnic groups.
Thus, in a largely polygomous society facing a situation of increasing land
pressure it is obvious that strict division of land between heirs would cause
extreme fragmentation. There is therefore a tendency for land title to
be inherited by a single heir of the late owner leading to evolutionary
combinations of individual and group rights. This is further influenced by
a local practice of land holders pledging the security of usufruct of their
land in order to obtain cash loans. The usufruct is enjoyed by the pledgee
as an interest and continues for as long as the loan remains outstanding. The
almost constant cycle of debt surrounding many farmers in the area results
in land title accumulating in the hands of the more prosperous community
members with a corresponding rise in the predominance of "begged land." In
the context of the project, these aspects of land rights are of greatest
significance to swamp development both from the stand point of tenure security
in relation to long-term development loans and from the stand point of water
rights within the developed swamp. While these problems must be recognized
at the outset, it is important that any tenurial arrangements are allowed to
evolve from the community itself. Such evolution will be encouraged during
the project through a group approach to swamp development, and through active
participation of the traditional authority in the planning process.
1/   In the case of swamp lands acquisitions of this sort can extend for
many years. On the uplands, occupancy is limited to the duration of
the cropping cycle (1 to 2 years).

25.       Crop Production.  Existing crop yields are subject to great
speculation in Sierra Leone, and it is unfortunate that the surveys and trials
that have been conducted in the area, and indeed in the country as a whole,
are sufficiently controversial as to render the entire production base of
the project dependent almost wholly on 'guesstimates'. These controversies
were reviewed during project preparation and include both errors of intention
as well as errors of design and collection. The findings of the recently
published Agricultural Statistical Survey (conducted during 1970/71) and
analyzed by districts likewise reported crop yields which bore little re-
semblance to the mission's observations. In part this is explained by the
statistical variance of the Survey data (sampling errors for Bombali and
Tonkolili districts were among the highest in the country) and by relating
data collected throughout a rather heterogeneous sampling frame to a dis-
crete area within that frame (the project area occupies about 40% of Bombali
district, and 10% of Tonkolili district). In addition, certain techniques
used in the survey could have had a significant effect on the yields re-
corded. Yield measurements were obtained by crop cuttings using insufficiently
accurate weighing scales in relation to the size of plot harvested. This
could lead to an upward bias on average yields (due to a tendency to round
upwards rather than downwards) as well as constituting a source of variance
not wholly included in the calculations of sampling error.
26.       The crop yields given below are based on observation, a critical
appraisal of existing yield data for the area, and the results of discusssions
with farmers. 1/ It should be stressed, however, that while speculation re-
mains regarding existing crop yield levels, project benefits, being based
on incremental production, are uneffected in an absolute sense.

estimated at 207,000 head of which the majority are found in the north
eastern highlands. Cattle population within the project area is unknown,
but almost certainly below 15,000 head, concentrated mainly in the hillier

areas. The cattle owners are predominantly Foulah most of whom are nomadic
or semi-nomadic and with whom cattle ownership has deep rooted social im-
plications. All cattle are of the Ndama breed which is hardy, disease
tolerant (particularly of trypanosomiasis) and generally well suited to
prevailing conditions. Productivity, however, is low due to various factors
among which are low calving rates and high calf mortality (production from
100 cows often being as low as 40 weened calves). The genetic potential
of the breed is also low with slaughter stock, sold usually between 5 and 7
years, rarely exceeding 600 lbs liveweight. Production of milk, which
produces a staple food for the Foulah people, is also low, lactation yiedls
being below 150 gallons.
28.       During the cropping season, herding is carefully supervised by
herd boys and cattle are night housed in fenced enclosures (waries) to avoid
damage to growing crops. During the dry season, when food is scarce and
there is less likelihood of crop damage, the herd is allowed to graze more
extensively. Dry season grazing, low genetic potential, the nomadic practice
of the Foulah, and a marked antagonism between crop and livestock farmers
are the more serious problems facing livestock development. Sierra Leone
FAO Survey in 1967 indicated that over 60% of slaughtered animals are ex-
ported on the hoof. Smallstock production is likewise poorly developed.
Per capita meat consumption is low in comparison with most countries, but
fish is generally available and makes a more important contribution to the
supply of animal protein.

NORTHERN AREA PROJECT
Farm and Crop Development
A. Inland Valley Swamps
Background
1.        Inland valley swamps are a particular feature of the topography of
Sierra Leone and can occupy from between 2 to 10% of the total land in certain
areas. An inland valley swamp is defined as, "a seasonally inundated, flat
branching valley floor, lacking well defined or efficient natural drainage."
It lacks other riverine landforms being essentially a headwater feature, and
is generally covered with grasses and Rafia Palm. It Is a product of post
rejuvenation valley in-filling and impeded drainage. The soils are
'hydromorphic'.
2.        Traditionally farmers have relied on cultivating upland soils for
subsistence requirements, but during the last 15 years there has been an
increasing tendency to utilize swamps both for main crop rice and for partial-
ly irrigated out of season crops. Until recently, this was officially en-
couraged by MANR, which provided subsidies of up to Le 30.00 (US$37.50) per
acre to farmers who cleared, stumped, and applied water control measures
in the swamps. Isolated demonstrations of successful swamp development have
been set up by the Taiwanese and Peace Corps' Volunteers over the past six
years or so, but these have proved insufficient to encourage farmers as a
whole to develop swamps fully without the benefit of direct advice on layout,
construction, and close supervision. Notable exceptions to this are the
Tikonko Extension Center near Bo in Southern Province, and the Eastern Area
Project where technical advice and supervision have been provided with im-
pressive results.
3.        Owing primarily to population pressure on the uplands, around 85%
of the 1,300 swamps in the project area are cultivated to some extent at
present and few present major problem regarding tree clearing though most
require some additional stumping. Water control measures are, however,
virtually non-existent.
Rice Development
4.        Water Control.  Without water control there is little check on
weed growth, and hand weeding tends to be carried out only spasmodically
during the early stages of crop growth. Since the crop is mostly established
by broad casting, effective weed control is difficult to achieve.



Volume 2
Annex 2
Page 2
5.        Experience in the Eastern Area Project, and elsewhere in Sierra
Leone, has shown that effective water control is possible using a low
technology, labor intensive approach. The primary factors influencing swamp
planning are catchment, drainage lines and soils, since concentration of
water in drainage channels constructed in sandy soils could result in serious
soil erosion. In general, the swamp soils are lighter than those in the
Eastern Area Project, where most experience of swamp development has been
gained, and swamp gradients are generally steeper. As a result, most swamps
will require contour levelling (a'square' design is used at EAP) and greater
use will be made of grass floodways to avoid exposing the sandy subsoils.
Soil sampling along the center level of drainage channels will be an essential
prerequisite of swamp development.
6.        Flood water damage to bunds and distribution channels will be
highest at the beginning of the first rainy season after construction, before
the works have become grassed over. This can be kept to a minimum by ensur-
ing that spillways are cut in the header bunds (as is done in the Eastern
Area Project) and by arranging sand bags in the header sluice so that they
blow out when water pressure becomes too great. The stability of swamp
peripheral channels will, in a similar manner, be dependent on the material
through which the channels pass. Attempts to maximize the acreage developed
per swamp could force the peripheral channels into the sandy swamp margin
soils and this must be avoided. In situations where this is unavoidable,
grasses should be planted to hold the bunds together. Chewing cane has been
suggested as a suitable plant as it is much relished by 'cutting grass' and
may serve to reduce this rodents excursions into the swamp rice fields.
7.        Swamp planning and technical layout will be undertaken by trained
Land Use Planners of the Conservation and Land Development Services Section.
Actual implementation of soil and water conservation programs will, however,
be the responsibility of extension staff. Digging and bunding work will be
carried out by farmers in organized swamp development groups, to whom develop-
ment loans will be extended, repayable over 5 years at 8%. Estimated average
swamp development costs are given in Table 1.
8.        Varieties.  Varieties grown by farmers in the project area are
almost wholly local and unidentified. They are leafy, day length sensitive
and show limited responses to applications of fertilizer, but do not suffer
much damage from insects, nor fungal diseases. They are almost invariably
long-term varieties maturing in about 180 days or more. Improved seed is
generally in short supply in Sierra Leone and few varietal trials under farm
conditions have been carried out. This is particularly the case in the
northern area though isolated demonstration indicates that marked yield
increase would result.



Volume 2
Annex 2
Page 3
9.        Varieties recommended for inland swamps are BD2, IR20 and IR442;
supplies will initially be secured from the West African Rice Research
Station (WARRS), Rokupr and from the Eastern Area Project seed farms. A
seed farm will also be established under the Northern Area Project and will
supply seed from year 3 (1977).
10.       Fertilizers.  Few swamps receive fertilizer application due mainly
to a lack of distribution and credit facilities. Nutrient status of the
swamp soils is generally low, and the few trials that have been conducted
have shown good responses to nitrogen and phosphate. Potassium is not ex-
pected to be a limiting factor as large quantities are contained in the
seepage water from the uplands. Provisional recommendations, based on
calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and single superphosphate (SSP) are set at
44 lbs N and 33 lbs P205 per acre (1.5 bag of each). These, however, are
composite averages, and during project implementation adjustment will be
made both for soil nutrient levels and for managerial ability.
11.       Sprays.  Although insect damage is not currently recognized as
being economically important, it is expected to increase following general
intensification of rice production in a relatively confined area. Insecticide
and spraying costs have therefore been included on the assumption that 25%
of the crop will require spraying annually. Chemical weed control techniques
have been insufficiently evaluated to make general recommendations to farmers.
They will, however, be kept under review during project implementation.
Until the benefits of crop spraying are properly evaluated sprayers will
not be provided to farmers, and the project will, instead, operate a spraying
service for which a flat cash charge of 60 per acre will be made. Details
of the spraying service are given in Annex 4.
12.       Benefits.  The above technological improvements are expected to
result in an average yield increase of husk rice from the existing 1,200 lbs/
acre to 2,400 lbs/acre. A one acre budget for swamp rice is given in Table
2 and a one acre development cash flow is given in Table 3.
Rotational Crops
13.       There are few swamps in the area with sufficient year round water
to allow double rice cropping. Most cultivated swamps are dry by February
and are either uncropped during the dry season, or planted to a range of
vegetable crops of which the most important are cassava, maize, sweet
potato and groundnuts plus small individual areas of onions, beans, cowpeas,
tomatoes, garlic and chillies. The project will actively encourage intensified
vegetable production, particularly onions, through fertilizer use and improved
cultural practices. There is little information available, however, on exist-
ing and market potential is therefore unknown. Large quantities of onions
and tomato puree are imported (annually averaging around 5,000 and 2,500
tons respectively) but the scope for import substitution would be limited to



Volume 2
Annex 2
Page 4
a large extent by supply, seasonality, storage problems and consumer pre-
ferences. For the predominantly domestically produced and consumed crops,
the market is likely to be extremely sensitive to supply fluctuations though
there may be export potential for certain crops such as chillies. In view
of these uncertainties it is unrealistic to forecast production increases
from dry season crops. Project management will investigate market and
production potential during project implementation, and the revolving
credit fund would be able to provide dry season credit funds for those crops
that might be grown.
3. Upland Development
Background
14.       The upland farm is the traditional area of cultivation in Sierra
Leone and accounts for over 60% of natioanal rice production. However, this
prominent position in the agriculture sector has not been equalled by develop-
ment effort, for the very nature of upland farming and its deep-rooted im-
plications in the social life of the people poses formidable problems for
technological innovations. Against this background it is not surprising
that MANR extension effort has largely excluded the uplands. Nevertheless,
with increased pressure on land, declining fallow periods and a growing
deficit in domestic rice production, this important area cannot be ignored.
15.       Two categories of upland can be identified, namely the areas of
shifting cultivation and the areas that are permanently or semi-permanently
cropped. The latter are usually on inherently superior soils around the
village houses and on the shoulders of swamps and water courses, and cover
about 4% of the gross cultivable land. On this area, which is important
for groundnuts and vegetables, significant impacts from improved seed,
fertilizer application, and planned rotations are expected. The remaining
upland is under shifting cultivation. Although the problems of developing
this important area remain largely unresolved, it has the characteristic of
cccupying such a large acreage (around 70% of total cultivated land) that
marginal improvements in productivity per acre could have a significant
impact on overall national production.
Rice Production
16.       Varieties.  These are predominantly of the Oryza glaberrina mixed
types which are low yielding but relatively disease resistant, and preferred
for consumption to introduced varieties. Anethoda and CP4 are the currently
recommended improved varieties but are not commonly grown in the north.
Cther more promising varieties such as TX52.10.1 have, however, been pro-
duced and tested at WARRS, and recent trials in Liberia have demonstrated
that varieties such as TX52, LAC23 and IR442-2-58 are capable of high yields
under upland conditions.



Volume 2
Annex 2
Page 5
17.       Improved, dressed seed will be introduced to upland farmers through
a system of mass saturation whereby the project will exchange on a bushel
for bushel basis all seed supplies in selected villages. This will be followed
in successive years by replacement of seed by extension staff and redis-
tribution of second year seed among farmers (organized through village and
chiefdom committees) to allow complete seed replacement every five years.
Seed would be obtained initially from WARRS and the Eastern Area Project,
and from the project's own seed farm from year 3 onwards.
18.       Fertilizer.  Upland rice is commonly grown with mixtures of other
crops, and since few fertilizer trials have been conducted under upland
farm conditions the effect of applications on the entire crop mixture is
unknown. Moreover, nitrogen topdressing on steep slopes with high rainfall
intensity could prove ineffective and quite likely uneconomic in view of
current high prices. On the permanently cropped uplands, which are flatter
and where pure stand cultivation within a planned rotation would be en-
couraged, significant fertilizer responses are expected. Provisional re-
commendations based on CAN and SSP are set at 29 lbs N and 22 lbs P205 per
acre (a bag of each). These, however, are composite averages and during
project implementation adjustments will be made both for soil nutrient
levels and management ability.
19.       Benefits.  Improved seed, seed dressing and fertilizers (for
permanently cropped rice only) are expected to increase yields as follows:
Before Development After Development Increment
------------- lbs husk rice/acre -------------
Permanently Cropped        800                  1,800           1,000
Shifting Cultivation       500                    650             150
One acre budgets for upland rice under permanent and shifting cultivation
are given in Tables 4 and 5.
Groundnut Production
20.       Varieties.  The most common varieties grown are Marace, Kono and
Gambia which are short cycle Spanish types with non-dormant seeds. Although
isolated variety trials have been carried out they have been insufficient
to make general varietal recommendations and, in any case, have not been
supported by any systematic bulking and distribution of seed. However,
comparative trials, under IRHO supervision, have recently been started in
the project area, and include varieties adapted to conditions of low sun-
shine and long cycly Virginia types which may be suitable for dry season
harvesting. Successful varieties will also be tested for their acceptability
in the local diet and for their value as oil nuts. While unable to base
development projections on proven varietal improvements, it is realistic to
expect such improvements to materialize.



Volume 2
Annex 2
Page 6
21.       Improved seed (in shell) and seed dressing would be distributed by
mass saturation as for upland rice with complete replacement every five years.
Since yield increments are unproven, they are kept intentionally low and are
assumed to amount to 100 lbs of unshelled nuts/acre.
22.       Fertilizers.  Soils in the area are known to be acid and phosphate
Cdeficient and a small number of trials in the area have shown significant
individual and combined responses to phosphates and calcium. Phosphates,
through basal application at time of planting, are easier to handle under
upland conditions, and have been included for both permanent and shifting
cultivation. Provisional recommendations based on single superphosphate
(which may give rise to additional benefits from sulphur content) are set
at 22 lbs P205 per acre (a bag) for both land classes. It is assumed that
farmers will apply fertilizer to only 50% of the upland area under shifting
cultivation.
23.       Sprays.  Pests and diseases among groundnuts do not appear to be
important in the project area. Rosette diesease occurs but on a small scale,
and while Cercospora leaf spot is common, it occurs mainly on the mature
leaves when the crop is ready for harvesting and does not, therefore, appear
to have any significant effect on yields. Various fungi affect plants at
the seedling stage but the extent of damage is not known, and will in any
case by controlled by the use of seed dressing. Little is known about the
incidence of Aspergillus flavus although conditions at time of harvesting
would appear to be ideal for its development. Present rotational practices
are probably responsible for the low incidence of pests and diseases and
provided these are continued they are not expected to increase. Project
management will, however, pay particular attention to this during implement-
ation.
24.       Benefits.  Improved seed, seed dressing and fertilizers are ex-
pected to increase yields as follows:
Before          After
Development    Development   Increment
lbs unshelled nuts/acre ------
Plermanently Cropped
Seed and Fertilizer                    1,000           1,600          600

One acre budgets for these three land categories are given in Tables 6
through &.

Other Rotational Crops
25.       While direct project benefits have been included only for rice
and groundnuts, the project will be essentially concerned with the farm
system as a whole. This will be particularly the case with the upland
areas under permanent cultivation for which suitable rotations will be intro-
duced. This will be carried out in close association with the Rokel Leaf
Tobacco Company subsidiary of the Aureol Tobacco Company which is responsible
for tobacco development in the project area. Methods for preserving soil
structure and fertility in the uplands will be a particular area of attention
for project management.
C. Resource Evaluation
26.       Development Centers.  In terms of land and human resources the
project area is extremely variable, rendering average figures of doubtful
value for detailed planning. Basic physical information was, therefore,
refined by selecting 20 major population centers and cataloguing, in detail,
the resources contained within a radius of 3 miles of each. The three mile
radius, representing a gross area of about 18,000 acres, was chosen on the
basis that it defined an area over which an extension service could be
expected to operate efficiently and within which the distances involved would
not be prohibitive for farmer transport of agricultural inputs. It should
be stressed that this approach is essentially a planning technique and does
not infer that islands of development will be established. On the contrary,
it is anticipated that maximum farmer contact by the extension and land
planning services will tend to radiate from the centers in a manner dictated
primarily by population density and access.
27.       Development activity will be organized and controlled on a chiefdom
basis, and in this regard, certain circles have been truncated to avoid
crossing chiefdom boundaries. Their location is shown on the Map appended
to this report.
28.       Collectively, the centers cover about 50% of the gross land area
outside the bolilands and it is assumed that farmer contact and the develop-
ment programs proposed will be 100% effective within each center. (Any
actual shortfall being compensated by additional contacts outside the plan-
ning circles.)
29.       Within each development circle the area occupied by steep hills
and mountains was excluded along with an assumed 10% of gross area occupied
by rivers, roads and settlements. This gave a net cultivable upland area
of just over 200,000 acres. Swamps within each circle were also counted.
Previous surveys in the area have given estimates of average swamp size
varying from 15 acres to 7.6 acres. The largest estimated (15 acres) was



Volume 2
Annex 2
Page 8
derived from air photo interpretation and represents gross swamp area and
observations suggest that 40% of the gross area is unsuitable for swamp rice
development, leaving a net area of 6,000 acres.
30.       Estimates of farmer populations were made from taxpayer counts
using a conversion factor supplied by MANR planning unit. Rounded, this
gave a total of 8,000 farmers which, when applied to the gross useable uplanfd
area, gave an average of 26 gross acres. Table 9 lists the 20 development
centers and their associated land resources within a 3 mile radius.
31.       Based on survey information for the area, and aerial observations,
the following cultivated land areas are included for development:
Land Category                Crop                  Acres
Inland Swamp                 Rice                  6,000
Upland
Permanent                  Rice                  1,250
Permanent                  Groundnuts            2,500
Shifting                   Rice                 24,000
Shifting                   Groundnuts            8,000
Total               41,750
The proposed cropping program is given in Table 10, and production pro-
jections for rice and groundnuts are given in Tables 11 and 12.
32.       Conservation and Extension.  Erosion in the uplands is, as yet,
not serious 1/ due primarily to root preservation, minimum tillage and a high
proportion of lateritic pebbles in the soils. It is inevitable, however,
that as land pressures increase and fallow periods decrease a soil conserv-
ation protlem will result, and this is already evident in certain areas
where permanent upland cropping is practised. From the outset, land planning
and extension will be based on individual swamp catchments with simple
conservation measures applied to the permanently cropped areas (such as
storm cut-off drains and correct ridge alignment) and with cropping patterns
based on strict land use principals.
33.       Agricultural assistants, who would be based at development centers,
would be responsible for implementing land development plans prepared by the
Conservation and Land Development Services Sector.
1/   There are a few remarkable exceptions to this generalization.

34.       The project will investigate the potential for cattle development
in the northern area for which the major limitants are: the poor beef and
milk potential of the Ndama; trypanomiasis resistance in relation to
upgrading Ndama with other breeds; the long dry season and related nutri-
tional problems; and the land tenure system in connection with grazing
rights of pastoralists.
35.       The project will develop three fact finding cattle farms of about
1,000 acres each, and for which possible sites adjacent to perennial rivers
have been identified. In consultation and agreement with the chiefdom authori-
ties, the project will demarcate the ranch boundaries and select groups of
traditional cattle owners for ranch settlement with tenure acceptable to all
three parties. Finance will be provided for minimum infrastructure require-
ments, including boundary fencing and cattle handling facilities.
36.       The strategy behind the development of these ranches will be
simplicity and duplicity for the future. The ranches will be closely super-
vised by a project livestock specialist and will:
(a) determine productive potential of the pure Ndama under
improved management conditions including calving rates,
mortality, liveweight gain, and carcass quality:
(b) establish stocking capacities of natural pastures, and
identify simple methods of improved fodder production,
particularly during the dry season, from the associated
inland swamps;
(c) in association with veterinary staff at the project
veterinary station at Teko, identify the tsetse fly
and contingent trypanosomiasis problems associated
with the ranches and experiment with upgrading of
Ndama using imported semen of selected animals particularly
Sahiwal (a Zebu of high milk potential) on the ranches
and at Teko. The progency of such crosses will be held
under prophalaxis, the practicality of which will be
assessed; and
(d) assess the social and tenurial implication of any
potential development proposals.
37.       The Livestock Specialist will also determine the possibility of
stall-feeding, on a smallholder basis, using crop residues. This has been
successful in other parts of Africa, and suitable smallholders will be

selected and provided with unfinished steers, for supervised fattening
under farm conditions. In addition, assistance will be given to selected
villages, and particularly the town of Makeni, in those areas free of trypanoso-
miasis to establish small pig units. In all cases, the fattening systems will
be closely monitored and evaluated to determine their economic feasibility.
38.       The Livestock Specialist will assist the MANR Planning Unit in
formulating livestock development proposals in Sierra Leone, and it is hoped
that after three or four years, based on the findings of the project,
appropriate plans can be formulated for a national livestock development
program. Funds for the Livestock Specialists and two Livestock Assistants,
and for minimal development requirements of the three fact finding farms
are included under the Extension and Training Services Section of the project.
A small amount for unidentified credit (US$20,000 total) is included under
the project credit fund for the purchase of immature feeder cattle and breeding
pigs. A full assessment of the actual credit requirement for each potential
sub-borrower will be made by the Livestock Specialist during project im-
plementation.
F. Forestry Development
39.       Woodfuel for Tobacco Curin.  The need to consider a forestry
component for the project is based on the necessity of providing woodfuel
for curing tobacco. There are two methods of curing with different estimated
demands of woodfuel:
Fire-curing: 1-1/2 to 2 cords woodfuel per acre of tobacco pa
Flue-curing: 30 cords woodfuel per acre of tobacco pa
40.       Source of Woodfuel Suppljy.  There are two possible sources of
supply of woodfuel: from the farm bush cleared annually for cultivation;
or from plantations, either those already being grown on protected forests
in the area or from woodfuel plantations to be grown specially for this
ourpose. The requirement of woodfuel for fire-curing is so small that there
ls little doubt that it can be collected as required by the farmer from
cultivated areas at no cost other than labor time. The requirement of wood-
fuel for flue-curing is much larger and needs special consideration.
41.       Bush Woodfuel.  Woodfuel yields from the farm bush are not known
and need study: but have been suggested as being from 5 to 10 cords per
acre of 6 vear old farm bush. An individual farmer cultivating from 1/3
to 2/3 acre of tobacco could then obtain his woodfuel requirement from between
1 and 4 acres of farm bush if yields are as suggested above. However, the
organization of collecting all the woodfuel from the cultivated area would
be considerable in the absence of roads and, in any case, this woodfuel is
regarded as an important source of cash to the farmer throughout the year



Volume 2
Annex 2
Page 11
and especially in times when no other income is coming in, being sold in
small lots at roadside. Indications based on the current need to make special
arrangements to supply plantation grown woodfuel for the present experimental
scale flue-curing, are that it will not be possible to rely on the provision of
bush woodfuel and that special woodfuel plantations will have to be grown.
42.       Plantation Woodfuel.  There are some existing Forestry Division
plantations on protected forests in the project area and these can be used
as a source of supply. However, Gmelina is the main species grown and
is not altogether suitable for this purpose as it takes such a long time
to dry out and does not have a very high calorific value. Nevertheless
existing plantations will have to be used to supplement woodfuel supplies
from the farm bush until other arrangements can be made. Even yields from
Gmelina plantations are not known but may be about 20 cords per acre at age
7 and at this rate a 3-1/2 acre of Gmelina plantation should provide suf-
ficient woodfuel for 1/3 acre of flue-cured tobacco.
43.       Gmelina is not the best species for woodfuel but there is
virtually no evidence for the growth of alternative species such as Eucalyptus,
Teak and Cassia, all of which require research on their suitability, growth
and woodfuel production over a range of sites in the tobacco growing area,
before their planting could be recommended on other than an experimental
scale.
44.       Required Plantation Develypment Program.  The projected acreage
of flue-cured tobacco development totalling 375 acres by 1979 will require
11,250 cords of wood for curing in that year which could be obtained by
clearfelling about 560 acres of 7 year old Gmelina plantation. As this is
an annual woodfuel requirement a total plantation area of about 4,000 acres
would be necessary to provide a continuous woodfuel supply. Further develop-
ment of flue-cured tobacco over and above 375 acres would require a cor-
respondingly larger woodfuel plantation development program. The size of
the program and the timing of the tobacco development requires that the
most suitable fast growing high calorific value woodfuel species should be
grown so that the land area requirement, growing cost and volume of woodfuel
required can all be minimized. Until research provides information on the
most suitable woodfuel species to grow under project conditions, it is not
possible to lay down a plantation development program.
45.       Need for Research.  Immediate research by carrying out trials of
alternative woodfuel species, especailly Eucalyptus, is fully justified.
The urgent nature of this need is emphasized by the fact that there are
only about 750 acres of forest plantations within 15 miles of the likely
center of flue-cured tobacco growing in Paki Masabong chiefdom. The
research need is for an investigation of growth and woodfuel yields under
a range of site conditions for a) farm bush, b) Gmelina, c) Cassia, d) Teak
and e) a number of Eucalyptus species.

46.       Implementation of Research Program.  The work could not be under-
taken by the Forestry Division alone because of shortage of suitably ex-
perienced staff and shortage of financial and vehicle support. The work
needs to be undertaken by the project with the assistance of the Forestry
Division who should second some staff to the project for the limited periods
necessary. The Forestry Division is in a position to call on help from the
Tropical Silviculture Unit of the Commonwealth Forestry Institute at Oxford,
England who could give valuable assistance in selecting species to be tried
and in suggesting experimental design. The staff needs are one professional
forester with supporting staff (forest ranger, forest guard, nuerseryman,
driver and clerk/typist) for limited periods. The work should be undertaken
by the Division Forest Officer, Makeni and his staff under the direction of
the project research officer; making certain to liaise with the Forestry
Division research officer at Bambawo.
47.       Implementation of Plantation Development.  Ouite apart from deciding
which woodfuel species should be planted a decision needs to be made on the
organization required to carry out plantation development and on the setting
aside of land for this purpose. Plantations could be planted either indi-
vidually by the tobacco grower in the immediate vicinity of his curing barn
or by some central organization on land set aside by the chiefdom for the
purpose. There is much to be said for central plantations with a woodfuel
subsidy scheme repaid from the price obtained for cured leaf, provided plant-
ation blocks are kept quite small so that transport distances are not very
great. Major plantation development should be provided for in Phase II and
need not be considered for the initial part of the project. Nevertheless,
it would be wise to complete the planting up of Bombali Sebora and KMR
protected forests where there is a total of about 950 acres unplanted and
it is proposed provisionally that these areas should be planted to Gmelina
at the rate of 300 acres per year and be converted to some other crop as
soon as a better alternative is available. This could be done by the Forestry
Division for a cost of about Le 50 per acre or a total annual cost of Le
15,000. The project would provide funds Le 40,000 to enable an initial de-
velopment of a research and trial planting program. The funds (Vol. 2,
Annex 5, Table 1) would cover staff and labor requirements.

NORTHERN AREA PROJECT
Civil Works
Roads
1.        There is a good network of roads in the project area which connect
most of the important areas of settlement. Generally alignment is good and
although surface standards are moderate to poor this is largely due to in-
adequate camber and to poor drainage in low lying areas. Surfacing over
the formation width of the roads would seldom be required as the predominantly
lateritic soils are well capable of carrying the low volume of traffic that
is likely to use them. Existing small bridges are of a high standard of
construction with concrete decks and well founded mass concrete abutments.
2.        In addition to providing suitable road links between the 20 devel-
opment centers, the existing road network provides good radial links to
outlying areas within the sphere of influence of each center. This is of
particular importance in relation to swamp accessibility, and while not all
of the roads are motorable at present, their very existence, coupled with
the suitability of the soil for construction, means that parts of the net-
work can be upgraded to motorable standard as and when farmer response and
production development so justify it.
3.        In order to schedule road improvements on this basis, a small
construction unit has been included in the project which will upgrade and
maintain an estimated 280 miles of crop extraction roads during the 4 year
phase and construct 20 bridges and 900 pipe culverts and 20 miles of new
roads. Civil works by year of project development are shown in Table 1.
4.        The roads would be graded over an 18"-24" formation, center cambered
from 12"-18" side gullies with turnout drains. Construction would be under-
taken using a grader for shaping the existing formation; a bulldozer for
clearing, site preparation and for constructing turnout drains; and 2 tractor
drawn graders for road maintenance. A service truck is included for in field
maintenance, and repairs would be carried out at the Makeni Agricultural
Workshops. Unit operating costs for plant and vehicles are given in Table 2.
5.        Bridges would be concrete decked with spans of 30'-40', 10 ft deck
widths, concrete abutments and 450 wing walls. Surface level to stream
bed would vary between 5 and 10 feet. Culvert drainage would be provided



Volume 2
Annex 3
Page 2
for low-lying areas with an average of 3 per mile. To ensure year round
accessibility, embankments would be constructed to a minimum of 1.5 x culvert
diameter. Average unit costs for bridge and culvert construction are given
in Table 3.
6.        Water Supplies.  During the five-month dry season, water is scarce
or unpotable in many areas of the project. Long hauls for water are common
and the incidence of stomach sickness is high. In most areas, however,
there is an ample supply of groundwater within 25 feet of ground level
making it possible to sink improved wells at low cost.
7.        The project would assist in constructing 200 improved wells to be
sited in areas of production development. Construction would be undertaken
on a self-help basis and all excavation would be carried out by the villagers
themselves though the project would assist in pumping out the wells during
construction so that an adequate depth can be reached. The project would
also line and cap the wells and equip each with a hand-operated pump.
Estimated construction costs are given in Table 4.
House Construction
8.        There are sufficient local contractors in the Makeni area who
can adequately build the houses and offices required by the project; thus
apart from supervising contractors the project would not actively construct
buildings.
9.        Project building policy would be to rent where possible and only
build where determined essential. Thus some senior staff houses would be
built in Makeni, with other staff houses being rented. Warehouses and
project market centers would be constructed with project funds, but asso-
ciated staff houses in the villages would be rented.

INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
NORTHERN AREA PROJECT
Marketing and Farm Inputs
A. Marketing
1.        NAP is a deficiency area for rice:  estimates of present production
result in an average per capita availability of about 125 lb milled rice per
year, or about half of the national average. No detailed household survey:s
have been carried out on dietary makeup, and thus extent of the actual short-
fall in rice is unknown; however, there is an important flow of surpluses
from the Bolilands, through Makeni, where milling facilities and merchants
are concentrated. Milling efficiency is generally low, and capacity exces-
sive; however, most mills depend on electricity and the intermittent nature
of power supplies at least counterbalances the effects of this over-capacity,
to the possible detriment of consumers and the industry as a whole.
2.        Available information indicates that increased rice production
would be consumed within the project area rather than being moved out of it.
The greater part of presently marketed production is sold in February, shortly
after harvest (with repurchases probably starting around June), and this
pattern is unlikely to change significantly except that the amount of sales
made for credit repayment purposes may be reduced as a result of the less
onerous terms of project credit. The main effect of incremental production
on the market would probably be a volumetric change in present grain flows
due to the greater degree of self sufficiency attained by project farmers.
Kono seems to be the main outlet for the surpluses from the Bolilands which
are moved through Makeni, as well as for groundnuts from the project area,
and this market is likely to become increasingly important to farmers in
Makeni and Tonkolili Districts as a whole.
3.        There is very little factual information available concerning
consumer habits and preferences, such knowledge is basic to full understanding
of markets and marketing requirements and steps would be taken under the
projects to overcome this deficiency (Volume 1, Annex 3).
4.        There are few formalized aids to marketing in the project area.
The Rice Corporation maintains a depot at Makeni from which a mobile buying
team has recently started to operate, while SLPMB is represented only by
LBA. Some retail marketing facilities are provided by municipal authorities
and these are active centers of this level of trade.



Volume 2
Annex 4
Page 2
5.        To assist development of market infrastructure the project area
would be divided into five Market Areas administered from a Market Center;
development within these areas would be from a total of twenty Development
.enters.  (For details see Volume 1, Annex 2, Table 10).
6.        Covered storage would be erected at each Market Center and necessary
facilities provided for a statutory buying team handling all crops to which
guaranteed prices apply. A mobile buying team would operate throughout
the Market Area should quantities offered warrant it, or unsatisfactory
performance by LBA require intensification of official competition.
7.        Details of the function of the Market Centers and the relationship
of the project to national marketing policies may be found in Volume 1,
Annex 2(E).
B. Commercial Services
8.        Input Supplies.  The Commercial Services Section (CSS) would be
responsible for the distribution, storage and sale of recommended farm
inputs within the project area. The whole emphasis of CSS would be on
market penetration and thus input utilization. Ancillary to supply of
physical inputs would be that of credit; although initially both functions
would be combined within the one department, the aim would be to develop
each into commercially viable entities as quickly as possible, able to
operate alone or in association with similar organizations elsewhere in
the country. For this reason, overall supply and distribution of inputs
as well as determination of operational procedures would be the responsibility
of the Commercial Services Officer in PESU working through, and in conjunc-
tion with PMU.
9.        Diseconomies resulting from an initially low intensity of demand
would necessitate the cost of CSS being subsidized by government during the
development period. Nevertheless the whole approach would embody a strong
training element to allow eventual reduction of CSS staffing to a small
core of specialists.
10.       The greatest proportion of on cost in the farmgate price of an
input is a combination of product transportation and sales time per unit
sold. The operational and pricing policy would therefore be designed to
build up on the group approach of the Extension and Training Services Section,
with traditional structures and disciplines complementing, and in some cases
supplementing, activities of CSS staff.
11.       Sales Services would be provided in each market area through an
Area Salesman, operating from the Market Center, where office and storage
space would be provided. He would be assisted by a clerk/storekeeper. Area



Volume 2
Annex 4
Page 3
salesmen would be salaried staff but a performance stimulus would be applied
through a system of bonuses related to achieve sales.
12.       Sales Policy.  There is an average of about 140 swamps per Market
Area ranging from 70 in Kaimpo to 208 in Magburaka, while total annual
fertilizer requirement is expected to reach 1,500 tons in year 4. These
figures reinforce the need for group formation and the achievement of simi-
larly based sales. In this context the word "group" does not only mean
associations or numbers of farmers but also any individual demand that could
be large enough to improve the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions.
Encouragement would therefore be given to farmers to adopt the most economic
means for getting inputs onto their farms; these will differ with circumstances,
but the project would use a pricing policy designed to demonstrate benefits
of group buying as well as the effects of small units of sale on cost of
sales.
13.       An annual base price would be calculated for fertilizer (and other
necessary inputs--see Table 1). For fertilizer this price would be the basic
cash price for quantities of 1 ton and upwards, and would be common to all
Development Centers. It would be achieved through applying transport costs,
weighted to represent anticipated sales in each market area, to the gross
price (i.e., all overheads included) ex-Freetown.
14.       Discounts would be granted on fertilizer sold in not less than
lorry load lots (5 tons), ex Market Center. These would equal the calculated
cost to the project of delivering sucih fertilizer to DC at which the buyer is
registered. For those buyers wishing to take exact lorry load quantities
the CSS would agree to deliver fertilizer, at base price, to nearest point
of suitable access to buyers farm or swamp, any additional transport costs
incurred by the project over base costs being payable in cash. In both cases
an allowance would also be made for bookkeeping savings resulting from the
larger unit of sale.
15.       For quantities smaller than one ton (twenty bags) the price would
be basic plus ten percent. Seed would be sold at a standard price which
would include production costs and selling overheads, quantity discounts
would be available as for fertilizer, and a ten percent premium would be
payable on lots of 10 bags or less. Total annual sales of seed and fertilizer
are given in Tables 2 and 3.
16.       Credit.  Credit facilities would be available with terms depending
on the purpose of the required loan (i.e., seasonal or development). The
credit system would depend heavily on, and be linked with, the disciplines
of the Chiefdom Authorities, benefits and strengths of which have been
clearly demonstrated in the ongoing EAP. Such an approach would also mean
imposing new functions on a traditional structure and project staff would
provide necessary assistance and advice at chiefdom level.



Volume 2
Annex 4
Page 4
17.       After due consultation with the Chiefdom Authorities and farmers,
a Cred-t Advisory Committee (CAC) would be formed in each Development Area
to appraise the status and creditworthiness of applicants. The principle
of collective responsibility would obtain, and loans could only be made after
approval by the CAC. Although the Commercial Officer would be the final arbiter
concerning creditworthiness it is extremely unlikely that he would be able to
obtain better information than that available to the CAC with whose chairmen
he would in any case maintain a close liaison.
18.       Development credit would be available only to farmers opening up
or rehabilitating approved swamps. Payment would be retrospective and in
two installments. Repayment would be in equal amounts over five years, with
interest at 8% calculated on a declining balance basis, and averaged over
the period of the loan. Details of the content of the swamp development loan
are given in Annex 2, Table 1. Total development loan outlays are given in
Table 4 of this Annex.
19.       Seasonal credit would be in kind, and bear a flat rate of
ten percent. Repayment would be in cash within a period determined by the
nature of the crop for which credit was granted. For example, upland and
main crop swamp rice credit would be repayable by March 31 (harvest period
November-January). Estimated values of cash and credit sales for seeds and
fertilizer are given in Tables 2 and 3.
20.       Ready access to a realistic floor price for statutory crops should
minimize the need for additional short-term credit by those growers engaged
in recommended double cropping. However, cultivation demands of the second
crop could well delay threshing and marketing of the main harvest and thus
create a need for such credit. Each case would have to be considered indi-
vldually, and in view of the increased risks, PMU and CAC would need to
consider the desirability of obtaining physical security through, for example,
a pledge of already harvested crops.
21.       The apparently rather fragmented nature of production within market
areas dLnderlines the importance not only of group approach but also of full
cooperation among project staff if potential value of physical inputs is to
be realized and the commercial feasibility of CSS operations properly eval-
uated. Actions and responsibilities in the development of input service
operations are shown in Table 5.
22.       Debt Recovery. Repayment would be made by individuals or by the
group leader. While the group system reduces the amount of physical account-
ing as well as the number of loans to be recovered at project level, it



Volume 2
Annex 4
Page 5
does not decrease the number of ultimate borrowers; it shifts, rather
than removes, responsiblity for primary collection. This change of emphasis
is important not only for the savings that will be ultimately realized,
but also because of the opportunity provided to start off with a near mirror
image of conditions and requirements in a commercial finance company.
23.       Instruction and help in applying adequate recording practices will
lhave to be given to group leaders and GAC; such work would complement that
being carried out by extension staff and would be an integral part of the
group development process. Accounting Assistants would be responsible
for this function as well as being the persons to whom actual repayments
would be made. By the end of the development phase the Accounting Assistants
should have established satisfactory recording systems in groups and by
chiefdom, thus providing the sound foundation necessary for a farmers' finance
company (see Volume 3, Annex 4).
24.       Although statutory marketing facilities would exist at Market
Centers and funds for debt repayment generated at these points, it would be
impractical to attempt to utilize the organization as a vehicle for debt
collection. Introduction of such a system would tend to undermine and prob-
ably destroy the group concept as well as necessitate the employment of
additional accounting staff and create an undesirable diversification away
from the prime purpose of efficient low cost primary marketing.
25.       Field Staffing.  The variation in extent and, to a lesser degree,
density of Market Areas together with uncertainty regarding ease of access
makes it necessary to make provision for six Area Salesmen to ensure proper
coverage of the project area. In a large area like Gbendembu two salesmen
would be able to operate from one Market Center, and only five storekeeper/
clerks would be required in total. Salesmen would have a 175 cc motorcycle
on which to cover their area, while actual movement of inputs would be coor-
dinated by the Commercial Services Officer, to ensure best use of available
transport. A simple cost recording and analysis system would be instituted from
the start of each salesman's operations to provide indicators as to probable
cheapest effective means of operating the Unit, and procedure would be kept under
careful review. Provision would be made for one Accounting Assistant to each
Market Area with a further two for back up in the larger areas; each would be
provided with a small motorcycle. This relatively high density would be required
to ensure that group approach and recording practices were satisfactory from the
outset, and some reduction in AA to new group ratio would be aimed at over the
life of the project.
26.       The principal duties of the Commercial Services Officer (CSO)
would initially be in the establishment of efficient input supply and credit
organizations. During the project period he would also identify other specific



Volume 2
Annex 4
Page 6
areas where assistance is required, or would benefit project farmers. Such
work would be carried out within guidelines agreed between the commercial
services officer of PESU and PMU and would include detailed appraisal of rice
milling requirements within the project boundaries and areas tributary thereto.
C. Seed Multiplication
27.       The project depends in large measure on the provision of improved
seeds to farmers and, since the quantities are not otherwise available, a
seed multiplication unit would be established on the river terrace soils
of the project area. The unit would comprise some 100 acres, fully irri-
gated with around 60% of the area double cropped, and, on the basis of
seed replacement every fourth year, would provide the entire project rice
seed requirement. For groundnuts, quality seed would be issued to approved
and supervised outgrowers for bulking. Prices paid to outgrowers would be
around 1.5i per lb above current market price to provide the necessary
incentive for improved husbandry practice.
28.       A pricing structure for seeds is proposed that would enable the
seed multiplication unit to operate at a profit sufficient to cover invest-
ment and operating costs, including supervision and seed inspection. Seed
would be purchased from the farm by the commercial services unit and a
mark-up added to cover distribution costs to farming groups. The following
price structure is recommended:
Ex Seed Farm       Base Price
Price          to Farmers
-----     Leones------------
Rice           bu                 7.50             8.00
Groundnuts      lb /1              .11               .12
/1   Shelled seed.
Seed would be dressed and packed in one acre packages (1 bushel rice and
60 lb groundnuts) and clearly marked to warn off the dangers of eating
treated seed.
29.       Details of the seed multiplication program for rice and groundnuts
are given in Table 6 and the estimated capital and operating costs of the
multiplication unit are given in Table 7.

D. Spraying Service
30.       Insect damage to rice has not assumed economic importance in
Sierra Leone, but is expected to increase following general intensification
of rice production. Until the benefits of crop spraying are properly eval-
uated, however, and farmers suitably trained in insect damage identifica-
tion, a "fire brigade" spraying service would be operated by the project
for which a flat cash charge would be made.
31.       Recommended spraying charges, and estimates of sprayers and
spray requirements are given in Table 8.

in the following December. The project runs for three years affecting three
crop seasons: 1973, 1974, and 1975. Although slow starting, and under
difficult conditions, the project is achieving its targets and farmers of
the project area are responding well. The main objectives of the project
were to establish 6,000 acres of inland swamp rice, 750 acres of new cocoa,
1,830 acres of outgrower oil palm and 510 acres of estate oil palm plantings.
These physical objectives will be obtained and project funds, now nearly
fully committed, should be disbursed by September 1975.
2.        A few problems have emerged from the project, including:
(a) the existence of two arms of MANR working the same area.
Under the new project all MANR staff would come under project
control;
(b) the high cost in funds and staff required to distribute inputs
and recover credit, currently being rectified through a group
approach--particularly applicable to swamp rice;
(c) the lack of the proper institutions to carry the development
forward after the project impetus has been established. At
the time of Credit signing, Government and IDA envisaged
setting up an Agricultural Development Authority (ADA) to
take over the project and institutional responsibilities from
MANR. In the intervening time, both Government and IDA have
concluded that the ADA would not be an appropriate institution.
The main Government opposition to ADA came from MANR officials,
who saw ADA as a weakening of MANR control. IDA, on the other
hand, saw ADA as another multifunctional institution, with heavy
overhead costs, and really no chance of being more efficient
than present organizations and institutions. Instead, it is
now considered that credit and processing institutions be
established at local levels, for ultimate farmer control.
Such local institutions could be developed in other areas of
the countries taking full cognizance of the economic and tribal

differences within the country. Eventually such institutions,
if warranted, could be brought under appropriate holding companies
or corporations.
3.        The deficiencies outlined above would be rectified under this new
project with the strategy of providing a firm service base to farmers in
the Eastern area so that development after 1977 can take place with minimum
financial assistance from external sources.

INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
EASTERN AREA PROJECT
The Project Area
A. Description
1.        Geography.  The Eastern Area Project (EAP) lies between latitudes
6058' and 80221 North and longitudes 10°37' and 11°53' West, and comprises
23 chiefdoms in Eastern Province and nine chiefdoms in Southern Province
giving a total of 2,750,000 acres or 4,300 square miles. Topographically,
the area covers three major zones. To the north and north east are the
intermediate uplands, lying between the inland plains and the internal
plateaux. This is a continuation of the scarp face that forms the north
western boundary of the Northern Area Project (NAP) but is here in a much
more advanced stage of erosion, giving a steeply undulating zone, 350' to
950' a.s.l. covering around 70% of the project area, and dissected by
several hill ranges which are granite residues of the old scarp face.
South west of the intermediate zone are the inland plains, 30-50 miles
wide and 100-350' a.s.l. and bounded on the south by the coastal swamp belt
most of which lies below 50'. A major river, the Moa, drains from the
plateau in a south westerly direction. The provincial town, Kenema, lies
centrally in the project area.
2.        Climate. Annual rainfall, based on a 15-year average of record
taken at Kenema is 109.0 ins of which 95 ins falls from May through November
and 14 ins from December through April. To the south of the project area,
annual rainfall rises markedly to a maximum of around 170 ins at the coast
(see Table 5). Dry season rainfall is generally higher and more reliable
than in the north.
3.        Soils.  Geologically the area comprises the granite and acid
gneisses, which underlie the intermediate zone, the Kasila series of
crystalline schists and gneisses which underlie the inland plain, and the
Bullam series of marine and estuarine sediments along the coastal swamp
zone. Soils are mainly lateritic sands with varying clay content, acids
(ph 5.0-6.0), free draining and with a low nuttient status. In general,
the eastern soils are recognized as being superior to those of the north
due to lower laterite and higher clay content, and to a greater thickness
of peat/clay topsoils in the swampland areas. Throughout the upland areas,



Volume 3
Annex 2
Page 2
the soil catena is generally more pronounced than the north with stony
sandier soils on the hill crests to sand clay loams on the lower slopes.
The area is also more liberally strewn with inland swamps which are larger
and have shallower gradients than those in the north.
4.        Vegetation.  The ecology of the area is closely comparable to the
dense farm bush in the southern half of the NAP, dominated by fast growing,
fire resistant species (see Volume 2) which thrive under the bush/fallow
system. However, the area contains over 20,000 acres of forest reserves and
protected forest areas, and areas of high trees traditionally surround many
of the Mende villages, and are used as shade for cocoa and coffee.
5.        Population.  Total population of the area is estimated at 475,000
in 1974 of which 400,000 are living in the rural areas. In contrast to the
NAP, the northern part of the project area is characterized by an excess of
males over females, this being due to the attractions of diamond mining
which has likewise caused a marked increase in urban population in EAP
since the early 1950's.
6.        Most of the 18 ethnic groups of Sierra Leone are represented in
the project area but the Mende tribe is wholly dominant. Along the coast
towards the Liberian border are settlements of Kum, Vai and Gola, which
are minor groups almost entirely concentrated in this area.
7.        Farm families are smaller than at Makeni, averaging 4 working
adults and 2 children, giving a total of around 65,000 in the project area.
Traditional administration is comparable to the NAP and is likewise strong
and respected.
8.        Communications.  A paved road links Kenema to Bo and Pendembu to
Daru, and there is a network of unpaved trunk roads joining the 12 principal
towns. There is a low density of feeder roads, however, and a large pro-
portion of the area is serviced only by footpaths or by secondary roads
which are unmotorable due to poor drainage and lack of maintenance. For
the latter, a low level of investment could make a significant impact on
development prospects for the area.
9.        Services.  Reticulated water supplies have been installed at
Kenema, Pujehun, Panguma and Daru. The remaining urban and rural settle-
ments rely on streams and groundwater for supply, but the hydrology of the
area is such that dry season supply is more available and reliable than
at Makeni. Electricity supplies have been installed at Kenema, Daru and
Pujehun.

10.       Farm System.  The bush/fallow system of shifting cultivation is
the dominant form of agricultural practice and essentially comparable to
that described in Volume 2. This section will highlight the important
differences of agricultural practice between the two project areas.
11.       For the Eastern Area Project, it has been possible to draw useful
information from the results of the 1970/71 Agricultural Statistical Survey,
this being due primarily to the greater size of the project area, embracing
major portions of three districts (Kenema, Kailahun, Pujehun) for which
specific information is presented in the survey report. This is in contrast
to NAP which occupies too small a portion of the northern districts of
Bombali and Tonkolili to make statistical extrapolation feasible. Never-
theless, there are interesting comparisons between eastern and northern
agriculture as a whole, and for this reason land use and cropping pattern
information has been analyzed for these five districts and for Bo district
which is 90% outside the Eastern project area on the western side. The
results of this analysis are given in Tables 2 through 5.
12.       In terms of cropping patterns, there is a marked contrast in that
the EAP contains the principal cash crop areas of Sierra Leone. Cocoa and
coffee production are centered on the Pendembu, Segbwema, Kenema belt and,
in the case of coffee, there are smaller concentrations around Pujehun and
Zimmi in the south. These concentrations are primarily a function of dry
season rainfall reliability and the availability of suitable soils and
natural shade trees. Oil Palm is an important crop in the center of the
project area, and the southern coastal belt is important for Piassava. 1/
Groundnuts, a major crop in the north are of minor importance in the EAP.
The contrast in cropping patterns is shown clearly in the Agricultural
Statistical Survey findings (see Volume 1).
13.       There is a greater potential for swamp rice development in the
Eastern Area project due to a higher density of swamps, greater swamp size
and to more favorable soils. While the 1970/71 Agricultural Statistical
Survey shows a high degree of existing swamp cultivation, this is understood
to result from a large proportion of only partly cleared swamps. In common
with other swamp areas in Sierra Leone, there is also a generally observed
pattern of declining rice yield if swamp production is not accompanied by
appropriate technological improvements.
14.       Throughout the project area, rising population is causing consid-
erable pressure on the uplands and a corresponding decline in fallow period.
In many areas, around 20% of the cultivable uplands are annually cultivated,
and fallow periods rarely extend beyond 6-7 years. As a result there is an
1/   A vegetable fibre obtained from the lower part of the leaf stalks of
the raphia palm and used for producing brushes.



Volume 3
Annex 2
Page 4
increasing trend towards swampland cultivation and it is important that
this trend is supported by adequate improvements in water control, and crop
technology.
15.       Farm Size.  Farm size in the Eastern area is probably smaller
than in the north, but this difference is primarily a function of family
size. The composition of the holding, however, differs markedly due to a
lower ratio of annual crops to perennials. The Agricultural Statistical
Survey suggests average holdings size of 6-7 acres, of which the area
cultivated under the bush/fallow system amount to 2-3 acres. Swamp culti-
vation is undertaken by 30-40% of growers and average swamp holdings range
from 1-3 acres. In Pujehun, where there is a greater dependence on fish
as a source of income, holding sizes are around 50% of the average for
Kenema and Kailahun districts.
16.       Land Tenure.  The system of land tenure is essentially comparable
to that of the north, though the practice of land pledging is uncommon. In
the context of swamp land, however, the practical implications of tenure
are affected by the greater availability of uncleared land, and the indi-
cations are that the proportion of "begged" land is lower, most farmers
cultivating with the security of an inheritable usufruct.
17.       Crop Production.  Husk rice yields in developed swamps were
measured in a crop cutting survey in which sample plots were harvested in
25% of swamps which had water control measures and crop inputs provided
under the project. Climatic conditions were favorable and the weighted
average, corrected to 16% moisture was 2,640 lbs per acre. Unfortunately
control cuttings were not undertaken in unimproved swamps so that base line
comparisons are not possible. While the controversy surrounding yield surveys
and trials in the Eastern Area are no less than those of the north, there
are indications that the assumed 1,200 lbs per acre used during appraisal
of the first phase project may be too low, and this should be investigated
before further investment proposals are drawn up. In view of the uncertainty
of existing figures, economic analysis of the current investment proposals
have included sensitivity tests using differing base line yield levels.
No yield recordings have been undertaken for cocoa or oil palm, and until
investigation is extended to these crops, the base yields of the first phase
project appraisal are assumed.

Farm and Crop Development
A. Inland Valley Swamps
Baeckround
1.        Inland valley swamps are an important feature of the Eastern
Area occupying about 10 0/0 of the gross land area. They are generally
large (average gross area around 20 acres but some are over 200 acres),
linear in shape and have shallow gradients. During 1973, 480 acres of
swampland were developed, and a further 2,800 acres are under development
in the current year. Experience gained over these two seasons has led to
simple but effective water control measures to be implemented with an
impressive farmer response rate.
2.        Considerable areas of inland swamps are presently cultivated
by farmers outside of the ongoing project. In most cases, however, the
swamps are partly cleared only, and satisfactory water control measures
and purchased crop inputs are not employed. Initially the project has
concentrated on swamps already cleared and under part cultivation. In
successive years, through opening new swamp areas and through complete
clearing and development of existing swamps, a significant increase in
the total area under swamp cultivation is expected as well as improved
productivity per acre (see Section C).
Rice Development
3.        Water Control.  A low technology approach for swamp water control
has been employed by the Eastern Area Project (EAP), the main objective of
which are: provision of adequate drainage system; prevention of flood
damage; conservation of water for irrigation as required, and provision of
structural layout so as to minimize the amount of work necessary to bring
the swamp into production. Within this broad framework, design criteria
for individual swamps are determined by catchment area, drainage lines and
soil texture, and by the managerial abilities of the farmers and farm
groups involved.



Volume 3
Annex 3
Page 2
4.        In its simplest form, the structures comprise a central drainage
and supply canal with peripheral protective bunding and interplot ridging,
irrigation being effectively achieved by blocking the central canal and
inundating backwards. A "squared" plot layout is possible provided that
swamp gradients are sufficiently shallow. This design is easily understood
by farmers and used where a generally low level of technology is applicable.
5.        More advanced designs include header-bunds from the central canal
leading to peripheral irrigation canals from which flow can be directed
into the paddy lots. This layout generally results in a larger proportion
of the swamp being developed and also permits terraced levelling of the
paddy lots. In swamps with light textured soil types below a shallow top
soils, grassed waterways have been used instead of drainage channels.
6.        Some interesting practical design aspects have emerged from the
work at Kenema. It is difficult to persuade farmers to dig very large
central drains where necessitated by catchment size. In such cases safety
measures were incorporated into underdesigned systems such as constructing
spillages in the header well, and setting the drain bunds back from the
drain edge as far as a man could reach with a shovel. All channel walls
are "side-sloped" except for the peripheral irrigation channels, since a
vertical edge presents a more formidable obstacle to "cutting grass"
(Thrynomys swinderianus - a rodent that causes large scale damage to the
standing rice crop).
7.        The organization of swamp development will be encouraged on a
group basis, since this conforms to the technical aspects of treating the
swamp as a whole and is in accord with the aim of encouraging farmer groups
in order to permit economies of scale in farm input supplies and credit
administration.
8.        Loans of Le 48.50 were included in the first project to cover
hired labor and material costs for swamp development. These were found
to be adequate for swamps where major clearing work has been previously
undertaken but inadequate for those where complete development work was
necessary. Two categories of development loan have therefore been introduced,
calculated on a per acre basis, and will be issued either to individuals or
to organized swamp development groups as the circumstances of the swamp
dictates, this assessment being the responsibility of the project management
unit. Estimated swamp development costs are given in Table 1.
9.        Varieties.  Five varieties--RH2, RC4, CP4, Nachin 11, and IRS,
were supplied to project farmers in 1973 and all but IR5 are included for
1974. This has largely resulted from problems of supply, and it is intended
to limit varieties once variety trial results 1/ are assessed and supplies
1/   Trials in the project area are being undertaken by the West African
Rice Research Station, Rokupr.

of seed are secured from the projects seed farms (see Annex 5). The 1974
plantings also include BD2 and IR20, and the project has been advised to
concentrate on these two varieties and IR442 which has been highly successful
elsewhere in West Africa. All three varieties are higher yielding under
swamp conditions and are also of shorter duration. This will enable the
harmful effects of the harmattan on milling quality to be reduced through
earlier harvesting; the existing varieties are mainly long duration and
harvesting extends well into January.
10.       Fertilizers.  Project farmers are currently using a low basic
application of 1 cwt of sulphate of ammonia and 1 cwt single superphosphate
per acre. Trials are underway, which include higher levels of nitrogen and
phosphate application and soil analyses of developed swamps are now being
undertaken for further guidance on fertilizer requirements. It is anticipated
that in swamps with farmers of a sound management rating, higher fertilizer
levels will be possible in future.
11.       Sprays.  Insect damage is not of economic importance at the moment,
but is expected to increase following general intensification of rice pro-
duction. Blanket spraying would not be appropriate at this stage particu-
larly in view of the general problems of sprayer maintenance and regulation
of application rates. The project proposes to provide a spraying service
to cope with localized outbreaks of stemborer, and calculations have been
based on the assumption that a maximum of 25% of the crop would need to be
sprayed in any 10-day period. Trials are being carried out on chemical weed
control, but the technique has been insufficiently evaluated to enable
recommendations to be made at this stage. A breakdown of spraying costs
is given in Annex 4, Table 8.
12.       Benefits.  Although high yields are possible, and have been achieved,
on developed swamps, a considerable yield variation must be expected. This
will result from differing managerial expertise (which will likewise influence
recommended application rates) and to problems resulting from farmers giving
priority to their upland rice fields (this is discussed further below). In-
sufficient information is available to permit categorizing of farmers,
however, and a composite average is used. With an average application rate of
35 lbs N and 33 lbs P205 (1.5 bags each of SA and SSP) average swamp yields
are expected to be 2,500 lbs husk rice per acre. A one acre budget for
swamp rice is given in Table 2, and one acre development cash flows for
category A and B swamps are given in Table 3a and 3b.
Rotational Crops
13.       It is estimated that double cropping will be possible and practiced
on 5% of total swamp area. The project is investigating the possibility of
dry season crop production in the swamps, and the following trials program
is planned for 1974 and 1975.

B. Upland Development
14.       Background.  Thus far, the project has been involved in upland
development only in connection with oil palm and cocoa production. However,
it has become apparent that swamp development cannot be viewed in isolation
from the upland farm.
15.       For most farmers, the upland rice farm is the most important unit
in the farming system, with deep-rooted social implications in the pattern
of family life. It represents tradition, security and a proven source of
income, and against this the swampland takes second place. This has impor-
tant implications on the degree of crop technology that can be applied to
the swamplands and which can only be fully understood by consideration of
the farm system as a whole. In addition no effective rice program aimed
at meeting domestic demand can afford to neglect the overwhelmingly large
proportion of cultivated land devoted to upland rice production. Although
the problems of developing this important area are largely unresolved,
marginal improvements in productivity per acre could have a significant
impact on overall national production.
16.       Rice Development.  The project is investigating the possibility
of introducing improved varieties (such as LAC 23 and TX 52101) and will
evaluate variety performance on the bases of yield and acceptability for
consumption. During the 1975 cropping season it is intended to issue foun-
dation seed to registered outgrowers for bulking up prior to an upland mass



Volume 3
Annex 3
Page 5
saturation program to be launched in cropping season 1976. Sufficient seed
would also be produced to service the Northern Area Project for cropping
seasons 1976 through 1978. Complete seed replacement would be carried out
every fifth year, and it is expected that the combined efforts of. improved
seed and seed dressing would increase upland yields by 150 lbs of husk
rice per acre. A one acre budget is given in Table 4.
17.       Cocoa Development. The project has established 7 cocoa nurseries,
and a planting program of 750 acres will be completed in 1975. Despite
substantial price increases for most crop inputs, the project has managed
to maintain the level of development loans estimated at Phase I appraisal,
this being primarily due to a lower hired labor component than originally
envisaged. Revised development cost estimates and development cash flows
are given in Tables 5 and 6.
18.       Planting material is currently obtained from a small clonal garden
(about 1/2 acre) planted to F2 Amazon x Amalonado hybrids brought in from
Ghana. While expansion of total cocoa acreage in the Eastern Area will be
limited by lack of suitable soil, there is considerable scope for replanting
and in anticipation of this, cost estimates are included for establishing a
new clonal seed garden during the interim project (see Annex 4, Table 7).
19.       Oil Palm Development. A total of 1,750 acres of outgrower oil palm
is being planted under phase I of the project, from seedlings produced at the
Daru Estate, under IRHO supervision. There is considerable demand from farmers
for improved seedlings, and following construction of the Daru Palm Oil Mill,
outgrower acreage will need to be expanded to a level representing around 80%
of mill throughput. Price increases of farm inputs will require an increase
in crop development loans per acre though these are not excessive due to a
lower hired labor component than originally envisaged. Revised per acre
development costs are given in Table 7.
20.       Within the project area there are about 775 acres of improved
outgrowers oil palm planted under Government-assisted scheme from 1968
through 1972. Planting material and crop inputs were provided, and a devel-
opment grant paid to cover hired labor costs. Many growers, however, neither
received satisfactory supervision nor the entire cash and kind inputs, but
while the planted area is generally poorly maintained, it represents a
valuable asset and potentially valuable source of throughput for the Daru
Oil Mill.
21.       The project therefore intends to include this area in its general
supervision and crop establishment program, and to pay or supply all out-
standing development inputs. Thereafter, the growers would be incorporated
into the general outgrower development credit fund which would be replenished
by applying a standard cost on each ton of ffb delivered to the mill. Average
development costs for old and new outgrowers are given in Table 8, and by



Volume 3
Annex 3
Page 6
applying a cess of Le 11 .50/ton ffb, this average development cost could be
amortized over 9 years at 8 0/0 interest, with an initial 4 year (up to fruit
production) grace period for interest and principal.  Estimated outgrower
cash flows are given in Table 9 and are based on a factory price of Le 25.00/
ton, a price that could be raised by as much as Le 5/ton, a farmgate price
of Le 21.00/ton (Le 4.00 for fruit collection) leaving a net farmgate price
(after deduction of the development cess) of Le 9.50/ton (possible Le 14.5/ton
if factory can pay a higher price).
C. Resource Evaluation
22.       Physical information on the Eastern area is extremely limited, and
it is not possible to accurately estimate its crop development potential.
Development projections for the interim project are conservative and are
essentially aimed at maintaining the same rate of crop coverage as that
scheduled for the final year of Phase I, thereby allowing the project a
period of consolidation in which group formation and farm input supply
services can be streamlined to the extent that substantial future develop-
ment effort become administratively possible. In addition, a detailed
mapping and resource evaluation exercise will be undertaken to permit
accurate investment planning for the future.
23.       A further important objective of the interim project will be to
extend development into 16 traditional upland farming areas, by extending
simple conservation and land use principals from the inland swamp to the
entire swamp catchment area. In addition, upland rice production will be
increased by mass saturation of improved seed on a similar basis to that
proposed for the NAP.
24.       The proposed interim cropping program and production projections
are given in Table 10 through 13.

I/ It is assumed that of the total area of inland swamps developed by the project, the proportion alreadr under
cultivation will be as follows:
Years -3 and -2   100%
Year  -1             60%
Years  1 and 2       30%
2/ 5% double cropping from year 4 onwards.
3/ The 1965/66 and 1970/71 Agricultural Statistical Surveys suggest that cultivated swamp area is increasing at an
annual rate of about 9%. As a percentage of the total previously cultivated swamp area developed (6,600 acres) this
would amount to about 600 acres per annun. In evaluating the project benefits it is assumed that the previously
uncultivated swamp area developed (5,400 acres) would have come under cultivation at this annual rate from project
year 7 onwards.  Increnental production from year 7 is therefore reduced by 348 tons (600  x 1,300 lbs per acre)
for 9 years.

INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
EASTERN AREA PROJECT
Marketing and Farm Inputs
A. Rice Marketing
1.        The Eastern Region of Sierra Leone is a deficiency area for rice and
marketed production from the ongoing EAP finds a ready market in Kenema and
other towns; there is a particularly strong and constant demand from the-re-
maining areas. The Rice Corporation maintains four depots within EAP 1/
which are primarily occupied with distribution and sale of imported milled
rice. A census of rice mills is now being carried out by PMU, but it is
believed that there are more than 30 in the project area including six
fitted with rubber roller shellers. Evaluation of small mill performance is
under way by PMU but no mill has yet been financed under the provisions of
Credit 323-SL.
2.        The greater part of Sierra Leone cocoa and coffee is produced in
the eastern region and some 37 Licensed Buying Agents (LBA) operate in the
project area on behalf of SLPMB (see Volume 1, Annex 2, Table 8).
3.        Transportation difficulties appear to exert strong constraints on
all produce marketing in the area and the low onfarm value accorded to rice
used to repay traditional credit reflects the importance of this problem.
4.        The project would establish twelve "market areas" each administered
from a market centre where storage and offices would be erected. A statutory
marketing team would operate in the centres, at which guaranteed prices would
be offered for gazetted produce. Provided that assembled volume of produce
warranted or LBA performance was found to be inadequate, these teams would
also buy at selected points within the market area.
5.        The extent of the EAP as well as the volume and diversity of pro-
duce marketed, renders Market Center siting critical to marketing efficiency
and producer well being. For this reason no precise locations have yet been
selected, but a pilot Market Area has been established in Kamara, Kenema
1/ At Kenema, Pendembu, Pujehnn and Gbundapi.

District. Under the ongoing EAP, marketing and input supply operations are
being carefully monitored in order to provide information regarding operating
economics so that essential parameters may be stipulated for the location of
other Market Centers. 1/ For administrative reasons, Market Area boundaries
will follow those of chiefdoms.
B. Oil Palm Marketing
6.        The production of the oil palm outgrowers and Daru Estate
would be processed by the Daru Oil Palm Company Limited, in the mill now
being erected under Credit 323-SL.
7.        The pricing policy would be established by the Directors of the
company within overall national agricultural pricing policy which would
embody the following principles;
(i) the freedom of the company to sell in Sierra Leone
palm oil produced in its own mill in such volume,
units and at such prices, as operating economics
and local market conditions permitted;
(ii) in the event of oversupply causing local prices to
fall below world levels, SLPMB would purchase sur-
plus oil in direct parity with export prices.
8.        Market conditions and mill throughput requirement would demand con-
siderable flexibility in pricing oil, and consequently ffb, but producer prices
would be maintained for periods of not less than a month. Prices for each
period would be announced not later than completion of final ffb collection
round in the preceding period.
9.        The price paid would be determined from revenue received for mill
products (i.e. oil and kernels) less collection, processing administration
and financial charges; the latter would include allowance for creation of a
price maintenance reserve as well as for interest payments, taxation, etc.,
and provision for reasonable profits relative to investment and turnover.
Allowance would also be made for grower credit payments (see para 8). In
converting the resultant net product value to a price per ton of ffb, an
average extraction rate would be applied. In early years this would result
1/   The pilot area contains 29 presently developed swamps ranging from 3 to
84 developed acres in extent. Average road mileage from Market Center
to swamp is 39 miles. This is comparable to an area successfully admin-
istered by a Credit Assistant during year 1 of the ongoing EAP.



Volume 3

in owners of the more mature trees receiving less than their theoretical
share, however this would balance out over the long term, while considerable
direct and indirect benefits flow from operational simplicity when marketing
smallholder production (for details see Appendix 1, page 10).
10.       FFB would be bought at a uniform price, 'grading' being initially
confined to an accept or reject basis. The small number of buying staff and
low volume of total purchases would allow a close check to be kept on de-
livered quality.
11.       Sales of oil would be confined to wholesale level, and a policy
developed to encourage regular quantity take-off by traders. In the short
run the mill may have to operate on a notional loss basis on either or both
ffb and oil in order to maintain adequate throughput levels. The main rea-
sons for such situations arising usually relate to lack of market knowledge.
EA PHU and mill management would cooperate to accumulate and develop an in-
telligence system to assist anticipation of market movements. Millgate price
calculations are shown in Volume 1, Annex 2, Table 17.
12.       Development credit has been granted to all existing outgrowers, and
this arrangement would be continued for new growers. Credit terms provide for
a loan bearing interest at 8%, repayable over thirteen years, including a four
year grace period for interest and principal. These terms are largely neces-
sitated by the time period between planting and first bearing; however they
cause recovery costs to be high relative to the amount involved, a situation
that is exacerbated by the wide dispersion of growers in relation to the oil
palm acreage planted. In order to minimize the impact of such recovery costs
on grower income, repayment of all development credit would be achieved by
means of a form of cess levied on all outgrowers. The required cess payment
would be arrived at by amortizing total development credit over the period of
the loan, and expressed as an amount (Le 11.50) per ton of ffb. Announced
producer prices would be after deduction of cess. Details of the calculations
are contained in Volume 1, Annex 2.
13.       Fruit Collection from both outgrowers and the estate would be the
responsibility of mill management since proper scheduling is critical to fac-
tory operation. In addition, outgrower production in the interim phase would
still be small compared with that from the estate (2,600/5,800 tons ffb), but
the total is sufficient and would permit more economic utilization of trans-
port.
14.       The fruit collection system would have to cater for a relatively
large number of small production units situated up to 25 miles from the mill,
with a consequently high proportion of empty running mile per load collected;
consolidation of new plantings around existing acreages within the median
radius would result in considerable savings in collection costs. The some-
what slow build up of production would, however, allow time for the refine-
ment of a collection and marketing accounting system specifically suited to
EAP conditions and so permit ultimate cost savings in the collection process.



Volume 3
Annex 4
Page 4
15.       Although consideration could be given to encouraging smallholders
to deliver direct to the mill, difficulty in determining likely costs in-
volved, and thus the risks of 'losing' production to traditional processors,
combined with the need to establish harvesting and collection disciplines in
order to insure receipt of good quality fruits with low ffa, 1/ mitigates
against such a course. Consequently, a series of collection centers would
be established at strategic points along roads serving the production area.
Growers would have to carry fruit to these points, but this should not in-
volve movement in excess of about half a mile.
16.       Road surfaces within the production area would after improvement
be suitable for year round use and in view of the long distances to be cov-
ered a truck is considered the most suitable type of vehicle for the collec-
tion service. The time element is critical to effective utilization and
mechanized loading equipment (with built in scales) would be fitted to enable
speedy performance of the loading function. Nets would be provided to allow
maximum quantity of fruit to be loaded at one time.
17.       Each truck would be manned by a buying team, consisting of a
supervisor (also the driver) and two laborers, one to assist growers attach
filled nets to the hook of the crane, the other remaining in the lorry to
empty and stow or return the nets and stack the bunches. The weight of
fruit would be recorded on a simple accounting machine 2/ by the supervisor,
this record being counter-signed or marked by the grower after receiving
payment.
18.       Prior to leaving the mill the supervisor would be issued with cash
to the value of expected purchases (i.e. truck capacity x guaranteed price
plus 5% contingency to cover possibility of high proportion of loose fruit),
and a suitable accounting machine. On return the load would be weighed in
and recorded, remaining cash counted and the accounting machine handed in.
There would thus be no delay in truck turnround, and the audit roll could
be reconciled against cash and fruit weight before completion of the sub-
sequent trip. There would thus be a running performance check and account-
ing process which would greatly assist management control. Limited cash
issues would minimize the risk of robbery or defalcation, and mechanical scales
would be checked daily.
1/   Handling of fruit bunches needs to be kept to a minimum if free fatty
acid build up is to be avoided.
2/   Anyone of the type which permit three copies of an entry to be made, the
third copy remaining locked inside an audit record, would be suitable.



Volume 3

19.       In 1977 the estimated maximum 1/ monthly movement requirement from
smallholder production would be 325 tons ffb (see Annex 2) equivalent to
say 46 trips with a 7 ton truck or 65 in a 5 tonner. Using an average
round haul of 30 miles it is estimated that 4 trips could be made per 10
hour day or 100 per 25 day month. (i.e. a movement capability of 500 or
700 tons per month, depending on truck size). Maximum monthly production
from the estate is expected to reach 845 tons ffb in 1977. This would require
a daily movement of about 35 tons, with an average round trip of 5 miles.
Total 1977 movement requirements could therefore theoretically be met by one
7 ton vehicle. However, this would leave no margins for breakdown, delays
in fruit assembly, etc. anyone of which could endanger mill production
schedules and/or jeopardize grower confidence. Two high seated 7 ton tipper
trucks each fitted with cranes with built-in scales would be acquired by the Oil
Palm Company in order to ensure reasonable reserve of movement capacity at all
times. Nets for harvested fruit bunches would be small-meshed in order to
prevent loose fruit loss and allow such fruit to be collected and weighed
simultaneously with ffb. During the interim phase, nets would be retained
by smallholders between collection days, the benefits of greater net util-
ization being more than outweighed by costs of continued distribution.
C. Cocoa Marketing
20.       Project production would reach 547 tons at full maturity in 1983
and account for about 5% of expected national output at this time. Sierra
Leone is a minor producing country, providing less than 0.5% of total world
supplies in 1972/73, and cannot expect to influence international price
movements. Farmers would be able to sell their cocoa either through LBA or
to the statutory buying teams, operating from Market Centers, who would pro-
vide adequate control on LBA operations through competition. Economic price
calculation, based on IBRD constant price projections are detailed in Volume 1,
Annex 2, Table 20.
D. Input Supplies
21.       The organization and approach of the Commercial Services Section for
the supply of farm inputs would replicate that in NAP (details of which are
in Volume 2, Annex 4) except in so far as the structure of credit services
are concerned, The individual and group approach, already used in the ongoing
project would be maintained for rice farmers, but the latter because of the
different factors involved would not necessarily apply to those growing tree
crops.
1/ Estimated at 12.5% of mean annual yield.



Volume 3
Annex 4
Page 6
22.       Substantial price increases have affected all farm inputs since the
ongoing project was appraised in 1972. In most cases, however, these price
increases have not altered the book values of development and seasonal credit
issues to farmers due to a heavy subsidy on fertilizers (now up to 80% of
distributed cost) and to adjustments in the composition of each loan issue.
Indirect subsidies have also been applied to other crop inputs (such as
seeds and insecticides) through the project absorbing part of the distribu-
tion costs from point of purchase to point of sale.
23.       While project records of hired labor costs and crop input appli-
cation rates show that a number of physical reductions are possible in the
original appraisal report estimates, in most cases these do not compensate
for overall price increases. Revised development and seasonal loans for
rice, cocoa and oil palm are detailed and discussed in Annex 2.
24.       Basic price assumptions for seeds and fertilizers are detailed in
Table 1, and development and seasonal requirements for seed, fertilizer,
hired labor and hand tools have been projected through to completion of the
interim project in Tables 2 to 4.
25.       Staffing requirements for the commercial services section would be
similar by Market Area to those in NAP but total numbers higher due to the
greater extent of EAP. The present credit services would be maintained and
their cost carried by the project, but the first formal steps would be taken
towards their transition into a farmer owned finance company which would be
self-perpetuating and capable of serving the needs of farmers in the area for
an indefinite period.
E. Seed Multiplication
26.       The project is establishing two 25 acre seed farms, at Sangbwana
and Kenema, which would multiply parent stock originating from Rokupr. Seed
of a high standard would be released from the seed farm for bulking up on
registered swamp farms in the project area, and sufficient seed would be pro-
duced to allow upland and swamp farms to completely replace their seed after
5 years planting. An initial surplus would be available for the Northern
Area Project until its own seed farm is in production.
27.       Variety research work and hence limited bulking from parent stocks
would be carried out at WARRS, Rokupr, and the project would require approx-
imately 60 bushels of improved seed each year for bulking on its own seed
farms. A comprehensive roguing and plant protection program would be under-
taken, with strict supervision of registered growers to ensure that similar
high standards of management are attained. Facilities are to be installed
at 16 Kenema farms for cleaning, dressing, packaging and storing of seed from
both farms and from the registered growers. It is recommended that strong,



Volume 3
Annex 4
Page 7
clear, 1-bushel capacity plastic bags be used for packaging containing printed
labels warning of the dangers of eating treated seed.
28.       The seed farms would buy back seed from registered growers at
Le 5.50 per bushel (50i above prevailing market price) which would provide
the necessary incentive for improved production techniques and roguing.
Bulked dressed seed would then be distributed at Le 8.00 per bushel which
would cover the cost of both seed farms excluding initial expatriate super-
vision. Details of the rice seed multiplication program are given in
Table 5, and the estimated capital and operating costs of the seed multip-
lication unit are given in Table 6.
29.       Supplies of oil palm and cocoa seedlings would continue from the
existing nurseries, but finance is included for establishing a clonal seed
garden for production of hybrid cocoa seed. Garden establishment costs are
given in Table 7, and are based on the assumption that potted cuttings are
air freighted in from Ghana.
F. Spraying Service
30.       All crop spraying in the project is currently undertaken as a pro-
ject service to farmers, and while it is ultimately intended to ussue sprayers
to farmers, the scale of smallholder operations is such that this will not be
possible until farmer groups develop into cohesive managerial units with neces-
sary technical ability to accurately identify insect and fungal attacks.
Spraying costs have therefore been projected on this basis through the invest-
ment period of the interim project. Cost estimates are given in Tables 8
through 11.

/1  Equity would consist of (a) EAP revolving credit fund contributions converted to Government equity.
Contributions each year would be converted to eauity in blocks of
100,000 ordinary A shares of Le 1 each. Government equity would
stand at Le 1,385,000 by 1977;
(b) contributions of Le 5,000 from each of the three commercial banks for
5,000 ordinary B shares of Le 1 each, payable in 1975; and
(c) purchase of ordinary B shares by participating farmer borrowers as
a condition for receiving loans.
It has not been possible to quantify the farmers equity shares in the Balance Sheets,as shares would be
issued only against payment. Farmers would undertake to purchase shares as a condition of their loans
but would be allowed to defer payment until their loan repayments commenced.
/2 Loans from Governments would comprise all development loans granted to Eastern Area Project farmers
through the revolving credit fund up to 31st December 1974 together with all further development loans
granted in connection with the Eastern Area Project physical program extension up to 31st December 1977.
Thereafter repayments from existing farmer development loans would be adequate to finance the completion
of the latest planting loans. In addition to financing the development loans, Government would provide
finance for the seasonal rice loans up to the total requirement on an incremental basis. All Government
finance would be converted to Government equity in the form of ordinary A shares in blocks of 100,000 as
administratively convenient (see Footnote 1 above).
/3  Loans to Famer. for Development - figures are computed on the physical program and the terms of the
various types of loan less repayments. Repayments have been calculated in full but an allowance for
bad debts of approximately 10 percent has been charged against the income of each year.
/4  Cash - initially this figure represents the repayment of seasonal loans.  Seasonal loans for rice peak
at approx. Le 300,000. Cash balance above this amount represents net development loan repayments less
income deficit financing. No account has been taken of possible income from short-term employment of
| cash balances. Such funds would be available for up to five months a year.

/1  Interest Receivable - initial interest income arises solely from the 10 percent flat rate charge on seasonal
loans for rice. The development loans enjoy interest free grace periods of varying length according to the
crop type.  From 1977 onwards, income from development loans becomes material.  Wo. acpo    has been taken of
possible additional income from investment of short-term surplus cash (up to five months each year) outside
of the project.
/2  Bad Debts - it has been assumed that the comptniy will suffer bad debts of approximately 10 percent of interest
income and repayme-nt installments each year.  The bad debts have been written off as incurred.
/3  Administration Expenses - the cost if administration and staff would be borne by the existing Eastern Area Project
up to and including 1975 as financial provision was made for the administration of the revolving credit fund,
now converted  irnto the farmer finance  Dmpany. The proposed two-year extension of the EAP includes financing
for the administration cos-ts for 1976 and 1977.  Thereafter, it is envisaged that the annual administration                     X
costs o0  Ee 50,000 (see Annex  1 , Table 3 ) would be financed from the companyls own generated incomeon the
assemptiorxs  that t:e bad debts level does not exceed 10 percent of annual incorme and repayments and that the
.nteresn b sIncoine is incrcased by the profitable employment of th.; cash surplus.

OIL PALM PRODUCER FFB PURCHASE PRICE FORMULA
1.        The basic principles to be followed by the Daru Oil Mill Company
to formulate the purchase price for fresh fruit bunch payable by the Daru
Oil Mill Company would be attached as an Annex to the Company's Memorandum
and Articles of Association, and would incorporate the following:
(a) each calendar month, the Company would publish the previous
months average mill gate price received for oil and palm kernels;
(b) the ex-mill value of the derivatives of a ton of producers'
fresh fruit bunch (including the Company Estate) would be de-
rived from the mill gate (i.e. mill tank value for palm oil and
mill store value for naked palm kernels) value by:
Mi) first, deducting an agreed amount, per ton of palm oil
and per ton of naked palm kernels, in lieu of profit,
depreciation, long-term loans and working capital charges
and standard company tax attributable to the operations
of the mill;
(ii) second, deducting any levies, cesses, or duties imposed by
any taxing authority of Government, other than standard
company tax; and then
(iii) applying rates of extraction of oil and kernels from
producers' fresh fruit bunch, agreed on the basis of
monthly factory tests satisfactory to Government.
(c) The purchase price of fresh fruit bunch payable by the Daru
Oil Palm Company to producers (including the Company's own
estate) would be the ex-factory value of the derivatives of a
ton of producers fresh fruit bunch less the following agreed
charges:
(i) agreed mill operating costs, including management, but
excluding depreciation and working capital charges; and
(ii)  transport costs for collection and delivery to the mill of
producers fruit.
2.        The price for fresh fruit bunches payable to producers as derived
above would not include debts payable by producers relating to oil palm
production. These payments concerning loan servicing for seasonal and de-
velopment loans would be deducted from the producer fresh fruit bunch price
by the mill on behalf of and in consultation with the credit lending institu-
tion.
