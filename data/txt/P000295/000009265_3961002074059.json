levels; liberalizing (external) trade in\n            traditional cereals; liberalizing the consumer price of\n            rice, the price of paddy, and the processing of rice;\n            restructuring of the National Cereals Marketing Board, and\n            limiting its role to the maintenance and management of food\n            aid and food security stocks; reforming the

rationalizing the role of various ministries\n            and agencies intervening in the agricultural sector, and\n            undertaking a manpower review of the main agricultural\n
