SECAL I) in Burkina Faso. This program aims at\n            deepening and extending to the agricultural sector the\n            reforms undertaken through SAC I in order to: (i) modernize\n            and diversify agricultural production; (ii) increase food\n            security; and (iii) improve natural resource management. The\n            objectives of AG. SECAL I have been partially achieved.\n            Progress has been substantial in trade and price\n            liberalization, tariff reform, strengthening of cotton and\n            sugar sub-sectors, and food security. Overall, the Bank\n            performance has been satisfactory. The Borrower's\n            performance was highly satisfactory during the preparation\n            of the adjustment program, which was comprehensive,\n            participatory and consistent with the new national economic\n            policy. The Outcome of the AG. SECAL I can be considered\n            satisfactory, as substantial progress has been achieved,\n            especially in the fields of price and trade liberalization\n            for traditional cereals, livestock and oilseeds, tariff\n            reform, rehabilitation of the cotton and sugar sub-sector,\n            and food security. However, full completion and\n            sustainability of some measures and reforms need further\n            support. The summary of findings and key lessons are the\n            following: 1) Preparation and implementation of the program\n            should have explicitly included appropriate consultation and\n            monitoring arrangements and more flexible planning, in order\n            to broaden ownership and adapt to changes deriving from the\n            democratization process; 2) To increase commitment and\n            reduce the risks of reversals, adjustment programs should\n            contribute to increase the political and economic influence\n            of farmers by setting an adequate legal framework which\n            would facilitate their political representation, and\n            supporting the development of farmer organizations at\n            national, regional and local levels; 3) Contract-Plans\n            (cotton and sugar) between a State-company and the State\n            should have permitted a better definition of the contractual\n            obligations of the two parties and provided for a framework\n            of actions in the context of increased autonomy; and 4)\n            Privatization efforts need to be supported by a better\n            knowledge of the real situation and potential for private\n            sector involvement."}, "docdt": "1996-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
