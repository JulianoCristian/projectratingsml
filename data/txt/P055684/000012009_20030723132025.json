Lessons on project\n            design, and management suggest that institutional reform can\n            be more efficient when articulated around two complementary\n            levels : a broad institutional reform process, involving the\n            key stakeholders, and an experimental reform process in one\n            of the system institutions that serves as a pilot, and a\n            reference to advance, and structure the broader reform. The\n            two levels are mutually reinforcing each other, and lead to\n            institutional changes that are more relevant, and acceptable\n            to all concerned stakeholders, rather than duplication of a\n            model developed separately as an experiment. Moreover, the\n            choice of an institution to provide the piloting process for\n            a wider reform, is more effective when designed around an\n            on-going experiment that has already shown some positive\n            results, while the development of a pilot in an institution\n            requires an assessment of the organizational, and managerial\n            capacity of the institution to carry out the experiment, and\n            to ensure that it has the capability to implement activities\n            according to objectives, and the flexibility to adapt to\n            results. Sector technical lessons indicate that reform in\n            francophone tertiary education systems, can be more\n            effective if it uses successful reforms already carried out\n            in the French system (here the IUT - University Technical\n            Institute - system) that can be relevant to the country\n            labor market environment. However, developing a cooperative\n            relationship with the private sector, when weak at project\n            preparation, takes time, thus, the private sector needs to\n            be convinced that real, and sustainable benefits can be\n            gained from this cooperation. Research, particularly as\n            technical support to enterprises, can be a very efficient\n            approach to (a) provide a better understanding of the\n            technological needs of enterprises, (b) earn self generated\n            resources for the institution, (c) help improve the\n            productivity of enterprises, and, (d) build-up the image of\n            the institution, and its cooperation with the private sector."}, "docdt": "2003-07-16T00:00:00Z"}
