Education\n            Technical Training Project are to: (i) encourage existing\n            private sector enterprises to become involved in the\n            management, the selection of courses, and the development of\n            curricula in public sector higher education institutions;\n            (ii) involve private sector enterprises in the training of\n            higher education students in both public and private sector\n            institutions; (iii) insist on following up regularly the\n            employment situation of students in the year following their\n            graduation, and the attitude of employers to the training\n            these students have received; (iv) allow a range of\n            different types of courses depending on market demand; short\n            courses requested by employers, sub-degree, degree, or post\n            graduate, regular full time, part time, or evening; (v)\n            encourage institutions to raise a substantial proportion of\n            the non salary recurrent resources they will need from\n            non-governmental sources; and (vi) allow institutions full\n            financial autonomy and control in the utilization of all\n            self generated resources.  The project components include:\n            (i) the strengthening of existing disciplines through the\n            introduction of new training options requested by local\n            industries; (ii) the addition of new disciplines and system\n            coherence; and (iii) institutional development, evaluation\n            and follow-up, and sustainability of policy initiatives."}, "docdt": "1998-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
