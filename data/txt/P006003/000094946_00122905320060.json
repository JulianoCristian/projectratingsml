Maintenance and Rehabilitation\n            Sector Project's outcome is rated as highly\n            satisfactory. The lessons drawn from this project include:\n            1) The Argentine experience confirmed that strong government\n            ownership and commitment can help bring about dramatic and\n            positive changes in highway sector policies within a\n            relatively short period of time. 2) This project has also\n            shown that the implementation of an optimized network\n            rehabilitation and maintenance strategy can effectively\n            bring an entire road network back into a satisfactory\n            condition over a period of a few years and at a reasonable\n            cost. 3) Proactive supervision and restructuring of the\n            project as soon as critical assumptions have changed were\n            essential to achieve the development objective: in this\n            case, by the end of 1995, stock of subprojects ready for\n            bidding was lacking and the design and adoption of the CREMA\n            (Contract of Rehabilitation and Maintenance) system proved\n            to be an appropriate solution for facilitating the use of\n            the Bank loan. 4) Good quality of project design at entry,\n            full Borrower's commitment and innovativeness, sound\n            highway maintenance policies involving private sector\n            participation, Bank flexibility in revising the Loan\n            Agreement, as well as good support to supervision missions\n            from decentralized Country Management Unit are factors that\n            played a vital role in bringing about the success of the project."}, "docdt": "2000-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
