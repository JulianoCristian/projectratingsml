It will also include flood\n            emergency works.  The project contains a major technical\n            assistance and training sub-component aimed at:  (a)\n            strengthening the Secretariat of Public Works and\n            Communications for its important role in establishing\n            policies and goals in the road sector; (b) strengthening\n            DNV, and particulary its regions, for the new role it has to\n            play with regard to supervision of concessions, technical\n            leadership, coordination and support of the impact\n            assessment; (c) improving the capability of the Provincial\n            Highway Directorates (DPVs) to plan, manage and execute\n            roadwork properly; and (d) reinforcing DNV's\n            capabilities in carrying out national programs for traffic\n            safety, control of vehicle weights and dimensions, and other\n            activities of such scope that it is not advisable to assign\n            oversight responsibility to each province.  The project also\n            supports the preparation of a Manual on Environmental\n            Assessment of Road Projects to be systematically used in DNV\n            and disseminated to DPVs.  The project will provide for\n            acquisition of related equipment, and technical assistance\n            to study alternative options of a proposed transport link\n            between Argentina and Uruguay."}, "docdt": "1993-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
