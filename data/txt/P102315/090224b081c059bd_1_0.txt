                         This is the last ISR being filed for the Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SMDF) Project that has a closing date of May 31, 2013. The SMDF Project in the amount of US$
                         11.81 million, funded by the MDTF-N, with a grant agreement signed on May 22, 2007. The Project became effective on April 14, 2008, with an original closing date of June 30, 2011.

                         RELEVANCE: The project was restructured twice (level two) at the request of the government. In doing so, the project was extended in May 2011 by 12 months and then again in

                         March 2012 for an additional 11 months for a final closing date of May 31, 2013. The restructuring and closing date extensions were expected to help the Project fully utilize the
                         remaining funds, in a nascent microfinance sector. The team used this restructuring opportunity to streamline the overdue realignment of the PDO indicators and intermediate result
                         indicators. The changes were undertaken to better reflect the contribution of the project to the microfinance sector with respect to outreach, gender distribution, and the performance
                         of microfinance providers.

                         EFFICACY: Based on the April-May 2013 implementation support mission, the Project made moderately satisfactory progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives
                         (PDO) to increase the availability of affordable financial services to 200,000 households by supporting the emergence of commercially sustainable microfinance service providers.
                         The PDO indicators are: (i) direct number of beneficiaries, including the percentage of women, (ii) the portfolio at risk, and (iii) the number of operating microfinance providers.
                         Overall, the project has achieved the number of beneficiaries envisaged under its development objective, with over 490,000 people with access to microfinance in Sudan. The
                         outreach includes 302,000 clients served by commercial banks and 189,600 by MFIs. The Microfinance providers supported by SMDF have a total of 8,588 active loan accounts, with
                         47.2% reaching women. Lastly, the portfolio at risk (PAR) is 1.83%.

                         EFFICIENCY: The financial analysis in the project document MFI financial performance was be a key determinant of access to financing under the project. In order to remain eligible
                         for financing, MFIs were required to maintain a high quality loan portfolio with no more than 5 percent Portfolio-at-Risk (past 30 due). The project has reached this target based on the
                         reporting MFIs, with a PAR of 1.83%. The ongoing impact evaluation may provide information on the profitability of the MFIs, which was the other aspect covered in the financial
                         analysis.

                         PROJECT-END DISBURSEMENT RATE TO BE REVISITED. The current disbursement rate of 91% is expected to be revised upwards by the time the project closes. This is
                         primarily due to the pending lines of credit and ongoing technical assistance work. The final disbursement rate will depend on the eligibility of MFIs to become eligible for the second
                         tranche of the lines of credit, as the project requires absorption of 80% from the first tranche, to become eligible for the second one.

                         FIDUCIARY MANAGEMENT: With regard to Financial Management, the FM rating remains at moderately satisfactory (MS). Similarly, the FM risk rating remains the same as M
                         (moderate). The financial audit of 2012 is progress well and this audit is due on June 30, 2013. The audit for 2013 will be carried out after project closing, and the project has been
                         informed to cover this from counterpart funding.

                         PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT: All the procurement of contracts for technical assistance have been completed and the work is currently in progress. As agreed during the
                         November portfolio review, which assessed the new proposed work plan, the first mission in 2013 had the responsibility of reviewing and assessing all the remaining activities in the
                         procurement plan to determine the feasibility of completing the assignments by the project’s closing date of end-May 2013. The result of this assessment carried out in February 2013
                         the cancellation a number of activities due to the lack of sufficient time to complete the assignments by the project’s closing date. The procurement of the remaining activities was
                         completed on time, including the hiring of the firm to carry out the impact evaluation.
