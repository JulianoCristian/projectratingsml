                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation progress of all four project components has shown progress since the last ISR. The goal of reaching 200,000 people with access to microfinance has been
                         achieved, with over 209,000 Sudanese accessing financial services through MFIs and commercial banks. Activities under component one have been implemented, including the
                         microfinance policy and the guidelines for monitoring and evaluation of the sector.

                         After the departure of the Frankfurt School in July 2011, SMDF has been in a transitional period. Moreover, the microfinance industry in Sudan is also in a transitional phase, with the
                         government currently preparing a new Microfinance Strategy that will set up the future roles that organizations will play in the sector, including SMDF and the Microfinance Unit in the
                         Central Bank.

                         There are many changes currently in progress in SMDF such as the review of the role of the General Assembly, the selection of a new board of directors, and the completion of the
                         staffing of SMDF. As a result of these changes, together with the restructuring of the microfinance sector in Sudan, the implementation of the project has slowed down during the last
                         five months, making it difficult for the project to achieve its disbursement targets by June 30, 2012. However, CBOS plans to continue supporting SMDF and the counterpart funding
                         will be used for SMDF to maintain its role as a wholesaler for microfinance. SMDF's financial and management sustainability will depend in the role that is meant to play as part of the
                         new National Microfinance Strategy.

                         As of April 2, total MDTF-N funds committed to the SMDF project amounted to US$ 11.8m, while accumulated disbursements amounted to US$9.53m, representing a disbursement
                         rate of 81 percent.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The key decision related to the project continues to be the future sustainability of the Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SMDF) as a microfinance Apex institution in Sudan.
                         On February 15, 2012, the Ministry of Finance and National Economy requested an extension of the closing date of the project to June 30, 2013. The extra 12 months will ensure that
                         the project achieves its development objective and effectively utilizes the remaining funds. The SMDF is formulating, in close consultation with the Bank, an activity program along
                         with a disbursement plan until the requested completion date of June 2013. The extension request will be discussed during the next OC meeting in early-May and if supported, the
                         SMDF project will be extended until June 30, 2013.
