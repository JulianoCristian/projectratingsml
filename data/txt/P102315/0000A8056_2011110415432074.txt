                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation progress of all four project components has shown progress during the past six months. Improvements in the implementation pace are as a result of stronger
                         SMDF and Central Bank of Sudan - Microfinance Unit (CBOS-MFU) coordination, specific and technical interventions undertaken by Frankfurt School and the World Bank continued
                         implementation support. This has had noticeable improvements in the level of the SMDF capacity and has expedited the firm's operations delivery.

                         The management contract with Frankfurt School ended on July 31st, 2011. The MFU is currently managing the SMDF, with the Deputy Director of the MFU appointed as the interim
                         MD of the SMDF. The SMDF Board continues to support the firms' core business activities through scheduled business proposal review periods for both the Executive Management
                         Committee and full Board meetings.

                         The SMDF's financial and management sustainability remains a challenge for the firms# future continuity, this will pose a significant challenge as the MDTF approaches its end on
                         June 30, 2012. Financially, the firm continues to rely on MDTF and CBoS grant financing. The SMDF will need to increase its income from various activities including 'fee for services'
                         such as advisory services to the banks, and its investment income in order to supplement its operational income and reduce its reliance on grant funding. The SMDF's current mix of
                         TA and Financing/equity portfolio remains at 30%-70% and actions to revisit the firms' financial position and sustainability plan are continually being considered. However, this will
                         need to be weighed with the challenge of building the technical capacity of the microfinance sector in Sudan. The SMDF sustainability plan was presented by Frankfurt School to the
                         SMDF Board of Directors and is currently going through further discussion and consideration. Options to be pursued under the plan focus on supporting the SMDF#s operating cost,
                         while re-evaluating the company#s five year financial and operational sustainability plans.

                         Limited available technical capacity in the Sudanese market presents an on-going challenge to SMDF as the firm strategizes its future expansion and sustainability. The focus of the
                         SMDF has been on providing technical support, to build the capacity of MFI's rather than financing potential microfinance institutions. Continued effort is required to ensure that the
                         basic foundations of the sector are suitably established. The weak technical capacity has also impacted the SMDF directly.

                         There has been notable progress in terms of results, including a substantial increase in the number of MFI's, client outreach and completion of the microfinance sector regulatory
                         framework. The government of Sudan has recently renewed its commitment to microfinance as a poverty alleviation tool and will consider further support to the sector. The regulatory
                         framework, completed and approved in October 2010, governing the microfinance institutions, is currently in place and provides the basis for the strengthened CBoS supervision of
                         MFI sector.

                         Disbursements are progressing well. As at 23 September 2011, total MDTF-N funds committed to the SMDF project amounted to US$ 11.8m, while accumulated disbursements
                         amounted to US$8.52m, representing a disbursement rate of 72 percent. The disbursement rate is expected to reach 89 percent by the close of CY2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The key decision related to the project continues to be the future sustainability of the Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SMDF) as a microfinance Apex institution in Sudan.
                         Covering the SMDF's operational costs from its operational income will take time given the level of development of the sector and the fact that loans are just being made to several
                         MFI's. The SMDF's sustainability plan presents several scenario's, however in the near term, continued support from the Sudanese authorities (CBoS and MOFNE) will be necessary.
                         The extension of the project closing date by an additional year till June 30, 2012 and the addiitonal financing of $1.81 million have contributed towards increasing the likelihood of the
                         project achieving its development objectives, however the concern will be support post-MDTF.
