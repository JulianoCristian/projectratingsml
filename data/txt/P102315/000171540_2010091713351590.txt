Dear Mr. Holi,

First Amendment to the Grant Agreement
We refer to the
 Grant Agreement (the “Agreement”) for the above-mentioned Project (the

We also refer to your letter dated June 17, 2010 requesting certain amendments to the Agreement. We are 
pleased to inform you that IDA agrees to your request and proposes to amend the agreement as follows: 
 
1. 
In the first paragraph, the amount of the grant shall read eleven million eight hundred and ten 
thousand United States Dollars (US$11,810,000). 
 
2. 
The definition of “Sub-Grant” at Article I, Section 1.02(g) of the Annex to the Agreement is 
modified as follows: “Sub-Grant" means a sub-grant including other forms of financing (such as loans, 
loan guarantees and equity investment), 
or technical assistance 
permitted under the SMDF corporate 
charter, made by the SMDF to a Sub-Grant Awardee, under the Project for the carrying out of one or 
more Sub-Projects.” 
 
3. 
The table at Article III, Section 3.01 of the Annex to the Agreement is replaced by the table
