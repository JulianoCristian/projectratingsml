The original\n            closing date for the project is June 30, 2011. It is will be\n            extended to June 30, 2012. Delays in project implementation\n            were encountered in the set up phase of the Sudan\n            microfinance development facility. Project implementation\n            was further hampered by the fact that the microfinance\n            sector in Sudan is relatively nascent and the weak capacity\n            of personnel in the microfinance sector in Sudan. All funds\n            have been committed to various activities related to\n            sub-projects for technical assistance, loans and equity.\n            This extension will enable the project to fully disburse the\n            allocated funding for the project and allow the project the\n            come closer to achieving its development objectives. The\n            project extension will also give us an opportunity to\n            continue to seek a broader policy discussion with the\n            authorities on the microfinance sector in Sudan."}, "docdt": "2011-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
