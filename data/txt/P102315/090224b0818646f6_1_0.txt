                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved the number of beneficiaries envisaged under its development objective, with over 210,000 people with access to microfinance in Sudan.

                         The project was meant to close on June 30, 2012, but after the MDTF-N was extended, the project was also extended, and now closes on May 31, 2013. This extension will allow for
                         the project to achieve its objectives, and allow for the Central Bank and MoFNE (shareholders) to decide on the future of SMDF after project closing.

                         Since the last supervision mission (March 2012), the project has been impacted by a transitional period from two different angles. Firstly, the MFU assigned a permanent director in
                         April, and SMDF’s new board of directors was formed in July. Currently, SMDF has reached 87% of MDTF disbursement. If the balance from the designated account is included, the
                         project still has a balance of over USD$2 million. While the project was able to disburse around $1,000,000 during the first two quarters of 2012, Since then th project has disbursed

                         less than $250,000. Reasons for these slow disbursements included the inability of SMDF to adjust to problems experienced in MFIs, and the impossibility of approving new projects.

                         After the MFU director came on board, a momentum has started with the board being formed two months after. The new chairman of the board has set a new tone, which the mission
                         welcomes. The priorities of the new board include the hiring of a managing director, which position has been advertised, completing staffing plans, and reassessing the work plan for
                         both MDTF and CF.

                         During the portfolio review (November), the World Bank and SMDF agreed to have flexible work plan, so that new MFIs can be added to it. This is an important way for SMDF to
                         better respond to market conditions. The number of consultancies being procured will require close monitoring by the project given that there are only five months left before project
                         closing.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The key decision related to the project continues to be the future sustainability of the Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SMDF) as a microfinance Apex institution in Sudan.
                         Now that SMDF has a new board of directors, it is key for them to assess the future of SMDF after the project closes on May 31, 2013. It would be important for SMDF to attract
                         donors for further support after project closing.
