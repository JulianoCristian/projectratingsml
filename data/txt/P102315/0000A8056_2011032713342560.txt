                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The four project components have been progressing at an improved pace during the period under review due to coordination and closer implementation oversight by CBoS-
                         Microfinance Unit (MFU), the World Bank continued implementation support, direct technical and fiduciary support and constant consultations with the client and stakeholders on the
                         project's progress.

                         There has been notable progress in terms of results, including a substantial increase in the number of MFI's, client outreach and completion of the microfinance sector regulatory
                         framework. The sector's regulatory framework, including its monitoring and evaluation tool, was drafted, finalized and approved by the CBoS Board in October, 2010. The regulatory

                         framework, which governs the microfinance intermediary institutions is currently in place and will provide the basis for the strengthened CBoS supervision role of the MFI sector.

                         With the approved MDTF additional financing of $1.81 million, a one year extension of the contracted firm, Frankfurt School of Management and Finance (FSFM), was signed in
                         September, 2010. The contract extension includes a revised TORs, with the key activity of providing technical support to the SMDF to develop its management and financial
                         sustainability plan. The SMDF Board continues to support the firms' core business activities through scheduled business proposal review periods for both the Executive Management
                         Committee and full Board meetings. SMDF financial and management sustainability remains a challenge for the firms future continuity. Financially, the firm continues to rely on MDTF
                         and CBoS grant contributions. The SMDF will need to increase its income from various activities including 'fee for services' such as advisory services to the banks, and its investment
                         income in order to supplement its operational income and reduce its reliance on grant funding. The SMDF's current mix of TA and Financing/equity portfolio remains at 30%-70% and
                         actions to revisit the firms' financial position and sustainability plan is in progress. However, this will need to be weighed with the challenge of building the technical capacity of the
                         microfinance sector, particularly that of MFI's in Sudan.

                         Limited available technical capacity in the Sudanese market presents an on-going challenge to SMDF as the firm strategizes its future expansion and sustainability. The focus of the
                         SMDF has been on providing technical support, to build the capacity of MFI's rather than financing potential microfinance institutions. Continued effort is required to ensure that the
                         basic foundations of the sector are suitably established. The weak technical capacity has also impacted the SMDF directly. The process of building SMDF management has shown
                         limited progress during the last six months. While direct technical support is provided by FSFM international consultants, the SMDF local staffing process has been at its early buildup
                         stages where at present the firms' total technical and administrative staff coverage is at 75%. Plans to meet SMDF 100% full local staff target is planned to be reached by the first
                         quarter of 2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The key decision related to the project relates to the future sustainability of the Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SMDF) as a microfinance Apex institution in Sudan.
                         Covering the SMDF's operational costs from its operational income will take time given the level of development of the sector and the fact that loans are just being made to several
                         MFI's. Work is underway with regards to the SMDF's sustainability plan. However continued support from the Sudanese authorities (CBoS and MOFNE) will be necessary. The
                         extension of the project closing date by an additional year till June 30, 2012 will increase the likelihood of the project achieving its development objectives.
