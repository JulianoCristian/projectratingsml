for Burundi were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in post\n            conflict situations, the peace-building process is the key\n            objective, while the governments\u2019 capacity to rebuild the\n            nation is usually low. Therefore, helping the government to\n            generate employment and rebuild infrastructure is among the\n            key priorities. To this end, the design and scope should\n            focus on quick and easy implementation, with rapid and\n            visible deliveries/outputs. For cost estimates, substantive\n            contingency funds (in this case, costs overruns and\n            financing gaps amounted for one-third of the total project\n            funds) should be included together with conservative cost\n            assumptions. National Roads Agency (Office des Routes), or\n            OdR needs to increase its absorption capacity by improving\n            its programming skills and implementing road maintenance\n            works accordingly. Regarding the National Road Funds (FRN),\n            its resources (the proceeds from fuel levies) should be\n            directly paid on its accounts and not transit through an\n            account at the treasury where it may be transferred to roads\n            rehabilitation and new construction, or even used to cover\n            other gaps in the country\u2019s budget. Finally, a\n            well-functioning FRN is paramount for sustainable road\n            network conditions. FRN demonstrated its good performance,\n            especially through the successful use of ACDs."}, "docdt": "2016-02-01T23:42:02Z"}
