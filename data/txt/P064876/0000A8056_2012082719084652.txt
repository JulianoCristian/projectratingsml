                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The main agreements reached between the Bank team and the Government during the supervision mission in June 2012 are as follows:

                         � The delegations agreed to request an assessment of the road maintenance system reform involving the road agency OdR (Office des Routes), the road fund FRN (Fonds Routier
                         National) and the road construction equipment agency ALM (Agence de Location de Materiél) in order to draw lessons on the effectiveness of the entire system. The assessment will
                         also address the issue of transforming OdR into a true road management agency for the national road network;
                         � It was agreed that FRN, OdR and the Project Management Unit (PMU) will explore possibilities to realize a strategic study on tolling options through tollbooths and / or weighing
                         stations on Burundi's priority road network in order to improve long term funding for road maintenance and rehabilitation.
