                                     Restructuring Paper


 A. Summary

1.     This Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director to extend the
Closing Date for seven months, from December 31, 2013 to July 31, 2014 for the
Burundi Road Sector Development Project (Additional Financing Grant Number H684-
BI). The proposed restructuring is based on the Government’s request dated August 9,
2013.

2.      The proposed restructuring will help complete ongoing activities and implement
remaining activities, which are critical for the attainment of the project development
objectives (PDOs).

 B. Project Status

3.       The Burundi Road Sector Development Project (RSDP) original Credit IDA-3874
was approved by the Board on March 18, 2004 in the amount of SDR 34.3 million (US$51.4
million equivalent). The Agreement was signed on April 2, 2004, and became effective on
September 9, 2004, with a closing date of December 30, 2009. The Credit was extended twice
from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, and from December 31, 2010 to June 30 2011,
to allow completion of implementation commitments and enable processing of an Additional
Financing (AF). The original Credit IDA-3874 closed on June 30, 2011. An additional
Grant in the amount of SDR 12.2 million, (US$19 million equivalent) was approved by the
Board on April 05, 2011 and became effective on August 11, 2011, with December 31, 2013 as
its closing date, bringing total International Development Association (IDA) financing for
the Project to SDR 46.5 million (US$70.4 million equivalent). The AF was specifically
designed to complement the spots improvement works on national roads NR 1, 3, 7 and 10, and
the rehabilitation works on some of the provincial and communal earth roads, which were not
completed due to unanticipated cost overrun of US$7.3 million and a financing gap of US$11.7
million under the initial Credit. Institutional support to the Road Agency and to the Ministry of
Transportation, Public Works and Facilities was also included in the AF activities.

4.       As of October 30, 2013, US$7.6 million (40.6%) of the AF has been disbursed and about
US$11.1 million remain undisbursed while contractual commitments have reached 88 percent. As
of July 31, 2013, most of the targets of the outcome indicators have already been achieved.

5.      The Task Team confirms that the requirements of OP/BP13.30 (Closing Dates) will be
met, specifically: (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of the
Borrower is satisfactory; (c) the team has received an action plan from government with an
updated procurement plan to complete the project within the revised closing date; and (iv) there
are no outstanding audits, or IFRs for the Grant. The progress on implementation of the

                                                1
activities under the various components has been reflected in the Implementation Status
Reports (ISRs). Project achievements thus far include: (i) restoring 161 km of trunk roads
through rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works; (ii) generating more than 40,000 jobs for
the rural poor; and (iii) improving institutional capacity in the road sector such as an increase in
the National road maintenance resources from US$ 2.5 million in 2005 to US$9.1 million in 2012
and expected to reach US$13 million in 2013. Despite a favorable SDR – US$ exchange rates
during most of the implementation period, the project registered a financing gap and cost overrun
of about US$19 million funding gap, caused by increased construction prices, increased scope of
works on paved roads works and legal claims on two contracts.

C.      Rationale for Proposed Final Seven-month AF extension

6.       Although there have been delays, implementation is progressing reasonably well and the
PDO is likely to be achieved. All rehabilitation works of earth roads under component 2 have
been completed and the implementation of the road maintenance program under component 3 is
performing well. The main outstanding activity is the contract for the paved roads
rehabilitation works in the amount of US$10.5 million (55% of the Grant amount), under
component 1, which was signed on April 1, 2013, for a duration of about eight (8) months,
inclusive of contractor’s mobilization. The contractor has experienced some delays in mobilizing
which has resulted in a 4-month lag in the contract execution period. The delay is mainly due to
the following reasons: (a) increase of quantities in some activities like treatment of slope
stabilization works that are now required after the last rainy season; (b) difficulties by contractor
in putting in place adequate organization to cover works on all the 5 different roads concerned
simultaneously; and (c) anticipated slow execution of rehabilitation works during the rainy season
from September 2013 to January 2014. In addition, this extension will also help to complete the
institutional support underway: (a) at the ministry level, to help the sector clarify its strategic
approach and, (b) at the Road Agency level, to improve the management and maintenance of the
national road asset. For the latter and beside the support to the OdR accounting and financial
section, the project is developing with the road sector a three-fold support: (i) reviewing the
global organization and functioning of the OdR in order to ensure more efficiency in the
management of the national road asset; (ii) re-launching the road data base management system
assuring regular and adequate collect, management and update of the road condition data and
assuming the use of this data to establish the annual road maintenance program, and; (iii)
assessing the multi-year road maintenance contract experienced under the Burundi-RSDP with
national small and medium enterprises and propose measures to improve and globalize this
approach for the national road maintenance program. The assessment will also evaluate the
contract award system of the entire road maintenance works (including processing within OdR
and relationship with RMF). All these activities are being launched and the extension of the
closing date will help complete and implement their conclusions.

7.     The ratings for achievement of Project Development Objectives and
Implementation Performance are moderately satisfactory, as documented in the last
archived Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) dated August 13, 2013. The project
development objectives continue to be achievable.

8.     Furthermore, overall safeguards compliance is moderately satisfactory and there
are no unresolved legal or safeguard issues. The existing financial management
procedures and guidelines for the Project will remain unchanged in substance, based on
the continuing adequacy and reliance of the financial management systems for the
                                                 2
project. There are no outstanding audit reports and the interim unaudited financial reports
have met fiduciary compliance.

D.      Proposed Changes

9.      Except for the proposed seven-month extension of the closing date from
December 31, 2013 to July 31, 2014, this restructuring does not entail any change to the
overall scope of the project or the PDO. The entire Project will be 10 years and 4 months old
at the time of the new closing date of July 31, 2014.

10.     Implementation schedule. Discussions with various stakeholders (Road Agency,
Supervision Firm, contractor and also with the Minister of Public Works) led to an action plan
which has been agreed upon between the Government and the contractor to ensure completion of
works. The contractor is committed to reorganize and mobilize more equipment in order to cover
the various work sites simultaneously in light of the rainy season, from September 2013 to
January 2014 The action plan, finalized by the Client, for a six-months’ extension of the
contract’s deadline (which is contractually planned for December 02, 2013) focuses on the
following: (a) completion of mobilization of equipment and qualified staff, by the contractor; (b)
close monitoring of the contractor organization for the works execution in order to be able to
continue implementation during the rainy season even at reduced pace; and (c) absorption of
increase in quantities of slope stabilization works. The implementation schedule will be
revised to reflect the extended project closing date of July 31, 2014.
