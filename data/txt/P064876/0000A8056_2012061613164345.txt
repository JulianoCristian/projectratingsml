                         This ISR is based on a final supervision mission that took place from June 22-July 5, 2011. It maintains the "Satisfactory" Project Development Objective (PDO) rating. All project
                         development objectives have been met and most intermediary indicators achieved except the unpaved road network objective whose rehabilitation works have reached only 10

                         versus the stated goal of 14% of the network length. This gap (due to cost overrun and financing shortfall) will be covered under a US$19 million dollar Additional Financing which
                         became effective on August 11, 2011. The Client is in full compliance with all legal dispositions. The financial audit report for 2010 has been reviewed and rated "Satisfactory" by the
                         Bank's Financial Management Unit. This mission maintains the Moderately Satisfactory rating for the Environmental Safeguards based on the results of an environmental audit of the
                         last civil works carried out on RN 1, RN 7 and unpaved roads. The audit report submitted to the Bank prior to this mission is largely positive. A remedial action plan to fully address
                         minor shortcomings is included in the mission aide-memoire and will be implemented under ongoing maintenance contracts on these roads and monitored during the supervision of
                         the Additional Financing. The Credit amount of US$54.5 million (6 % above the original amount of US$51.4 million thanks to exchange gains of the Standard Drawing Rights # SDR-
                         over the US dollar) is fully committed and disbursed at 98%. Its undisbursed balance is expected to be fully utilized by the end of the project grace period on October 31,2011.

                         Additional Financing: In order to bridge a financing gap and further consolidate the gains of the project, an additional Grant of US$19 million was approved by the Bank's Executive
                         Board of Directors on April 5, 2011. The Financing Agreement of the Grant was signed on May 17, 2011 and declared effective on August 11, 2011. The Additional Grant will be
                         implemented over a 30 month period extending to December 31, 2013. While the original project closed on June 30, 2011, its Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be
                         combined with that of the Additional Grant, and published by no later than June 30, 2014.
