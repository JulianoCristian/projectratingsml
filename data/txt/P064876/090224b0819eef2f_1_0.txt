                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following key decisions were reached during the December 2012 implementation review mission:

                         � An agreement was reached to better assess the road maintenance system reform including the road agency OdR (Office des Routes), the road fund FRN (Fonds Routier National)
                         and the road construction equipment agency ALM (Agence de Location de Materiél) in order to make the entire road maintenance system more effective. The assessment will also
                         address transforming OdR into a viable road management agency for the national road network.
