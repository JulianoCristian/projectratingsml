1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal

Country Background

1.      Burundi is a small landlocked country. The nearest sea gate is some 1,500 km at the
Indian Ocean. Since its independence in 1962, Burundi has been stuck in an unending cycle of
conflict. Successive waves of violence—particularly in 1965–69, 1972, 1988, 1991, and 1993—
have increased ethnic and regional divisions while deepening the already existent extreme poverty.

2.      Over the past decade Burundi has enjoyed moderate gross domestic product growth
of about 4 percent, but poverty remains widespread. With a gross domestic product of about
US$2.4 billion in 2013, the annual per capita income was about US$240. The share of the poor
population declined by 6 percent between 2006 and 2012, but remains very high at 60 percent. The
country remains among the ten poorest countries in the world, with a Human Development Index
of 0.389 in 2013, which is well below Sub-Saharan Africa’s average, estimated at 0.502 for the
same period. The population is widely dispersed across the country and the livelihood of nine out
of ten Burundi people depend directly or indirectly on farming.

3.      Between 1992 and 2002, international financial assistance fell dramatically, from an
annual average of nearly US$300 million to an annual average of less than US$100 million, largely
because of the resumption of violent conflict in 1993. After the conclusion of the Arusha Accord
in 2000, donors pledged substantial amounts of development assistance. Unfortunately, a
significant proportion of this assistance has not been disbursed, partly because of persistent
insecurity and political uncertainties. The current political tension further to the presidential
elections in May 2015 needs to be calmed to see the resumption of a more inclusive development
agenda.

Sector Background

4.      Internal transport within Burundi and its international exchanges are totally
dependent on the road network. Burundi’s small size limits internal air traffic and rail traffic
could not be envisaged for domestic transport only, because of low volumes, high investment costs,
and the country's sociopolitical situation. Nonetheless, on a regional scale, studies are ongoing to
see the opportunity for the construction and rehabilitation of a regional integrated railways network.
For its agriculture products, (which accounts for more than 50 percent of the country’s national
product) trade, and international exchanges, the country depends essentially on its international
road transport, given the high cost of air traffic and the unreliability of traffic on its waterways.
The high cost of infrastructure development,1coupled with equally high transport costs, were major
inhibiting factors in a predominantly agricultural economy.

 Studies conducted for road works revealed unit costs as high as US$236,000 per km for asphalted double surface
sealing.



                                                        1
Rationale for Bank Assistance

5.       The Bank’s assistance was primarily needed to cover the major financing gap in the
transport infrastructure sector. The country was facing post-conflict competing priorities and
did not have the financial and human resources to address transport infrastructure gaps and reforms
challenges without external assistance. Furthermore, the road network of Burundi is denser than
that of its neighbors, and exceeds the country's capability to maintain it.

6.      The Bank’s assistance was needed for coherence and consistency. The project was
designed to build on the results of previous IDA financed transport projects since 1970, with the
Highway Engineering Project (US$0.4 million equivalent), followed by: (a) the Highway
Maintenance Project (US$5 million equivalent) in 1974; (b) the Second Highway Project (US$14
million equivalent) in 1978; (c) the Third Highway Project (US$25 million equivalent) in 1981;
(d) the Fourth Highway Project (US$18.1 million equivalent) in 1985; and (e) the Transport Sector
Project (US$43.2 million equivalent) in 1990. All those projects aimed to assist the Government
of the Republic of Burundi (GoB) in improving transport planning and management, the road
maintenance system and program, road investments, and institutional capacity.

7.     Contribution to higher-level objectives. By improving transport connectivity and
contributing to employment generation (including for war veterans and women), the project is
considered to have contributed to boosting peace and the population’s welfare and living
conditions, especially of the poor. This higher objective was consistent with the Arusha Accord
and the Bank’s Africa Action Plan.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

8.    As described in the project’s legal documents, the initial Development Credit Agreement
(DCA) and the Financing Agreement for the Additional Financing (AF), the PDO was to contribute
to Burundi's post-war revival by restoring part of the priority road network, generating
employment for the rural poor, and improving institutional capacity in the road sector.

9.     To measure attainment of this PDO, the following key outcome indicators and key
performance indicators were used:

        (a) Restoring part of the priority road network. Increase in annual expenditures on road
            maintenance (interim benchmark: by midterm review the National Road Funds [Fonds
            Routier National, FRN] road maintenance budget is doubled).

        (b) Generating employment for the rural poor. Percentage of active population
            employed under the project (benchmark: 30 percent of the Community Development
            Associations [ACDs] 2 established and 60 percent of major road contracts under
            execution).

 For routine road maintenance works, the contracts are signed between the FRN and local SMEs who, in turn,
subcontract the manual works to ACDs. The workers are directly paid by the FRN. An ACD is a community

          (c) Improving institutional capacity in the road sector
                  Maximum time spent on International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and Quality-
                   and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procurement: 24 weeks (interim benchmark:
                   32 weeks).
                  Maximum number of days between reception of invoice and payment: 15
                   (interim benchmark: 20).

10.       The following impact cross-sectorial indicators were also included:
          (a) Gender empowerment/social inclusion. At least 30 percent of ACD membership is
              female (interim benchmark: 15 percent)
          (b) Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
              (HIV/AIDS) Prevention. 95 percent of ACD members have received information,
              education, and communication (IEC) counselling (benchmark: 30 percent)

1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

11.       The PDO was not revised throughout the project’s life.

12.     Nonetheless, the results framework, including some of the PDO indicators, were revised
during the project’s restructuring during the preparation of the AF to introduce new mandatory
core indicators and to drop or rephrase previous indicators, as shown in table 1.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

13.    The PAD stated that the direct beneficiaries of the project would be road construction firms,
individual consultants, consulting firms, community populations, business communities, and
farmers. The other main beneficiaries of the project were also the road users (transporters, travelers,
and so on), roadside population, and more vulnerable population, namely veterans and women.
The project’s investments in road rehabilitation and maintenance clearly contributed to delivering
the expected benefits to the project beneficiaries by creating business opportunities and increasing
connectivity.

14.     In addition, the PAD estimated that through the increased economic activities induced by
the project, the banking system would also benefit from the project; likewise, the government
treasury was considered to benefit from the project through the World Bank’s financial support,
with the initial credit and the subsequent grant for the AF.

1.5. Original Components

15.    The components were designated as ‘parts’ in both the original project DCA (Parts A to E)
and the AF Financing Agreement (Parts 1 to 5). For ease of reference, this Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) is mainly referring to ‘components’ (except in the listings
below) and indistinctly between components ‘A to E’ or ‘1 to 5’.

       (b) Incremental operating costs associated with project implementation.

       (c) Vehicle for logistics of project implementation.

1.6. Revised Components

21.     In 2011, the AF Agreement slightly revised the original project’s components as follows,
to continue activities initiated under the initial credit.

Part 1. Rehabilitation of Paved Classified Roads

22.     Completion, control, and supervision of civil works for the rehabilitation of part of paved

                                                6
Part 5. Project Management Support

25.   Support for the management of the project, including financial management, procurement,
M&E, reporting, auditing, as well as preparing follow-on activities.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

26.      Extension of closing date. As previously indicated in the data sheet, the project underwent
five restructurings, including the preparation of an AF. Each restructuring included an extension
of the project’s closing date. The project became effective on July 1, 2004 and was expected to
close on December 31, 2009. Five extensions for a total of 61 months were required to complete
all of the project activities under the original and AF. As a result, the project implementation lasted
for 10 years and 6 months.

27.     Additional Financing. With the AF of SDR 12.2 million (US$19 million equivalent)
approved by the World Bank in April 2011, total project funds went up to SDR 46.5 million
(US$71 million equivalent). The AF mainly aimed to complete the activities financed by the initial
credit that could not be achieved due to an unanticipated cost overrun of US$7.3 million and a
financing gap of US$11.7 million. To this end, it adjusted the project’s components and undertook
restructuring in outcomes and output indicators, but kept the same PDO.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation

28.     The project design took into account the main lessons from the Transport Sector Project
which was to keep its objectives as simple as possible. It also drew lessons from experience in the
road sector in Sub-Saharan Africa, notably concerning the establishment of new generation road
funds (with sound financial and administrative autonomy in relation to the supervising ministries,
to efficiently ensure maintenance of the road network) and the state’s withdrawal from former
inefficient force account practices in road works.

29.     The project was prepared in a participatory manner and included various stakeholders, local
communities, and other donors involved in the transport sector to ensure consistency and
coherence in its approach. This approach created more ownership from the rural communities as
the project employed people, including the most vulnerable ones, in road rehabilitation and routine
maintenance works. In addition to the achievements presented in the results framework regarding
the person-days financed by the project, it is worth noting that the local communities’ enthusiasm
was so high that by the end of the project, 113 ACDs were created whereas only 60 of them were
planned at appraisal. Furthermore, the use of ACDs to recruit people to maintain the roads is on-
going, after the project’s closing date.




                                                  7
Project Design

30.      The PDO was clear, but there was not a clear results chain between the project’s
achievements and the key indicators. The project’s key achievements, which were major
improvements in the road network condition, and employment generation, were diluted in complex
institutional reforms, involving too many stakeholders (see figure 1). A simpler design of this
component should have placed more emphasis on delivering concrete and clear outputs to achieve
the PDO, especially for its first two sub-objectives. The components related to road rehabilitation
and maintenance were sound and rather straightforward, measurable, and with a realistic aim to
reposition the network in a maintainable status. Likewise, the aim to generate employment for the
rural poor in road works was not only innovative but also fully adapted to the country’s context,
as rural people could find job opportunities in areas other than agriculture, in a country where land
is scarce.
                    Figure 1. Entities in the Transport Sector Involved in the Project




Quality at Entry

31.     The lack of security and safety during the preparation stage made it impossible to travel,
inspect the roads to be covered by the project, and make a realistic assessment of the construction
costs of the works to be carried out. As a result, a significant cost overrun, especially for
Component 1 (Rehabilitation of Paved Classified Roads), was acknowledged from the very
beginning of the project. Furthermore, as there was not much construction cost data in Burundi
available for comparison purposes at the time of appraisal, the costs could not be assessed with
realism.

32.     Likewise, the political risks were underestimated during the project’s preparation. More
specifically, frequent changes in key GoB officials in the transport sector, made it difficult to get
the government’s ownership and continuous commitment to the project.



                                                    8
33.    Lastly, the original implementation time frame for the project was far too optimistic
considering the country’s specific factors (among others, the political instability, the waves of
violence, and the inadequate capacity of the government and its implementing agencies), which
impeded smooth implementation of the project.


2.2. Implementation

34.     The following factors caused delays in the project’s implementation and the subsequent
need to extend the project’s closing date five times: (a) armed conflict in some project zones; (b)
borrower/ recipient’s low implementation capacity; (c) initial lack of proficiency in procurement
procedures; (d) initial poor execution of rehabilitation works contracts; (e) difficulties in the
mobilization of contractors; (f) weak implementation capacity of the OdR; (g) fiduciary staff
dismissal and reinstatement at the Project Management Unit (PMU); (h) frequent changes of high-
level decision makers; and (i) high staff turnover within the OdR and the PMU.

35.     The difficult conditions in the country were aggravated by the generalized inflation in the
road construction industry due to high fuel and bitumen prices which are key inputs. Under the
AF, delays continued for the implementation of the scheduled activities (especially, some road
works, the setting up of ACDs, and institutional reforms). The project team was able to modify the
project design by focusing all road interventions on critical spots improvements, which optimized
resource use. The involvement of the GoB in the financing of road maintenance through the FRN
strongly contributed to the improvement of overall roads conditions while demonstrating the
potential of the FRN to duly fulfil its mission. Furthermore, as previously indicated, the
employment generation through the highly successful creation of ACDs was beyond the project
expectations and continued after the project’s closing date.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.     M&E Design. The project’s M&E design was overly complex, with a total of 30 indicators.
As previously mentioned, the project’s key achievements in road condition improvement and
employment generation were unnecessarily diluted within unclear indicators. Most of those
indicators were of poor quality, as their direct link to the measurement of the PDO was not always
explicit and many of them had neither clear baselines nor end target values. As a result, some of
those indicators were never monitored and all the initial PDO indicators were revised or dropped
at the AF, as presented in table 1. Furthermore, there was an over emphasis on the number of
indicators related to sub-objective 3 (improving institutional capacity in the road sector) which
was not the most important one in a post-conflict situation. Simpler indicators related to road works
outputs could have been added during the preparation of the AF, such as: (a) the increase in the
number of spot improvements; and (b) the number of ACDs created.

37.     For ease of reference, the number of indicators and their status with regard to achievement
of their end target values is summarized in table 2.




                                                 9
                Table 2. Project’s Indicators Achievements Status at Project’s Closing Date
                       PDO Indicators                               Intermediate Indicators
           Initial (6)              Revised (6)              Initial (10)             Revised (8)
        4 achieved                5 achieved              7 achieved                7 achieved
        2 not measured            1 not achieved          3 not achieved            3 not achieved

38.     M&E Implementation. The frequent rephrasing and change of values of many indicators
during the preparation of the AF and during the project’s implementation phase (without any
formal restructuring) is indicative of the weakness of the above-mentioned M&E design. The
entities in charge of the indicators’ data collection and monitoring lacked both capacity and
incentives to closely monitor all those indicators. Nonetheless, the GoB eventually managed to
measure most of the indicators, with two-third of them achieving their target values (9/12 PDO
indicators and 11/18 outcome indicators).

39.     M&E Utilization. As project implementation progressed, GoB could more effectively
monitor progress made by the project and take corrective actions when possible to ensure that most
of the remaining problems were adequately addressed by the project’s closing date. Nonetheless,
the sustainability of the project’s M&E framework is questionable because of: (a) its complexity,
as described in the above paragraphs; and (b) the unclear definition of which entity would formally
continue the monitoring of key indicators once the project is closed.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Issues

40.     The project was classified as an Environmental Category B project, with partial
assessment, as the expected environmental and social impacts were minimal and site specific.
Environmental and social impact assessments for NR 3, 10, 1, and 7 and unpaved roads were
prepared and disclosed. There were no issues during the implementation of the road works, and no
long-term adverse impacts on the environment. That’ because the identified mitigation measures
were correctly implemented. From an institutional point of view, an environmental unit was
created within the OdR in August 2013.

Social Issues

41.     Project affected people were consulted during the preparation of the environmental and
social impact assessments for the planned road works, and before the commencement of works.
These consultations contributed to ensuring ownership of the project by the local communities.
Furthermore, project beneficiaries were also involved in project implementation under the ‘fee for
service’ contracts that were put in place by the local non-governmental organizations under the
Community Road Maintenance and Management (CRMM) activities.

42.     Studies concluded that the negative direct social impacts of the proposed project works on
local populations would be minimal. Furthermore, the project had positive social impacts such as
the following.



                                                    10
       (a) Job creation for the rural poor population, as over 40 percent of local income generated
           by the project's proceeds benefited the local poor through creation of jobs and income
           generation in the form of routine maintenance works and road management oversight
           (CRMM activities)

       (b) Integration of the HIV/AIDS prevention program in the road works: potential bidders
           had to propose, as part of their bids, an HIV/AIDS prevention strategy and action plan.
           To this end, non-governmental organizations were required for sensitizing and
           counseling ACDs.

       (c) Minimization of the social cost of institutional reforms in the road sector: all permanent
           staff in charge of previous force account road maintenance have been retained in the
           new institutions (OdR, FRN, and MTTPE), whereas the temporary road maintenance
           workers were compensated from the government's general budget.

Financial Management

43.     In general, financial management by the PMU was rated Moderately Satisfactory to
Satisfactory. The Financial Monitoring Reports were received regularly and were compliant with
the agreed format. Audits were done annually, on time and were unqualified, with one exception
which led to a downgrading of the financial management rating to Moderately Satisfactory. The
training provided to the financial and accountant staff allowed, for the first time in the OdR’s
history, to prepare its financial statement for 2013.

Procurement

44.     During the early stages of project implementation, procurement was slow, which delayed
the implementation of the civil works. Staffing at the planning unit within the MTTPE was
inadequate, with no procurement specialist for one year. Likewise, a new project manager,
arbitrarily dismissed the procurement and accounting staff of the PMU, who were all re-hired three
months later. With the AF, all procurement activities were executed in a reasonably efficient
manner.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/ Next Phase

45.     Transition arrangements post-completion of this project were put in place. Further to the
heavy rains in February 2014, that caused extensive flooding and landslides and damaged
infrastructure and property in and around Bujumbura, a new project, the Infrastructure Resilience
Emergency Project (IREP) (P150929) in the amount of US$25 million equivalent, was prepared
and approved by the World Bank Board on March 31, 2015. The IREP will among others continue
the emergency spot improvement works on NR 1 to ensure uninterrupted traffic circulation on this
vital road for the country’s economy. Since the RSDP’s closing date, the World Bank team
continues discussions with the OdR and the PMU to monitor the status of preparatory activities
until the IREP can finance the scheduled activities.

46.    Nonetheless, the recent political unrest and violence in the country linked to the
contestation of the presidential elections, which occurred during the time of the ICR, generated
major uncertainties about the World Bank’s operations in Burundi, including the signing of the


                                                11
IREP and its potential effectiveness, and a major concern about this project’s impact on
sustainability.

47.     In the medium term, the mobilization of much more significant amounts of resources will
be required to rehabilitate/reconstruct part of the paved road network of the country, which was
mostly built in the 1980s. The amounts provided to the RSDP and the IREP would only allow for
targeted interventions to keep the key roads passable and maintainable.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

48.     The relevance of the objectives is considered High. The PDO was to contribute to
Burundi’s post-war revival by restoring part of the priority road network, generating employment
for the rural poor, and improving institutional capacity in the road sector remains highly relevant,
even as the country seems to be re-engaged in a crisis cycle.

49.      The project was consistent with the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending poverty and
boosting shared prosperity through the scheduled roads investment programs, job-creating
activities, and policy reforms. The project is also consistent with the World Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) Performance and Learning Review for fiscal years 2013 to 2016,
especially with its Pillar One, Improving Competitiveness, by ensuring sustainable development
in rural areas, through a deeper focus on agriculture. To this end, restoring part of the priority road
network remains a key priority for the development of Burundi.

50.     The project was consistent with the government's strategy for the road sector, which aimed
to: (a) privatize the execution of all road works and create an enabling environment that places
SMEs and ACDs at the center of road maintenance; (b) promote greater involvement of road users
in road maintenance activities; and (c) establish a framework for road sector planning and
management that eliminates dispersion, integrates all interventions in the sector, and enhances
efficiency and synergy.

51.    Finally, the objectives remain relevant for Burundi as a Landlocked Developing Country
(LLDC) in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade
2014–2024 (Vienna, November 2014) which pays particular attention to the development and
expansion of efficient transit systems and transport development for the LLDCs.

52.      The relevance of the design is considered Modest. As previously indicated, the project
design was overly complex. More specifically, the causal chain linking the delivery of project
activities to intermediate output, and then, to outcomes that would achieve the project’s objective
was hard to follow. The project design placed far too much emphasis on the improvement of
institutional capacity, and not enough on the implementation of road works activities. More than
half of the total indicators were related to the improvement of institutional capacity (6 out of 12
PDO indicators and 11 out of 18 output indicators) whereas the corresponding targets were not
achieved (share of annual road maintenance budget disbursed; M&E system functional in the
MTTPE and the OdR; road database completed and tested at the OdR for paved and unpaved roads;



                                                  12
statistics system completed and tested in the MTTPE) or barely achieved (privatization of ALM;
number of OdR staff trained in relevant fields; number of SMEs trained in works management;
project implementation and completion reports satisfactory).

53.     The relevance of the implementation is considered Substantial. 78 percent of the total
project costs were allocated to road maintenance and rehabilitation works, significantly and clearly
contributing to: (a) the restoration of part of the priority road network; and (b) the generation of
employment for the rural poor through road works. Next, the contribution of the government in
the financing of maintenance works through the FRN after the AF is proof of an improvement of
the FRN’s institutional capacity to accomplish its mission. Last, thanks to the PMU’s strengthened
capacity, especially toward the end of the project, all the project’s scheduled activities were
completed.

54.    The overall rating of the project’s relevance is Substantial. This rating is based on the
following: (a) High relevance of the project’s objectives; (b) Modest relevance of its design; and
(c) Substantial relevance of its implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial

55.     The project achieved the indicator targets, reflecting, among other factors, the achievement
of its PDO. Furthermore, the ICR for this operation does not use a split rating evaluation for the
PDO, primarily because the PDO remained the same throughout the project’s life.

56.    The PDO —to contribute to Burundi’s post-war revival— is assessed in relation to its three
sub-objectives, as shown in the outcomes assessment after the outputs’ summary below.

Outputs

57.     The project’s key outputs were: (a) the sharp increase in the percentage of paved roads in
good and fair condition, from 16 percent of total classified roads to almost 70 percent; (b) increase
in the portion of earth roads in good and fair condition as a share of total classified roads, which
went from 7 percent to 28.5 percent; (c) rehabilitation of 308 km of non-rural roads through
periodic maintenance works; (d) annual maintenance of about 1,500 km of roads (of which about
1,100 km are paved and 430 km are unpaved roads); (e) establishment, as scheduled, of 31.7
percent of ACDs to carry out routine maintenance; (f) training of 22 SMEs in works management;
and (g) completion of all the scheduled design studies.

58.     To produce these outputs, the project supported the rehabilitation and spot improvement
works on paved roads (NR 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10) and unpaved roads (national, provincial, and
communal roads), which were of high value to ensure traffic flow on key NRs, keep them in a
maintainable status, as well as avoid their premature closing. In parallel, the project also
contributed to the preservation of road assets and in improving FRN capacity by supporting its
restructuring and allowing the increase of its annual dedicated resources from about US$2.5
million in 2005 to about US$15.4 million in 2014, of which almost 70 percent is dedicated to the
funding of the road maintenance program. The CAS Completion Report for CAS FY09 –12
acknowledged the RSDP’s achievements in this area by noting the doubling of the FRN’s funding
between 2007 and 2010 to improve road maintenance.

Outcomes

Sub-objective 1: Restoring part of the priority road network (67 percent of the project’s total costs)
Rating: High

59.     As indicated in the previously detailed project’s outputs, the share of rural population with
access to an all-season road achieved the targeted value of 40 percent, of which 52 percent are
female. Thanks to the works financed by the project, road closures could be avoided allowing
economic activities to continue in the areas served by them, the population to reach social services
(related to health and education), and the country to remain connected to its neighbors.

Sub-objective 2: Generating employment for the rural poor (12 percent of the project’s total costs)
Rating: High

60.    The number of persons employed on road works was surpassed, as indicated in the project’s
outcomes indicators. Moreover, 113 ACDs were created (vs. 60 scheduled), and the FRN is
continuing to replicate the same system to continue to generate employment for the manual road
maintenance works.

61.    The number of ACD members counseled on HIV/AIDS prevention surpassed the objective
of 27,000 by reaching 34,123 persons, of which 50 percent were female.

Sub-objective 3: Improving institutional capacity in the road sector (16 percent of the project’s
total costs)
Rating: Modest

62.      The project’s outcomes indicators concerning this objective relate to the improvement of
procurement capacity of the Borrower/ Recipient. Nonetheless, despite these outcome indicators’
achievements, all of which measure progress in the procurement process, the broader improvement
of institutional capacity in the road sector was clearly not achieved, especially at the MTTPE and
OdR levels, which are the key decision makers in the sector, with no key reforms achieved. The
most noticeable achievements under this sub-objective were at a lower level, with the FRN and
the creation of the mechanisms of ACDs (which continues even after the project’s closing date)
and the PMU.

63.     The project’s rating of its PDO (Efficacy) is rated Substantial. This is the result of a
High rating for its sub-objectives 1 and 2, and Modest for its sub-objective 3. In the context of a
postwar country, the assumption was made that the two first sub-objectives (restoring part of the
priority network and generating employment for the rural poor) appeared to be more important
and more urgent than the third one (improving institutional capacity in the road sector).

Split Evaluation of Outcome Indicators

64.     In table 3, only one PDO outcome indicator could be evaluated against the original and
revised targets before and after the AF because, for the rest, there are no original target values
available to allow for the weighting of the outcome ratings during the two implementation periods
by the disbursed amount at each period.

3.3. Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

65.     Efficiency is rated as Substantial. The rehabilitation of NRs under Component 1
represents 60 percent of the project’s total costs, including the spot improvements on NR 1, 3, 7,
and 10. For the rehabilitation works on the key national paved roads (NR 3 and NR 4) and the
periodic maintenance on NR 10, an ex post economic evaluation was carried out following the
same approach as the ex-ante economic analysis, using the Highway Development and
Management (HDM) model. Based on the analysis, with discount rates of 12 percent, the Net
Present Value (NPV) were all higher than what was scheduled during appraisal (details provided
in annex 3). This is because the significant cost overruns (mainly due to lack of reliable feasibility
studies at preparation, external shocks caused by the 2008 global economic crisis, and subsequent
commodities price increases) were partially offset by higher than projected traffic levels.

66.    Nonetheless, some measures taken during the project’s implementation helped contain the
cost increases: (a) some scheduled activities were reduced or dropped (for example, surface
treatment and other works which were estimated as less urgent on a section of NR 10); and (b) the

 Above end of target value achieved = Highly Satisfactory = 6; between 80 percent and 100 percent of end of target
value achieved = Satisfactory = 5; between 60 percent and 80 percent of end target value achieved = Moderately
Satisfactory = 4; between 40 percent and 60 percent of end target value achieved = Moderately Unsatisfactory = 3;
between 20 percent and 40 percent of end target value achieved = Moderately Unsatisfactory = 2; and below 20 percent
of end target = Highly Unsatisfactory = 1.



                                                        15
spot improvements approach, which reduced the length of roads to be treated, and focused on high
priority sections, allowed the GoB to address the most important and urgent maintenance priorities.

67.    Furthermore, in the absence of reliable data regarding the prices of imported and local
goods, interviews with truckers during the ICR mission revealed that during the closure of NR 1
to heavy trucks, they had to reduce their commercial margins by the equivalent of US$500 per
round trip per truck, which they could not reflect in the transport prices as it would have become
unaffordable for the shippers.

68.     Finally, for the rehabilitation of unpaved classified roads, which represent 7 percent of the
project total cost, together with the maintenance of roads, which represent 12 percent of the project
total cost, no formal economic analysis was carried out. However, based on qualitative analysis,
the works that were completed were done efficiently, as their costs were finally lower than
expected (US$4.5 million versus an estimate of US$9.5 million at appraisal) while completing the
total expected length of road (355 km actually rehabilitated versus 350 km as projected at
appraisal). All works were completed by December 31, 2013, giving 40 percent of targeted people
access to an all-weather road, with an average of 2,075 persons per km and a minimum of 1,319
persons per km compared to a national average of 710 persons per km. Major benefits to the
population stemming from road rehabilitations include classic benefits such as better road
conditions, decreased travel time , decreased vehicle operating cost (VOC), and lower costs for
road users (including farmers who export their products to markets).

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.      The overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory, due to: (a) continued Substantial
relevance of the PDOs, project design, and implementation to the Bank’s strategy and the country’s
priorities (please, refer to paragraphs 48 to 53); (b) the Substantial achievement of the PDOs (see
paragraphs 55 to 63); and (c) the Substantial efficiency of the project (see paragraphs 65 to 68).


3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.     The development of basic roads infrastructure reduced VOC, improved food security, and
access to education, health services, and market places. During the ICR mission interviews, it was
reported that the price for the transport of passengers using PR 205 diminished by 40 percent. At
the Gihogazi market, the team learned that the transport time was cut by half and the price for
freight transport was reduced because of the elimination of the ‘fee for bad road’ which was the
equivalent of about 3 liters of fuel (BIF 6,000 or US$3.84 equivalent). This factor directly
contributed to economic development, especially in rural areas where 90 percent of the country’s
population is living, while supporting regional integration.

71.     Furthermore, thanks to the spot rehabilitation at km point 17+320 on NR 3, the Médecins
Sans Frontières hospital at Kabezi is now protected against floods and can provide medical
assistance and is accessible in any weather condition.


                                                 16
72.     Finally, according to the CAS for FY13–16, “the participation of women in cash-for-work
in road works and in micro-credit schemes has helped increase Burundi women’s ability to be self-
employed.” This was confirmed by selected respondents during the ICR mission, were women
stated “the project gave us a voice, allowing us to buy health insurance for our families, send
children to school, and buy fertilizers to improve our crop”.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.      As indicated above, the project had modest achievements concerning the strengthening of
institutions. Nonetheless, the involvement of rural poor people residing along the roads to be
rehabilitated was innovative and ended up being more sustainable, as the FRN is continuing to
finance ACDs beyond the project’s life. The training provided to the financial and accountant
section under the project allowed the OdR to present its first financial statement for 2013, which
is a first since its creation and improves its financial accountability.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

74.    The project made the ‘peace dividend’ visible to large sections of Burundi’s rural
population in the form of improved welfare and connectivity.

75.     Furthermore, the improvement of Burundi’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) (see box 1
and table 4), notably concerning the timeliness and the overall score, can be partly attributed to the
project, particularly to the activities under the AF.

     Box 1. The World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI)
     The LPI measures performance along the logistics supply chain within a country. The LPI consists of
     both qualitative and quantitative measures and helps build profiles of logistics friendliness for these
     countries, based on evaluations of a country in six areas by its trading partners—logistics professionals
     working outside the country. The scores are from 1 (low performance) to 5 (high performance). The LPI
     uses standard statistical techniques to aggregate the data into a single indicator that can be used for
     comparisons between countries.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

76.    The risk to development outcome is High. The main reasons for this rating are the
following:

       (a) The current political turmoil and unrest in the country is likely to negatively affect the
           development of the sector. This will have negative impacts on the government’s
           commitment to long- term reforms.

       (b) The fragile achievements of the project that will be difficult to sustain are: (a) the
           FRN’s financial autonomy, to avoid its revenues being mainstreamed with those of the
           government; and (b) the creation of ACDs which are functioning well, but whose
           payments were late during the last months of the project. Such a situation may
           discourage ACDs members in the medium run.

       (c) The continued massive overloading by truckers, as legislation on vehicles’ maximum
           weights and axle load control is not enforced, partly because of the absence of
           equipment for such controls and partly because of vested interests.

       (d) The weak maintenance management system, partly due to the OdR’s lack of planning
           and implementing capacity, which may end up in roads being cut off, and would
           translate into the country’s isolation and significant losses for its economy, in general,
           and for the private sector, in particular.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

77.      The World Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory. The poor quality at entry of the project was the primary cause of the slow pace of
initial implementation of the project activities. More specifically, the following factors were key
in determining poor quality at entry: (a) an over-estimation of the implementation capacity of the
GoB, not only from an institutional point of view (at the ministry and OdR levels, aggravated by
high staff turnover within both institutions and within the PMU) but also regarding the transport
sector’s ambitious restructuring agenda, causing limited institutional development impacts; (b)
overly optimistic cost estimates required to properly fund the scheduled works, despite the
uncertainties of the Burundi road contracting markets, which led to major cost overruns/gaps,
necessitating the need for an AF; (c) the assumption that works would start immediately after credit
effectiveness whereas the readiness conditions (including implementing agencies and the
procurement process) were not in place; (d) poor design of the project’s indicators which were
either difficult to measure (even for baselines) and to monitor; and (e) political and security issues,
such as armed conflicts in some project zones, which were not adequately factored.




                                                  18
78.      Nonetheless, adequate attention was given to World Bank and government development
priorities, lessons from previous projects were largely taken into account, and the project’s scope
was adequate.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.    The World Bank’s performance in ensuring quality of supervision is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. The World Bank team tried to compensate with an enhanced
supervision effort, for the complex project design during its implementation. More specifically, 28
implementation support missions were undertaken during the project life which represents about
2.7 missions per year and is above the norm of 2 implementation support missions per year. The
proactive supervision effort demonstrates a high level of commitment from the World Bank’s side
to support the borrower in the project’s implementation process.

80.     Throughout the project’s life, the World Bank team consistently worked with the GoB to
develop action plans for compliance purposes and helped the GoB meet key outputs and outcomes
milestones. The World Bank was also proactive in processing an AF to cover the cost overruns
that affected the implementation of the project and worked closely with GoB to introduce and
optimize the cost effective spot improvement process under the project. As a result of the proactive
implementation support strategy, most of the scheduled activities under the project were completed.

81.    Nonetheless, the effects of various risk factors (price increases, low capacity of contracting
leading to delays, political influences, adverse climate, and so on) were not adequately reported,
notably under the original project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82.     The poor quality at entry and optimistic cost estimates had a negative impact on project
implementation, which could only be partly compensated by a proactive implementation support
strategy. Furthermore, a more aggressive approach should have been taken to restructure the
project during the implementation phase. Therefore, the rating for the overall World Bank
performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2. Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

83.     The government’s performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Political
instability negatively affected both the preparation and implementation of the project. Nonetheless,
several factors were under the government’s control and contributed to delays project
implementation. For example, the high turnover of ministers and director generals caused frequent
changes in direction and strategy for the transport sector and also unnecessary disruptions within
the PMU. As a consequence, the government did not show adequate ownership of the transport
sector reform agenda, and as a result, the scheduled reforms of the sector supported by the project



                                                 19
were not completed. Finally, the government did not always resolve implementation issues in a
timely manner.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     The performance of the agencies responsible for the implementation of the project is
rated Moderately Satisfactory. This is mainly due to the increasing effectiveness of the PMU
within the OdR during the last years of project implementation, as it significantly contributed to
the completion of the remaining works and therefore, to the achievement of the PDO. Thanks to
an increase in the FRN’s resources, the availability of financing for maintenance works was no
longer an issue. However, as a result of inadequate support by GoB, the Planning Unit at the
MTTPE was established late and most of its assigned objectives as described in Component D1
(Consolidation of the functionality of data management and planning systems in OdR and MTTPE)
and D2 (Implementation of the Road Sector Policy Action Plan) were not achieved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

85.     The project suffered from poor quality at entry in part due to the lack of capacity by the
GoB to prepare the project. Furthermore, although the road works activities funded under the
project were completed with delays, insufficient progress was made by GoB under the project to
reform the transport sector. That is why the overall borrower performance is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

86.     For post-conflict affected countries, projects objectives, designs, implementation
arrangements, and M&E should be simple and implementable. In post conflict situations, the
peace-building process is the key objective, while the governments’ capacity to rebuild the nation
is usually low. Therefore, helping the government to generate employment and rebuild
infrastructure is among the key priorities. To this end, the design and scope should focus on quick
and easy implementation, with rapid and visible deliveries/outputs. These measures would include
simple and measurable indicators (compliant with SMART –i.e. Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
Relevant, and Time-bound- approaches), light institutional arrangements, clear institutional
accountabilities, close supervision, and a quick decision-making process from both the World
Bank and the government to address issues as they arise. Lastly, country-based sector experts could
help in keeping momentum in the dialogue with the client to ensure daily follow-up, coherence,
and consistency in the Bank’s message.

87.     Potential Accuracy of cost estimates in post conflict situations: For cost estimates,
substantive contingency funds (in this case, costs overruns and financing gaps amounted for one-
third of the total project funds) should be included together with conservative cost assumptions.

88.    While strong institutions are among the pillars of sustainable development, it requires
time to build them. Institutional reforms should be modest and realistic, especially in a post-



                                               20
conflict country. Furthermore, an adequate time frame should be given to implement even modest
institutional strengthening agendas.

89.      For sustainable results in road condition improvements, OdR’s capacity and FRN’s
autonomy need to be strengthened. OdR needs to increase its absorption capacity by improving
its programming skills and implementing road maintenance works accordingly. Regarding the
FRN, its resources (the proceeds from fuel levies) should be directly paid on its accounts and not
transit through an account at the treasury where it may be transferred to roads rehabilitation and
new construction, or even used to cover other gaps in the country’s budget. Finally, a well-
functioning FRN is paramount for sustainable road network conditions. FRN demonstrated its
good performance, especially through the successful use of ACDs.

90.     ACDs and SMEs cooperation for maintenance works should be sustained in Burundi .
This approach is cost effective and generates social benefits, especially in a country where
innovative works for rural population are highly needed as land is scarce (as a result, some of the
population use every available piece of land, including the roads right-of-way for agriculture). To
this end, multiyear contracts should be used more often to ensure business continuity for both the
SMEs and the ACDs, and the system of payment to SMEs by the FRN should be simplified and
closely monitored to ensure monthly payment to the ACDs. These later should be strengthened to
help them retain their employees.

   Annex 2. Outputs by Component

   Component A. Rehabilitation of Paved Classified Roads

   1.     Under the original credit, this component consisted in the provision of financial and
   technical support for rehabilitation of part of the paved primary roads, comprising the following
   oads:

          (a) Rehabilitation of 161.8 km of NR 3, 4, and 10, linking major cities, production areas,
              and neighboring countries, and including protection works on River Rusizi
              embankments

          (b) Spot repairs on NR 1, 5, and 7, linking Bujumbura with the rest of the territory of the
              borrower

   2.      Under the AF, Component 1 consisted in the rehabilitation of part of the paved primary
   roads, comprising NR 1, 3, 7, and 10, through drainage improvement and spot rehabilitation.

   Rehabilitation of 161.8 km of NR 3, 4, and 10

   3.      The NR 3 is the main road link to Tanzania. The works included the rehabilitation of about
   30 km. However, the scheduled works were significantly delayed because of the contractor’s weak
   capacity causing a cost overrun, which necessitated the recruitment of a more expensive second
   bidder to complete the works. Consequently, the works on NR 10 and the execution of Component
   2 had to be downsized. On the positive side, during the implementation of the AF, a small check
   dam protecting a community of about 2,000 people against flooding could be built, in addition to
   addressing the critical spots along the road.

   4.     The NR 4 ensures the road link with the Democratic Republic of Congo. The works
   included the rehabilitation of about 10 km and protection works on River Rusizi embankments
   upstream the Concorde Bridge. There were no issues with this contract, except that the initial
   amount exceeded the appraisal estimation by 10 percent. By the end of the project, including the
   AF, there was a 7 percent increase of this activity’s cost, compared to the appraisal.

5. The works on NR 10 consisted of periodic maintenance on 122 km. There were significant issues:
   delays, costs, and volumes overrun. During the five years between assessment and the
   commencement of works and in the absence of maintenance works, the degradation progressed
   rapidly. Consequently, the parameters of the initial contract were downsized; this entitled the
   contractor to file a claim for US$1 million.

   Spot Repairs on NR 1, 5, and 7

   6.      There were no major problems with the corresponding contracts, except that the works took
   longer than planned (12.5 instead of 9 months). There were many changes to the initial identified
   spots because they are by their nature constantly developing. This required adjustment of quantities
   and deadlines.




                                                   23
Studies and Treatment of Critical Spots on NR 1, 3, 7, and 10 (Financed under the AF)

7.      The contract for the studies, monitoring, and control of critical spots treatment works on
NR 1, 3, 7, and 10, started in June 2012. At the preliminary design stage more than 60 critical
spots, spread across the four NRs (NR 1, 3, 7, and 10) were selected. However, because those
roads are old, sudden degradations appeared, shifting priorities during the works execution.
Moreover, because the studies and the control were entrusted to the same consultant, it made it
easier to adjust the studies to the actual conditions; besides, it allowed significant cost reductions.

8.      After the heavy rains that hit the Bujumbura area during the night of February 9 and into
the early hours of February 10, 2014, many infrastructures were damaged, particularly the NR 1
for which the estimate of urgent works for rehabilitation was US$4.9 million. As a result of savings
made with technical solutions applied to the treatment of critical spots (on NR 1, 3, 7, and 10) and
from other sources identified by the government, those works could be financed by the project.

9.       The initial contract covered 28 critical spots (23 firm spots and 5 optional). A total of 41
critical spots, instead of 28, were treated (increase of 46.4 percent with regard to the number of
critical spots treated), for a total amount of US$11.9 million (increase of 20 percent of the total
amount) with an implementation period of 17 months instead of 8 months.

Conclusions on the Execution of Component A

10.    The objective of this component was to have 56 percent of paved roads in good condition.
The goal was achieved since about 69.9 percent of national paved roads were in good condition at
the end of the project.

11.    Furthermore, by the end of the project, the roads where the interventions focused on spot
treatment were in a reasonably good condition. However, as these roads are old, new critical spots
continuously appear.

12.     It must be noted that the necessary works on NR 1 forced heavy traffic to use routes that
were not designed for such loads. Consequently, the PR 101 and 109 on which works were
finalized in 2013 under Component 2 were significantly damaged. Significant damage was also
recorded on NR 10, 7, and 18.

Component B. Rehabilitation of Unpaved Classified Roads

13.     Under the original credit, this component consisted of the provision of financial and
technical support for the rehabilitation of 350 km of unpaved secondary and communal roads, of
which 56 km of NR 18, 210 km of PRs, and 85 km of local roads are principally in the country’s
agricultural production areas.

14.   Under the AF, Component 2 consisted in the rehabilitation of the remaining approximately
100 km of unpaved classified roads including PR 101, 109, 120, and 124.

15.   Rehabilitation of 249 km of unpaved roads was done under the initial credit, whereas the
AF funded the rehabilitation of an additional 106 km.



                                                  24
16.     The progress and quality of works under this component did not pose any particular
problem other than those commonly encountered with SMEs which lacked skills in managing their
unit prices. Furthermore, the technical terms of the bid documents did not define with sufficient
precision the different tasks to perform, leading to mismatches between the estimated and the
actual costs.

Conclusions on the Execution of Component B

17.    The objective was to rehabilitate 350 km (or 14 percent) of the 2,500 km of priority roads
(provincial and/or municipal). With a total of 355 km rehabilitated, it was fully achieved. At the
same time, the percentage of people with access to an all-weather road as a consequence of works
under this component reached 40 percent (741,406 persons out of a total population of 1,853,517),
which was the target set for the end of the project.

18.     Almost all roads rehabilitated under this component were visited during the ICR mission.
They are poorly maintained and, contrary to what was foreseen in the project, they are not included
in the regular maintenance planning.

Component C. Road Maintenance and Management

19.    Under the original credit, this component consisted in the provision of financial and
technical support for various road maintenance activities.

20.    Under the AF, this component was entirely financed by the government’s counter part
funding contribution through the FRN. It consists of routine maintenance on 1,100 km of the paved
road network, routine maintenance of 250 km of earth roads rehabilitated under the project, and
periodic maintenance on selected roads of the classified paved network, through labor-intensive
and output-based contracting approaches.

21.     The overarching objective of the component was to maintain priority roads rehabilitated
under Components 1 and 2, with lengths increasing as the rehabilitation works advanced. The
progress was steady until 2013–2014, when the situation changed and resulted in a 32 percent
decrease in the total length maintained and a dramatic 65 percent decrease in the maintenance of
earth roads. The latter was mainly due to delays in processing and signing the maintenance works
contracts.

22.     Road maintenance works carried out under the RSDP were monitored by local consultants,
periodically supported by technical auditors. In addition, in 2014, the OdR commissioned two
diagnostic studies that assessed the performance in road maintenance, including the organization
and functioning of the OdR. The monitoring and the studies concluded that the maintenance system
established by the project with the ACD and SMEs is effective at both the organizational and
operational terms. However, the two diagnostic studies identified a number of shortcomings with
regard to the management and quality of maintenance. These studies proposed a number of
improvements to the current road maintenance system that would increase system performance,
such as the use of multiyear contracts for road maintenance, the monthly payment to ACDs
members, and so on.




                                                25
Conclusion on the Execution of Component C

23.     The project proved the relevance of the SMEs/ACD mechanism and also proved that the
use of roadside residents for maintenance works is ideal in a country with a high rural population
and high population density. The distribution of tasks between SMEs and ACDs was adequate and
well adapted to the level of skills of ACD members and supervisors. However, as confirmed during
the ICR mission interviews, the functioning of the mechanism is at risk because of delays in
payments, including ACD wages, and working conditions being deemed unsatisfactory.

Component D. Sector Management and Institutional Strengthening

24.    Under the original credit, this component consisted in providing financial and technical
support to agencies involved in the road sector, especially, the MTTPE, OdR, ALM, LNBTP, and
FRN.

25.    Under the AF, Component 4 consisted of: (a) consolidation of the functionality of data
management and planning systems in road agencies and the MTTPE; and (b) implementation of
the Road Sector Policy Action Plan.

26.    Specifically, the component financed the following activities:

       (a) Under the original project the following goods were financed:

                Equipment and spare parts for the ALM in view of its privatization. ALM was
                 therefore able to rent some equipment to SMEs; but those SMEs, which
                 improved their competitiveness in the construction market, managed to acquire
                 their own equipment.

                Geotechnical material for the LNBTP. This reinforced the LNBTP’s capacity to
                 cope with the increasing demand for tests under the project or for other
                 construction works.

       (b) Studies on implementation of the road database; institutional audit of the OdR, NRF,
           LNBTP, and ALM; study of road and inland transport strategy of Burundi; and the
           planning and asphalting of NR 1, 6, 7, 11, 12, and 13;

       (c) Consultants’ services for interventions of a strategic or institutional nature:
           environmental and social monitoring; technical assistance to the OdR’s Accounting &
           Finance Unit; evaluation of the socioeconomic impact of the RSDP; Technical
           assessment of the current maintenance works; organizational and functional assessment
           of the OdR and proposals for better organization; specific (ad hoc) technical assistance
           to the MTTPE for transport planning; and establishment of a road database.

Road Database Study

27.    The objective of the study was to raise the level of local expertise and provide the OdR’s
Planning Unit with modern and efficient tools for monitoring and managing the road network. The
study was only delivered in November 2010 instead of end 2008, as its course was disrupted by


                                               26
political turmoil (2008), delays in data collection by a third party contracted by the OdR, and the
2010 elections. It selected the VISAGE/ VIZIRROAD software for the road database but it was
not demonstrated that it was the most adequate to the local situation. In August 2013, the OdR
decided to start from scratch and set up a new database using the MAPINFO software. Further
support will be requested to move the process toward its end, subject to the appointment of trained
staff to the corresponding tasks.

Institutional Audit of the OdR, NRF, LNBTP, and ALM

28.      The objective of the audit was to conduct a diagnostic study of the main road agencies,
focusing on three elements: (a) the establishment of a comprehensive diagnostic of the four
institutions operating in the road sector; (b) the identification options for the privatization of the
ALM and LNBTP; and (c) the elaboration of proposals for training plans and any measure to
improve the capacity of the staff.

29.     The institutional audit of the OdR, NRF, LNBTP, and ALM was conducted at the
beginning of the project and made comprehensive recommendations, most of which were not
implemented. For example, no performance contract was concluded before December 2012 and
the proposals for improved organization of the OdR were not taken into account. As for the training,
the program was abandoned as a consequence of the GoB’s decision to abandon training outside
the country for the OdR’s staff while requesting that type of training for the cabinet of ministers
‘on an exceptional basis’. IDA’s position was that there cannot be two different approaches for the
same issue.

Study of Road and Inland Transport Strategy of Burundi

30.     The study made a very detailed analysis of the situation but without making concrete
proposals that could be implemented. It remained a drawer paper and therefore its ultimate
objective was not achieved.

Conclusions on the Implementation of Component D

31.     Although the equipment supplies, studies, and consultant services have been financed as
foreseen, there are no significant improvements in the sector management and institutional
strengthening. However, the studies and reports provide a comprehensive framework to continue
the efforts, including under the new emergency project, the Financial Agreement of which is
pending signature.

Component E. Project Management Support

32.    This component consists of the provision of financial and technical support to agencies
involved in project implementation and M&E.

33.    Under the AF, almost the same activities were supported.

34.    The technical audit helped the recipient’s agencies to improve their procurement skills, by
preparing, amending, and cancelling contracts, preparing for Bank’s supervision missions, and
notably preparing the midterm review. The auditor made recommendations of a technical or


                                                 27
organizational nature. Most of these have been implemented at the PMU level but few of them
have been implemented at the OdR level. The financial audit helped the recipient comply with the
general accounting principles and the Credit Agreement.

Conclusions on the Implementation of Component E

35.     The financial and technical support was provided as foreseen and within the deadlines.
Therefore Component 5 attained its objectives, especially regarding the PMU (which evolved into
a professional, skilled entity, which is an asset for the preparation and management of future
projects) even though the GoB did not fully implement the recommendations of the auditors.




                                              28
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The lack of security and safety at the project preparation stage made it impossible to carry
out a traffic survey for any of the roads under Component A, to duly document the economic
analysis. Nonetheless, the PAD includes economic studies for the works on NR 3, 4, and 10, based
on the HDM model. The economic studies for the other works under Component B were supposed
to be carried out during the project, but were never done.

2.      At appraisal, traffic on NR 3 and NR 4 was estimated based on 1992 traffic counts. The
economic analysis was carried out using the VOC model, based on the HDM model, which
calculates the VOC depending on the road’s roughness and other technical parameters. The initial
roughness of the road was 8 International Roughness Index (IRI) and would improve to 2 after
rehabilitation.

3.      For NR 3, the cost of the rehabilitation works was estimated at BIF 4.2 billion or BIF l40
million per km. The NPV of costs and benefits discounted at 12 percent amounted to BIF 5.2
billion (US$3.3 million equivalent). The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the high economic
interest of the works as the NPV, discounted at 12 percent, remains positive when costs increase
by 50 percent or benefits decrease by 50 percent.

4.       For NR 4, the cost of the rehabilitation works was estimated at BIF 1.6 billion or BIF 160
million per km. The NPV of costs and benefits discounted at 12 percent amounted to BIF 1.1
billion. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the high economic interest of the works as the NPV
discounted at 12 percent remains positive when costs increase by 50 percent. It becomes negative
when benefits decrease by 40 percent.

5.      For NR 10, the road conditions vary along the road and two technical options were
considered: single surface treatment (on sections in fair condition) and rehabilitation (of sections
in poor condition). The total cost of works was estimated at BIF 3.3 billion. The NPV of costs and
benefits discounted at 12 percent is positive on one section of the road only, where the level of
traffic was highest. On that section, the NPV amounted at BIF 3.2 billion. On the other sections,
the NPV was negative and only routine maintenance (patching of potholes) was to be carried out.

6.     A cost-benefit analysis conducted in December 2010 took into account the total cost of the
works completed under the original project and those envisaged under the AF (with the exception
of NR 10 for which works under the original project were excluded). The analysis compared the
annual VOC on each road with those on a credible deviation4 in good condition. Works envisaged
under the AF were considered economically viable if they yielded a positive NPV. The analysis
was based on the following assumptions:




4
 A credible deviation is an alternative road in good condition to which traffic would most likely deviate in case there
was disruption on the road under study.



                                                          29
       (a) A paved road in good condition has an IRI of 3 and an average VOC of US$0.30 to
           US$0.36 per km, depending on the road; an unpaved road in good condition has an IRI
           of 7 and an average VOC of US$0.39 per km

       (b) An unpaved road in poor but maintainable condition has an IRI of 12 and an average
           VOC of US$0.48 per km

       (c) Deviated traffic was determined from Origin/Destination surveys

       (d) Considered investment and maintenance costs include surface treatment and drainage
           structures (culverts and slopes)

       (e) A traffic growth of 5 percent in the first five years and 3 percent beyond

7.      To measure the efficiency of the activities carried out under the project, the same
assumptions and methodologies should have been used for both ex ante and ex post economic
analysis. However, none of the analysis performed at appraisal could be retrieved at the end of the
project and there were no systematic and comprehensive traffic counts on the roads covered by the
project.

8.      The borrower conducted a traffic count in January 2015 to compare it with the PAD
assumptions. Counts were made in 13 points on NR 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10. NR 3 is Burundi’s main link
to Tanzania, NR 4 is the most extensively used of all the roads under the project and ensures the
link with the Democratic Republic of Congo. The counts were carried out on two working days
and a weekend day, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.; the assumption is that this traffic represents 75 percent
of the daily traffic.

9.      Table 3.1 presents the comparison between PAD assumptions and traffic counts at the end
of the project.

10.    The ex post economic evaluation is made assuming that:

          the investment cost is the actual total cost of the work and supervision;

          the costs of routine or periodic maintenance correspond to those in the PAD considering
           the 5 percent increase per year;



                                                 30
          the benefits from VOC correspond to those in the PAD considering: inflation (5 percent
           per year), traffic growth (5 percent per year), and the traffic count done in January 2015
           (based on actual observed number of vehicles between 6a.m. and 6 p.m. which is
           considered as representing 75 percent of the total traffic; therefore, the adjusted traffic
           represents the estimated total traffic).

11.  The results of the evaluation for roads covered by Component 1 of the project are
summarized in the table 3.2:

12.     Conclusion: The result of the ex post economic analysis for NR 3, NR 4, and NR 10 show
positive NPVs.

13.    The result of the economic analysis for NR 1 and NR 7 show that for an investment of
US$11.44 million, the NPV is US$35 million and the IRR is 61 percent, as compared to PAD
where the estimated NPV was US$36.5 million and the IRR 51 percent.

14.     Regarding the rehabilitation of unpaved roads (Component 2), it was not possible to
retrieve studies justifying the choice of roads covered by the project’s components at the ICR time;
therefore, no economic analysis was carried out. However, logic indicates that they were selected
because of the significant impact on the access of population to an all-weather road. These roads
ensure the access of an average of 2,075 persons per km, compared to a national average of 710
persons per km.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
1.       The GoB provided a comprehensive implementation report, in French language, at the end of the
project.   The    report   is   archived     in   the   system     and    can    be    accessed     at
http://wbdocs.worldbank.org/wbdocs/drl/objectId/090224b083144980.

1. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

2.     The goal of the RSDP was to contribute to the recovery of Burundi at the end of the conflict,
by rehabilitating part of the primary road network, creating jobs for rural populations, and
improving the institutional capacity of the road sector.

3.     The RSDP was first financed through a credit in the amount of SDR 34,300,000. It was
appraised in February 2004 and declared effective on September 9, 2004. An AF to the project,
amounting to SDR 12,200,000, was appraised in March 2011 and declared effective on August 11,
2011. The project closed on January 31, 2015.

4.     The project comprised five components with the following achievements:

       (a) Rehabilitation of 161.8 km of classified paved roads

       (b) Rehabilitation of 350 km of earth roads of which 56 km are NRs, 210 km are PRs, and
           85 km are communal roads

       (c) Maintenance and management of roads, of which 600 km of paved NRs, 700 km of
           unpaved PRs, and 200 km of communal roads

       (d) Sector management improvement and institutional strengthening, except the
           privatization of the ALM and LNBTP and the effective functioning of the OdR

       (e) Support to project management

5.      The initial indicators of the project, as well as the ones introduced at midterm review were
regularly monitored and their targets were generally fulfilled, with the exception of the share of
FRN budget disbursed which only reached 65 percent instead of the expected 80 percent.

7.     The traffic measured in January 2015 on the rehabilitated paved roads show a net increase
compared to what was expected at appraisal. Despite the higher cost of investments, the operations
show a positive NPV and IRR.

8.      The entities of Burundi in charge of the implementation of the project may be rated
Satisfactory, based on their performance during the project’s implementation, although the
MTTPE was not able to proceed with the privatization of the ALM and LNBTP and unable to set
up an efficient sector database and the OdR was not able to implement the institutional and
operational improvements recommended in the different studies.

9.     The performance of the Bank was also rated Satisfactory in spite of the problems
encountered due to the underestimation of some of the OdR’s weaknesses at the preparation stage
of the project and during its implementation as the OdR sometimes delayed crucial decision-
making related to contract management.

10.      IDA has demonstrated very favorable reactivity to the project, for example, by setting up
an AF when it became evident that the initial amount allocated to the project would not be
sufficient to reach the objectives. At the same time, the project’s performance indicators were
adjusted regarding the end of target values and a spot improvement approach was adopted for NR
1, 3, 7 and 10 to rehabilitate the roads deteriorated by the heavy rains of 2014.

11.    The borrower has no observation regarding the project’s design: the results achieved with
regard to the improvement of the quality of the network and of its maintenance are self-
explanatory.

12.   However, some issues were underestimated, and this caused difficulties and delays in the
implementation of the project.

13.     The results can be considered as sustainable regarding the improvement of the quality of
the network, subject to the availability of sufficient financing and the continuation of mechanisms
set up under the RSDP for the routine maintenance and subject to the on time execution of periodic
maintenance, which is particularly necessary on NR 1 and 7.

14.     The mechanisms of financing and implementation of road maintenance initiated under the
project are efficient, but further improvements regarding technical and organizational issues, as
well as procurement, which are all under the responsibility of the OdR are needed.

15.    At the date of closure of the RSDP, the FRN is fully operational and is able to respond to
the country’s needs with regard to its road network maintenance financing. Its sustainability is



                                                 39
subject to the sole willingness of the authorities in the sector to respect the already set up
objectives, mechanisms, and procedures.

2. Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR

16.    The comments received from the GoB on the draft ICR are reproduced below in the form
in which they were received.

       (a) This report has done a keen analysis of all aspects of the project, emphasizing
           systematically the main findings including the lessons to be learned.

       (b) The summary of the findings is self-explanatory with numbers and ratings of
           performance on both sides—the Bank and the client.

       (c) The appraisal context and the background of the project has been revisited and helps to
           describe the main characteristics of the project’s implementation including location,
           historic dates, institutions, stakeholders, linkages, and methods applied to involve all
           different stakeholders, beneficiaries, and so on and this is clearly developed in the
           report.

       (d) Activities that were carried out are analyzed with respect to project objectives and
           conditions that prevailed during their implementation.

       (e) The main actors have been critically analyzed with professionalism. A focus has been
           given to the capacity of management on both sides—the Bank and the client.

       (f) Each phase of implementation of the project has been individually evaluated and a
           performance rating was given for both sides—the Bank and the client.

       (g) Difficulties and problems including external factors, which were part of the project
           implementation including the planning processes, have been adequately analyzed in
           this report.

       (h) Empirical data found in the report support the evidence of the findings. The report
           evaluated the overall performance rating as of January 31, 2015 to be Moderately
           Satisfactory.

       (i) Most of the Bank’s appreciations are similar to those of the GoB in this report of
           achievement.

17.    Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes are clearly described and some call
upon the GoB in particular the ministry in charge of the road sector and the OdR in charge of
implementation to be more responsible and proactive regarding the future of the road network in
Burundi. Below are highlighted specific comments from the GoB:

       (a) The road network in Burundi is denser than that of its neighbors and it exceeds the
           country's capability to maintain the network. From the GoB’s point of view, having a
           denser network is by itself a strength that should be reinforced. Maintaining the denser


                                               40
           road network in Burundi should continue to be the major concern for the Bank, not
           only because Burundi relies on it for the country’s development, but also because it is
           the best strategy to assist the country’s population which is in deep poverty partly
           because the country is landlocked and its development performance depends on the
           quality of the road sector.

       (b) The project design was kept simple to adapt it to the weak implementing capacity, and
           to reflect the fragile, post-war environment in which it was designed. High insecurity
           in the country prevented the teams from traveling and inspecting the roads to be
           covered by the project. This is true because when it comes to insecurity it is beyond
           one’s control. It may be called weak implementing capacity on the side of institutional
           arrangements, but in reality when faced with insecurity there is not much space left to
           one’s performance, be it a small scale or large one.

       (c) Burundi is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa and agricultural land
           is scarce. Local populations have often represented a threat to road works and assets,
           either through guerrilla hit-and-run acts of sabotage or by farming into the right-of-way.

       (d) The political risks have been under-assessed: the project has seen nine transport
           ministers and nine director generals of the OdR, followed by changes in high-level
           managers in the two institutions. These translated into uncertainties and delays because
           of changes of policies and directions and dismissal of procurement and accounting staff
           of the project unit. This is true. There has been a high turnover within these
           implementing institutions. Technically this has affected the project and has contributed
           to the shortcomings of its performances. The GoB would like to see continuous support
           from the Bank to address such challenges in the framework of global capacity building
           and absorption capacity strengthening of the sector.

       (e) The implementation was negatively impacted by the frequent changes in leadership and
           strategic directions, caused by political appointments at the top of the main agencies
           concerned, the MTTPE and the OdR. Action plans were constantly proposed by the
           Bank and agreed upon with the borrower but rarely implemented. This is equally true
           and the GoB requests the Bank to reinforce institutional leadership while continuing
           the dialogue on political economy.

       (f) A particular achievement under the project is the FRN, which was restructured and has
           increased its annual dedicated resources from about US$2.5 million in 2005 to about
           US$15.4 million in 2014, from which almost 70 percent is dedicated to the funding of
           the road maintenance program. The GoB appreciates this achievement and would like
           the Bank to continue its support to contribute to the efficiency in the maintenance
           expenses and in increasing the level of dedicated resources.

18.    The GoB has analyzed all lessons learned as contained in the project’s completion report
and found them all relevant. Where weaknesses have been pointed out, the GoB would like to see
the Bank assisting the GoB to reduce or eliminate those weaknesses, while continuing to strengthen
the positive achievements.
