Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Overall, implementation is progressing well and the PDO will be substantially achieved by the extended project closing date of January 31, 2015. More
 specifically, the results of the Burundi Road Sector Development Project (BI-RSDP) AF are as follow:
 a) Component 1. The spot improvement road works on the national road (NR) 1, 3, 7 and 10 will be completed by January 31, 2015 after three
 amendments to the initial contract to take into account: (a) additional road deterioration that appeared during the project implementation and the change
 in the technical solutions adopted for some of the initial critical points; and (b) emergency road works on the NR 1, the most important road in the
 country, caused by the severe floods that occurred in Bujumbura in February 2014. Globally, the RSDP and its AF would have completed, on the paved
 roads, rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works on 161.8 km on NR 3, 4 and 10 and spot improvement works on NR1, 3, 7 et 10 (comprising of
 drainage improvement and rehabilitation of degraded sections due to landslides, embankment deterioration, etc.);
 b) Component 2. All the planned 100 km rehabilitation works related to earth road where completed before December 31, 2013 (105 km finally
 completed instead of 100 km). This included the following provincial roads (PR) - 101, 109, 120 and 124. As such, the total length of earth roads
 rehabilitated by the Initial and AF projects amount 355 km;
 c) Component 3. The Government co-financed, through the National Road Maintenance Fund (FRN), part of the road maintenance annual program at
 the rate of three (3) hundred million of Burundi Francs (about US$ 193,500) per month. This amount which has reached about US$8.8 million during the
 AF period is primary dedicated for the funding of the manual recurrent maintenance by the ACD on about 1,500 km of roads (about 1,070 km of paved
 roads and about 430 km of earth roads);
 d) Components 4 & 5. All the institutional support planned in the components 4 and 5 are satisfactorily completed and their final reports approved by
 the OdR.
 e) The disbursement rate for the Additional Financing (AF) has reached US$17.98 million (95 percent) as of December 31, 2014, while contractual
 commitments have reached about 100 percent. It is expected that the disbursements will reach about 100% at the closing date of the project.

 There are no key decision for disclosure.

 Overall Comments
 The indicator related to the ACD members counseled on HIV/AIDS prevention as a percentage concerned only the initial credit and was replaced
 by "the number" of members counseled. It is the same case for the "Annual Road Maintenance resources (in US$ million equivalent)".

               Comments
               The two systems below were installed and staffs trained during the first part of the implementation of the initial credit. However, due to
               reassignment in other duty of the trained staffs the systems were abandoned. As regard to the Road database after the move back of 2 of
               the 5 staffs initially trained, a new road database is currently under establishment with also a support from EU. It is expected that the new
               Emergency project under preparation would also contribute to this new establishment.

               Comments
               For the roads rehabilitated, rural, there was a mistake in the calculation which appears when elaborating the completion report on the
               Government side. The figure is 45.87 km instead of 67 km.
