                         which the expression of interest has already been launched expected to start in August 2013, and be completed within three months. In addition, the OdR will share with the Bank a
                         revised action plan of support of its accounting and financial section for the compilation of its financial statements for the last 10 years.
                         � The OdR and the Bank agreed to launch an assessment of the multi-year (5 years) road maintenance contracts in August 2013, to draw on the lessons learned and to better
                         understand its gradual application to the main roads maintenance program in the future.
                         � The OdR and PUI will review the remaining activities under implementation and clearly identify those to be completed by the closing date of December 31, 2013 as well as activities
                         to be completed beyond that date (i.e. their completion dates, amounts committed and percentage of execution).
