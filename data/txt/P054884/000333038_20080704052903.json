Some lessons learned included:\n            payment system projects are complex, and building\n            understanding, capacity and necessary consensus can not be\n            underestimated in terms of the time needed nor in terms of\n            financial resources especially in an eight country\n            sub-region. Before undertaking a technically and\n            managerially complex project, the Bank needs to place a\n            special emphasis on assuring that adequate institutional and\n            procurement capacity is in place. Finally, with the\n            Bank's current emphasis on access to finance, a payment\n            systems project today may be structured differently: such a\n            project will probably not only focus on improvements in\n            wholesale markets, i.e. systemically important, but also on\n            all segments of retail markets where emphasis may be less on\n            competition and more on cooperation."}, "docdt": "2008-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
