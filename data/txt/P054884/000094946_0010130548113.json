A secondary objective is that the new\n            payments systems satisfy internationally accepted standards\n            and core principles and thus ensure a high level of user\n            confidence in the WAEMU financial systems. The project has\n            five components: The project support component includes\n            project management and monitoring, training, and\n            procurement. The RTGS component establishes a real time\n            gross settlement system at the regional level, which\n            includes transaction monitoring, management of settlement\n            accounts, management of transactions queues, exchange of\n            information with participants, and intra-day liquidity\n            management. The low value clearing component upgrades\n            existing systems at the national and regional levels. The\n            inter-bank card system develops a common bank card product,\n            enabling use in any ATM or participating merchant's\n            facility in the sub-region. The project includes a\n            feasibility study on the use of e-money systems for small\n            payments. For all three payments systems in this project,\n            the BCEAO's telecommunications satellite network would\n            be used to effect transactions with a degree of security and\n            at low cost."}, "docdt": "2000-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
