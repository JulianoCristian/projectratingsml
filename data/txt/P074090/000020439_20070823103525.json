as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: high level government support is key to success;\n            reliance on champions can backfire as the departure of\n            champions impacted the project in two ways: (i) momentum\n            built during project preparation was interrupted early on\n            and took until 2004 to resume; and (ii) initial investments\n            in communication devices were made redundant after the 2004\n            change in the IT strategy of the SCA, which decided to rely\n            on a different approach to rebuild the communication\n            network. Also, for a project of this type where seven to\n            eight agencies are involved, their active participation and\n            cooperation are essential for successful implementation and\n            achievement of project, objectives and also to ensure\n            sustainability. Finally, the cooperation between operational\n            staff and IT staff ensures that operational needs and\n            procedural modernizations will be translated into new IT options."}, "docdt": "2007-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
