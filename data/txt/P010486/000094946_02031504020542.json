variation in achieving objectives in\n            each of the project elements, and is a function of the\n            heavier weight given to the access and quality components,\n            both in terms of substantive priority and expenditure. A\n            \"likely\" rating was given for the overall project,\n            despite weak performance in several components, too because\n            of the heavy weight accorded to the access and quality\n            components. Both World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            rated marginally satisfactory.

Desired capacities, numbers of individuals who\n            would develop those capacities and desired outcomes or\n            indicators of progress should have been identified and\n            agreed to at the outset of the project. Financial management\n            systems and procurement procedures need to be understood and\n            in place at the beginning of the project, or provision needs\n            to be included in the project design to assist the client in\n            acquiring those skills. The technical/advisory teams would\n            have strengthened their impact by integrating themselves\n            better programmatically, physically, and\n            socially/psychologically into the on-going activities of the\n            education department.
