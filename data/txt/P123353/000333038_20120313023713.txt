                         CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

                 First Edo State Growth and Employment Support Credit
Borrower               Federal Republic of Nigeria
Implementing           Edo State Government
Agency
Financing Data         IDA Credit of SDR 48.4 Million (US$75 Million equivalent)

                       The credit has a final maturity of 40 years including a grace period of
                       ten years.


Operation Type         Development Policy Operation
Main Policy Areas   The main policy areas supported are: (a) improving the management of
                    public resources in implementing an infrastructure-oriented
                    development strategy by ensuring fiscal sustainability and improving
                    budgeting institutions and practices; (b) improving the institutional and
                    policy environment for growth and employment creation by improving
                    investment climate and the quality of education. A cross-cutting theme
                    running through these policy areas is that of improving social
                    accountability.
Key Outcomes        The following outcomes are expected as a result of the proposed
                    operation:
                     Edo state‘s budget remains fiscally sustainable through sustained
                        real growth in IGR and containment of the wage bill;
                     Credibility of the budget improves, reflected in the declining
                        deviation between actual expenditure out-turns and the approved
                        budget;
                     Transparency of expenditure improves through improved
                        procurement on account of regular publication of contract awards;
                     Improved timeliness in the submission of Audit Reports to the State
                        House of Assembly;
                     Improved follow-up on audit queries;
                     Time to register property falls significantly on account of simplified
                        procedures;
                     Increased percentage share of certified female science teachers in
                        total number of female teachers in rural areas;
                     Reduction in drop-out rates of female pupils at basic education level
                        in rural areas;
                     Increased number of accredited courses in technical and vocational
                        education institutions.
Program development The DPO‘s development objective is to support Edo State‘s critical
Objective(s) and    reforms for improving the management of public resources and creating
Contribution to CAS a better environment for growth and employment creation in a socially
                                              vii
                 accountable way.

                 The proposed Edo growth and employment support credit contributes to
                 all the areas of strategic focus under the Nigeria Country Partnership
                 Strategy. First, the policy area on improving the management of public
                 resources is consistent with the strategy‘s theme of strengthened
                 governance at state level, particularly in assisting states manage their
                 own resources more effectively, efficiently, and transparently. Second,
                 the policy area on improving the institutional and policy environment
                 for growth and employment creation will contribute towards the CPS‘s
                 themes on sustaining non-oil growth and human development, the
                 former through the program‘s sub-policy area of improving the
                 investment climate, while the latter through the program‘s sub-policy
                 area on improving the quality of education.
Risks and Risk   Macroeconomic risk: A significant fall in world oil prices or lower-than-
Mitigation       projected increase in non-oil revenue could reduce the Government‘s
                 fiscal space to undertake significant discretionally expenditures,
                 particularly on infrastructure development. With limited scope to borrow
                 additional resources, the Government could be forced to cut down on
                 some priority investment expenditures. To mitigate this risk, the Bank
                 will continue to advise the Federal Government on the need to establish
                 a more robust oil fund that would be insulated from ad hoc withdrawals
                 and hence build up healthy balances that would be used to cushion the
                 economy from negative oil price shocks. The Bank and other
                 development partners will also actively support the newly created Fiscal
                 Responsibility Commission, which will play a critical role in enforcing
                 the oil-price based fiscal rule.

                 Political risk: Edo will be holding Governorship elections in July 2012.
                 In the near term, there is a risk that political activities in the run-up to
                 the elections could distract the Government‘s attention to reforms, and
                 hence delay their implementation. Beyond the elections, there is also a
                 risk to the medium-term sustainability of the reforms being supported by
                 the DPO should a different administration emerge from the elections. To
                 mitigate these risks, the team will take three measures. First, conscious
                 efforts will be undertaken to identify and establish a critical mass of

                       THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
              FIRST EDO GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTCREDIT

                                         I.    INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document proposes the first growth and employment support credit
to the State of Edo for SDR 48.4 (US$75 million). It will be the first operation in a series of
three annual programmatic development policy operations, with a planned total of US$225
million, that are aimed at supporting the Government‘s policy and institutional reform program
in the implementation of the state‘s medium-term development strategy that is itself focused on
growth and employment creation.

2.      Edo represents an average Nigerian State in size and is famous for its rich history
and culture. Unlike the large city state of Lagos, or the relatively large state of Kano, Edo has a
population of approximately 3.5 million people which is close to the average population of a
typical Nigerian State. It is situated in the south-south regional zone of Nigeria that covers the
Niger Delta region. It is one of the nine oil-producing states, but accounts for less than 2 percent
of total oil production. It has an estimated poverty rate of 44.3 percent compared to the national
average of 51.6 percent, based on 2004 data.1 Edo was created in August 1991 when the defunct
Bendel State of Nigeria (itself created in 1963) was split into Edo and Delta States.

3.      Within a period of two years, a new, reformist administration has had a noticeable
positive impact on the state’s development landscape, particularly in the area of
infrastructure development. Soon after coming into office in November 2008, the
administration of State Governor Adams Oshiomhole announced that it would focus on the
rehabilitation and upgrading of the state‘s infrastructure, which had virtually crumbled following
years of neglect, poor planning, and compromises in quality. Openly admitting to have been
inspired by the transformation that had taken place in Lagos State, the Government moved
quickly to prepare plans for its infrastructure development programs. It also embarked on a
consolidation program with the view to expanding the fiscal space for capital projects. Through
improved efficiency and transparency in tax collection, and by expanding the tax base, internally
generated revenues (IGR) increased by 300 percent from N300 million a month in 2008 to N1.2
billion a month in 2010. The Government has also undertaken steps to reduce wastage in public
expenditures. For example, Edo became the first state in the country to introduce citizen‘s
identity cards based on biometric technology that will partly be used to manage the state‘s
payroll. Further, an expenditure control committee was established to explore ways of reducing
recurrent expenditures. As a result of these measures, and a deliberate change in policy, the share
of capital expenditure in the budget has increased from an average of 32 percent between 2005
and 2007 to 46 percent between 2008 and 2010. This has resulted in noticeable infrastructure

  A recent report released by the Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) seems to indicate poverty having
increased between 2004 and 2010. However, since such a trend seems at odds with the reported high non-oil GDP
growth rates during the same period, the Bank analytic team plans to work with the NBS technical team to confirm
the new poverty numbers.

development, focusing on construction and maintenance of roads, drainage systems, schools, and
health centers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that service delivery is already improving.

4.      In spite of progress made in service delivery, challenges still remain, including the
need to ensure sustainability of the gains made. The infrastructure development needs still
abound with huge financing gaps to be filled. For instance, there are still many schools at various
levels of education requiring rehabilitation. Similarly, although work has begun on the master
plan of the Benin City storm water drainage system, the financing requirements of its full
implementation are immense. Finally, Government systems remain largely weak which threatens
the long-term sustainability of progress.

5.      Going forward, the Government’s overall strategy is to mobilize more resources,
including from external sources, and to strengthen systems and institutions for sustained
progress. In terms of external sources of funding, the Government earlier in the year floated a
N25 billion bond from the capital market for infrastructure development. However, the
Government‘s preference is for more concessional sources of financing. At the same time, the
Government recognizes the importance of anchoring its infrastructure development program in
strong policies and institutions for sustainability.

6.       It is against this background that the proposed development policy lending support
is being extended to the Government of Edo State. The state becomes the second in Nigeria
after Lagos to benefit from this type of support. The instrument used is consistent with the
Bank‘s current country partnership strategy for Nigeria which seeks to strengthen governance
systems in states through among other instruments, DPOs. The design of the proposed DPO
builds on lessons learnt from the Lagos DPO as well as DPCs from other federal states, such as
Brazil and India, where sub-national DPCs have successfully been used to support policy and
institutional changes at the state level. A successfully implemented DPO program will have a
demonstration effect on other states in Nigeria on the benefits of being reform-oriented.

7.      Among the possible states that could receive this support in Nigeria, a critical factor
for the selection of Edo was progress made in implementing its development strategy and
commitment to carrying out policy reforms. After Lagos, which was a pioneer DPO state, it
was agreed with the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) that selection of subsequent DPO states
would be based on overall performance of a state against six criteria as follows: (i) having a
development strategy that is consistent with the national Vision 2020 and evidence of its
implementation; (ii) due diligence for public financial management in the form of a PEMFAR
being undertaken and concrete corrective actions for identified weaknesses formulated; (iii)
evidence that the state‘s fiscal program is sustainable and that the state is in good standing in
terms of its financial arrangements and obligations with the federal government; (iv)
participation and performance of the state in Governance and other Bank projects; (v) state‘s
position on the doing business rankings; and (vi) relevance to regional/geopolitical balance.
Overall, Edo performed well against all the criteria, but the most critical consideration was the
rapid transformation that had taken place in the implementation of the state‘s development plans
and the state‘s commitment to undertaking reforms to correct weaknesses identified in PFM.

Section II discusses the country context which gives an overview of Nigeria, recent economic
developments including macroeconomic outlook, and debt sustainability. Section III provides the
state context, while Section IV outlines the Edo State Government‘s program; section V
discusses how the Bank is supporting the government‘s program, while section VI describes the
proposed first DPO. Section VII outlines implementation issues, including risks and mitigating
measures.

                    II.   THE COUNTRY AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

A. Political context

9.      Nigeria is a federal system comprising of the federal government at the centre, a
federal capital territory administration, thirty six (36) state governments and seven
hundred and seventy four (774) local government councils (LGCs). The Constitution assigns
significant powers, resources, responsibilities and autonomy to the sub-national levels of
government, particularly the state governments. Under the revenue sharing formula currently
operating in the country, 52.68 percent of revenues are allocated to the Federal Government,
26.72 percent to state governments and 20.60 to local governments. Thus, sub-national levels of
government control close to half of the nation‘s public resources. The 1999 Constitution gave
increased responsibility to states in the delivery of economic and social services and for the
provision of infrastructure, both directly and jointly with local governments (LGs), while the
Federal Government remains responsible for setting standards, coordinating policy, and
discharging national functions such as security, foreign affairs, and macroeconomic
management.

10.     The last decade has been the first period of continuous democracy in Nigeria. Since
independence, Nigeria has experienced a series of military regimes, a devastating civil war and
several democratically elected governments unable to complete their terms in office, until 1999,
when President Obasanjo was elected, and then re-elected in 2003. With the election of President
Yar‘Adua in 2007, one elected government handed power over to another for the first time in
Nigeria‘s history, although the election process was widely viewed as flawed. Subsequent court
rulings, however, confirmed President Yar‘Adua‘s election victory. In 2010, there were fears that
the long illness of President Yar‘Adua and his subsequent death could trigger another military
coup. However, the fact that Nigeria successfully scaled a potential crisis through constitutional
means was to many observers a demonstration that the country‘s democratic values were
becoming more entrenched. In April 2011, Nigeria held general elections that have been hailed
by national and international observers as the most free and fair to date. In spite of this
achievement, the post-election violence that broke out in most parts of the north, mostly
involving the youth, was seen as a stark reminder of how youth unemployment and restiveness
could precipitate political instability if not tackled.

11.    After a successful amnesty program that brought relative peace in the Niger Delta
region, security has become a major issue again following the recent spate of bombings in
Nigeria’s capital and other northern states, as well as the sectarian violence in the northern
state of Plateau. After years of attacks on oil installations and kidnappings that disrupted
production in the Niger Delta region, there has been relative peace following the implementation

                                                3
of an amnesty program that commenced in 2009. The program required militants to surrender
their weapons in return for a presidential pardon, and access to an education, training, and
rehabilitation program. Security concerns have now shifted to the north following a recent spate
of bombings perpetrated by a religious extremist group known as Boko Haram that is opposed to
western education. Since October 2010, the group has claimed responsibility for five bombs that
exploded in the Capital Abuja, including a recent one at the United Nations Building and the
bombing of a church on Christmas Day. Sectarian violence has also recently broken out in the
northern state of Plateau. While life continues normally in most parts of the country, security has
become a major policy issue again in Nigeria.

B. Economic context

12.     Nigeria is highly dependent on oil which accounts for over 95 percent of exports and
nearly 85 percent of government revenues. It is Africa‘s leading producer of oil and has huge
gas reserves and other natural resources. Discovered in 1956 but with actual production only
starting in 1967, oil is produced in nine states located in the southern Niger Delta region.
However, while oil dominates the country‘s budget and foreign exchange earnings, it only
accounted for 15.9 percent of GDP in 2010. On the other hand, agriculture accounted for 40.9
percent of the economy while wholesale and retail trade accounted for 22.3 percent.
Nevertheless, because of its significant contribution to the budget and foreign exchange reserves,
the performance of the oil sector and the management of oil resources have been central to
explaining Nigeria‘s changing economic fortunes over the years.

13.     The country has not been able to fully leverage its earnings from oil as well as its
rich endowment in other natural resources to attain commensurate economic development.
Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with an estimated population of 167 million in
2011. In spite of huge earnings from oil and being rich in other natural resources, Nigeria
remains largely underdeveloped. The country continues to face a huge infrastructure deficit,
particularly in power and transportation, and public service delivery is generally poor. As a
result, poverty is still very high. In 2004, it was estimated that 51.6 percent of the population
were living in poverty. Income distribution is highly unequal. It is estimated that between 1985
and 2004, inequality measured by the Gini Coefficient worsened from 0.43 to 0.49 in Nigeria,
placing the country among those with the highest inequality levels in the world2. Other social
economic indicators are equally poor. For example, net primary school enrolment is on average
only 57 percent nationally, while, infant mortality is at 100 per 1,000 live births and maternal
mortality at 704 per 100,000 live births. Poverty in Nigeria has been aggravated by a high rate of
unemployment, especially among the youths. At 15.3 percent, unemployment rate in Nigeria is
higher than the average rate of 9.5 per cent for Sub-Saharan Africa.

14.    Following Nigeria’s return to civilian rule, subsequent governments have been
pursuing various macroeconomic and sector reforms. The most fundamental and far-reaching
reforms were in the area of fiscal management, when the government introduced in 2004 a
system of preparing the budget based on a conservative reference price for oil, with excess funds
saved into a special account, thus ending the ―boom-and-bust cycle‖ of previous periods (See
Box 1 for details on the mechanics of the oil price-based fiscal rule). In 2005, Nigeria secured

the largest debt relief in the history of the Paris Club, substantially increasing fiscal space to
expand social expenditures. Ambitious initiatives were launched to increase transparency and
reduce corruption in the management of public finance, and civil service reform was begun,
although progress has been mixed. The establishment of the Economic and Financial Crimes
Commission (EFCC) was successful in convicting high-level politicians of corruption and
recovering embezzled funds3. Nigeria was among the first countries to adopt and implement the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to improve governance of the oil and gas
sector. In this context, an independent audit of the oil and gas sector from 1999 to 2004 was
carried out and published, and efforts to address the findings of the report are still being made.
Reforms were initiated in the financial sector, including strengthening banking supervision and
consolidation of the banking system; the telecommunication sector was deregulated; the power
sector was unbundled into 18 companies for generation, transmission, and distribution.
Privatization and concessioning were initiated in the ports, steel, mining, and petrochemicals
sectors. The pension system was replaced with a fully-funded contribution system.

15.     These reforms ushered in a period of high, broad-based and sustained non-oil
growth. Since 2001, the growth of Nigeria‘s non-oil economy accelerated to more than 8
percent, more than twice the rate of growth over the previous 5 year-period. Increased
agricultural production played a key role in the expansion of the non-oil economy as previously
pent-up domestic demand increased prices for food products and led to increased land under
cultivation. About 70 percent of non-oil growth since 2001 can be explained by the agriculture,
wholesale and retail sectors. Other sectors, such as construction, the financial sector,
telecommunications, and ICT have also recorded high growth and have initiated a structural
transformation of the Nigerian economy towards the services sector.

16.     Going forward, the Federal Government has unveiled the details of a
transformation agenda whose top priorities will be job creation and infrastructure
development. Following the 2011 elections, the President constituted a reformist economic
management team that has prepared a ―transformation agenda‖ to be pursued during the tenure of
his administration. The top priorities of this agenda are job creation and implementation of
strategies for resolving Nigeria‘s long standing infrastructure problems, particularly in power and
transportation. The transformation agenda also includes far reaching reforms in agriculture and
the oil and gas industries. Underpinning this transformation agenda is a fiscal reform program
characterized by reduction in the share of recurrent expenditures in favor of capital expenditure,
improved transparency, adherence to fiscal discipline, and more recently, reduction in the fuel
subsidy.

  Between 2005 and 2008, for example, convictions increased from 20 to 200 cases and recovered assets from less
than $1 billion to more than $5 billion.

                         Box 1: Mechanics of the Oil Price-Based Fiscal Rule in Nigeria
In 2004, the Federal Government introduced an oil price-based rule into the budgeting system. Under the rule, the
contribution of oil revenues to the Federal Government budget (which includes federal transfers to state and local
governments) is based on a conservative reference (benchmark) price for oil and projected production levels.
Excess revenues accruing because the actual oil price is higher than the reference price are saved into what is
called the Excess Crude Account (ECA) that is maintained at the central bank. The primary objective of this
approach to budgeting is to ensure stability in public expenditure. In times when oil prices or production are higher
than projected in the budget, savings in the ECA accumulate. On the other hand, when oil prices or production
levels fall below budgeted levels, withdrawals from the ECA are made to ensure that budgeted expenditure levels
are maintained. Since its establishment, this mechanism has to a large extent succeeded in avoiding boom-bust
cycles of spending that had plagued Nigeria since the 1970s. More recently, withdrawals from the ECA helped to
mitigate the impact of negative oil revenue shocks and the global financial crisis during 2008-10.

In order to institutionalize and legitimize this practice, the oil price-based fiscal rule was entrenched in the Fiscal
Responsibility Law (FRL) of 2007. In particular, the FRL stipulated that savings held in the ECA can only be
accessed if the oil price falls below the predetermined level for a period of three consecutive months. Withdrawals
from the account in such an event are to be limited to such sums as will bring the revenue of government to the
level contained in the budget (called ―augmentation‖). Furthermore, the FRL allows for proportions of the savings
in the ECA during a particular year to be appropriated in the following year for capital projects and programs.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the FRL, the National Economic Council (NEC) – a body consisting of all State
Governors, the FCT and the federal Ministry of Finance, NPC and the CBN, and chaired by the vice president -
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in September 2007, agreeing to an arrangement whereby N1
trillion (about US$8.5 billion at the time) out of the existing savings would form a base deposit for the ECA, and
the balance shared among the three tiers of government. Furthermore, at the end of each year, 80 percent of the oil
savings would be shared and should form part of the budget for each tier of government for the next fiscal year;
while 20 percent is ploughed back into the ECA as savings. This became to be known as the ―80:20‖ rule.

In practice however, the ECA has been operated in a way that does not conform to the provisions in the FRL or the
MOU. In particular, ad hoc withdrawals from the ECA have been made beyond those required for augmentation.
For example, after the financial crisis abated, the draw-down of the ECA continued in the subsequent year of 2010
even when oil prices were significantly higher than the benchmark prices. As a result, the ECA balance dropped
from $19.7 billion at end 2008 to $2.7 billion as at end 2010. It was clear that the existing framework for managing
the ECA was not adequate. In particular, in spite of the FRL and the MOU, state Governments have been arguing
that the operation of an ECA contravenes the constitution which stipulates that all revenues accruing to the
Federation Account should be distributed to all the three tiers of Government.

In order to introduce best practices into the management of oil revenues, a bill establishing the National Sovereign
Wealth Fund (NSWF) was signed into law in May 2011. An initial seed amount of $1 billion was transferred from
the ECA to the NSWF. Once fully operational, the Fund will replace the ECA and will have three components: (a)
a stabilization component for protecting the budget against a fall in oil prices as is the case under the ECA, and two
additional components: (b) an infrastructure component for financing and catalyzing investment in the country‘s
critical infrastructure, and (c) a savings component for carrying out various portfolio investments for the benefit of
future generations. While state governments were initially supportive of the NSWF, they have recently been raising
questions about the constitutionality of the NSWF, again as was the case with the ECA. The change in position
appears to have been triggered by the fact that state governments are under pressure to implement the new national
minimum wage, and are therefore exploring all available opportunities for more revenues. The Federal
Government maintains that since the constitution does not explicitly specify that revenues should be distributed
immediately, saving and investing part of the oil revenues for later distribution [to all the three tiers of government]
is consistent with the constitution.

Ultimately, the success of the oil price-based fiscal rule in Nigeria will therefore depend on the extent to which
state governments buy into it and the extent to which rules governing withdrawals are adhered to. Obtaining buy-in
from state governments will, among other things, depend how the question surrounding its constitutionality is
resolved and how the current fiscal pressures faced by states are dealt with.

C. Recent economic developments

17.     The Nigerian economy continued to register strong growth in 2011. In the third
quarter of 2011, real GDP growth was 7.4 percent, slightly down from 7.7 percent in the second
quarter. While oil output in 2011 has been strong at an average of 2.44 million barrels per day
and price, on average, US$120 per barrel (Bonny Light), the oil sector experienced negative
growth of 0.34 percent in the third quarter of 2011. Average daily production stood at 2.36
million barrels per day in the third quarter mainly due to operational constraints experienced by
some of the oil producing companies during this period. On the other hand, non-oil GDP grew by
8.81 percent, driven predominantly by rapid growth in the telecommunications, building and
construction, wholesale and retail trade, hospitality and solid minerals sub-sectors, which in turn
was fueled by booming domestic demand.

18.     The agricultural sector continues to maintain the largest share in the country’s
GDP. The growing share of telecommunications, wholesale and retail trade, solid minerals and
construction in GDP contributed to a decline in the share of agriculture in Q2, 2011, but
agriculture still remained by far the largest contributor to the GDP. Agriculture accounted for
43.6 percent of GDP in the third quarter of the year, marginally down from 44.3 percent in the
corresponding period of 2010. The wholesale and retail trade sector was the next largest
contributor to GDP, accounting for 18.29 percent, while the oil and gas GDP accounted for 14.27
percent.

19.     In the financial sector, the year just ended has been characterized by Banking
system recapitalization and significant tightening of monetary policy by the Central Bank.
In a third and final phase of the plan to restore banking system soundness and stability following
the special bank audits in 2009, the CBN set a September 30, 2011 deadline for affected banks to
reach recapitalization deals with new investors. This follows a first phase of banking system
strengthening whereby the CBN injected N620 billion (US$4 billion) into 9 banks with severe
capital deficiencies and liquidity problems in 2009, and a second phase whereby the CBN
established the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) in 2010 to absorb bad bank
loans from the balance sheets of the banks in exchange for government bonds. After its
establishment, AMCON issued three-year zero-coupon bonds with a face value of N1.03 trillion
to 21 banks in December 2010 in exchange for non-performing loans (NPLs), paying out a
discounted total of N770 billion. However, in an early move, the CBN took action to nationalize
3 of these banks (Afribank Nigeria Plc, Bank PHB and Spring Bank Plc) in August 2011 when it
was felt that these banks would not meet the September 30 deadline for banks to recapitalize.
AMCON immediately injected a further N679 billion into these 3 banks to enable them meet the
minimum capital base requirement and capital adequacy ratio to make them attractive to
investors while the CBN guaranteed the deposits in the banks. By the end of September 2011 all
the affected Banks had indeed completed plans for their recapitalization.

20.     The tightening of monetary policy was premised on the need to manage inflationary
expectations. The Central Bank in January 2011, raised the Monetary Policy Rate by 25 basis
points to 6.5 percent, the cash reserve requirement (CRR) from 1 to 2 percent; and the liquidity
ratio from 25 to 30 percent, citing the upside inflationary risks in the run-up to the April general
elections, as well as the liquidity injections into the banking system by the newly-formed Asset
Management Company. Furthermore, on the back of the expanded budget initially enacted by

                                                 9
parliament in March 2011 and rising global food and energy prices, the CBN further increased
the MPR to 7.5 percent. In May, the MPR was further increased to 8 percent, while the CRR was
increased from 2 to 4 percent. Again, in July, the MPR was hiked to 8.75 percent in order to
address inflationary expectations associated with huge liquidity injections into the economy
through federation account distributions to the three tiers of government. In September 2011, the
CBN further raised the rate by 50 basis points to 9.25 percent, raising concerns about
international financial market volatility as well as the huge liquidity injections into the system
from the federation account. The CBN also anticipates a liquidity surge due to AMCON‘s
intervention in the under-capitalized banks. A month later (October 2011), the CBN raised the
MPR again from 9.25 percent to 12.0, and the CRR from 4.0 percent to 8.0 percent. The further
increases in October came after the completion of bank system recapitalization. The monetary
policy committee‘s view therefore was that concerns about the impact of a tighter monetary
policy stance on financial system stability were now significantly reduced.

21.     In spite of the tight monetary policy stance, monetary growth was higher in the
second half of 2011, including credit to the private sector. Broad money supply (M2) grew by
7.3 percent in the second half of 2011 compared to 6.0 percent in the first half. On an annual
basis, broad money grew by 9.8 percent in 2011, compared to 7.0 percent in 2010. Private sector
credit grew by 29.7 percent in the second half of 2011, while credit to Government declined by
50.1 percent. Net foreign assets in the second half of 2011 grew by 11.3 percent compared to 2.4
percent in the first half of the year.

22.     Headline inflation fell to single-digit in July and August 2011 for the first time in
three years, in response to tighter monetary policy and bumper food harvests but started
increasing again thereafter. The year-on-year inflation rate fell to 9.4 percent in July and
further to 9.3 percent in August 2011, following three years of double digit inflation in Nigeria.
The annual food inflation rate also dropped to single digit in June for the first time in more than
three years. From 9.2 percent in June, food inflation dropped to 7.9 percent in July - its lowest
level so far this year – but accelerated slightly to 8.7 percent in August. This moderation of food
prices has been attributed to the buoyant harvests of early-maturing food crops like maize,
tomatoes, potatoes, vegetables and fruits. Non-food inflation also slowed from 13 percent in May
to 11.5 percent in June and July, and further to 10.9 percent in August. However, in September,
2011, inflation rose to double digits again, reaching 10.3 percent, and then 10.5 percent in
October and November, before coming down slightly to 10.3 percent in December 2011. The
rise in inflation in the last quarter of 2011 has been attributed to the depreciation of the Naira
from N152.72 to one US dollar in August to N155.26 in September, 2011.

23.    The fiscal balance of the consolidated government showed signs of improvements in
2011 but came under pressure following the passage of the new Minimum Wage Law. The
consolidated fiscal deficit was -7.7 percent of GDP in 2010. Due to robust oil prices and output,
the federally-collected revenue in the first seven months of 2011 exceeded projections. An
amount of N4,693.5 billion in oil revenue was collected in the first seven months of 2011, 18
percent higher than what was budgeted. However, at N555.5 billion, non-oil revenue was 26
percent lower than what was budgeted. Collections from all the various non-oil taxes like
corporate income tax, capital gains tax and customs and excise duties, under-performed their
budgets. Overall, the total revenue accruing to the Nigerian federation account in the first seven

                                                10
months of 2011 was N5,249.02 billion or US$ 35 billion, which is 11 percent higher than
projections. Actual expenditure data for 2011 for the Federal Government and other tiers of
government are currently not yet available. However, it is estimated that due to consolidation
measures at the Federal Government level, the fiscal balance improved from a deficit of 7.7
percent in 2010 to 0.2 percent in 2011 (See Table 1). Similarly, the non-oil primary balance is
expected to have strengthened from a deficit of 34.6 percent of non-oil GDP in 2010 to 32.9
percent in 2011. However, the signing into Law of the National Minimum Wage Bill by the
President in May 2011, implies a 140 percent increase in the public sector minimum wage (from
N7,500 or US$50 to N18,000 or US$120). While the 2011 Federal Government budget had
already incorporated the implementation of a new minimum wage, the consolidated budget,
which includes state level budgets, is likely to be under pressure.

24.     As part of its fiscal consolidation reform program, the Federal Government
removed the subsidy on petrol on January 1, 2012, but re-introduced some of it following
nationwide strikes and protests. Nigeria is estimated to have spent $9.6 billion, or 4 percent of
GDP, on subsidizing the pump price of fuel. While the landed cost of petrol was N143 per liter
($0.92), the pump price of petrol was pegged at N65 per liter or $0.42, representing a 55 percent
subsidy. However, while appreciating the benefits of the subsidy on the poor, the Government
felt that the subsidy was not efficient as it also benefitted the relatively better off, including the
marketers. The Government was further concerned about the fiscal sustainability of the subsidy
which was becoming more costly. On the first day of 2012, the subsidy was therefore completely
removed. This prompted protests from the public in the first week and a nationwide general
strike by the organized labor movement. In response to calls that the complete removal of the
subsidy had adversely affected the poor, the Government reduced the petrol pump price from
reflecting the full landed cost to N97 ($0.63) per liter, representing a 32 percent subsidy on the
landed cost of fuel.

25.      Nigeria’s gross monetary reserves have remained fairly stable in 2011 despite the
increases in international crude oil prices. Nigeria‘s gross external reserves stood at US$ 32.3
billion at the end of December 2010 (corresponding to 6.1 months of import cover), and has
hovered around this level up till the current period, closing at US$ 32.9 billion at end-December
2011. This is principally because for a long time, the exchange rate has been largely unchanged,
with the Naira remaining within a +/- 3 percent band of N150/US$, which led the CBN to
purchase a substantial amount of Naira during the year. The CBN believes that Nigeria‘s
structural import dependence makes it imperative to maintain a fair level of exchange rate
stability. However, concerned with the slow build up of international reserves in the wake of
high oil prices and the continued demand pressures in the foreign exchange market, the CBN in
November 2011 adjusted the mid-point of target official exchange rate from N150.00/US$1.00 to
N155.00/US$1.00 but maintaining the band of +/-3.0 per cent. This means that the Naira would
since be allowed to float within a range of N150.00/US$1.00 – N160.00/US$1.00, unless
extraordinary shocks necessitate a change in stance.

26.    Similarly, current fiscal reserves held in the ECA have not been reflective of the
high oil prices so far in 2011. The Excess Crude Account, which had about $1.9 billion at the
beginning of the year, grew to $7.2 billion in June, but was subsequently depleted to $4.2 billion
by the end of August, despite the relatively high oil prices so far during the year (largely above

                                                 11
US$100 vis-à-vis a budget benchmark oil price of US$75 per barrel). Draw downs were made to
augment the distributable revenue to all tiers of government as well as to pay petroleum
subsidies to independent marketing companies responsible for the importation of petroleum
products (to enable them sell in-country at the subsidized rate of N65 per liter – before the price
was increased to N97 per liter). By end December 2011, the ECA still had a balance of only $4.7
billion.

27.     While risks to the economy remain, Nigeria’s macroeconomic policies remain
broadly appropriate. The IMF Article IV Consultations with Nigeria were carried out towards
the end of 2011. The Staff Report was discussed by the IMF‘s Board on February 22, 2012. A
key observation was that the authorities‘ fiscal strategy aims at rebuilding fiscal buffers, reorient
spending from recurrent to capital, and keep debt levels low. This stance taken by the authorities
is appropriate given the significant decline in balances of the Excess Crude Account at a time
when oil prices have been high. In particular, as indicated in Box 1 above, the Government
recently passed a law establishing a Sovereign Wealth Fund that will have tighter rules
governing the management of excess crude reserves. Also, in spite of pressures from election
related spending in 2011, Government pursued a tight fiscal policy. Another observation during
the IMF‘s Article IV consultations was the appropriateness of the CBN‘s tight monetary policy
stance in an attempt to rein in inflation.

D. Medium-term economic outlook

28.     Nigeria‘s growth prospects over the medium-term (see Table 1) remain positive,
although the strength of growth performance will depend on success in implementing
structural reforms to address binding constraints to investment. The recovery in Oil
production and continued stability in the Niger Delta should lead to positive growth of oil GDP.
At the same time, the continued buoyancy of important sectors of the Nigerian non-oil economy,
especially agriculture, wholesale and retail and construction, as well as the continued strong
growth of emerging sectors of the economy (telecommunications, financial sector and aviation)
are projected to allow the non-oil economy to grow at around 7 percent.

29.     Fiscal prospects over the medium term remain vulnerable to swings in oil prices in
the absence of a stronger fiscal framework. The fiscal and monetary reserves have not yet
reached the levels that were instrumental in helping Nigeria survive the impact of the global
financial crisis and economic down-turn during the period 2008-10. As mentioned above, the
Excess Crude Account (ECA), which holds fiscal reserves, had a balance of $4.7 billion by the
end of December while at the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, the ECA had
accumulated $20 billion. The low balance in ECA would make it difficult to absorb any negative
shock to oil prices in the near term.

30.    The balance of payments is projected to improve over the medium-term, as growth
of exports is expected to exceed growth in imports, reflecting the positive outlook for oil
and gas production as well as export-oriented non-oil sectors. As a result, the current account
surplus is expected to improve, from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2013.
Reserve coverage is expected to rise from $32.9 billion at end-2011 to $38.5 billion in 2013.

31.     Reflecting sound macroeconomic policies and prudent borrowing, Nigeria is at low
risk of debt distress based on the joint Bank-IMF low-income country debt sustainability
analysis (DSA). Nigeria‘s external debt stock was $4.8 billion, equivalent to only 2.4 percent of
GDP as at end 2010. It is projected to increase to $6.8 billion by 2013, but remain constant as a
percentage of GDP, at 2.4 percent. A joint Bank-Fund DSA on Nigeria was carried out towards
the end of 2011 as part of the IMF‘s Article IV Consultations. The conclusion was that Nigeria is
at low risk of external debt distress. In the baseline scenario and in the standardized stress tests,
Nigeria‘s debt outlook remains robust throughout the projection period. It was also concluded
that including domestic debt in the analysis would not significantly alter the debt outlook.
However, the findings from the customized scenarios also showed that, without significant
compensating policy measures, a prolonged oil price shock or deterioration in the current
account balance could undermine the recent progress made in achieving macroeconomic and
debt sustainability.


                                     III.    THE STATE CONTEXT

A.      Political context

32.     While Edo is a democracy like all other states in Nigeria, it has its own unique
political characteristics. For example, Edo is one of the few states in Nigeria that are governed
by a party that is different from the ruling party at the federal level, the People‘s Democratic
Party (PDP). Both the Governor and the majority of members in the State House of Assembly
belong to the party that is in opposition at the federal level, the Action Congress of Nigeria
(ACN). The Governor of the State, Adams Oshiomhole, assumed office in November 2008 after
an election appeals tribunal ruled that he was the duly elected candidate in the April 2007
election and nullified the election of the then sitting governor. Before running for the highest
office in the state, Governor Adams Oshiomhole had been the erstwhile leader of the largest
labour union in the country for close to a decade.4

B.      Economic context and recent developments

33.     The economy in Edo is predominantly agrarian. Agriculture is the predominant
economic activity for the majority of the population. Among the crops produced in the state are
oil palm, rubber, cassava, rice, plantain, yam, sweet potatoes, sugar cane, cashew, groundnuts,
tomatoes, cotton, and tobacco, among others. The state has a narrow industrial base. Apart from
oil mills, there are few prominent industrial and manufacturing companies. Bendel and Guinness
Breweries are the main functional industrial projects in the state. The state-owned Okpella
Cement Factory and Bendel Flour Mills are moribund. In spite of its rich historical background,
and having one of the richest art heritage in Nigeria (the bronze works of Benin City have
achieved substantial fame), tourism plays a minor role in the state‘s economy. Other tourist
attractions in the state not yet transformed into major destinations include the royal palace of the
Oba (Chief) of Benin and the Benin Moat, touted as one of the World‘s largest manmade
earthwork before the use of technology.

 He was the first president of the Nigeria Labour Congress which was formed soon after Nigeria returned to
Democracy in 1999.

34.     Although most of Edo’s socio-economic indicators are relatively better than the
national average, it is one of the poorer states in the southern half of the country. As can be
seen in Table 2, socio-economic indicators are relatively worse in the north than in the southern
region of Nigeria. Therefore, although Edo‘s indicators appear to be better than the national
average, the state is amongst the poorer ones in the south. A 2010 UNDP report on Nigeria
estimated Edo State‘s per capita income at only $327.62, compared to $1,437 for the south and a
national average of $1,156.82. The population living in poverty is estimated at 44.3 percent
compared to the national average of 51.6 percent and a regional average of 38.3 percent in the
south. From the table, it can also be seen that while net primary enrollment is higher than the
national as well as the average for the south, Edo has significantly higher overall unemployment
as well as youth unemployment compared to both the national average and the southern region
average.

35.     Like most other Nigerian states, the bulk of Edo’s revenues come from Federation
allocation transfers (See Table 3). The constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has
assigned different revenue collection responsibilities to the three tiers of Government – federal,
state, and local (see Table 4 for tax allocation responsibilities between Federal and State
Governments). The revenues are then shared using set guidelines and formulae (See Box 2 for
details of revenue sharing arrangements under Nigeria‘s fiscal federalism). In general, the bulk
of revenues mobilized by states are in the form of federal transfers. Over the years, federation
transfers have on average, accounted for around 90 percent of Edo State‘s revenues. Therefore
the remaining 10 percent of revenues has been coming from internally generated revenues (IGR).
However, since 2008, the share of IGR started increasing, reaching 16.7 percent of total revenues
in 2009 and 20.9 percent in 2010 (See Figure 5). The most dominant source of IGR is taxes,
contributing close to 70 percent of the total. Within taxes, personal income taxes are the most
dominant while other sources of IGR are fines and fees (13.9 percent of total IGR), licenses (4
percent), earnings and sales (4 percent), and interest and dividends (2.6 percent).

36.      Apart from a state level commission for coordinating the development of oil
producing communities, there is no special oil fund at state level for managing oil revenues
received from the Federal Government. The Nigerian constitution allocates mineral rights
exclusively to the Federal Government. Therefore, oil contracts are negotiated and managed at
the federal level. The state has no control over how much oil is produced within its borders. As
indicated in Box 2, oil revenues accrue either to the federation account or to the excess crude
accounts before they are shared amongst the three tiers of government. At state level, there is no
special fund similar to the ECA for managing oil revenues, whether received as part of general
federal transfers or on account of the 13 percent derivation principle. Nevertheless, in order to
ensure that communities in which oil is produced see the direct benefits of oil, Edo state, like all
the oil producing states, has a special commission known as the Edo State Oil and Gas Producing
Areas Development Commission (EDOPADEC) for coordinating development projects targeted
at oil producing communities. The commission‘s activities are funded by part of the oil proceeds
that the state receives under the derivation principle. The development initiatives managed by the

                                                                                  15
commission include the provision of social amenities such as schools, hospitals, boreholes,
police stations, markets, and environmental projects aimed at mitigating the impact of oil
spillage and pollution.

                 Box 2: Revenue Sharing Arrangements under Nigeria’s Fiscal Federalism
Different levels of Government in the federation have different revenue collection responsibilities. Revenues
collected by the Federal Government accrue to three types of accounts before they are shared amongst the three
tiers of Government: a Federation Account, an Excess Crude Account, and a VAT pool account. A Federation
Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares accruals to the Federation Account on a monthly basis using a
formula periodically determined by the Revenue Mobilization and Fiscal Allocation Commission and approved
by the National Assembly. The FAAC is presided over by the Minister of State for Finance and has as members,
the Accountant-General of the Federation, state commissioners for finance, and state accountants-general. Other
members include representatives of Federal Ministry of Finance, Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal
Commission, Central Bank of Nigeria, Federal Inland Revenue Service, Nigeria Customs Service, Debt
Management Office, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.

Sharing of funds from the federation account

Revenues deposited into the federation account accrue from sale of crude oil and gas, mining rents and royalties,
petroleum profits tax, companies‘ income tax, and customs and excise duties. However, before oil related
revenues are transferred to the federation account for sharing, 13 percent is set aside and transferred to an Oil
Mineral Derivation Fund. Proceeds from this fund are allocated to only the nine oil producing states, based on a
formula that uses each state‘s contribution to on-shore total production as weights. The remainder of the revenues
in the federation account is shared amongst the three tiers of government using a vertical formula that allocates
52.68 percent to the federal government, 26.72 percent to states, and 20.6 percent to local governments. Once the
amount due to state and local governments is determined, a horizontal formula is applied in allocating revenues to
different states. The formula applies the following criteria: equality of states (40 percent), population (30
percent), landmass and terrain (10 percent), social development factor (10 percent), and internal revenue
generation effort (10 percent).

Sharing of funds from the Excess Crude Account

As outlined earlier in Box 1 above, the Excess Crude Account (ECA) is used to save oil revenues above a base
amount derived from a defined oil benchmark price. Once the National Economic Council which comprises of
the President, the Vice-President, and State Governors agrees that a withdrawal from the ECA should be made,
the FAAC applies the same principles as above used in allocating revenues from the federation account. That is,
(i) 13 percent of the revenues are first allocated to the nine oil producing states, (ii) a horizontal formula is then
applied to decide amounts due to the three tiers of government, (iii) a horizontal formula is applied to decide
amounts due to the different states and their local governments.

Sharing of funds from the VAT Pool Account

Unlike other tax revenues collected by the federal government, proceeds from VAT are deposited into a separate
VAT pool account. The FAAC applies a horizontal formula for determining amounts due to the three tiers of
government that is different from the one for sharing proceeds into the federation account or the ECA. The
current horizontal formula for sharing VAT proceeds is 15 percent for the federal government, 55 percent for
states and 30 percent for local governments. The horizontal allocation of VAT proceeds to states and their local
governments is based on three criteria: equality of states (50 percent), population (30 percent) and 20 percent for
derivation to reward states such as Lagos that contribute more to VAT collections because of having high level of
commercial and industrial activities.

37.     In-line with the priorities of its medium-term development strategy, the state’s
expenditures are biased towards infrastructure development in roads, urban drainage,
sewage systems, and education. Just like revenues, the constitution of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria also assigns service delivery responsibilities to the three tiers of Government. These
assigned responsibilities define the broad framework within which state Governments undertake
their expenditures. In this context, the State of Edo has developed a medium-term strategy
document which defines the Government‘s priority areas as roads, drainage, education, health,
agriculture, and information and communication technology. Within these priorities, the strategy
indicates that infrastructure development for improved service delivery will be the main focus.

38.      To address the state’s infrastructure needs, the new administration pursued a rapid
fiscal expansion, while making efforts to improve tax compliance to raise IGR. As a result
of this fiscal stance, the share of capital expenditures in the budget has been increasing in recent
times (See Figure 6).5 In spite of the rapid increase in IGR (which as mentioned earlier is still
just a fifth of total revenues) and some fiscal consolidation measures, the overall fiscal deficit has
also increased in recent times. In particular, while the overall deficit to revenue ratio was -5.9
percent in 2008, it more than tripled to 18.1 percent in 2009 before declining significantly to -6.4
percent in 2010. Before the bond issuance in January 2011, these deficits were being financed by
commercial bank borrowing. However, because of the high interest rates (19 percent) and shorter
maturity period of these loans (2 years), the state decided to issue a N25 billion Edo State Bond
in January 2011. The Bond was issued at a fixed interest rate of 14 percent per annum, repayable
over a period of 7 years. In order to reduce the cost of debt service on existing loans, part of the
proceeds from the Bond (55.5 percent) was used to repay the more expensive commercial bank
loans. The remainder of the proceeds is being used to finance on-going infrastructure projects.

 The actual increase in capital expenditure may be slightly lower than reported here given changes in expenditure
classification. Some of the expenditure items that are sometimes classified as capital are of a recurrent nature.

                                                                                      18
39.      The bulk (two-thirds) of the budgetary resources are being allocated to the state‘s
strategic development priorities (See Table 5 below). In 2010, 18.7 percent of total public
expenditures went to education while 27.5 percent went to works, housing, and transportation,
mainly for road construction and rehabilitation. As Table 5 further shows, the resource
requirements between recurrent and capital expenditure varies across sectors. For example,
within education, the bulk of the resources (83.8 percent) went to recurrent expenditure in 2010,
mainly for the payment of teacher salaries. However, in line with the Government‘s stated
objective of upgrading the condition of schools by building new classrooms and carrying out
extensive rehabilitation, the share of capital expenditure in the 2011 approved budget increased
significantly to 40.2 percent. On the other hand, resources allocated to water, drainage,
environment, waste management, works, housing, and transport have mostly been on capital
expenditure, accounting for between 80-98 percent of respective sector budgets.

C.       Medium-term outlook and fiscal sustainability

40.      A fiscal sustainability analysis (FSA) carried out (See Annex 3 for details) shows
that Edo State’s fiscal program is sustainable in the medium-term although risks remain.
The baseline scenario of the FSA suggests that Edo's fiscal policy would be sustainable in the
medium terms. In particular, Edo State does not breach the threshold under Nigeria‘s statutory
guidelines for external borrowing, that total projected debt service should not exceed 40 percent
of total federal accounts allocation for the past twelve months. This ratio is projected at 20.2
percent in 2012, declining to 12.1 percent in 2015. However, alternative scenarios indicate that
Edo‘s public finances are vulnerable to risks. In particular, uncontrolled growth in infrastructure
spending and heavy borrowing on commercial terms without a significant increase in IGR would
result in a deterioration of the fiscal situation.

41.      Going forward, improved fiscal reporting and monitoring of other potential sources
of fiscal pressures will be essential. As is the case in many states in Nigeria, Edo does not have
an efficient system of monitoring and recording debt, arrears/irregular debt and contingent
liabilities. In spite of the weaknesses in fiscal data classification, monitoring, and recording, the

                                                 19
Government in Edo has been very cooperative and willing to engage. Further, it has made
improved classification, reporting, and monitoring of contingent liabilities an integral part of its
fiscal sustainability strategy and has requested for technical assistance from the Bank. Further, in
2010, the Government conducted a biometric identification exercise in the civil service that
resulted in the flushing out of ghost workers on the payroll. But subsequently, a new recruitment
exercise in the civil service was undertaken, after years of a hiring freeze. While this has not
been translated to a large increase in the wage bill as yet, the hiring of government workers needs
to be monitored carefully going forward.

D.     Intergovernmental relations

42.     The current inter-government arrangements with respect to external debt service
and overall state debt monitoring provide adequate controls for state government spending
within limits compatible with overall fiscal sustainability. The federal government of Nigeria
is actively engaged in oversight of sub-national fiscal and borrowing decisions through controls
that derive from the constitution and the DMO Act, requiring the center to approve borrowing
operations and prohibiting sub-national governments from directly accessing external borrowing
(See Box 3 for a summary of Federal Government guidelines governing sub-national borrowing).
Under the guidelines, a state government receives approval to borrow externally if the ratio of
projected external debt service plus all other deduction obligations for the next 12 months
(inclusive of the loan under consideration) to the state‘s total Federation Accounts Allocation
over the preceding twelve months does not exceed 40 percent. On this score, Edo‘s indicator for
2011 is found to be 25.4 percent, which is comfortably below the threshold.

43.     All external borrowing, including lending by International Financial Institutions, is
controlled by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF), which provides an explicit federal
guarantee on all external credits to states. The FMF directly participates in the negotiations on
such credits and, through the federal DMO, monitors the overall debt profile of individual states.
Upon effectiveness of state credit agreements, the federal DMO takes on responsibility for
ongoing service payments (both principal and interest). All state external debts are serviced
centrally by the Federal Government, and debt service payments are recovered later through
automatic deductions from the monthly Federation Account transfers to states.

                  Box 3: Borrowing guidelines for Nigeria's Sub-national Governments
External borrowing guidelines for states

In 2007, the FDMO issued new external borrowing guidelines, as well as sub-national borrowing guidelines
covering the period 2008-2012. The main provisions are:
     States should seek federal government approval in principle ahead of full-scale negotiations for such
         loans;
     To receive approval for external borrowing, State Governments must demonstrate that the ratio of their
         projected external debt service plus all other deduction obligations for the next 12 months (inclusive of
         the loan under consideration) to their total Federation Accounts Allocation over the preceding twelve
         months will not exceed 40 percent.
     States should authorize Federal Ministry of Finance to deduct at source from their statutory allocation,
         the amount needed for debt service;
     States‘ external loans must be supported by Federal Government guarantee before final approval;
     Borrowing should be tied to specific investment projects whose feasibility studies should have been
         cleared by the National Planning Commission (NPC);
     Borrowing must be on highly concessional terms, specifically not to exceed one percent per annum;
     Borrowing should be limited to financing of projects for ―poverty eradication‖ and for infrastructure.

Domestic borrowing guidelines for states

States have, within the established debt limits, a free hand to determine their domestic borrowing needs
and seek such financing from domestic banks of their choice. The sub-national borrowing guidelines state that
any borrowing by a sub-national shall be the obligation solely of that particular sub-national unless explicitly
guaranteed by the sovereign. For all FGN-guaranteed loans sub-national governments are required to issue an
irrevocable standing payment order tied to the state‘s FAAC allocations. Federal disclosure requirements in
place with respect to state borrowing from commercial banks require sub-nationals to immediately upon
contracting a commercial bank loan, furnish the DMO with details of the loan. Also, the lending bank should
furnish the DMO and the borrowing sub-national's Debt Management Department (where in existence), with
reports on various stages of draw-down and utilization by the borrower, on a periodic basis. States are required to
establish a sinking fund for each loan raised into which periodic contributions are made for meeting the loan
obligations.

To access the capital market, states must meet a certain number of legal and regulatory requirements
including requirements under the Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 1999, the Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations and the listings requirements of the Nigeria and the Abuja Stock Exchanges. Under the
ISA, states can issue securities in the form of registered bonds and or promissory notes. As with external
borrowing, loans must be tied to specific projects. The total debt amount outstanding of the state and the
proposed loan should not exceed 50 percent of the state‘s total revenues in the preceding year. A state‘s
application to float bonds on the market should include audited accounts for the past five years.

The guidelines stipulate a FGN guarantee as being compulsory for the states’ borrowings from the capital
market. States are required to provide an irrevocable letter of authority giving the Accountant General of the
Federation the authority to make deductions at source from the state‘s statutory allocation in the event of default
by the state in meeting its payment obligation under the terms of the loan. The state is required to establish a
sinking fund for each loan raised into which periodic contributions are made for meeting the loan obligations.
Any deductions from the state‘s statutory allocation by the Accountant General are to be paid into the sinking
fund

                          IV.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

A. Edo’s development strategy

44.      The State Government’s development strategy is outlined in a report of the Vision
2020 Stakeholder Development Committee for Edo State. The report represents the Edo State
Economic Transformation Blueprint and was conceived within the framework of the Nigeria
Vision 2020 Economic Transformation Blueprint (NV2020) that seeks to position Nigeria as one
of the top 20 economies in the world (in terms of GDP) by the year 2020. Within this context,
the blueprint articulates Edo State‘s analysis of the implications, opportunities and challenges
portended by this national developmental goal for the State. The blueprint outlines the sectoral
priorities and policy initiatives through which Edo State will contribute (and benefit) from the
national developmental goal. As much as possible, the strategies to be adopted are selected on
the basis of what the State can directly influence.

45.     The development blue print identifies high poverty levels, youth unemployment,
dilapidated infrastructure, and flooding as the main development challenges in the state.
With close to half of the population living below the poverty line, the Government has identified
reduction in poverty as a key development challenge. Another challenge identified is high youth
unemployment, which among other factors, is the result of insufficient employment opportunities
and mismatch between the needs of employers and the qualification of students. Other
development challenges identified in the blue print are the poor state of infrastructure and
flooding, both of which have been due to years of neglect, poor planning, and compromises in
quality.

46.      Therefore, the main policy thrust of the economic transformation blue print for the
state is poverty alleviation and sustainable economic growth. In this regard, four main
components of the policy thrust are identified: (i) increasing access of the people to quality social
services and basic infrastructure; (ii) partnership and role sharing between the government and
the private sector, where the role of government will be predominantly that of policy making,
regulation and providing an enabling environment while the private sector will become the
engine of growth; (iii) inclusiveness in development initiation, management and sustenance; and
(iv) targeted reduction of poverty.

47.     The blue print also identifies good governance as an over-arching theme. In this
context, the strategy for governance is expected to involve: (i) inclusive sector specific policy
design and implementation; (ii) prudent economic management framework (improved
expenditure management); (iii) greater level of transparency/accountability; (iv) introduction of
targets/safety nets for the poor; (v) reorientation and strengthening of public service; (vi)
diversification of funding sources for priority areas; and (vii) inclusive governance through the
implementation of broad-based consultative fora.

48.    In order to achieve the main development objective of poverty alleviation and
sustainable economic growth, six priority areas are identified as follows: roads, drainage,
education, health, agriculture, information and communication technology, and internally
generated revenue. The main objective under roads is construction and rehabilitation of roads
with the view to connecting many rural communities to urban centres for enhanced economic

                                                 22
activities. Under drainage, the main objective is to improve urban storm water drainage systems
through the construction of properly planned, high quality, drains. In education, the main
objective is to improve access, quality, equity, and relevance of education. The main areas of
focus in the medium term include construction and rehabilitation of schools and improving
community-based vocational education. In health, the Government‘s priorities are to revitalize
integrated service delivery towards a quality, equitable and sustainable healthcare system, and to
enhance harmonized implementation (amongst government, private sector, and development
partners) of essential health services in line with national health policy goals. Within the
agriculture sector, the objective is to establish a vibrant, mechanized, technology-driven
agricultural and agro-allied sector as one of the key drivers of the economy in Edo State and a
significant contributor to the Nigerian economy. The Government‘s main objective in ICT is
automation of public service processes to improve efficiency in internal service delivery. Finally,
the objective in the area of IGR is increased efficiency in the collection of taxes through greater
automation, strengthened institutional capacity of the BIR, improved taxpayer services, and
expanding the tax base.

B. Progress in implementation

49.     Within a short period of time and with little external assistance, the Government
has made noticeable progress in implementing its development program. Progress made in
implementing its vision is contained in a report titled ―mid-term report of vision and
transformation‖ that was produced to mark the second anniversary of the current administration.
First, budgetary allocations to the priority areas have been significantly increased. For instance,
between 2008 and 2009, actual real expenditure on public works (which includes roads)
increased by 414 percent while that of education increased by 153 (World Bank PEMFAR,
2010). Second, these increased expenditures have been translated into actual progress on the
ground. For example, the mid-term report documents that 64 road construction and rehabilitation
projects have been commenced over the past two years, 30 of which have been completed while
34 are still underway. In the area of drainage, a detailed and prioritized master plan of the Benin
City storm water drainage system was prepared by external consultants and its implementation
has commenced. Similarly, a number of construction and rehabilitation works in education and
health sectors have either been completed or are underway. Progress in agriculture included the
introduction of farmer-based small-scale arable farmers program, and provision of equipment
and inputs to farmers. In ICT, the Governor created a full directorate, with its executive director
sitting in state executive council (cabinet) meetings. Since its creation, the directorate has
acquired and installed an integrated financial management information system (IFMIS). Through
the ICT directorate, Edo also became the first state in Nigeria to introduce a citizen identity card
system based on biometric features. Finally, in internally generated revenues, the bureau of
internal revenues has implemented a number of reforms and initiatives that have lead to a 300
percent increase in monthly levels of IGR between 2008 and 2010.

50.      In spite of the progress made, challenges remain, including ensuring that the gains
made so far are sustained. After many years of neglect and mismanagement, the development
challenges remain immense. Many more schools and health facilities need to be rehabilitated and
constructed. At the same time, with the state largely dependent on federal transfers, even with
significant increases in internally generated revenues and measures to control wastage in public
expenditures, there is still a large financing gap to be filled. Finally, the progress made so far has

                                                 23
been hinged on strong political will and a few key technocrats within government. Capacity in
the civil service remains weak. Therefore, without strong institutions, there is a risk that these
gains may not be sustained beyond the life of the current administration.

51.     The Government’s medium-term strategy is therefore to mobilize more resources,
including from external sources, and to ensure that progress in infrastructural
development is anchored in strong policies and institutions. In this context, the Government
is exploring all possible options for raising funds externally. For example, in education, the
Government has been leveraging private sector funding through PPPs. Second, although the
Government‘s preference is to borrow on concessional terms, it has joined a group of few states
that have moved to borrow from the capital market through bond issuance. As mentioned earlier,
the Edo State Government earlier this year issued N25 billion worth of bonds for infrastructure
development. Finally, the Government has decided to implement an ambitious program of
reforms in various areas in order to improve effectiveness, efficiency, transparency, and
accountability in the implementation of its development program. The policy and institutional
reform program will also ensure that progress made will be sustained over time.

C. Participation

52.      Preparation of Edo’s vision 2020 report was broadly participatory and the
Governor regularly consults the people through town hall and village square meetings. The
report was prepared after extensive consultations with various stakeholders in the State,
including an Economic and Strategy Team made up of leading Edo indigenes in both the private
and public sectors. The team is made up of opinion leaders and experienced professionals in
most sectors of the economy, and is to act in an advisory capacity on all public policy
management issues. The Governor also regularly consults people on developmental issues
through town hall and village square meetings. The outcome of the consultations on the strategy
was a report that articulated the state‘s priority areas, the state‘s vision in each priority area, the
specific development objectives as well as short-term, medium-term, and long-term policy
initiatives for achieving the objectives. This provided a framework for more specific reforms,
some of which are supported by the proposed DPO. These specific reforms have been the result
of more focused consultations. For example, reforms in PFM are the result of further
consultations with key stakeholders including Government authorities, representatives of the
state legislator, civil society, and the private sector on the preparation of a PFM reform action
plan. To ensure even further participation by various stakeholders in the reform program, further
consultations have been made on some of the specific reform actions. For example,
representatives of more than 13 civil society organizations were consulted on the elements of the
public procurement law on October 24th, 2011. The outcome of the consultations was a
procurement bill that included specific suggestions from the stakeholders, including the need for
the quarterly report of the procurement regulatory agency to be established under the law to be
made public in addition to being submitted to the State House of Assembly.

D. Coordination

53.   Progress has been made in coordinating development programs, although capacity
remains weak. Soon after the current administration came to power, the State Planning

                                                  24
Commission was transformed into a full Ministry of Budget, Planning, and Economic
Development. One of the reasons for the reform was to raise the profile of the coordination
function, which the new Ministry is responsible for. Coordination of the state‘s development
strategy is through a secretariat that is located in the ministry, while coordination of donor
funding is through the department responsible for donor interventions. Apart from coordination
of the overall development strategy and donor funding, the Government also constituted a
steering committee for the coordinated implementation of the PFM reform action plan. However,
in spite of these arrangements, capacity remains weak. The Ministry of Budget, Economic
Planning, and Development does not yet have enough staff in the right quality and quantity to
provide adequate technical level support for coordination.

E. Monitoring and evaluation

54.     Arrangements for monitoring and evaluation are in place, especially of projects, and
systems are being put in place to improve M&E. Monitoring of projects is through a newly
established office known as the Fiscal Governance and Project Monitoring Office (FGPMO)
located in the office of the Governor. Funds for projects are released in tranches through a
process of warrants and based on work actually done. Prior to establishment of this office, there
were several instances of projects that were fully paid for, but not executed. On the output side,
the Governor‘s office produced the first year annual report on the performance of the
Government and more recently, a mid-term report. More recently, the Ministry of Budget,
Economic Planning, and Development, has established an M&E department to undertake a more
structured and systematic approach to monitoring and evaluation of projects and programs across
MDAs.

               V.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

A. Link to the Country Partnership Strategy

55.     The proposed Edo DPO is consistent with the Bank’s new strategy for supporting
improved governance in Nigeria as outlined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
the period 2010-2013. The Nigerian Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was discussed by the
Board in July 2009. The strategy has a strengthened focus on improving governance at the State
level given the critical role that states play in service delivery. For this purpose, the CPS
envisages the introduction of state level Development Policy Operations (DPOs) as one of the
support instruments for strengthening state-level governance, particularly to help states manage
public resources better. This is because financial support under DPOs is premised on progress in
improving policies and institutions. It envisages that the provision of DPO support to reformist
states could also create incentives for other states to engage in policy reform dialogue even if the
DPO amounts are relatively modest compared to the states‘ other resources. The envisaged
demonstration effect of state DPOs is being manifested in the proposed DPO since the authorities
in Edo have openly admitted that they have drawn inspiration from the transformation that has
taken place in Lagos which was identified in the CPS as a ―pioneer‖ for state-level DPOs.

56.     Apart from strengthening governance, the DPO is also consistent with other pillars
of the CPS – human development and sustaining non-oil growth. The proposed DPO is
consistent with these two focus areas in two ways. First, as will be outlined in more detail later,

                                                25
the second policy area of the proposed DPO covers improved quality of education and improved
investment climate which will clearly contribute towards the achievement of the CPS outcomes
in human development and sustaining non-oil growth, respectively. Second, as indicated earlier,
the Edo State Government has indicated that funding to be provided under the DPO will mostly
be utilized for infrastructure development in roads, education, and urban storm drainage systems.
All these areas are also consistent with the CPS pillars of human development and sustaining
non-oil growth.

B. Links to other bank operations

57.     The proposed DPO is expected to contribute towards the strengthening of systems
and institutions that would enhance the Government’s capacity to use its own resources in
scaling up development approaches that have been successful under Bank funded projects.
Currently, there are three operations active in the state: the Second Health Systems Development
Project, an HIV/AIDS Project, and the Fadama Project. The DPO is expected to contribute to
this portfolio by strengthening systems and institutions, particularly in public financial
management, that should enhance the Government‘s capacity to continue confidently with the
implementation of successful components of Bank funded projects using its own resources.

58.     The DPO is also closely linked to several planned Bank projects bringing technical
assistance and knowledge in PFM, education, and ICT. Most of the actions supported under
the first DPO have been implemented with the Government‘s own funding. However, going
forward, there are a number of projects that will be used to provide TA to the Government in the
implementation of the DPO supported reform program. First, there is a TA project at an
advanced stage of preparation, the State Employment and Expenditure for Results (SEEFOR)
project. This project will be the Bank‘s main instrument for providing TA to the Edo state
government in the implementation of the reforms supported under the DPO. In particular, the
SEEFOR project will provide TA towards the implementation of reforms in the PFM and
education policy areas of the DPO. Specifically, PFM support from the SEEFOR project will
include TA for the preparation of PFM laws and regulations; budget planning and preparation
(including MTEF and MTSS), accounting, expenditure control and financial reporting; external
audit and oversight; public investment planning and management; specific procurement reforms;
tax administration, and social accountability. Under education, the SEEFOR project will among
other areas support the strengthening of school based management committees in technical and
vocational education institutions. A DFID technical assistance project (the State Partnerships for
Accountability, Responsiveness, and Capability Project) will provide bridging support in the area
of PFM before the SEEFOR project comes on stream. Under this type of support, DFID will
provide a PFM reform resident advisor as well as PFM consultants specialized in tax
administration reform, budget reform, accounting and auditing reform, and procurement reform,
to provide specifically defined TA. Second, the DPO is also linked to a planned Governance and
Partnership Facility (GPF) funded initiative on Result-based Review, Monitoring and
Performance Evaluation of the State Budget covering the states of Edo, Ekiti, and Niger. Finally,
the DPO is also closely linked to two ICT-based initiatives for promoting citizen participation
and social accountability: a South-South Experience Exchange Trust Fund program aimed at
transferring knowledge to the authorities in Edo on ICT-based initiatives for promoting citizen
participation in urban planning and a planned TA project for supporting ICT-based initiatives for
promoting transparency and accountability in budgeting and service delivery.

                                               26
C. Selection of Edo as a DPO state

59.      Selection of Edo as a DPO state was based on its overall performance on six criteria
agreed in advance with the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF). When a decision to start
providing support to states through DPOs was made, Lagos was already earmarked as a pioneer
state because it stood out as advanced in so many respects. Beyond Lagos, it was agreed with the
FMF that selection of subsequent DPO states would be based on performance of potential states
against six criteria. When all the states were considered against these criteria, Edo was selected
on the basis of its superior overall performance as follows: (i) the state has a development
strategy that is consistent with the national Vision 2020 and there has been evidence of its
implementation. In particular, as outlined above, the state‘s Vision 2020 Report is consistent
with the Federal Government‘s priorities of improving infrastructure, increasing employment,
and meeting the Millennium Development Goals; (ii) due diligence for public financial
management in the form of a PEMFAR was undertaken and concrete corrective actions for
identified weaknesses have been formulated and are being implemented; (iii) a preliminary
assessment showed that the state‘s fiscal program was sustainable and that the state was in
good standing in terms of its financial arrangements and obligations with the federal government.
This assessment has subsequently been confirmed by a full fiscal sustainability analysis; (iv) the
state is part of a Governance project (SEEFOR) and its performance under existing Bank projects
has broadly been satisfactory; (v) its performance on the doing business indicators was poor at
the national level. It was ranked 21 out of 36 states. However, it was observed that there was a
regional dimension in the performance of states on the doing business indicators. Northern states
performed better than southern states, presumably because business activities are generally fewer
in the north. Therefore, when Edo was compared amongst states in the south only, it ranked
number 3; and, finally, (vi) Edo is strategically located as a key transit state in the south-south
region, and belongs to a different geo-political zone from Lagos, which is in the South-west.
Therefore, it has significant relevance to regional growth and geopolitical balance through
positive externality and demonstration effects. Overall, Edo‘s credentials as a reformist state
were critical to its selection, evidenced in the rapid transformation that had taken place in the
state within a short period of time and the Government‘s demonstrated commitment to carrying
out policy reforms, particularly in PFM.

D. Coordination with the IMF and other donors

60.    In preparing the operation, the Bank has coordinated closely with the IMF on the
assessment of Nigeria’s macroeconomy and its outlook. In 2004, Nigeria became the first
country to benefit from the IMF‘s Policy Support Instrument. Performance under the program,
which focused both on structural and macroeconomic reforms, was good, including in the
aftermath of the historic October 2005 debt relief from the Paris Club and the subsequent
London Club deal which resulted in the virtual elimination of Nigeria‘s bilateral and multilateral
external debt. Following the expiry of the PSI in November 2007, the IMF maintains a regular
policy dialogue through Article IV consultations, interim staff visits, and supplements this
dialogue with TA in areas of its expertise. The IMF and the World Bank continue to collaborate
closely in Nigeria to ensure harmonized dialogue with the government based on a Joint
Management Action Plan (JMAP). Under the JMAP, the IMF takes the lead in macroeconomic
monitoring and is, therefore, responsible for the preparation of an assessment letter for this
operation and provision of macroeconomic projections.

                                                27
61.    Coordination with donors is taking place through regular consultations in the
context of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The current CPS was jointly prepared by
the World Bank and three other development partners: DFID, the African Development Bank
(AfDB), and USAID. As mentioned earlier, the CPS currently being implemented provided for
the strengthening of governance systems in states through development policy lending
operations, amongst other instruments. Therefore, the strategy to use this instrument in
supporting state governments is mutually shared by other development partners.

E. Lessons learned from other DPLs

62.     Since the Edo DPO is the second after Lagos to be prepared at State level, its
preparation has benefited from the experience in preparing and implementing the first
Lagos DPO. In particular, lessons have been learnt with regard to the choice of critical actions,
the need for the Bank to have readily available technical assistance for helping the Government
in the implementation of DPO-supported reforms, and the importance of having well coordinated
implementation arrangements within Government.

63.     The choice of prior actions has been influenced by the need to lay a solid foundation
for real change in certain critical areas. In light of experiences under the Lagos DPO and in
other countries where DPOs have been implemented, the choice of prior actions under the Edo
DPO has been based on considerations of criticality and realism. In some cases, it was agreed
with the authorities that it was important to have certain measures in place quickly in order to lay
the foundation for real change in the state. For instance, as will be outlined later, instead of
aiming at just submitting a procurement bill to the State House of Assembly as was the case
under the first Lagos DPO, the Government in Edo had committed to actually enacting the law
as a prior action for the first DPO, and has implemented it. Without having the actual law in
place, it is difficult for real changes in procurement practices to be possible. Although the
passing of the law is beyond the control of the executive branch of Government, due to the
cordial relationship between the executive and legislature in Edo, the authorities expressed
confidence that having the law passed was a realistic prior action.

64.     In light of weak capacity in Government to implement certain reforms, a conscious
effort has been made to ensure that the requisite TA is lined up to support implementation
of the reform program underpinning the DPO. The experience under the first Lagos DPO was
such that available Bank instruments for the provision of TA in the state had limited scope. As a
result, it became necessary to mobilize TA support from DFID through the SPARC project
without which little progress could have been made in some areas. Therefore, in the design of the
Edo DPO, efforts have been made to ensure that Bank instruments for the provision of
comprehensive TA are lined up. This is especially important since there are no other
development partners with TA type of projects in Edo State.

65.      Finally, in order to ensure more efficient implementation of the reform program, an
institutional arrangement for coordinating implementation of the program has been put in
place. Under the first Lagos DPO, coordination of the various Government MDAs and
institutions responsible for implementing the DPO supported reform program was on an ad hoc
basis, with the Commissioner for Finance driving and coordinating the program, supported by

                                                28
one of his personal assistants. While such an arrangement was still effective in achieving the
desired objectives of the operation, a deeper understanding and sometimes appreciation of the
program was not fully shared across all the participating institutions. In some cases, this
contributed to delays in the implementation of some reforms. With this experience to learn from,
the Governor in Edo has instituted a steering committee to be chaired by the Deputy Executive
Governor of the State. The steering committee is being technically supported by a DPO program
coordinator who is also the Project Coordinator for the SEEFOR project. The DPO program
coordinator is responsible for following up with institutions concerned with the implementation
of specific prior actions.

F. Analytical underpinnings

66.    The design of this operation has been informed by various pieces of analytical work
carried out by the Bank. The main diagnostic work was the Public Expenditure Management
and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) which had the following components: (i)
Fiscal Performance Analysis, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
Assessment, and Public Investment Management Assessment; (ii) Financial Management
Fiduciary Assessment; (iii) Procurement Fiduciary Assessment; and (iv) Public Expenditure
Review of the Education Sector.

Fiscal performance analysis, PEFA assessment, and public investment management assessment

67.     The fiscal performance analysis and PEFA assessment found that although progress
had been made in some areas of Edo’s PFM system, there were weaknesses in many others.
The main findings of the PEFA assessment were that Edo‘s PFM system was strong in revenue
collection including in terms of transparency and effectiveness, provision of political guidance in
the preparation of the budget, progress in the timeliness and consistency with which financial
statements are prepared, and transparency in the process of scrutinizing audit reports by the
Public Accounts Committee of the SHA. The review also found weaknesses in several areas.
First, Edo‘s PFM was seen to be susceptible to wastage in certain budgetary areas that could
threaten fiscal sustainability. For example, existing payroll management systems were weak in
the sense that changes to the payroll were quick for promotions and salary increments, but less so
in cases of death and retirement. Second, the review found weaknesses in budgetary institutions
and practices manifested in poor fiscal planning, classification of the budget not meeting
international standards, limited coverage of budget documentation, limited access by the public
to budget information, low execution of the budget (with data used covering the period 2006-
2008 before the new administration came in), regular and comprehensive reporting of budget
execution, and lack of follow-up to audit recommendations.

68.     The assessment of public investment management found that progress had been
made in monitoring of project implementation while project selection and evaluation
remained poor. Like in most states in Nigeria, the assessment found that in general, there was
no systematic appraisal based on cost-benefit analysis in the selection of projects to be included
in the Edo State‘s budget. However, monitoring of project implementation had significantly
improved. This has allowed adjustments to be made to projects as necessary. At the same time,
project evaluation remains weak. Once projects have been completed, there is no systematic ex-
post evaluation to compare actual outputs and outcomes of the projects against the predetermined

                                                29
objectives and planned outputs and outcomes in the project design, as well as to compare final
expenditure against budgeted expenditure.

Financial management fiduciary risk assessment

69.     The financial management fiduciary risk assessment focused on looking at the
underlying factors behind areas of weakness observed under the PEFA assessment. The
assessment found that fiduciary risk to public funds in Edo State is high. It found that some of
the underlying weaknesses included outdated PFM legal and regulatory framework to support
modern practices and trends in PFM reform, dearth of skilled PFM technicians at the middle
management level to mange public funds in an effective and transparent manner, and poor
organizational arrangements in some of the key institutions charged with the responsibility of
public financial management. The recommendations in the fiduciary risk assessment report
further provide specific actions to mitigate fiduciary risks to public funds. The Governor has
inaugurated an inter-ministerial PFM Reform Implementation Committee to implement wide
ranging reforms, including recommendations from the financial management fiduciary risk
assessment. Some of the reforms will be supported under the proposed DPO and their
implementation will enable Edo State to comply with international best practices which will in
turn promote public trust in government.
Procurement assessment

70.     The findings of the procurement assessment were also mixed. The assessment found
that the new administration had put in place some basic institutional elements that could be built
upon in order to have much stronger institutional platform for procurement. In particular, the
newly established Fiscal Governance & Project Monitoring Office (FGPMO) was a step in the
right direction towards the establishment of a public procurement regulatory agency. Similarly,
the Policy on Public Procurement 2009 was benchmarked against the Federal Law, UNCITRAL
Model Law, and international good practice as outlined in the OECD-DAC Methodology on the
Assessment of National Procurement Systems. It, therefore, represents a good basis for the
preparation of an Edo State Procurement Law. Another positive finding from the assessment was
the improved monitoring of implementation of contracts through the FGPMO. Areas of
weakness found by the assessment included the absence of a procurement law itself, lack of a
cadre of procurement specialists in MDAs, absence of independent complaints review
mechanism for aggrieved bidders, limited public access to procurement information, poor
procurement planning, and the involvement of many layers of government in the procurement
process which leads to long processing times.

Public expenditure review of the education sector

71.    A public expenditure review of the education sector in Edo found that more
resources were now being allocated to education, but that there were weaknesses in the
distribution of teachers across schools, school inspection system, and education statistics.
According to the review, the share of education expenditure in total Government expenditure had
increased from 10.7 percent in 2007 to 14.4 percent in 2008 and 17.4 percent in 2009, which
represents significant progress towards the achievement of the 26 percent share advocated by
UNESCO. In spite of the increase in allocation of resources to the sector, the review also found

                                               30
that achievement of desired education outcomes was being undermined by unbalanced
distribution of teachers between urban and rural areas, weak systems for inspection and
insufficient education statistics for improved management. On the distribution of teachers
between rural and urban areas, the review observed that the proportion of female teachers in rural
areas is lower compared to urban areas.

Doing business in Nigeria report

72.     The 2010 Doing Business in Nigeria Report provided useful findings on the cost of
doing business in Edo State. The report was based on a survey that covered all the 36 states in
Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. It provided a quantitative measure of the
federal and state regulations for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering
property, and enforcing contracts – as they apply to domestic small and medium-size enterprises.
The report found that overall, Edo state was ranked 21st out of 36 states and the FCT. Within the
disaggregated elements of doing business, Edo was ranked 16th on starting a business, 26th on
dealing with construction permits, 32nd on registering property, and 6th on enforcing contracts.
The survey, therefore, provided useful insights into areas that require more urgent attention if the
investment climate is to improve in Edo state.


               VI.     THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT

A. Overall description

73.     The proposed first Edo DPO (DPO-1) is the first in a series of three planned annual
programmatic operations whose aim is to support the Government’s medium-term policy
and institutional reform program in two main policy areas: (a) improving management of
public resources in implementing an infrastructure-oriented development strategy, and (b)
improving the institutional and policy environment for growth and employment creation. These
policy areas will constitute the main pillars of the DPO. A cross-cutting theme running through
these policy areas is that of improving social accountability. Figure 8 below presents the scope
of the reform program covered by the entire DPO series, showing the main policy areas and their
sub-components.

74.    The specific critical actions supported by the first DPO can be summarized as
follows:

      Improving management of public resources: the first DPO supports five prior actions
       under two sub-policy areas. The first focuses on ensuring fiscal sustainability under
       which the DPO supports improved expenditure control through the sanitization of the
       payroll using modern biometric-based identification of personnel. The second sub-policy
       area focuses on improving budget institutions and practices. Specific actions supported
       are the enactment of modern procurement legislation; usage of selected IFMIS functions

   Improving the institutional and policy environment for growth and employment
    creation: the first DPO supports four prior actions under two sub-policy areas: improving
    the investment climate and the quality of education. Critical reforms for improving the
    investment climate under the first DPO are the commencement of an Edo Geographic
    Information System (GIS) and publication of land maps which together, provide a
    platform for a modern land information system that will be central to the process of
    streamlining procedures for acquiring property rights. Reforms for improving the quality
    of education include the piloting of Education Information Management Information
    Systems (EMIS) and establishment of School-based Management Committees in
    technical and vocational education institutions.

B. Development objective

75.    The DPO‘s development objective is to support Edo State‘s critical reforms for
improving the management of public resources and creating a better environment for growth and
employment creation in a socially accountable way. The state‘s critical reforms are outlined in
the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1), summarized in the policy matrix (Annex 2), and
described in more detail in the narrative below.

C. Level of support under the First DPO

76.    The proposed level of funding is US$75 million equivalent under IDA terms and to
be disbursed in a single tranche. As mentioned earlier, this is the first in a series of three
programmatic operations. Although the support is to a three year reform program, each
subsequent operation will be prepared separately.

D. Policy areas

77.     This section describes in more detail the reform program supported by the entire
DPO series. The prior actions for the first DPO are part of broader reform efforts being
supported under the three-year DPO program. A summary of the full policy matrix is presented
in Annex 2. Below is a detailed description of the issues under each policy area, the reform
measures being implemented, and the expected outcomes at the end of the program period. The
description is structured in the same way as Figure 8 above. At the end of the section, a summary
of the DPO-1 prior actions is presented in Table 5 with an indication of the latest implementation
status.

Policy Area 1: Improving Management of Public Resources

78.     The Government in Edo has placed improved management of public resources at
the top of its reform agenda. This is borne out of recognition that better management of
resources is critical to ensuring improved delivery of critical services, particularly in health,
education, transport, and the environment. In this regard, the reform program for improving
management of public resources focuses on two policy sub-areas: The first is to ensure that
development programs are implemented in a fiscally sustainable manner by making efforts to
increase revenues and controlling wastage in public spending. The second focuses on improving
budget institutions and actual practices so that the public gets value for money by ensuring that
resources are allocated to the right priorities and utilized efficiently. These two reform objectives
have an added significance for states such as Edo that have huge infrastructure needs following
years of under-investment but at the same time do not enjoy the same level of IGR as Lagos or
significant oil revenues as the core Niger Delta States.
Sub-policy area 1.1: Ensuring fiscal sustainability

79.     The Government’s commitment to fiscal sustainability is premised on its
appreciation of the need to maintain and expand public services in a resource constrained
fiscal framework. The construction of public infrastructure without paying attention to medium
and long-term fiscal sustainability can have significant negative consequences on service
delivery. Once there is no more fiscal space for expansion or maintenance of public facilities,

                                                 34
service delivery starts deteriorating with hospitals, for example, unable to pay for running costs,
health facilities without medicines, and schools suffering from lack of maintenance and
educational materials. Achieving fiscal sustainability is particularly challenging at the State level
because of over dependence on federal government transfers, and the federal government‘s
influence on key expenditures such as wages and pensions. In this regard, the Edo State
Government has put in place a reform program that is geared towards ensuring fiscal
sustainability by improving levels of IGR and controlling expenditure.
(i) Improving IGR

80.     The Edo state Government seeks to build on the recent strong performance to
further improve IGR. As observed earlier, IGR in Edo increased significantly since the new
administration came to power in 2008. However, there is also wide recognition that there is still
potential to improve IGR further. In this context, the Board of Internal Revenue (BIR) has
embarked on a medium-term reform program that aims at increasing revenues by promoting
voluntary compliance with tax laws and developing effective mechanisms for collection of taxes
and levies. First, the State BIR plans to undertake a training/capacity needs assessment of its
staff and before implementing the recommendations. Implementation of some agreed
recommendations from the assessment will be a trigger under DPO-2. Second, the board also
plans to complete coding for Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE). Through this process, the BIR has been
requiring institutions to provide information on their staff including ranks and pay structures
which is entered into a database. The BIR then determines individual tax liabilities of persons
subject to PAYE and issues codes. The codes help employers know how much tax to deduct
from wages while the overall database helps the Board establish tax amounts due from particular
corporate bodies thereby easing the process of reconciliation with the institutions when they
remit taxes. The Board will be updating the codes once a year around March. Third, the BIR
also plans to achieve full-scale automation of the tax administration system that will be further
integrated with the State IFMIS. Finally, the BIR also plans to establish a taxpayer services unit
that will have responsibility for improving voluntary tax compliance.
(ii) Improving expenditure control

81.      While the Edo State Government steps up efforts to increase IGR, attention is also
being paid to controlling expenditures. In this context, reforms are focused on dealing with all
potential expenditure pressure points. To start with, the Government has gathered relevant
biometrics data pertaining to public servants and transferred the data to an Oracle-based human
resources system to enable monthly payroll calculation (DPO-1 prior action). This will reduce
cases of ghost workers appearing on the payroll. Second, the Government also plans to develop
detailed guidelines on fiscal reporting and monitoring of Parastatals, LGs, and contingent
liabilities. This is in recognition of the fact that poor monitoring and fiscal reporting on this front
pose fiscal risks which could materialize into significantly high unforeseen expenditures. In
2012, the Government plans to build on the biometrics exercise by gathering complete HR
details for all employees on payroll and in 2013, the plan is to input (scan) all relevant HR
documents (birth certificate, appointment letter, letter of most recent promotion, educational
certificates) into the HR Module of Oracle and then conduct a follow-up payroll audit.



                                                  35
Expected outcomes on ensuring fiscal sustainability: At the end of the program period, it is
expected that reforms for ensuring fiscal sustainability supported by the DPO will result in the
following improvements: (i) IGR growing by 13.4 percent in real terms by 2013 and, (ii) the
ratio of wage bill (including pensions and gratuities) to recurrent expenditures being contained
below 60 percent

Sub-policy area 1.2: Improving budget institutions and practices

82.     Public financial management occurs in the context of budget institutions and
practices. As mentioned earlier, Edo state‘s PFM reform program is based on a prioritized
reform action plan that was developed following several assessments of the PFM system: the
PEFA assessment, the public investment management assessment, financial management
fiduciary risk assessment, and procurement assessment. The reform program supported by the
DPO is, therefore, an excerpt of the broader state PFM reform program. Since the budget system
provides a framework for the management of public resources, in essence, the PFM reform
program seeks to improve budget institutions and practices that make up the budget system.
Therefore, under this policy area, the DPO seeks to support reforms in four sub-areas: (i)
establishing a strong PFM institutional platform; (ii) improving practices in budget planning and
preparation; (iii) improving practices in budget execution and monitoring; and (iv) improving
practices in accounting, audit, and external oversight.

(i) Establishing a strong PFM institutional platform

83.      For budget reforms to be implemented successfully, they need to be anchored in a
strong PFM institutional platform. Such an institutional platform has three main dimensions.
First, there is need for reforms to be anchored in modern and comprehensive legal and regulatory
frameworks. Second, there is need for strengthened human and organizational capacity to
coordinate and implement PFM reforms. Third, there is need to have a modern, comprehensive,
and integrated PFM information classification and technology system.
Legal and regulatory reform
84.     A modern and comprehensive legal and regulatory framework is central to PFM
reforms because it defines the standards that a state will need to adhere to in the
management of public finances. Unless these standards are clearly defined and entrenched in
law, PFM reforms may also be frustrated by vested interests opposed to the reforms. PFM laws
ensure that those who are entrusted with the task of implementing the reforms have legal backing
for their actions.

85.     Given the importance of procurement in ensuring that public expenditure delivers
value for money, the Government has prioritized the enactment of the public procurement
law in its legal and regulatory reform program. There is currently no public procurement law
in Edo State. Before the new Government came to power in 2008, procurement activities were
being guided by a 2006 Circular containing approved procedures for the award of Government
contracts, purchases, and limits of authority to incur expenditure. The new Government
introduced two improvements. First, in 2009 it drafted a Policy on Public Procurement aimed at
establishing the foundation for a future Edo State Public Procurement Law and demonstrating

                                               36
the Government‘s commitment to strengthening the legal framework on public procurement. The
provisions of the policy were benchmarked against the Federal Procurement Law, UNCITRAL
Model Law, and international good practice as outlined in the OECD-DAC Methodology on the
Assessment of National Procurement Systems. The Government has now enacted a new public
procurement law (DPO-1 prior action). The law defines the principles and procedures to be
applied in the public procurement of goods, works and services. It also defines the roles of
different institutions and officers in public procurement and its regulation. Once the new
procurement law is effective, the Government aims to give priority to the implementation of
those aspects of the law that provide a strong institutional platform for improving procurement
practices. In particular, it plans to establish the Public Procurement Regulatory Agency and
MDA level procurement units (DPO-2 trigger) and then later establish a Procurement
Complaints Review Body.

86.      Beyond procurement, the state also plans to pass four other PFM related laws. The
first of these is the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The FRL establishes rules to be followed for the
prudent, transparent and accountable use of public resources. The second is the Finance (Control
and Management) Law which defines more broadly the institutions and processes for the
management and control of public resources. The third will be the Audit Law which defines the
procedure of examining the financial transactions undertaken by government entities and the
roles of various institutions and officers in the process. Currently, the state is using the Audit
Law of Bendel state, 1982, that contains provisions, many of which the Constitution now
overrides. For example, the Law provides for a State Director of Audit, whereas the Constitution
requires the appointment of an auditor general for the state. In the context of the Audit Law, the
Government also plans to develop an audit charter to be signed between the Director of Internal
audit and MDAs. The Charter is a formal written document that defines the purpose, authority,
and responsibility of the Internal Auditing Office. It establishes the Internal Audit Office‘s
position within the organization; authorizes access to records, personnel, and physical properties
relevant to the performance of engagements; and defines the scope of work. Finally, the
Government also plans to pass the Edo State Revenue Service Establishment Law. This law
provides for the establishment, composition and functions of the state Board of Internal Revenue
and related matters. Such a law would, for example, provide for autonomy of the state Internal
Revenue Service so that it is insulated from bureaucratic bottle necks found in mainstream
government agencies that could retard its performance. The Fiscal Responsibility Bill and Edo
State Revenue Service Establishment Bill are being considered by the Executive Council for
submission to the State House of Assembly while the Public Audit Bill and Finance (Control and
Management) Bill are yet to be drafted.
Human and organizational capacity for reform coordination and implementation

87.     In recognition of the multiplicity of PFM related institutions and interconnectedness
of reforms, the Edo state Government has adopted a coordinated approach to
implementation of reforms. Following the finalization of a PEMFAR and the PFM reform
action plan, the State Executive Governor instituted a high level inter-agency steering committee
for implementing the PFM reform action plan. The role of the steering committee is to provide
guidance in the implementation of PFM reforms, including the sequence in which reforms are to
be undertaken. Below the steering committee, a dedicated PFM reform unit staffed with subject
matter experts will be established (DPO-2 trigger). The unit will be located in the Ministry of

                                               37
Economic Planning and Budget and will serve as a secretariat to the steering committee. At a
technical level, the unit will be charged with the role of maintaining reform momentum by
providing the necessary motivation and support to the various government agencies
implementing PFM reforms. Specific support to be provided to agencies will include helping
develop detailed implementation work plans, identifying areas where specialist technical
assistance is required, and helping facilitate the recruitment of consultants. It will also ensure that
there is proper coordination in the implementation of the various reforms across agencies as well
as coordinating implementation of donor funded capacity building programs in PFM. The PFM
reform unit will provide regular reports to the steering committee on progress in the
implementation of the reform action plan.

88.    Apart from having an effective PFM Reform Unit to coordinate and drive reforms,
the Government in Edo recognizes that successful implementation of actual changes in
PFM practices hinge on there being a cadre of capable subject matter experts in the
various implementing agencies. These include budget officers and planners, accountants,
procurement specialists, M& E specialists, and IT specialists. At every stage of the budget
process, there is need for a cadre of relevant PFM specialists to carry out the required functions.
For instance, at the budget planning and preparation stage, there must be a critical mass of
planning and budgeting officers in central as well as line ministries that are capable of carrying
out the various budget planning and preparation functions. For instance, at the ministry of
budget, planning, and economic development, there should be planning and budget officers who
have the skills to forecast revenues, prepare a macroeconomic framework and fiscal strategy,
prepare a medium-term expenditure framework, and determine MDA-level expenditure ceilings.
These officers should also have the requisite skills of appraising budget proposals submitted by
line ministries. Similarly, line ministries ought to have planning and budgeting officers who have
the skills of coordinating the preparation of sector strategies and translating them into
implementation plans and annual budgets.

89.      Currently, Edo state suffers from a dearth of specialists in almost all PFM areas.
The civil service has some Accountants and IT specialists, but they are insufficient numbers.
Further, most of the available accountants are situated in the office of the accountant general
while most IT specialists are concentrated in the ICT directorate. The majority of ministries and
departments are, therefore, still deficient of these requisite skills. In other PFM areas, the
capacity gap is even wider. In equally important public financial management areas such as
budget planning and preparation, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation, there is no
noticeable cadre of specialists in the civil service. These functions are currently undertaken by
officers whose job descriptions are defined more broadly as responsible for finance and
administration and without specialized qualifications and training. In some cases, the available
accountants do everything. Without having the requisite numbers of people with appropriate
skills, it will be difficult for new PFM practices to be implemented.

90.     In the medium term, the Edo state Government plans to embark on an institutional
development program aimed at cultivating a cadre of PFM specialists. The program will
involve recruitment and training. With regard to recruitment, some of the people to be recruited
will be those that already have the requisite qualifications and skills. This will be the case with
regard to the recruitment of more accountants and IT specialists. The recruitment program will

                                                  38
also target a significant number of people with relevant education qualifications who will then
undergo training for specific positions. For example, in 2011, 16 graduates with economics and
finance backgrounds have been recruited to be trained as budget and planning officers. It is
expected that these recruits will undergo the necessary training and acquire enough experience at
the Ministry of Budget, Planning, and Economic Development, that some of them will be
deployed to key line MDAs. A similar approach will be employed in developing a cadre of
procurement specialists, IT specialists, Accountants, Auditors, and M&E specialists.

91.    For the cadre of PFM specialists to be effective, it is essential that they operate
within appropriate organizational structures. First, it helps to have the scope of specialized
functions clearly defined and properly located in a ministry or department. This usually entails
having a specialized unit or division set up in a ministry for planning, M&E, and procurement.
This helps to engender focus and singularity of purpose. It also ensures that capacity
development activities are properly defined and targeted. Second, once the units are in place, it is
important to have clarity of roles, responsibilities, and job descriptions across various PFM
functions.

92.     Recognizing the existing weaknesses, the Edo state government seeks to restructure
the PFM organizational framework. As a priority, once the PFM reform unit has been
established, its first task will be to help with the reorganization of the Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Budget, Economic Planning, and Development, and the Accountant General‘s
Department to ensure clarity in roles, responsibilities and job descriptions in line with ongoing
PFM reforms (DPO-3 trigger). Going forward, the Government, through the PFM reform unit
will also establish specialized units in various ministries and departments that will act as entities
for carrying out specialized PFM functions. The specialized units to be established include
planning and budgeting, M&E, procurement, IT, and internal audit.
Establishing a modern, comprehensive, and integrated PFM information classification and
technology system

93.     A number of PFM reforms are likely to be easier to implement if government
processes are carried out on a modern information technology platform. It has been
recognized that there are a number of operational challenges in budget formulation, execution,
and accounting that can only be dealt with if information is properly classified and managed
using a modern, comprehensive, and integrated system. Some of the operational challenges
include the reality of large volumes of data that need to be handled, often with low levels of
skilled manpower, the challenge of communicating and enforcing compliance to policies,
guidelines, regulations, and operational procedures across a large civil service that is not located
in one place. In an attempt to deal with these challenges, an integrated financial management and
information system (IFMIS) has become a useful solution. It represents a combination of
software, hardware and communication technologies implemented to enable operation and
management of key areas of government operations across the budget cycle.

94.    The Government of Edo is at an advanced stage of introducing an IFMIS that will
run using the Oracle software application. In recognition of the value that information
technology can bring not just to improving the budget process, but governance in general, the
executive Governor established a dedicated directorate of information communication and

                                                 39
technology (ICT) in 2009. The ICT directorate was charged with, amongst other responsibilities,
the task of introducing an Edo state IFMIS. The directorate decided to introduce the system using
Oracle‘s Enterprise Business Suit (EBS). A license for 10 modules6 of EBS has been procured by
the State. After conducting a staff verification exercise for the whole civil service using
biometrics technology, the payroll module ‗went-live‘ in May 2010. Four other modules went
live in 2011: Procure-to-Pay- ‗P2P‘7, general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable.
The state has now introduced a system of processing financial transactions using Oracle-based
applications (such as general ledger and accounts payable) within MoF, MoBPED, and the AGD
(DPO-1 prior action). This is a critical change in the way Government manages its public
finances because it will ensure that accurate financial data is readily available for prudent and
strategic decision making. Going forward, the Government plans three major improvements.
The first is implementation of the budget preparation module (Oracle Hyperion) and Accounts
Receivable modules (DPO-2 trigger) while the second is the roll out of IFMIS to five high
spending MDAs for real-time processing. The third planned initiative is the establishment of a
Disaster Recovery Site with regular testing of Disaster Recovery Plans. Finally, plans are to roll
out IFMIS to all MDAs for real-time transaction processing and reporting; implementation of the
Fixed Assets, Inventory (Stock) and Procurement modules of IFMIS; and seamless integration of
budget preparation, execution, accounting, reporting and auditing modules of IFMIS.

95.     Apart from having an IFMIS, the Edo state Government plans to introduce a
comprehensive budget classification system for budget process management. A properly
formulated budget classification system is beneficial in the analysis of policy formulation and
performance, allocation of resources among sectors, ensuring compliance with the budgetary
resources approved by the legislature, and day-to-day administration of the budget. For instance,
during budget preparation, it is much easier to align the budget to development priorities if the
classification of activities for budgeting purposes corresponds to the classification of the overall
development strategy or sector strategy. Similarly, during execution of the budget, monitoring
and control of expenditure is easier when there is a comprehensive classification of activities and
transactions. Currently, the budget classification system in Edo does not conform to the United
Nations‘ Conference on the Functions of Government (COFOG) and IMF‘s General Financial
Statistics (GFS). The classification system being currently used in Edo does not sufficiently
break down or track costs functionally, economically, geographically, or programmatically.
Going forward, the Government is in the process of developing a multi-dimensional Chart of
Accounts (CoA) that is COFOG and GFS compliant. A user manual with guidelines on how to
use the new COA will also be developed and issued to all MDAs.
(ii) Improving Practices in Strategic Planning and Budget Preparation

96.   The Edo state government is cognizant of the critical role that strategic planning
and budget preparation play in improving the quality of public expenditure because they
provide a framework for resource allocation. In this context, the focus is on ensuring that the

  Oracle R12.0.6 EBS modules purchased: Hyperion Budget and Planning, General Ledger (GL), Accounts Receivable (AR),
Accounts Payable (AP), Purchasing (PO), Cash Management (CE), Assets Management (FA), Core Human Resource (HR) ,

7
  The Oracle‘s Procure to Pay solution automates the entire procurement process, including sourcing and contract management,
supplier collaboration, quoting, requisition, and invoice processing, and integrated purchasing intelligence.


                                                             40
overall budget as well as the capital component in particular, reflect strategic policy priorities
and have a medium-term perspective.

97.     The state has made significant progress in ensuring that the budget reflects strategic
policy priorities. As mentioned earlier, the Edo state‘s medium term development priorities are
contained in its Vision 2020 document. During the budget preparation stage, further
consultations are undertaken to identify more specific development priorities for the year. In
order to give enough time for this consultative process and for MDAs to have enough time to
incorporate inputs received into their budgets, the government introduced a calendar for the
budget preparation process. An analysis of the 2011 approved budget showed that resource
allocations by functional classification broadly reflect the stated priorities. In particular, as
highlighted in the Vision 2020 document, the approved 2011 budget has physical and social
infrastructure development, education, health, and agriculture amongst the top five recipients of
budgetary resources.

98.      Going forward, the Government plans to make further progress in ensuring that the
annual budget reflects priorities, particularly in the selection of projects. In order to promote
social accountability, there are plans to strengthen participatory budgeting, particularly in the
selection of projects. The focus here is on the selection of projects because of the increasing
share of the budget‘s capital component. Key to this reform will be the development of
guidelines for citizen participation in the identification of priority capital projects. These
guidelines will, among other things, outline who is to be consulted, when the process will start,
what kind of information the Government will need to provide to stakeholders, what information
will be gathered from them, and how the information collected plus other relevant information
will be analyzed in coming up with a list of projects to be included in the budget. The guidelines
will be used for the first time in the preparation of the 2013 budget. A report will be published on
the utilization of citizen participation in the identification of priority capital projects for inclusion
in the budget and the extent to which their inputs will have been reflected in the budget (DPO-2
trigger). The Government plans to continue publishing such reports on a yearly basis.

99.     As part of the initiative to further improve alignment of the budget to development
priorities, the Edo State Government also plans to introduce a multi-year perspective to
budgeting. The Government realizes that in order to prioritize better, there is need to have a
medium-term perspective to budgeting. Such an approach ensures that prioritization is done in
the context of a medium-term resource constraint, rather than on an annual basis. This is
particularly important when considering the capital budget since most projects are likely to take
longer than one year to complete, and once completed, the budget needs to cater for recurrent
costs of running and maintaining the infrastructure. In this connection, plans are first to develop
a medium-term fiscal strategy paper to guide the preparation of future budgets. The paper will
specify the deficit and borrowing positions targeted and total revenue and expenditure
projections for the medium-term, usually three years. Second, the Government also plans to start
the preparation of medium-term sector strategies in the priority sectors of economic, social, and
environment. The MTSSs will contain more detailed strategies and activities for achieving
medium-term sector goals and objectives within the specified medium-term fiscal framework.
Finally, the plan is to have at least two MDAs from economic, social, and environment sectors
prepare their budgets on the basis of these MTSSs (DPO-3 trigger). Ultimately, the goal is to

                                                   41
have a budget that is prepared, executed, and evaluated within a medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF). Given that the state is channeling the bulk of its resources to infrastructure
development, the MTEF will help improve allocation of resources for asset maintenance. In
subsequent DPOs, specific prior actions and triggers for improving asset maintenance will be
included in the policy matrix.

(iii) Improving practices in Budget Execution and Monitoring

100. Reforms for improving execution and monitoring of the budget are seen as critical
to improving public service delivery in Edo. In the past, it was in the process of budget
implementation that corners were cut and public funds abused. This resulted in some projects not
being completed, delays in completion, and compromises in quality. In the medium-term, the
Government‘s reform program will focus on improving procurement practices, cash
management, and monitoring of budget implementation.

Improving public procurement practices

101. Beyond the enactment of the procurement law, changes in actual procurement
practices will be crucial to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the budget,
especially its capital component, which has been increasing in Edo State. In this context, the
reform program focuses on improving transparency and social accountability, reducing costs,
and improving timeliness in the procurement process. With regard to transparency and social
accountability, the current practice is that journalists and other civil society representatives are
invited to witness the opening of bids. However, once contracts have been approved by the
executive council, the winning and losing bidders are informed but the public is not aware. For
construction contracts, the name of the winning contractor is also displayed at the site once work
commences. The Government has now introduced a system of regularly publishing awards of
contracts. This will be done on a regular basis. The first to be published are contracts above N10
million awarded between 2009 and 2011 (DPO-1 prior action). In order to ensure that the
procurement process delivers value for money through reduced costs, the Government also plans
to start conducting regular price surveys. From the results of the survey, a Price Norm will be
issued to all MDAs to be used for procurement planning, especially those done through
shopping.

102. The Government also plans to reduce the time it takes to procure goods and services
by decentralizing the procurement process. Currently, the Permanent Secretary approves
procurements of N500,000 and below; Ministerial Tender Boards (MTBs) chaired by the PS
process contracts between N500,000 and N20 million.8 The MTBs‘ decisions are approved by
Commissioners or Secretary to Government or Head of Service; procurements of between N20
million and N100 million are approved by the Governor. Finally, contracts above N100 million
are approved by the State Executive Council (EXCO). The reason that contracts above N20
million are processed and approved by the Governor and EXCO and not by MTBs is because of
the weak procurement capacity at MDA level. The MTBs are mere committees whose members

8
 The MTB comprises 8 members: Permanent Secretary, or Representative, of the Ministries of Works, Finance, Economic
Planning and Budget, the Permanent Secretary of the procuring ministry/agency, a Representative of the STB, the Director of
Finance, and an Administration Secretary.

                                                              42
are not specialized in procurement. Government has, therefore, been reluctant to risk delegating
the processing of large contracts to MDAs. However, the disadvantage of centralizing
procurement is that it has usually led to delays in the time it takes to award contracts. Going
forward, the Government plans to undertake the procurement capacity building measures
outlined earlier. Once specialized MDA level procurement units have been established and
staffed with procurement specialists, the Government plans to decentralize procurement further
to MDAs (DPO-3 trigger). Decentralization of procurement to MDAs will reduce procurement
processing times and hence increase budget execution rates, especially of projects.

Improving cash management

103. One of the main constraints faced during execution of the budget has been
unavailability of funds due to poor cash management. Currently, opening of bank accounts by
MDAs is authorized by the Accountant General but there are no readily available records to
ascertain the number of bank accounts maintained by the MDAs and their balances. This
prevents the Treasury to ascertain daily government cash position to prioritize payments. It leads
to a ‗cash rationing system‘ and sometimes the Government reverts to borrowing when there are
idle cash balances in other Government bank accounts. Unavailability of cash and uncertainty
leads to delays in the implementation of planned activities and sometimes the build-up of arrears.
Another problem is that currently, it usually takes about a week for tax revenues collected by
commercial banks on behalf of the Government to be remitted to the Government‘s Treasury
Consolidation Bank Account maintained at UBA Bank. In order to deal with this situation, the
Government plans to work towards the introduction of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) system,
with revenue collecting bank accounts swept within two-days of cash receipt to Treasury
Consolidation Bank Account (DPO-2 trigger). Further, the Government also plans to introduce
a system where suppliers will be paid by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). That is to say, instead
of using ordinary paper checks, payments will be made by simply issuing electronic payment
instructions to commercial banks who will debit an indicated Government account and credit the
account of a supplier or contractor. Enhanced use of this payment system will eliminate payment
delays and the need to maintain overnight balances in government bank accounts outside the
TSA.

Improving budget monitoring

104. While there have been some noticeable improvements in monitoring of the budget,
weaknesses remain. Currently, a budget monitoring committee is in place comprising the AGD,
MBEPD, MoF with the Budget Director as Secretary to determine how MDAs are performing
based on allocations to date. However, the Government only produces summary periodic reports
on funds released to MDAs with no information on how the MDAs are doing in the execution of
the approved budget. With regard to the capital budget, Edo State has setup a Fiscal Governance
and Project Monitoring Unit in the Office of the Governor. Among its other roles, the Unit‘s
purpose is to ensure that all projects are executed at reasonable costs in accordance with
prescribed quality specifications. The unit has, among other activities, been organizing regular
town hall meetings for sectoral engagements with stakeholders.




                                               43
105. Going forward, the Government plans to start producing budget execution reports
on a more regular and structured basis, and to strengthen the participation of ordinary
citizens in the monitoring of the budget, particularly capital projects. In order to have timely
information on the performance of the budget as it is being executed, the government plans to
start preparing and publishing (in official Gazette and website) timely in-year budget execution
reports within 30 days of each quarter. With regard to project monitoring, the Government will
strengthen citizen participation in the process by following a more structured and systematic
approach. In this context, it will prepare guidelines for the participation of citizens in project
monitoring. These will become effective for use after their adoption by the EXCO and their
publication (DPO-2 trigger). As in budget preparation above, the focus is on the monitoring of
projects because of the increasing share of the budget‘s capital component. Improved
participation of citizens in budget monitoring represents a significant improvement in social
accountability which should in turn improve the effectiveness of the public investment program.

(iv) Improving practices in Accounting and Auditing

Strengthening internal audit functions

106. The strengthening of internal audit function has been identified as essential towards
improving accountability of public funds in Edo state. Internal audit has the key function of
reporting to senior management of an agency on the functioning of the management control
systems, and recommending ways for improvement. Managers are expected to use their internal
audit units primarily to perform a continuing assessment of the control systems and as a source
of recommendations for improving the effectiveness of those systems. In addition, however, the
internal audit unit can be used to examine apparent irregularities. Its findings can serve both as
evidence of the need to strengthen the control systems and as a basis for determining what action
may be appropriate against those who caused the irregularity. Currently, emphasis is mainly on
pre-audit of payment vouchers due to absence of Risk Assessment Framework to develop annual
audit programs. Pre-audit involves examination of payment vouchers and other documents
before the associated payments are made. The objective of pre-audit is to ensure that payments
made are valid, necessary and accurate, and that expenditures are in line with the approved
budget. While this approach has many advantages, such as reducing the incidence of fraud and
irregularity, it is not the best approach in an environment of immense capacity constraints.
Therefore, the Government now plans to gradually introduce a risk-based approach to internal
auditing. This approach entails focusing internal audit on areas associated with identified risks to
an organization instead of auditing every document and transaction. First, a risk-based audit
program will be developed and piloted in five (5) high spending MDAs. Thereaafter, the risk-
based audit approach will be rolled out to all MDAs (DPO-3 trigger).

Strengthening external oversight

107. Although there have been some improvements, financial statements and audit
reports are still being prepared and submitted with delays in Edo State. The statutory
requirement is for the financial statements to be submitted to the State‘s Auditor General within
a period of six months after year end. In turn, the State‘s Auditor General is required to submit
an audit report to the State House of Assembly (SHA) within three months of receiving the


                                                44
financial statements from the Accountant General. Due to delays by the Accountant General in
submitting the financial statements, and due to weak capacity at the State Auditor General‘s
office, there have been long delays in submitting audited reports to the SHA. This means that the
audit function of the state is not able to provide timely information on areas that are a source of
risks to the management of public finances.

108. The State Government has made significant progress in clearing the backlog of
outstanding reports of audited financial statements. In particular, the State Auditor General‘s
office submitted earlier in 2011 the audited financial statements for 2008, 2009, and 2010, to the
State House of Assembly (DPO-1 prior action). Going forward, the Government believes that
the introduction of IFMIS and plans to strengthen the capacity of the State Accountant General
and Auditor General‘s offices will singificantly improve timeliness in the preparation and
submission of financial statements and audit reports.

109. Beyond improving timeliness in the submission of audit reports, there are also plans
to improve their quality and to ensure that there is follow-up on recommendations. The
International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs 9) provide a comprehensive
framework to perform public sector audit work and is largely based on International Standards
on Auditing (ISA10). Currently, the State Auditor General‘s report claims to comply with these
international standards. However, a review of the 2008 and 2009 audit report shows that in
particular, ISSAI 4.0.12-4.0.16 and ISA 705 are not complied with as the paragraphs dealing
with basis of opinion and the opinion itself do not clearly indicate that qualified opinions were
issued and the description of the matter giving rise to the qualification was not provided in the
basis of opinion paragraph as required by the standards. Also, the Office could not provide a
document showing policies and procedures to maintain a system of quality control 11. Going
forward, the Government will introduce changes to the auditing approach so that by 2013, Audit
meets INTOSAI and IFAC audit standards. Finally, the Government also plans to ensure that
audit recommendations lead to corrective actions. At the moment, there is little evidence of
effective follow up of recommendations from previous audits. A look at audit reports from a
number of years shows that the same issues keep on coming up in subsequent audit reports.
There is also evidence that MDAs have not been able to respond to some of the queries raised in
the audit reports. In order to address this situation, there are plans to start producing quarterly
reports on Executive actions taken on audit queries and recommendations (DPO-2 trigger).

Expected outcomes on improving budget institutions and practices: At the end of the
program period, it is expected that improvements in budget planning, execution, and accounting
will be manifested in the following improvements: (i) improved value for money spending
because of increased number of public contracts awarded through competitive processes; (ii)
improved credibility of the budget manifested in a reduction in the percentage deviation of
aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to the original approved budget; (iii) improved
timeliness in the submission of audit reports to the SHA manifested through a reduction in the
number of months between end of fiscal year and the State Auditor General submitting the audit
report to the SHA; and (iv) improved follow-up on audit queries manifested through an increase
in the percentage number of audit queries reported as resolved.

     Policy Area 2: Improving the Institutional and Policy Environment for Growth and
     Employment Creation

110. Beyond better utilization of public resources for improved service delivery, the Edo
State Government recognizes that sustainable development will ultimately depend on
economic growth and the extent to which the state’s citizens can avail themselves to
employment opportunities. Growth of the state economy will not only lead to increased
availability of goods and services for individual consumers but will also improve the state‘s
revenues that are needed to expand the provision of public services in order to keep up with a
growing population. Employment creation is necessary for growth to have a significant impact
on poverty reduction. This is even more critical for Edo, because as indicated earlier, the state
has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, particularly amongst the youth. In
order to promote growth and create employment opportunities, the institutional and policy
reform program supported under the DPO focuses on two sub-policy areas: improving the
investment climate and improving the quality of education.

Sub-policy area 2.1: Improving the investment climate

111. The Government in Edo sees improved private sector investment in the state as
critical to its efforts to promote growth, create employment opportunities, and increase
IGR. To this end, one of its focus areas for policy and institutional reform is in improving the
investment climate. As the environment for business improves, private sector investment
increases which results in economic growth. At the same time, increased private sector
investment opens up opportunities for self and wage employment. Furthermore, increased
business activities and higher employment result in the expansion of the tax base, and hence
increased IGR .

Improving access to investment land

112. Although Edo State performed relatively well on the 2010 World Bank doing
business indicators compared to other states in the south, nationally, its position was less
enviable. Out of 18 states south of the FCT, Edo state was ranked 3rd while nationally, it was
ranked 21 out of 36 states and the FCT in Nigeria. In response to this performance, the
Government is carrying out a number of reforms including improvements in registration of
property and dealing with construction permits.

                                               46
113. In order to improve the land registration process, the Government is in the process
of developing a new Land Information System (LIS) that is based on geo-referenced digital
maps. In the 2010 Doing Business Survey, Edo State was ranked 32 out of 36 states in terms of
ease of registering property. In 2010, it took 69 days to register property and 15 procedures in
Edo State. One reason why it is very difficult to register land in Edo State is because of a poor
land record-keeping system which still uses paper maps, most of which have not been updated
for some time. It is for this reason that the Government plans to modernize its land record system
through the development of a GIS based land information system (LIS) that is based on. The GIS
will ensure that all land parcels are defined on the basis of geo-referenced digital information
that can be easily retrieved and analyzed. To carry out this work, the Edo State Government has
executed an agreement with a concessionaire for devising and running the Edo State
Geographical Information System (EGIS) (DPO-1 prior action). Further, the Government
recognizes that public access to relevant information on land and procedures for property
registration is an important component in improving access to land. In this context, it has
introduced a transparent land information system by establishing a website for the EGIS and
publishing on it the first set of land maps produced under EGIS (DPO-1 prior action). It is
expected that the first phase of the Edo GIS, which includes having in place an Electronic Data
Management System and a comprehensive LIS will be completed in 2012. Thereafter, access to
EGIS will be increased to other parts of the state outside Benin City by establishing regional
offices of EGIS in Ekpoma (Edo Central) and Auchi (Edo North) (DPO-3 trigger).

114. In parallel, the Government is also streamlining land registration procedures and
strengthening capacity in the land registry department. Preparations are underway for a
comprehensive review of land transaction processes aimed at streamlining land registration
procedures. Based on the review, new streamlined procedures are expected to be introduced. At
the same time, the introduction of a new LIS will require the strengthening of staff capacity. The
Government is, therefore, preparing a Staff Development Plan to recruit adequately skilled
professional personnel, whilst further improving the capacity of current staff in electronic data
management. Implementation of the Staff Development Plan is expected to start in 2012 through
the recruitment of adequately skilled professional personnel and training of current staff in
electronic data management.

115. The Government will also improve access to property by streamlining the process of
obtaining certificates of occupancy (CofO). A Certificate of Occupancy in Nigeria confirms
ownership of title to land. Currently, it takes a long time for property owners to obtain CofOs in
Edo State which can be a disincentive for potential investors. In the Sub-national Doing Business
Survey 2010, of the 69 days it took to register a property, 46 days (67 percent) were for
submitting receipt of payment to the Ministry of Lands & Survey and obtaining Governor‘s
consent. In this context, the Government will be undertaking a comprehensive workflow review
of the processes and time taken in obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy (CofO) in order to
streamline procedures. Based on the review, the Government will implement new, streamlined
procedures for obtaining CofOs (DPO-2 trigger). Ultimately, existing records will be digitized
after which an electronic CofO processing system will be introduced.




                                               47
Expected outcome on improving investment climate: At the end of the program period, it is
expected that reforms for improving investment climate supported by the DPO will result in a
reduction in the time it takes to register property in Edo State.

Sub-Policy Area 2.2: Improving Quality of Education

116. Improving the quality of education is at the heart of the Government’s strategy to
deal with unemployment in the state. The aim is to ensure that when pupils graduate from
schools and colleges, they are employable. This requires that pupils should be equipped with
relevant knowledge and skills obtained from institutions that are recognized by potential
employers. In this context, the DPO supports reforms for improving the quality of education that
are targeted at three areas. The first area concerns improvement of information systems in the
sector since data are critical for the establishment and monitoring of quality performance targets.
The second seeks to improve the quality of public technical and vocational educational
institutions given the critical role that they can play in improving the employability of the youth.
Finally, the DPO also supports reforms that are focused on improving the availability of certified
teachers in critical subjects, particularly in rural areas.

Improving education information systems

117.      The Edo State Government recognizes the critical role that comprehensive, up-to-
date, and accurate education information plays in planning and managing for better
quality of education. There is a strong appreciation that data plays a significant role in helping
the government to develop strategies, establish targets, and the monitoring progress towards the
set targets. In this context, the Government has decided to strengthen its Education Management
Information System (EMIS). Currently, education statistics are collected through an annual
education census. The census is usually expensive and sometimes misses out relevant data since
some paper records are lost by the time the census is conducted. Against this background, the
Government has piloted the EMIS in 3 LGAs (DPO-1 prior action). The EMIS has been
introduced at senior secondary education level, which is under the responsibility of the State
Ministry of Education. Under this system, information that includes attendance and performance
is collected by class teachers on a daily basis and then transmitted to EMIS centers at LGA level
as well as at the Ministry of Education headquarters on a real time basis. The Edo State
Government is particularly interested in using the EMIS for establishing a baseline of gender-
disaggregated data, monitoring improvements in gender related targets, particularly enrolment
and completion rates for girls, and also developing further policies to improve gender balance in
education on the supply as well as demand side. While the pilot is underway, the Government
has already started putting in place the arrangements for rolling out the system to all LGAs.
Informed by lessons to be learnt from the pilot, EMIS will be rolled out to all the 18 LGAs
(DPO-2 trigger). Going forward, the Government expects to start preparing and publishing
Education Statistical Reports based on the decentralized system. There are also plans to conduct
an independent assessment on EMIS utilization for decision-making.




                                                48
Improving the quality of public technical and vocational education institutions

118. While technical and vocational education is widely viewed as playing a critical role
in improving the youth’s employability, most institutions are yet to reach the acceptable
quality standards. Technical and vocational education covers the study of technologies and
related sciences and the acquisition of practical skills, attitudes, understanding and knowledge
relating to occupations in various sectors of economic and social life. While in the past it was
often seen as only relevant for those who did not make it through the conventional formal
educational system, technical and vocational education is seen as critical in the Government‘s
strategy of youth empowerment in an environment of high unemployment. A key advantage of
vocational schools is that they provide the students with the exact skills they need for the job
market upon completion. In this regard, the number of public as well as private institutions
offering technical and vocation education has increased in recent years. However, because of
poor standards, most institutions are yet to achieve national accreditation. Without accreditation,
students who complete their programs cannot receive the diplomas and certificates that are
required by potential employers as evidence of having successfully attained the requisite skills.

119. In order to improve the quality of technical and vocation education institutions, the
Government is improving governance at institutional level through the establishment of
school-based management committees (SBMCs). Since 2009, the Edo State Government
started establishing SBMCs in primary and secondary schools in order to decentralize some of
the school management responsibilities and increase community participation. It is expected that
SBMCs will ensure that resources are allocated to the priorities of the school, introduce greater
transparency and social accountability in the management of school resources, and improve
discipline and commitment amongst teachers (See Box 2 for more details on SBMCs). The
Government has since established SBMCs in Technical and Vocational Education Institutions to
carry out some of the responsibilities decentralized to the institution level (DPO-1 prior action).
In order to promote social accountability, the committees have broad representation, including
members from civil society. These SBMCs will be operationalized through the development of
an improvement plan for each school and provision of budget to be managed by SBMCs in the
implementation of the plan (DPO-2 trigger).

120. Beyond establishment of SBMCs, there are also plans to undertake more specific
measures towards achieving accreditation of programs by technical and vocational
education institutions. Currently, although the state has a number of technical and vocational
education institutions, most of their programs do not have accreditation from the National Board
for Technical Education (NBTE). As a result, even after completing the programs, students do
not receive certificates that are nationally recognized. The NBTE‘s accreditation aims to ensure
institutional relevance of curriculum and quality of programs delivered. Institutions can work
towards accreditation of programs so that their students are able to obtain any of the following
certificates: National Technical Certificate; National Business Certificate, Advanced National
Technical Certificate, Advanced National Business Certificate, Modular Trade Certificate,
Ordinary National Certificate, Higher National Diploma. Going forward, the Edo State
Government plans to develop an action plan for course accreditation for selected programs with
the objective of achieving course accreditation for at least 3 of the selected programs courses in
technical and vocational education institutions by 2013 (DPO-3 trigger).

                 Box 4: School-based management committees – definition, scope, and benefits
School Based Management (SBM) is the decentralization of authority from the government to the school level.
Thus, in SBM, responsibility for, and decision-making authority over, school operations is transferred to principals,
teachers, and parents, and sometimes to students and other school community members. However, these school-
level actors have to conform to or operate within a set of policies determined by the state government. SBM
programs exist in many different forms, both in terms of who has the power to make decisions and in terms of the
degree of decision-making that is devolved to the school level. While some programs transfer authority only to
principals or teachers, others encourage or mandate parental and community participation, often as members of
school committees (or school councils or school management committees). In general, SBM programs transfer
authority over one or more of the following activities: budget allocation, the hiring and firing of teachers and other
school staff, curriculum development, the procurement of textbooks and other educational material, infrastructure
improvements, and the monitoring and evaluation of teacher performance and student learning outcomes.

The attraction towards SBM is borne out of a conviction that good education is not only about physical inputs, such
as classrooms, teachers, and textbooks, but also about incentives that lead to better instruction and learning.
Education systems are extremely demanding of the managerial, technical, and financial capacity of governments,
and, thus, as a service, education is too complex to be efficiently produced and distributed in a centralized fashion. It
has been discovered that most of the incentives that affect learning outcomes are institutional in nature, three of
which include: (i) choice and competition; (ii) school autonomy; and (iii) school accountability. The idea behind
choice and competition is that parents who are interested in maximizing their children‘s learning outcomes are able
to choose to send their children to the most productive (in terms of academic results) school that they can find. This
demand-side pressure on schools will thus improve the performance of all schools if they want to compete for
students. Similarly, local decision-making and fiscal decentralization can have positive effects on school outcomes
such as test scores or graduation rates by holding the schools accountable for the ―outputs‖ that they produce. The
World Development Report 2004, Making Services Work for Poor People, presents a very similar framework, in
that it suggests that good quality and timely service provision can be ensured if service providers can be held
accountable to their clients (World Bank, 2003a). In the case of the education sector, this would mean students and
their parents.

SBM in almost all of its manifestations involves community members in school decision-making. Because these
community members are usually parents of children enrolled in the school, they have an incentive to improve their
children‘s education. As a result, SBM can be expected to improve student achievement and other outcomes as these
local people demand closer monitoring of school personnel, better student evaluations, a closer match between the
school‘s needs and its policies, and a more efficient use of resources. For instance, although the evidence is mixed,
in a number of diverse countries, such as Papua New Guinea, India, and Nicaragua, parental participation in school
management has reduced teacher absenteeism. SBM has several other benefits. Under these arrangements, schools
are managed more transparently, thus reducing opportunities for corruption. Also, SBM often gives parents and
stakeholders opportunities to increase their skills. In some cases, training in shared decision-making, interpersonal
skills, and management skills is offered to school council members so that they can become more capable
participants in the SBM process and at the same time benefit the community as a whole. In Nigeria, this approach
has been very successful under the Eko Secondary Education Project in Lagos.



Increasing the number of certified female teachers in rural areas and in critical subject areas such
as English, Science, and Mathematics

121. Other reform efforts to improve the quality of education are focused on increasing
the number of teachers in rural areas and in critical subject areas such as English, Science,
and Mathematics. As in many states within Nigeria and other countries, there is usually a
preference amongst teachers in Edo State to be posted in urban areas where life‘s basic amenities
are usually more readily available than in rural areas. This creates inequalities in teaching
resources between rural and urban areas. These inequalities are ultimately reflected in disparities
in education outcomes between rural and urban areas. Similarly, there is a shortage of teachers in

                                                           50
subject areas such as English, Science, and Mathematics, which are critical to establishing a
knowledge and skills base required for making a graduating student employable. Against this
background, the Government will undertake an assessment of gaps in the number of teachers in
rural areas and in critical subjects such as English Language, Science and Mathematics at basic
education level. Based on the assessment, an action plan for implementation of special incentives
to attract teachers in critical subjects to rural areas will be developed. Once the action plan is in
place, the Government plans to carry out a special incentives pilot in 3 priority LGAs for
certified female science teachers to locate in rural areas (DPO-2 trigger). The focus on female
teachers is premised on the hypothesis that they tend to have a positive demonstration effect on
girls. It has been proven that when girls see that female teachers are well represented amongst
their teaching staff, they get inspired to stay in school because they see hope in being gainfully
employed when they finish school. Currently, proportionately more girls tend to drop out of
school compared to boys, especially in rural areas. Therefore, the greater the number of female
teachers, the higher the likelihood of girls staying and progressing in school. In 2013, the plan is
to conduct an independent impact assessment of the special incentives pilot and then to develop a
plan to roll out the special incentives scheme to all LGAs.

Expected outcome on improving the quality of education: At the end of the program period, it
is expected that reforms for improving the quality of education supported by the DPO will result
in (i) better governance at institutional level that will lead to an increase in the number of
accredited courses in technical and vocational education institutions in Edo; (ii) increase in the
share of certified female science teachers in total number of female teachers located in rural
areas; and (iii) reduction in drop-out rates of female pupils at basic education level in rural areas

                          Box 5: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The reform program supported by the proposed DPO is aligned to the Government’s own policy and
institutional reform program. More broadly, the Edo State government has developed a development
strategy document that outlines for each sector, the Government‘s policy priorities and initiatives. Beyond the
over-arching development strategy, each MDA has also developed a strategic plan that outlines in more detail
programs and initiatives to be implemented. Finally, in the case of PFM, the Government has prepared a
comprehensive and prioritized reform action plan. In preparing all these strategy documents and reform
action plans, the Government consulted civil society and the private sector. During preparation of the
operation, the role of the Bank team was simply to facilitate the process of identifying the prior actions and
triggers. The specific proposals of critical actions to be included in the policy matrix came from the
Government team and were based on the Government‘s development strategy, MDA strategic plans, and the
PFM reform action plan.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
Although there are no other financial partners involved in the provision of this support to the Edo
State Government, implementation of the DPO supported reform program will be coordinated with
another Bank project in the state. However, it has been agreed with the Edo State Government that should
other development partners wish to provide budget support, a coordinated accountability framework would
need to be developed and agreed upon. Meantime, implementation of the DPO supported reform program is
being monitored under a coordinated institutional arrangement with a Bank TA project, the SEEFOR project.
The Government has decided to have one steering committee to oversee the implementation of both projects
in order to ensure that activities are properly coordinated.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
Implementation and monitoring arrangements have been appropriately customized to the State
Government’s own institutional arrangements while the provision of direct budget support is also
consistent with the state’s and country’s PFM system. In particular, the Governor has established a high-
level implementation committee for the DPO and the SEEFOR TA project to be chaired by the Deputy
Governor. The committee will be reporting on progress regularly to the State‘s Executive Council. The
provision of this support through direct budget support is consistent with the state‘s and country‘s PFM
system.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
While the DPO supports a broad medium-term reform program, only a few critical actions have been
selected as conditions for disbursement. As outlined in the program document and summarized in the
policy matrix presented in the annex, the reform program underpinning this operation is broad. However, a
conscious effort was made with the authorities to identify critical actions as conditions for disbursement. The
critical actions identified are those with the highest potential impact on achieving the program‘s development
objectives.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
Monitoring of progress will be transparent since it will be led by the Government’s own
implementation committee. Progress review meetings with the committee will be held regularly so that to
discuss possible remedial measures as well as Bank support in areas where progress is slow. This will ensure
that critical prior actions are met in time for disbursement to be made within the expected period.

                        VII.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. Poverty and social impact

122. Although a formal and empirical poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) has not
been conducted in the context of the operation, it is expected that the policy and
institutional reforms being supported will contribute positively towards the reduction of
poverty. Even without carrying out ex-ante, an empirical and formal PSIA of all the major
reforms to be supported under the operation, a theoretical assessment is done on the likely
linkages between the policy reforms to be implemented and their expected impact on the poor.
The assessment shows that overall, the reform program is expected to have beneficial effects on
the poor in Edo State.

123. Reforms for improving the management of public resources are aimed at improving
the quality of spending in Edo State, which is expected to benefit the poor. As indicated
earlier, the Government‘s main policy thrust of its economic transformation blue print is poverty
alleviation and sustainable economic growth by tackling the state‘s main challenges which are
high poverty levels, youth unemployment, dilapidated infrastructure, and flooding. The
Government‘s strategy is to tackle these challenges by allocating more resources to the identified
priority sectors of roads, drainage, education, health, agriculture, and ICT. The PFM reforms
being supported under the proposed DPO are aimed at improving the quality of public
expenditure by ensuring that the budget is indeed aligned to these poverty reducing priorities,
and that all practices in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the budget are
consistent with the principles of effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency. Therefore, once
implemented, it can be expected that PFM reforms will have a positive impact on the poor.

124. Reforms for improving investment climate are also expected to be beneficial to the
poor in Edo State through increased opportunities for self-employment and wage
employment. The reforms being supported under the proposed DPO are aimed at making it
easier for potential investors to register land and obtain certificates of occupancy upon
completion of building construction. It is expected that these reforms will improve opportunities
for self and wage employment. In terms of self employment, a boom in investments in the state
will lead to the emergence of a middle class in Edo which will in turn lead to an increase in
demand for goods and services provided by microenterprises, most of which are owned by the
poor. At the same time, increased investment will create wage employment opportunities for the
poor. For example, greater security of property rights will unlock the bottlenecks in accessing
finance, not just for businesses, but for the general land owner since land is still the most
common form of collateral in Nigeria. Currently, more than 80 percent of Nigerians remain
unbanked, and roughly the same proportion lack access to credit due to lack of collateral. Access
to collateral will, therefore, bring more people into the financial market. Further, increased
access to investment land will increase the availability of land for transaction and, therefore,
make it more tradable, and in turn, bring down the exorbitant cost of land in Edo state.

125. Improved quality of education will empower the poor and put them in a better
position to take advantage of various income earning opportunities. The reforms for
improving the quality of education being supported by the proposed DPO are biased towards the


                                               54
poor. In particular, vocational and technical education are meant to improve the employability of
those pupils who do not have formal education, did not complete their formal education, or who
completed formal education qualifications but have simply not been able to find employment
because their qualifications are not in demand in the job market.

B.     Gender aspects

126. A gender dimension has been explicitly incorporated in the DPO-supported reform
program. Since one of the DPO pillars focuses on improving the institutional and policy
environment for employment creation, a reform measure has been included in the policy matrix
that seeks to ensure that girls are able to compete with their male counterparts in the job market.
In particular, one of the reforms entails the development of an incentive package for attracting
female science teachers to the rural areas. It is expected that female science teachers will have a
positive influence on the girl child in rural areas to develop interest in science subjects as well
and hence compete with their male counterparts. Further, as indicated under the narrative on the
reform program, the Government plans to use the EMIS for establishing a baseline of gender-
disaggregated data, monitoring improvements in gender related targets, particularly enrolment
and completion rates for girls, and also developing further policies to improve gender balance in
education on the supply as well as demand side.

C.     Environmental aspects

127. The policy and institutional reforms to be supported by the proposed DPO are not
expected to have any direct negative impact on the environment. Improvements in policies
and institutions for managing public resources, attracting investors, and improving the quality of
education as outlined above cannot in themselves have any direct impact on the environment.
However, it is possible that indirectly, the budget support to be provided could be spent on
activities that have the potential to damage the environment. On this account, it is hoped that the
state Government will apply the extensive experience acquired in implementing World Bank
investment projects before the DPO which require strict adherence to environmental safeguards.
Further, there are adequate legal and institutional frameworks in Nigeria and Edo State to ensure
compliance with World Bank safeguards policies triggered by the proposed project. In Nigeria,
the Federal Ministry of Environment is responsible for setting policy guidelines on
environmental issues and ensuring compliance with national environmental standards.
Specifically, in Edo State, the Ministry of Environment and Public Utilities came into being at
the inception of this administration on Jan 23, 2009. The Department of Environment in the
Ministry consists of three Divisions and one Board: (i) Flood and Erosion Control; (ii) Pollution
Control, Sanitation and Waste Management; (iii) Laboratory Services; and (iv) Environmental
and Waste Management Board. These departments are responsible for policies initiation, process
and institutions monitoring as well as advisory services to the State government on all
environmental priorities for the promotion of a safe, healthy and sustainable environment.

D.     Implementation, monitoring, and evaluation

Implementation entity

128. Implementation of this operation is being coordinated by the State Ministry of
Budget, Planning, and Economic Development. Overall guidance is being provided by an
inter-agency steering committee mentioned earlier, chaired by the Deputy Executive Governor of
the State and with the Commissioner for the Ministry of Budget, Planning, and Economic
Development as its Deputy Chair. The steering committee is being supported by a technical team
headed by a program manager located in the Ministry of Budget, Planning, and Economic
Development.

Implementation capacity and available TA

129. Due to weak implementation capacity, the Bank in partnership with DFID and the
EU will provide TA to the Edo State Government for the implementation of reforms
underpinning the DPO. As mentioned under linkages to other Bank projects, reforms
implemented by the Government under the first DPO have been completed without significant
TA from the Bank and other development partners. However, reforms to be implemented under
subsequent operations will be supported by TA from the Bank. In this context, the main TA
instrument will be the State Employment and Expenditure for Results Project (SEEFOR). The
SEEFOR project is co-funded by an EU grant and has two main components: a component for
supporting PFM reforms and a component for supporting youth employment. The PFM
component will be used for supporting the state in carrying out a wide range of reforms,
including those which underpin the proposed DPO. To complement support for PFM reforms
under the SEEFOR project will be a DFID funded project, the State Partnerships for
Accountability, Responsiveness, and Capability (SPARC) program that will be providing TA for
PFM reforms to all states participating in DPO programs. In particular, the SPARC project will
support a PFM resident advisor in the state and readily available PFM specialist consultants in
the areas of tax administration, procurement, budgeting, and audit and accounting. The youth
employment component of the SEEFOR will provide TA for the implementation of education
related reforms under the DPO through support to the Ministry of Education and to technical and
vocational training institutions. For the investment climate reforms, discussions have also
commenced to put together a TA program under the Investment Climate Facility for Africa. In
preparation, a more detailed diagnostic of the policy and institutional environment is underway
in Edo using a State-level Private Sector Policy and Institutional Mapping (SPPIMS)
methodology with funding from the World Bank and DFID under the Investment Climate
Program (ICP).

Program monitoring and evaluation

130. Monitoring and evaluation of the reform program will be undertaken jointly by the
Bank and Government teams. The Government team will meet regularly to monitor progress in
implementing the reform program supported by the operation. Apart from the policy and
institutional reforms to be implemented by the Government, an M&E framework has also been
developed. The framework describes expected outcomes at the end of the program and indicators
for measuring success. It also identifies intermediate targets expected to be achieved at the end of

                                                56
each individual operation. During implementation support (supervision) missions, progress
towards the achievement of these annual targets and end of program outcomes will be evaluated.
Relevant ministries and departments will be directly responsible for carrying out specific actions
contained in the policy matrix as well as providing data on indicators for measuring progress
towards end of program outcomes.

E.     Fiduciary aspects

Public Financial Management System

131. Although weaknesses and risks remain, the team is satisfied that the public finance
management system in Edo can support this operation. As indicated earlier under analytical
underpinnings, the PEFA assessment, the Financial Management Fiduciary Risk Assessment,
and the Procurement Assessment were conducted in 2009-2010. As outlined above, all the
studies identified areas of where the Edo PFM system was strong or where progress was being
made, and areas where weaknesses and risks remain. Apart from the assurance provided by the
areas in which the PFM system was found to be strong, such progress in the timeliness and
consistency with which financial statements are prepared, transparency in the process of
scrutinizing audit reports by the Public Accounts Committee of the SHA, improved monitoring
of project implementation, the Government has put in place a comprehensive and prioritized
reform action plan for dealing with areas of weakness, some of which will be supported under
this operation. The TA to be provided under the SEEFOR project will also contribute to the
strengthening of the fiduciary environment in Edo.

Foreign Exchange Control Environment

132. Although the CBN’s accounts are audited on an annual basis, a full safeguards
assessment has not been conducted since 2001, which raises the possibility of potential risk.
Like in most countries, the foreign exchange system is controlled by the country‘s central bank,
the CBN. The IMF conducted a full Safeguards Assessment of the CBN in 2001 with respect to
the Stand-By Arrangement which expired on October 31, 2001. The assessment, which was
completed on November 28, 2001, concluded that vulnerabilities existed in the areas of financial
reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank. These findings and proposed recommendations
were presented in the corresponding staff report. No further safeguards assessment has been
conducted. Since then, the CBN‘s financial statements have been audited on an annual basis and
the reports rendered timely. The auditors have given unqualified opinions on the 2007 and 2008
audited financial statements. Nonetheless, given the absence of a more recent IMF Safeguards
Assessment or equivalent information from other sources relating to the control environment in
the CBN, the potential for risk exists. Therefore, as additional safeguards and in line with the
Government‘s existing practice, the foreign exchange proceeds of this Credit will be deposited
into a dedicated foreign exchange account held with the CBN, and an independent audit of the
movement of flows on this account will be undertaken.

Overall Fiduciary Environment

133. In spite of the mitigating measures put in place, the overall fiduciary risk of this
operation is rated as ‘high’. The commitment of the state Government in Edo to prudent

                                               57
financial management is strong as demonstrated by the actions taken since the current
administration assumed office. The reform measures, most of which will be supported by the
SEEFOR technical assistance project, and some of which underpin this operation will improve
the fiduciary environment even further. Nevertheless, this operation is only the second of its type
in Nigeria. Therefore, the overall fiduciary risk to the operation remains high.

F.      Disbursement and auditing

Recipient, Program and Financing Agreement
134. The Credit will be extended to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, represented by the
Federal Ministry of Finance, which will in turn on-lend to the State Government of Edo.
The credit proceeds would be transferred by the Federal Government to the State Government of
Edo under the same terms and conditions used for IDA investment loans on-lent by the Federal
Government to a state government. The establishment of such an on-lending agreement shall
constitute a condition of Credit effectiveness. A program agreement between IDA and the
Government of Edo State, outlining the commitments and obligations of the Government of Edo
State under the program, shall be negotiated and signed at the same time that the Financing
Agreement for the Credit is negotiated and signed between IDA and the Federal Republic of
Nigeria.

Funds flow arrangements

135. Funds will first be deposited into a dedicated Federal Government foreign currency
denominated account at the CBN before being transferred into a dedicated foreign
currency denominated account for the Edo State Government also maintained at the CBN,
after which the Edo State Government will be able to use the funds to finance budgeted
expenditures. The Government of Nigeria shall identify a dedicated Foreign Currency Account
with the CBN into which the proceeds of the credit will be disbursed on a single tranche basis
upon credit effectiveness. The account is to be used exclusively for the proceeds of the Credit
and will form part of Federal Republic of Nigeria‘s foreign exchange reserves. The funds in the
Account will, within two working days, be transferred into a dedicated account of the
Government of Edo State, to be established with the CBN. The funds transferred into the
dedicated Foreign Currency Account of the Government of Edo State with the CBN will form
part of the Consolidated Fund Account of the Government of Edo State and will be used to
finance the budgeted expenditures of the Government of Edo State. The Government of Edo
State will make withdrawals from these accounts either directly for United State Dollar
denominated budgetary expenditure, or transfer the resources in Foreign Currency and/or local
currency to dedicated accounts it maintains with any commercial bank that has met the stress test
conducted by the CBN12 to finance budgeted expenditures in local currency. The dedicated
accounts and the transactions therein will be recorded in the Government of Edo State's budget
management and accounting system.

  The stress tests conducted by CBN in 2009 included a review of the state of capital adequacy, liquidity and
corporate governance.

Disbursements

136. Disbursements and /or withdrawals from the designated Foreign Currency Account
of the Government of Edo State held with the CBN, as well as the designated Local or
Foreign Currency Accounts of the Government of Edo State held with commercial banks
shall not be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be
needed. The proceeds of the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the
negative list as defined in Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement. If any portion of the Credit is
used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule of the Financing
Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an
amount equal to the amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such
request shall be cancelled from the credit.

Assurance Requirements

137. Due to the fiduciary risks associated with the program, additional fiduciary
arrangements shall apply to this operation. An audit of the flows in and out of the dedicated
Foreign Currency Account of the Government of Edo State held with the CBN as well as the
dedicated Accounts (Foreign Currency and Local Currency) to be established with any of the
Government of Edo State‘s will be carried out by independent auditors acceptable to IDA within
4 months after the end of each fiscal year (and until such time that the balances in the accounts
reach zero), and the audit report shall be submitted to IDA within 6 months of the end of each
relevant fiscal year. The Terms of Reference of the audit will be agreed at negotiation but will
include with respect to the Foreign Currency Account held with the CBN, a full assurance that
the withdrawals from the account were indeed (i) reflected in the budget management and
accounting records of the Government of Edo State, and/or (ii) transferred in foreign or local
currency to the dedicated accounts established by the Government of Edo State are reflected in
the budget management and accounting records of the Government of Edo State. Within 30 days
of disbursement of the Credit by IDA, the Edo State Commissioner of Finance, jointly with the
Auditor General, shall also provide a written confirmation to IDA certifying the receipt of the
transfer of the Credit by the CBN into the Government of Edo State‘s Foreign Currency Account
held with CBN.

G.     Risks and Mitigation

138. Potentially, the program faces three main types of risks. The first is macroeconomic
emanating from uncertainty in world oil prices or lower than projected non-oil revenues; the
second is political risk as a result of the upcoming elections; and the third is implementation
capacity risk due to the generally weak human capacity in Government.

Macroeconomic risk

139. A significant fall in oil-price revenues or non-oil revenues could undermine the
Government’s planned expenditure program. It would reduce the Government‘s fiscal space
to undertake significant discretionally expenditures, especially on infrastructure development.
With limited scope to borrow additional resources, the Government could be forced to cut down

                                               59
on some priority investment expenditures, in order to accommodate statutory recurrent
expenditures. To mitigate this risk, the Bank will continue to advise the Federal Government on
the need to establish a more robust oil fund that would be insulated from ad hoc withdrawals and
hence build up healthy balances that would be used to cushion the economy from negative oil
price shocks. The Bank and other development partners will also actively support the capacity of
the Fiscal Responsibility Commission in playing a critical role in enforcing adherence to the oil-
price based fiscal rule.

Political risk

140. Governorship elections slated for July 2012 in Edo could slow down implementation
of the reform program as well as affect the medium-term sustainability of the reforms
should a different administration emerge. As mentioned earlier, the Governor of Edo State
assumed office in November 2008 after an election tribunal nullified the election of a former
governor who was earlier declared winner of the 2007 elections. Since the tenure of a Governor
is four years, the next Governorship election in Edo State will be in 2012. The independent
electoral commission recently announced that the elections will take place in July 2012. In the
near term, there is a risk that political activities in the run-up to the elections could distract the
Government‘s attention to reforms, and hence delay their implementation. Beyond the elections,
there is also a risk to the medium-term sustainability of the reforms being supported by the DPO
should a different administration emerge from the elections. To mitigate these risks, the team
will take three measures. First, conscious efforts will be undertaken to identify and establish a
critical mass of reform champions at technical level who can continue to focus on implementing
those elements of the reform program that are critical but not politically sensitive. Second, to
help maintain the momentum, the team will intensify implementation support visits and missions
to the state. Finally, the team will accelerate social accountability work already started in Edo for
supporting greater participation of civil society and other non-state actors in monitoring reform
programs.

Implementation capacity risk

141. The systemic problem of capacity constraints in Government will be another risk to
the program that could also cause delays in the implementation of reforms. To mitigate this
risk, the Bank will, as outlined earlier, provide technical assistance as required using resources
from Bank investment and TA projects currently being implemented in areas also covered by the
DPO.

Mr Robert B. Zoellick
President
The World Bank
1818 H Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20433

Dear Mr Zoellick,

                    Edo State Government: Letter of Development Policy

1.      On behalf of the Edo State Government, I write to request for the first Edo Development
Policy Credit of US$75 million equivalent from the International Development Association
(IDA) to be provided through the first Development Policy Operation (DPO-1) in support of our
first growth and employment-oriented policy and institutional reform agenda whose framework
has been provided for in our development strategy that is contained in the Edo Vision 2020
Stakeholder Development Committee Report. The funds provided will help to fill a financing
gap that exists in the budget for implementing our development program. At the same time, this
form of support also contributes to the implementation of our development strategy by
recognizing the policy and institutional reforms that we are implementing.

2.      The proposed DPO-1 will support policy and institutional changes in the following areas:
(i) Improved management of public resources in implementing an infrastructure-oriented
development strategy by ensuring fiscal sustainability and improving budgeting institutions and
practices; (ii) Improved institutional and policy environment for growth and employment
creation, focusing on a better investment climate and improved quality of education. Under
improving management of public resources, the first DPO supports five critical reforms:
improved expenditure control through the sanitization of the payroll using modern biometric-

                                              61
based identification of personnel, the enactment of modern procurement legislation, usage of
selected functions from the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) for
transaction processing in the implementation of the budget, improving transparency in
procurement through the publication of contracts awarded, and strengthening external oversight
by clearing the backlog of audited financial statements that have not yet been submitted to the
State House of Assembly. Under improving the institutional and policy environment for growth
and employment creation, the first DPO supports four critical measures: the commencement of
an Edo Geographic Information System (GIS) and publication of land maps which together,
provide a platform for a modern land information system that will be central to the process of
streamlining procedures for acquiring property rights, the piloting of an Education Information
Management Information Systems (EMIS) and establishment of School-based Management
Committees in technical and vocational education institutions. More details on the proposed
reforms to be supported under the DPO-1 are set out in Part B of this letter.

A. Edo State’s Development Strategy

3.      My Government‘s medium-term development strategy is outlined in a report of the
Stakeholder Development Committee. The strategy seeks to propel Edo state to becoming
amongst the top 5 economies in Nigeria by the year 2020. The strategy was crafted after the
stakeholders came to a consensus that Edo‘s key development challenge is rampant poverty
which is in turn due to high youth unemployment, the poor state of infrastructure in key service
areas, and flooding - particularly in the capital city, Benin. In this context, the development
strategy is anchored on four many policy thrusts: (i) increasing access of the people to quality
social services and basic infrastructure, (ii) partnership and role sharing between the government
and the private sector, where the role of government will be predominantly that of policy
making, regulation and providing an enabling environment while the private sector will become
the engine of growth, (iii) inclusiveness in development initiation, management, and sustenance,
(iv) targeted reduction of poverty. With these main policy thrusts in mind, the strategy identifies
six priority areas as follows: roads, drainage, education, health, agriculture, information and
communication technology, and internally generated revenue. The strategy further identifies
good governance as an overarching theme.

Roads

4.      The strategy‘s main objective under roads is construction and rehabilitation of roads with
the view to connecting many rural communities to urban centres for improved service delivery
and enhanced economic activities. It is clear from our consultations that improved conditions of
our roads will improve access and delivery of services in various sectors including health,
education, and agriculture. Proper maintenance of Edo State roads will also be of benefit to the
entire country because the State is strategically located and remains the gateway to the northern,
eastern, and western parts of the country. In this regard, improving roads in Benin City will be a
key objective because the greatest traffic congestion is within and around our capital city.
Previous administrations grossly underinvested in road construction and maintenance. Whenever
funds were allocated, the projects were either poorly executed or not completed. My
administration therefore seeks to allocate more resources to the construction and rehabilitation of
priority roads and to ensure that we obtain value for money from such projects by following due


                                                62
process in the award of contracts for such road projects and closely monitoring the execution of
the projects.

Storm Water Drainage

5.       The City of Benin has perpetually been suffering from flooding during the rainy season
with many adverse effects on the population, including in some cases, death by drowning.
Whenever it floods, people cannot go about with their normal businesses, such as trading
activities. In other cases, the flood water causes water borne diseases while in other cases it leads
to the breeding of mosquitoes that cause malaria, which is the number one killer disease. The
experience before the new administration took over was one of drains being constructed but not
lasting because of poor design and workmanship. In terms of design, the problem was that drains
were being constructed without proper linkages to other urban infrastructure systems such as
roads and housing, and without taking topography into account. Since my administration took
over in 2008, we have been fixing those drainage systems that need urgent attention and have
ensured that drainage systems for new roads are properly designed. Most importantly, we have
now developed a prioritized master plan of the Benin City storm water drainage system which
was completed in 2010. Going forward, the strategy is to allocate significant resources to the
phased implementation of the master plan, starting with priority components.

Education

6.      The Government‘s strategic goal in education is to increase access as well as the quality
of education among the urban and rural population across all ages and levels in the state. A key
feature of the education sector that we inherited upon taking office was that it was characterized
by crumbling infrastructure following years of neglect. Therefore the focus of my administration
has been to start rehabilitating primary and secondary schools in order to improve the learning
environment. My administration has also embarked on a series of policy and institutional reforms
some of which I will highlight a little later in this letter.

Health

7.       In health, the Government‘s mission is to develop and implement policies and programs
that will strengthen the Edo State health system and enable it to deliver effective, efficient,
affordable, acceptable and readily accessible health services that will allow the people to live
healthy and productive lives. Like in education, the medium-term strategy is to build and
rehabilitate health facilities as well as implement policy and institutional reforms that will
improve access and the quality of health services.

Agriculture

8.     By virtue of her natural endowments and geographical position, Edo State has the
potential to develop as a hub of Agriculture and Agro-allied industries in Nigeria. In this context,
my administration seeks to pursue policies and programs that will improve productivity,
processing, and access to markets in identified priority value chains in which the state has a
comparative advantage.


                                                 63
ICT

9.      My administration‘s goal in this area is to use ICT as a vehicle for improved governance
and service delivery. In particular, the objective is to use ICT to deliver services in a manner that
is operationally more efficient and effective, transparent and accountable, and that promotes the
participation of citizens in the decision making processes. Hitherto, service delivery by the Edo
State Government was based on the manual management of information resulting in poor service
delivery as information required for planning was unavailable, difficult or impossible to store
and retrieve. This has made successive governments non-responsive and its workforce adjudged
sluggish and inefficient. Furthermore, manual financial management has encouraged leakages
and maladministration of scarce public resources. My administration‘s strategy is therefore to
use ICT as an enabler for effectively, efficiently, and transparently delivering public services.

B. The State’s Policy and Institutional Reform Program

10.      Having outlined the key elements my Government‘s development strategy, I would now
like to turn to the reform program that underpins this strategy. While the reform program itself
encompasses all the components of the strategy, I will limit myself to two main areas in this
letter: how we intend to get value for money from the utilization of public resources and how we
intend to grow the economy and create jobs by improving the investment climate and the quality
of education.

   (i)     Fiscal sustainability

11.     After years of neglect, my Government is committed to rehabilitate public infrastructure
and in other cases construct new infrastructure in order to improve service delivery and in turn,
the livelihoods of our people. At the same time, we started from a position of critical resource
shortage that necessitated the need for far reaching reforms in how we manage our resources. In
this regard, our reform program has two main pillars. The first seeks to ensure fiscal
sustainability by undertaking reforms to increase our internally generated revenues (IGR) while
at the same time curbing wastage in carrying out public expenditures. The second pillar seeks to
ensure that we do not just avoid wastage in the utilization of public resources, but that for every
unit of public resource, we get maximum value for money.

12.    In order to increase IGR, our Board of Internal Revenue (BIR) has been carrying out a
number of reforms to improve effectiveness and efficiency in the collection of taxes. At the same
time the Government is undertaking various measures in order to expand the tax base. In
improving effectiveness and efficiency of tax collection the State BIR has been strengthening its
capacity to collect taxes mainly by recruiting more staff and through training. However, this has
been happening mainly on an ad hoc basis. Going forward, the BIR plans to undertake a
comprehensive capacity needs assessment of its staff which will form the basis of a more
systematic capacity building program. Second, the BIR has started the coding of Pay-As-You-
Earn (PAYE) and now plans to complete the process. Under this exercise, institutions are asked
to provide information on their staff including ranks and pay structures that is entered into a
database. The information is then used to determine tax liabilities of persons that are subject to
PAYE and then issues codes. The information provided by the coding system is useful for

                                                 64
institutions in determining how much tax to deduct and remit while it helps the BIR to reconcile
expected tax returns with actual out-turns. Lastly, with help from the ICT directorate, the BIR
has started the process of introducing an Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS), where
people, processes and technology will be functionally organized to administer taxes in an
integrated manner.

13.    In order to expand the tax base, the State‘s efforts are currently focused on the state‘s
potential to maximize property taxes. In this regard, the Ministry of Lands has embarked on the
Edo Geographic Information Service (EGIS) in order to improve the identification of properties
using digitized and geo-reference maps in order to have a clear sense of billable records for
properties. It is hoped that when this project is completed, revenues from land use charges will
increase significantly. The project has started with Benin City but will eventually cover all the
major cities and towns of the state.

14.     Apart from increasing IGR, the Government seeks to achieve fiscal sustainability by
closing all loopholes that usually lead to wastage and abuse in the utilization of public resources.
In this context, the Government started by embarking on the process of sanitizing the public
sector payroll, which is usually susceptible to abuse through the inclusion of ghost workers. As a
prior action for the first DPO, we have gathered all relevant biometrics data pertaining to public
servants and transferred the said data to an Oracle-based human resources system to enable
monthly payroll calculation. This exercise has already helped to flush out ghost workers. Going
forward, the Government also plans to develop detailed guidelines on fiscal reporting and
monitoring of Parastatals, Local Governments (LGs), and other contingent liabilities. It is hoped
that implementation of the guidelines will minimize the likelihood of fiscal risks posed by
parastatals, LGs, and other contingent liabilities from materializing into significantly high
unforeseen expenditures.

   (ii)    Getting value for money through improved budget institutions

15.     The Edo State Government believes that ensuring fiscal sustainability needs to be
accompanied by conscientious efforts to get value for money from the utilization of public
resources by improving budgetary institutions and practices. This is because we recognize the
fact that the budget is the instrument through which public resources are translated into goods
and services for meeting people‘s development needs. Following a World Bank supported
assessment of our public financial management system, we developed a prioritized reform action
plan for improving institutions and practices around the various stages of the budget process:
planning, preparation, execution, monitoring, accounting, auditing, and external oversight.

16.      With regard to strengthening the institutional platform for PFM, we are carrying out
reforms in three areas. First, we have embarked on a process of preparing and passing modern
and comprehensive PFM laws. We believe that these will define the framework and set high
standards for the management of public finances. As prior action for the first DPO, we have
enacted the public procurement law. The law defines the principles and procedures to be applied
in the public procurement of goods, works and services. It also defines the roles of different
institutions and officers in public procurement and its regulation. Other laws to be passed include



                                                65
the Fiscal Responsibility Law, the Finance (Control and Management) Law, the Audit Law, and
the Edo State Revenue Service Establishment Law.

17.     Second, reforms for strengthening the institutional platform for PFM are focused on
improving human and organizational capacity. In particular, the reforms seek to improve
coordination of PFM reforms, the organizational structure of key ministries, departments and
agencies, and ensuring that such MDAs are staffed with the right numbers of qualified personnel.
With regard to coordination, we have instituted a high level inter-agency steering committee for
implementing the PFM reform action plan. The role of the steering committee is to provide
guidance in the implementation of PFM reforms, including the sequence in which reforms are to
be undertaken. Going forward, we plan to establish a PFM reform unit that will be staffed with
subject matter specialists. The unit will serve as a secretariat to the steering committee.

18.     Apart from having an effective PFM Reform Unit to coordinate and drive reforms, we
recognize the fact that successful implementation of actual changes in PFM practices hinges on
there being a cadre of capable specialists in the various implementing agencies. In this regard,
we have embarked on the process of recruiting and training PFM subject matter experts such as
budget officers and planners, accountants, procurement specialists, M& E specialists, and IT
specialists. Currently, Edo state suffers from a dearth of specialists in almost all PFM areas. For
example, the civil service has some Accountants and IT specialists, but they are insufficient.
Further, most of the available accountants are situated in the office of the accountant general
while most IT specialists are concentrated in the ICT directorate. The majority of ministries and
departments are therefore still deficient of these requisite skills. We have already made
significant progress in this endeavor. In 2011, 16 graduates with economics and finance
backgrounds we recruited to be trained as budget and planning officers. We also recruited 34
young accounting graduates.

19.     Organizational strengthening is also being done through the restructuring of some MDAs.
In particular, once the PFM reform unit has been established, we plan, as a priority, to restructure
the Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Budget, Economic Planning, and Development; and the
Accountant General‘s Department to ensure clarity in roles, responsibilities and job descriptions
in line with ongoing PFM reforms. Going forward, we also plan to establish specialized units in
various ministries and departments that will act as entities for carrying out specialized PFM
functions. The specialized units to be established include planning and budgeting, M&E,
procurement, IT, and internal audit.

20.     Finally, we also believe that the strengthening of an institutional platform for PFM should
involve the introduction of a modern information classification and technology system. This is in
recognition of the fact that a number of operational challenges in budget formulation, execution,
and accounting can only be dealt with if information is properly classified and managed using a
modern, comprehensive, and integrated system. In this regard, we have introduced an integrated
financial management and information system (IFMIS) to help us in the operation and
management of key areas of government operations across the budget cycle. The Edo IFMIS is




                                                66
running using the Oracle software application. A license for 10 modules13 of EBS has been
procured by the State. After conducting a staff verification exercise for the whole civil service
using biometrics technology, the payroll module ‗went-live‘ in May 2010. Four more modules
went live in 2011: Procure-to-Pay- ‗P2P‘14, general ledger, accounts payable and accounts
receivable. As a prior action for the first DPO, we have introduced a system of processing
financial transactions using Oracle-based applications within MoF, MoBPED, and the AGD.
Going forward, we plan to start using the budget preparation module (Oracle Hyperion) and
Accounts Receivable module. We also plan to roll out IFMIS to five high spending MDAs for
real-time processing.

21.     Apart from having an IFMIS, we also plan to introduce a comprehensive budget
classification system for budget process management. The classification system being currently
used in Edo does not sufficiently break down or track costs functionally, economically,
geographically, or programmatically. Going forward, we therefore plan to develop a multi-
dimensional Chart of Accounts (CoA) that is compliant with the United Nations‘ Conference on
the Functions of Government (COFOG) and IMF‘s General Financial Statistics (GFS)
classification systems. A user manual with guidelines on how to use the new COA will also be
developed and issued to all MDAs. We believe that a properly formulated budget classification
system is beneficial in the analysis of policy formulation and performance, allocation of
resources among sectors, ensuring compliance with the budgetary resources approved by the
legislature, and day-to-day administration of the budget.

     (iii)    Getting value for money through improved budget practices

22.     Beyond building a strong institutional platform for improved PFM, our reform program
seeks to improve our practices across the whole budget cycle. First, we have embarked on
reforms for improving strategic planning and the way we prepare our budget. In particular, the
focus of our reforms is to ensure that the overall budget and the capital component in particular,
reflect strategic policy priorities and have a medium-term perspective. In trying to ensure that the
budget reflects strategic policy priorities, we have introduced a budget calendar to guide the
budget preparation process. In particular, the calendar provides enough time for the Government
to consult with the public on more specific priorities for the following year. Going forward, we
would like to strengthen this process particularly as it pertains to the selection of projects.
Specifically, we plan to develop guidelines for informing the process through which citizens will
be consulted in the identification of priority capital projects. These guidelines will among other
things, outline who is to be consulted, when the process will start, what kind of information the
Government will need to provide to stakeholders, what information will be gathered from them,
and how the information collected plus other relevant information will be analyzed in coming up
with a list of projects to be included in the budget.

23.     In order to further improve alignment of the budget to development priorities, the Edo
State Government also plans to introduce a multi-year perspective to budgeting. The goal is to
have a budget that is prepared, executed, and evaluated within a medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF). Such an approach ensures that prioritization of programs and projects takes
place in the context of a medium-term resource constraint, rather than on an annual basis. Given
that most projects are likely to take longer than one year to complete, the introduction of an
MTEF will ensure that during the budgeting process, future recurrent costs of running and
maintaining infrastructure are anticipated and incorporated in the budget. The introduction of an
MTEF will be done in a phased manner. First, we plan to develop a medium-term fiscal strategy
(MTFS) paper to guide the preparation of the budget. The paper will specify the deficit and
borrowing positions targeted and total revenue and expenditure projections for the medium-term,
usually three years. Second, we plan to start the preparation of medium-term sector strategies in
the priority sectors of economic, social, and environment. The MTSSs will contain more detailed
strategies and activities for achieving medium-term sector goals and objectives within the
specified medium-term fiscal framework. The MTFS and the MTSS, will provide the critical
building blocks for an MTEF.

24.     Moving down the budget preparation process, the next set of reforms will focus on
improving budget execution and monitoring. In the area of execution, improving procurement
and cash management practices will be our priority. With regard to procurement, the reform
program will focus on improving transparency, reducing costs, and improving timeliness in the
procurement process. In order to improve transparency in procurement, we have introduced a
system of regularly publishing all procurement awards falling above the Ten Million Naira
threshold. As a prior action for the first DPO, we have published contracts above N10 million
awarded between 2009 and 2011. Going forward, we also plan to reduce procurement costs and
time by introducing a number of new practices. For example, we plan to start conducting regular
price surveys whose results will be used to come up with a Price Norm to be issued to all MDAs
for use in procurement planning, especially those done through shopping. We also plan to reduce
the time it takes to procure goods and services by decentralizing the procurement process.
However, decentralization of procurement to MDAs will only be done after the procurement
capacity of the MDAs has been strengthened through the establishment of specialized MDA
level procurement units and once these have been adequately staffed with qualified and trained
procurement specialists.

25.     In the area of cash management, our main focus will be to ensure that MDAs have readily
available funds to implement their budgets while at the same time minimizing the need to borrow
funds in order to meet the Government‘s cash flow needs. Central to this reform will be the
establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA). Under the current system where each MDA
can open several Bank Accounts as authorized by the Accountant General, we sometimes find
ourselves in a situation where the Government if forced to borrow funds in order to meet a cash
flow needs of some MDAs when other MDAs have idle cash in their accounts.

26.     Apart from improving implementation of the budget, we believe that improving the
monitoring of budget execution is equally critical. Currently, a budget monitoring committee is
in place comprising the AGD, MBEPD, MoF with the Budget Director as Secretary to determine
how MDAs are performing based on allocations to date. However, the Government only


                                               68
produces summary periodic reports on funds released to MDAs with no information on how the
MDAs are doing in the execution of the approved budget. Similarly, with regard to the capital
budget, we have in place a Fiscal Governance and Project Monitoring Unit that resides in my
office. Among its other roles, the Unit‘s purpose is to ensure that all projects are executed at
reasonable costs in accordance with prescribed quality specifications. The unit has among other
activities been organizing regular town hall meetings for sector engagements with stakeholders.
Going forward, we plan to improve on these existing initiatives. In particular, in order to have
timely information on the performance of the budget as it is being executed, we plan to start
preparing and publishing (in Govt. Gazette and official website) timely in-year budget execution
reports within 30 days of each quarter. With regard to project monitoring, we will strengthen
citizen participation in the process by following a more structured and systematic approach. In
this context, we will prepare guidelines for the participation of citizens in project monitoring to
be introduced after approval by the EXCO.

27.      At the tail end of the budget cycle, our reform program seeks to improve internal auditing
functions as well as external oversight. We believe that improving internal audit functions is
critical to ensuring prudent use of public funds since it offers senior management an opportunity
to detect weaknesses in control systems and take preventive measures for protecting abuse and
misuse of public funds. In order to improve internal audit functions, we plan to introduce a risk-
based approach to internal auditing. This approach entails focusing internal audit on areas
associated with identified risks to an organization instead of auditing every document and
transaction. Currently, what we have is a pre-audit system which involves the examination of
payment vouchers and other documents before the associated payments are made. While this
approach has many advantages, such as reducing the incidence of fraud and irregularity, it is not
suitable in an environment of significant capacity constraints as ours.

28.     With regard to improving external oversight, the first main problem has been the timely
preparation and submission to the State House of Assembly for scrutiny, of audit reports by the
Auditor General. The consequence is that the audit function of the state is not able to provide
timely information on areas that are a source of risks to the management of public finances. In
turn, delays in the submission of audit reports have been due to delays in the preparation and
submission of Financial Statements by the Accountant General to the Auditor General. However,
since my Government came to office, we have made significant progress in clearing the backlog
of outstanding audit reports. As a prior action for the first DPO, we have cleared the backlog of
audited financial statements by submitting the audited financial statements for 2008 & 2009 to
the State House of Assembly. We believe that the introduction of IFMIS and the strengthening of
human capacity at the State Accountant General and Auditor General‘s offices will singificantly
improve timeliness in the preparation and submission of financial statements and audit reports.
The target is for the Accountant General to be able to submit financial statements to the State‘s
Auditor General within the statutory period of six months after year end and for the State‘s
Auditor General to submit the audit report to the State House of Assembly (SHA) within three
months of receiving the financial statements from the Accountant General.

29.     Apart from improving timeliness in the submission of audit reports, we also plan to
improve their quality and to ensure that there is follow-up on recommendations. In terms of
quality, our aim is to ensure that the audited reports comply with international standards. With

                                                69
regard to follow-up, our plan is to ensure that audit recommendations lead to corrective actions.
In particular, we plan to start producing quarterly reports on executive actions taken on audit
queries and recommendations.

   (iv)    Creating a conducive environment for businesses in Edo

30.     As mentioned earlier, another major focus of the reform program supported by the first
Development Policy Credit is the creation of a conductive environment for growth and
employment generation by improving the investment climate and the quality of education. It is
our belief that improved private sector investment in the state is critical to its efforts to promote
growth, create employment opportunities, and increase IGR. In this context, our reform efforts
are focusing on making it easier for investors to make Edo their preferred destination. When
businesses set up shop in Edo and flourish, our IGR increases, which will then be utilized to
improve delivery of services. At the same time, improved investment activities will open up
employment opportunities for our people.

31.     In order to improve the investment climate, our reform program focuses on improving
access to investment land, particularly by making it easier for people and businesses to register
property and obtain construction permits. First, with regard to improving the property
registration process, we have started work on modernizing our land record system through the
development of a new land information system (LIS) that is based on an Edo Geographic
Information System (EGIS). The GIS will ensure that all land parcels are defined on the basis of
geo-referenced digital information that can be easily retrieved and analyzed. As a prior action
for the first DPO, we have executed an agreement with a concessionaire for devising and running
the EGIS. Further, and as another prior action for the first DPO, we have introduced a system of
public access to land information by publishing on the Edo State web site progress reports on
EGIS that include the first set of land maps produced under EGIS. It is expected that the first
phase of the EGIS, which includes having in place an electronic data management system and a
comprehensive LIS will be completed in 2012. By 2013, access to EGIS will be increased to
other parts of the state outside Benin City by establishing regional offices of EGIS in Ekpoma
(Edo Central) and Auchi (Edo North).

32.     In parallel, we are also streamlining land registration procedures and strengthening
capacity in the land registry department. Preparations are underway for a comprehensive review
of land transaction processes aimed at streamlining land registration procedures. At the same
time, the introduction of a new LIS will require the strengthening of staff capacity. We are
therefore preparing a Staff Development Plan to recruit adequately skilled professional
personnel, whilst further improving the capacity of current staff in electronic data management.

33.     Apart from modernizing the land information system, we are also working on making it
easier for people and businesses to urban certificates of occupancy (CofO) which confirm
ownership of title to land. In this context, we will undertake a comprehensive workflow review
of the processes, including the role of the Governor‘s consent in the process, and time taken to
obtain a Certificate of Occupancy (CofO). We will also digitize existing records and then
introduce an electronic CofO processing system. We believe that the process review and


                                                 70
introduction of an electronic processing system will result in a significantly streamlined process
of obtaining the CofO.

   (v)     Improving Quality of Education

34.    It is the firm belief of my Government that improving the quality of education is good for
businesses, and even more critically, for reducing unemployment. Once our people are properly
and sufficiently educated, they should be able to meet the human capital needs of businesses. At
the same time, good quality education equips them for self employment as well as for wage
employment. The reform program that is supported by the DPO focuses on improving education
information, improving the quality of public technical and vocational educational institutions,
and improving the availability of certified teachers in critical subjects, particularly in rural areas.

35.     First, we recognize that data plays a significant role in helping the government to develop
strategies, establish targets, and monitoring progress towards the set targets. In particular, we are
establishing a system of collecting and updating comprehensive education information that is
regular and dependent on school records. This is in contrast to the past system where we needed
to collect education statistics through annual education censuses that were usually expensive and
sometimes missed out relevant data. In this context, and as a prior action for the first DPO, we
have piloted the Education Management Information System (EMIS) in 3 Local Government
Areas (LGAs). The system is being introduced at senior secondary education level which is
under the responsibility of the State Ministry of Education. Once the pilot has been evaluated,
the system will be rolled out to all the 18 LGAs. After the roll out, we will be preparing and
publishing annual Education Statistical Reports. We believe that the new information will greatly
improve policy and management decision making in the education sector.

36.      Second, reforms for improving the quality of education are focusing on the quality of
technical and vocational education. The goal is to improve standards in the institutions that offer
technical and vocation education so that as many courses as possible are accredited. Without
accreditation, students who complete the courses cannot receive certificates that are recognized
by potential employers as evidence of having successfully attained the requisite skills. A key
reform that we believe will improve the standards of technical and vocational education
institutions is the establishment of school-based management committees (SBMCs). SBMCSs
decentralize some of the school management responsibilities to the institutional level and
increase community participation. This ensures that resources are allocated to the priorities of the
school, introduce greater transparency and accountability in the management of school resources,
and improve discipline and commitment amongst teachers. In this regard, and as prior action for
the first DPO, we have established SBMCs with broad representation in all Technical and
Vocational Education Institutions in the state. The committees have broad representation
including parents, faith-based organizations, and the private sector. Going forward, each school
will develop an improvement plan whose implementation will be supervised by SBMCs. The
improvement plans will include measures through which each of the institutions can achieve full
course accreditation.

37.     Finally, we are working on improving the quality of education by improving the
distribution of teachers between rural and urban areas. As in many states within Nigeria and
other countries, there is usually a preference amongst teachers in Edo State to be posted in urban
                                                  71
areas where life‘s basic amenities are usually more readily available than in rural areas. This
creates in-equalities in teaching resources between rural and urban areas. These inequalities are
ultimately reflected in disparities in education outcomes between rural and urban areas.
Similarly, there is a shortage of teachers in subject areas such as English, Science, and
Mathematics, which are critical to establishing a knowledge and skills base required for making
a graduating student employable. Against this background, the Government is planning to
undertake an assessment of gaps in the number of teachers in rural areas and in critical subjects
such as English Language, Science and Mathematics at basic education level. Based on the
assessment, an action plan for implementation of special incentives to attract teachers in critical
subjects to rural areas will be developed. Part of the measures to be implemented based on the
action plan is a special incentives pilot in 3 priority Local Government Areas (LGAs) for
certified female science teachers to locate in rural areas. It is hoped that the focus on female
teachers will create a positive demonstration effect on the girl child.

B. Conclusion

38.    I am confident that the outlined policies, programs and reforms will create a conducive
environment for the effective and efficient utilization of any assistance the IDA may provide,
towards enabling the Government to implement its poverty reduction goals as set out in our
development strategy.

Baseline Scenario

3.1    Assumptions underlying fiscal projections in this FSA are in line with those recently used
by the IMF team for the World Economic Outlook. The main assumptions of the baseline
scenario are as follows as well as in Table:

        Average GDP growth of 6.3 percent per year over the 5 year period starting in 2012,
         reflecting buoyant growth of non-oil GDP of around 7 percent per year and modest
         growth of oil and gas GDP of 3.0 percent per year. In the absence of state-level GDP, it
         is assumed that Edo‘s economy grows at the same rate as the GDP growth rate at the
         national level.

        In line with WEO projections, the baseline analysis assumes an oil price of US$103.2 per
         barrel in 2011, and US$98.4 per barrel on average thereafter.

        Annual inflation is assumed to fall from 13.7 percent in 2010 to a medium-term average
         of 8.6 percent.

        The Edo State Government (ESG) will continue with tax compliance drive, while
         introducing a 5 percent consumption tax on the hospitality industry effective September
         2011 to boost IGR collection.15 IGR is assumed to grow conservatively at around 6.5
         percent on average in real terms for the next 5 years, compared with 35 percent for the
         past 3 years, which was achieved owing to the authorities‘ effort. It is assumed that the
         FAAC distribution formula remains unchanged during the projection period and that the
         FAAC would remain a stable source of revenue for Edo, as the volatility in oil revenue
         would be smoothed out by the newly established Sovereign Wealth Fund. In addition,
         the baseline scenario assumes that there would be no ad hoc withdrawal from the
         Stabilization Fund under the Sovereign Investment Authority Act (2011).

        Following the rapid expansion during 2008-11, public expenditure is assumed to decline
         gradually from 2012, despite increased O&M spending. This is because the large
         infrastructure projects pursued during 2009-11 would phase out and capital spending
         would decline to the pre-expansion level.16 Public financial management reform,
         supported under the DPO, is expected to enhance the effectiveness of public expenditure,
         offsetting the impact of reduced lower public investment.

        Fiscal deficits over the next three years would be financed by IDA budget support
         operations (DPO) of US$ 75 million each to be disbursed in 2012 and 2013. Edo will
         also receive two IDA credits (SEEFOR and Erosion project). Unmet financing gaps
         would be closed by domestic borrowing.
15
   ESG introduced a consumption tax on goods and services rendered in hotels, restaurants and events centers and
other facilities in Edo State, effective from September 1, 2011.
16
   At its peak in 2009, capital expenditure accounted for 52 percent of total expenditure. In the medium term, capital
expenditure is assumed to decline to the pre-expansion level of 35 percent of total expenditure.

          Note : The projections for 2011 and 2012-15 were as at September 2011

3.2     Under the baseline assumptions, Edo‘s fiscal policy would be tightened after a large
expansion in 2011, the last year of the 3-year fiscal expansion. In 2011, the fiscal deficit is
projected to reach 25.6 percent of gross federal transfers, compared with 8.2 percent in 2010, due
mainly to a revenue shortfall. Despite modest growth in the IGR, total revenue in 2011 would be
10 percent lower than its level in 2010 in real terms in the absence of ad-hock withdrawals from
the Excess Crude Account, on which Edo has become reliant over time. The large fiscal deficit
in 2011 would be entirely financed by the proceeds of the N25 billion-Edo State Bond issued in
January 2011.

3.3     Edo‘s fiscal position would improve gradually in the medium term, after the three years
of rapid fiscal expansion (2009-11). With the phase-out of the large infrastructure projects and
the strict control on the growth of government employment, the government would be able to
contain growth of total public expenditure at a constant level in real terms. Revenue would grow
gradually with continued effort to improve tax compliance, in particular the consumption tax
introduced in 2011. By 2015, the share of IGR would rise steadily to 25 percent from 20 percent
in 2010, covering around 94 percent of the government wage bill, compared with 72.5 percent in
2010. Edo‘s fiscal position would remain in deficit in 2012 and 2013, to be financed by the
disbursement of IDA budget support (US$75 million each year). By the completion of the DPO
series, Edo is likely to achieve a small fiscal surplus.

3.4      The baseline projections for the period 2011-15 depict the path of fiscal and debt
indicators and suggest that the state fiscal framework would be sustainable in the medium term,
provided that the authorities continue with revenue enhancement efforts and maintain strict fiscal
discipline. Edo‘s debt stock, including irregular debt (e.g., construction arrears, pension arrears,
etc.), is projected at 73.4 percent of total revenue in 2013 and decline gradually thereafter.17 The
debt service-to-revenue ratio, including the clearance of arrears, would decline rapidly from
2011, as the government completes the amortization on the commercial bank loans in 2012 and
switches to IDA credits for deficit financing.



17
   If irregular debt is excluded from the calculation, then the debt-to-revenue ratio would peak at around 70 percent
in 2013 and decline thereafter.

 1/ Large debt service payments in 2011 are associated with debt resturcturing that took place in 2011.


3.5     The results of this fiscal sustainability analysis need to be interpreted with some caution.
As noted in the main text, although this is not an isolated case in Nigeria, the accounting practice
of the Edo government does not follow international standards, such as the IMF Government
Financial Statistics (GFS) and does not have a systematic framework to record and monitor debt,
arrears and contingent liabilities.

Alternative Scenarios

3.6     To examine the robustness of the baseline scenario, what follows analyzes a few
alternative scenarios. These scenarios are designed to illustrate the impact of the following set of
core risks on Edo‘s future fiscal performance:

          A sustained decline in world oil prices, and resulting lower federal transfers;
          A failure to sustain IGR collection;
          A failure to maintain strict control over the growth of state expenditure;
          Absence of IDA budget support in 2012 and 13; and
          Any financing gap arising from the changes in assumptions is assumed to be filled by
           domestic commercial bank borrowing.18 These risk factors are introduced in 2012 to the
           baseline scenario ceteris paribus.



18
   For illustration purposes, it is assumed here that Edo has unlimited access to domestic borrowing to close its
financial gap.

                                                                 80
3.7     The alternative scenario analysis indicates that the largest risks to Edo‘s fiscal
sustainability would be the failure to control the growth of public expenditure and borrowing on
commercial terms to support high spending. Should the government continue to spend a large
amount of resources as it did during 2008-11, Edo‘s fiscal position would deteriorate rapidly and
significantly. Under this higher expenditure scenario, the fiscal deficit would continue to hover
around 17-19 percent of gross federal transfer (or 12-14 percent of total revenue). While the
bulk of public spending in 2012 and 2013 will be financed by highly concessional IDA
resources, thereafter the government has no option but resort to commercial borrowing in order
to maintain the high level of spending, unless there is a significant revenue increase. Edo‘s debt
stock would rise sharply to reach N100 billion (96 percent of total revenue) in 2015, compared
with N62 billion (60 percent) under the baseline scenario.

3.8     The failure to secure IDA budget support would have a more profound impact on Edo‘s
public finances. Even if the government maintained the same level of expenditure as in the
baseline scenario, substituting the IDA Credits with commercial borrowing in 2012 and 13
would raise the debt service cost significantly. By 2015, Edo‘s debt service payments would rise
more than twice to 20 percent of total revenue (or 77 percent of IGR), as opposed to 9 percent
(34 percent) with IDA budget support. The fiscal position would remain in the negative territory
during the projection period. Debt would accumulate less rapidly than under the higher
expenditure scenario, since government expenditure is kept at the baseline level. For the same
reason, the adverse impact on the fiscal position would be limited.

3.9     The scenario analysis suggests Edo‘s public finances are less vulnerable to the
performance of IGR collection. Under the low IGR scenario—which assumes that IGR would
grow at a 75 percent slower rate than the baseline case—Edo would be able to balance the fiscal
position in 2015, compared with 2014 under the baseline scenario. The limited impact of lower
IGR on the fiscal position, debt and debt services is because IGR still accounts for a small
proportion of Edo‘s total revenue.

  If a drop in oil prices (below the reference price) is temporary, then the oil revenue shortfall would be augmented
by withdrawals from the Excess Crude Account/Stabilization Fund. However, in case where lower oil prices are
considered semi-permanent, as assumed here, the reference prices would be lowered and federal transfers to states
would be trimmed.

would reduce Edo‘s total revenue by 4-6 percent
in real terms during the projection period. The
impact on the overall fiscal position, debt and
debt services would likely be limited.

Conclusion

3.11 The government of Edo has strengthened its revenue performance since the current
administration took office in 2008, but this has been accompanied by a rapid expansion of public
spending, in particular capital spending. The baseline projections depict a sustainable long-term
fiscal framework. However, the alternative scenarios indicate that Edo‘s public finances are
vulnerable to risks, in particular, the failure to control the growth of public expenditure,
especially on infrastructure, and heavy borrowing on commercial terms.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Nigeria
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 12/20
February 28, 2012


Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of
the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of
Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the
regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries
with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board
discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a
particular case.


On February 22, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2011 Article IV consultation with Nigeria.1


Background
Economic growth remains strong in Nigeria, with non-oil real gross domestic product (GDP)
estimated to have grown at 8.3 percent in 2011 and overall real GDP at about 6.7 percent.
Inflation slightly declined to 10.3 percent in December 2011 (year-on-year) from 11.7 percent a
year earlier, in response to monetary tightening by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and
moderation of food prices.


A modest fiscal consolidation took place in 2011. The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) of the
consolidated government is estimated to have narrowed slightly from about 34.6 percent of non-
oil GDP in 2010 to 32.9 percent in 2011, mainly due to expenditure restraint at the federal
government level. Higher oil prices helped shrink the overall fiscal deficit from 7.7 percent of
GDP in 2010 to about 0.2 percent of GDP in 2011. Monetary policy was tightened substantially in
2011 in response to high inflation and strong foreign exchange demand. The central bank has
gradually increased its overnight deposit rate by 900 basis points since September 2010 and
tightened regulatory requirements. In November, it adjusted downward its soft band around the
naira-US dollar exchange rate, and depreciation pressures on the naira have since abated.
Financial soundness indicators point to continued improvements in the health of the banking
system.


Growth is projected to remain robust in 2012 and inflation is projected to increase temporarily
as a result of the increase in gasoline prices. The main downside risks to the short-term outlook


                                                84
are a further deterioration in the global environment and an exacerbation of current violence in
northern Nigeria.


Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for countercyclical policies that have supported
economic activity in challenging circumstances. Directors considered that the medium-term
growth outlook remains favorable, although subject to external downside risks. Accordingly, they
emphasized the continued need for policies to safeguard macroeconomic stability, diversify the
economy, and make growth more inclusive.


Directors supported the authorities’ strategy to rebuild fiscal buffers through a better
prioritization of public expenditure, continued subsidy reform, and improved tax administration.
Efforts in these areas will also provide the necessary resources for targeted social programs and
needed infrastructure. Directors endorsed the use of conservative oil price assumptions in the
preparation of the budget but noted that only a comprehensive tax reform will reduce the
budget’s dependence on oil revenues over the medium term.


Directors highlighted the importance of improving public financial management, including a
stronger framework for managing Nigeria’s oil wealth. They welcomed the establishment of a
Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) and underscored that a rules-based approach to setting the
budget reference oil price would strengthen the budgetary process and the operations of the
SWF. In this regard, Directors recommended that outlays from the SWF’s infrastructure fund be
integrated into the budget and medium-term expenditure plans.


Directors noted the monetary authorities’ commitment to further reduce inflation but considered
that a pause in the tightening cycle is at present warranted. More broadly, they agreed that a
monetary framework better focused on a clear inflation objective should help anchor inflation
expectations and support disinflation. Greater exchange rate flexibility will also facilitate the
pursuit of price stability.


Directors commended the authorities for their actions to resolve the recent banking crisis. The
modalities of operation of the asset management corporation should continue to make sure that
fiscal risks and moral hazard are minimized. Directors supported the central bank’s focus on
strengthening supervision and the regulatory framework, including by addressing remaining
deficiencies in the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism regime. They
also agreed that a Financial Sector Assessment Program update will help take stock of the
progress so far and provide a road map for remaining reforms in the financial sector.


Directors concurred that wide-ranging reforms are needed to make growth more inclusive. They
welcomed the authorities’ initiatives to improve the business climate and reform sectors with
high employment potential, particularly agriculture. Directors encouraged the authorities to
persevere with planned reforms in the energy sector under appropriate social safeguards.
