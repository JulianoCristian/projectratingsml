Executive Directors approved a\n            single-tranche credit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for\n            the First Edo State Growth and Employment Support Program in\n            the amount of SDR 48.4 million (US$ 75 million equivalent)\n            on the payment terms and conditions set out in the\n            President's Memorandum. The Directors underscored the\n            program's critical role in engendering reforms critical\n            to growth, employment, and improved service delivery, not\n            only in Edo State, but in other Nigerian states as well,\n            through the expected positive demonstration effects. They\n            noted the risk mitigation measures and underscored the\n            importance of complementary technical assistance to deal\n            with weak implementation capacity. They emphasized that such\n            support, together with the Bank's supervision missions,\n            will be critical to ensure the program achieves its\n            development objectives."}, "docdt": "2012-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
