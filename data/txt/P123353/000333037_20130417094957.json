improving\n            the management of public resources and creating a better\n            environment for growth and employment creation in a\n            socially-accountable way. The extension is necessary to\n            provide the Edo State Government with adequate time to\n            utilize the credit as the approval of Nigeria's\n            2012-2015 external borrowing plan by the National Assembly\n            was delayed and only came through as part of the 2013-2015\n            External Borrowing Plan in December, 2012. This has resulted\n            in a delay of the signing of the credit agreements and\n            declaration of credit effectiveness. The Edo State\n            Government is fully committed to the objectives of the\n            Development Policy Operation (DPO). This will be the first\n            extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2013-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
