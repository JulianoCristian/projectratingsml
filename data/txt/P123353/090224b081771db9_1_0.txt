                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The DPO was approved by Bank's Board in March 2012. However, the signing of the Financing Agreement between the Bank and the borrower (Federal Republic of Nigeria,

                         represented by the Federal Ministry of Finance) and the Subsidiary Agreement between the Federal Ministry of Finance and Edo State Government have been held up by the fact
                         that the country's external borrowing plan for 2012 has not yet been approved by the national parliament. Whilst US$50 million of the total US$75 million was approved by the
                         parliament in the 2011 borrowing plan, the balance of US$ 25 million remains un-approved in the 2012 plan.

                         All of the operation's prior actions were met before Board approval and following state governorship elections in July 2012 in which the incumbent reformist governor was re-elected
                         for a second term, the state is deepening its public financial management and investment climate reforms as well as social sector reforms. During the last visit to the state from
                         October 17 -18, 2012, the team reviewed with the state, progress on the deepening of the prior actions and the mission was pleased to note the good level of progress. More follow-
                         up and technical assistance is required to help the state deepen these reforms even further in preparation for the planned second tranche operation.
