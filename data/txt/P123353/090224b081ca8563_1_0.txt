                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the Bank Board in March 2012. Both the Financing Agreement between the Bank and the borrower (the Federal Republic of Nigeria, represented by the

                         Federal Ministry of Finance) and the Program Agreement between the Bank and the Edo State Government, represented by the Commissioner of Finance and the Attorney-General
                         of the state have been finally signed, effectively on the 16th of April, 2013. The Subsidiary Agreement between the Federal Ministry of Finance and Edo State Government was
                         signed on the 5th of June, 2013. The Bank is currently awaiting the transmittal of the legal opinion by the Federal Ministry of Finance and the conclusion of other administrative
                         procedures in order for the DPO to become effective.

                         Edo state has made progress in deepening some of the reforms introduced as prior actions for the DPO and in the process, has already achieved some of the targets set for the DPO
                         II and III triggers in a few areas. Progress has been made in areas such as the implementation of procurement reforms and the timely submission of audit reports to the State House
                         Assembly but some of the other indicators have regressed. A number of the fiscal sustainability indicators in particular, such as the real growth in Internally Generated Revenues
                         (IGR) and the deviation of expenditure outturns from the approved budget have fallen short of target. Although some of these reversals are due to the delays in the disbursement of
                         DPO-I and the effects of recently introduced Government policies, the State clearly requires additional technical assistance to strengthen reform efforts and reverse the trend in some
                         of the policy areas being addressed by the DPO. The State will also be able to strengthen these areas once the DPO becomes effective and the funds are disbursed as well as when
                         the Technical Assistance Loan - SEEFOR - which will support PFM reforms becomes effective. The Financing Agreement for the SEEFOR has also only recently been signed.
