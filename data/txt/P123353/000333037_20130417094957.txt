     NIGERIA–FIRST EDO STATE GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT CREDIT

                                    CREDIT IDA-50760


                 Restructuring Paper (Extension of Closing Date Only)



1.      The closing date for Nigeria, First Edo State Growth and Employment Support
Credit, IDA-50760 will be extended from June 30, 2013 until June 30, 2014.

2.       Following the approval of the credit by the Board, the team has closely
monitored Edo State's progress in its implementation of the reform measures introduced
by the government in fulfillment of the prior actions for the operation. Our assessment is
that the State Government has maintained the momentum of its reform program and
made significant progress in scaling up a number of these reforms. Two key areas of note
include the increase in the real growth rate of internally generated government revenues
beyond the targets set in the DPO policy matrix and demonstrated commitment to a
Medium Term Expenditure Framework in budget planning. A number of the reforms
identified as triggers for the second and third phase of the programmatic DPO are also
currently under implementation by the State Government. These reforms are integral to
the State's development strategy and it is our assessment that the DPO instrument
continues to be an effective tool in Edo State for creating incentives for the State to
commit to the improvement of its policies and institutions. It also provides a key entry
point for deepening our engagement with Edo State. Given this demonstrated
commitment by the Edo State Government, it is our belief that project objectives remain
achievable.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to provide the Edo State Government with
adequate time to utilize the credit as the approval of Nigeria’s 2012-2015 External
Borrowing Plan by the National Assembly was delayed and only came through as part of
the 2013-2015 External Borrowing Plan in December, 2012. This has resulted in a delay
of the signing of the credit agreements and declaration of credit effectiveness. The Edo
State Government is fully committed to the objectives of the Development Policy
Operation.

4.      This will be the first extension of the project.
