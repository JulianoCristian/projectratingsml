                         Implementation Status Overview

                         quest to strengthen overall economic governance. In this regard, the state has continued to make progress in implementing key modules of the budget management system, aimed at
                         enhancing transparency, comprehensiveness, and accountability in the management of public finances in the State. The State is a clear leader among Nigerian states in ensuring
                         that expenditure management systems, including the implementation of a commitment control system, are progressively robust; and all budget expenditures are transacted through
                         an Oracle-based financial management system, with the required in-built controls. Edo state also continues to improve on the timeliness of preparation of the State government's
                         annual accounts as well as the external auditing of these accounts. The 2013 audited financial statements of the state have been widely published as of May 2014. Furthermore, the
                         state has now established its public procurement regulatory agency as well as its Governing Council in March 2014 in order to strengthen the governance of public procurement in the
                         state. The erstwhile Fiscal Governance and Procurement Monitoring Office is in the process of handing over its operations to the new statutory Public Procurement Regulatory
                         Agency.

                         Edo state also continues to show commitment to investment climate and quality of education reforms as essential to growth and job creation. In particular, streamlined procedures for
                         registering landed property have been adopted which has reduced the time it takes to obtain land Certificates of Occupancy. The operational framework for managing technical and
                         vocational training institutions in the state is being enhanced through the establishment School-Based Management Committees. In terms of improving the quality of education in Edo

                         state, especially in TVET, School Based Management Committees have been established for the TVET institutions to improve governance at the institutional levels and school
                         improvement plans for each of the TVET institutions have now been developed. The Ministry of Education has begun to utilize part of its budgetary allocations to implement the
                         school improvement plans for TVET institutions and this will be supplemented by funding from the Bank's SEEFOR project. It is also working closely with the National Board for
                         Technical Education (NBTE) towards restoring accreditation status to the TVET programs of these institutions. During the last mission, the Bank advised the state to begin to think of

                         modalities for collaborations between the TVET institutions and relevant professional associations as well as private sector industry players to improve the job market relevance of
                         their programs.

                         The last mission in April 2013 offered the Bank team a good opportunity to continue the dialogue with the state government authorities at the highest levels to strengthen and build on
                         each of these reform areas and the state government finds it useful that the Bank's SEEFOR and SEPIP engagements provide complementary technical and financial support for
                         many of the DPO reform areas.
