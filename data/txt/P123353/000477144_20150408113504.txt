H. Restructuring
The project was restructured in February 2013 to extend the closing date from June 30, 2013 to
June 30, 2014. The extension was necessary to provide the Edo State Government with adequate
time for the operation given the delay in national parliamentary approval of Nigeria’s 2011/2012
External Borrowing Plan which in turn led to delays in the signing of the credit agreements and
declaration of credit effectiveness. The PDO and key outcome indicators remained unchanged.




4
 The effectiveness date was the 28th of June, 2013. Disbursement of the funds at the Central
Bank of Nigeria took place in August and into Edo state’s account in September 2013. This was
after the second ISR was filed.

               IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT

                                        MAIN DOCUMENT


1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.      The First Edo State Growth and Employment Support Credit was the second subnational
Development Policy Operation (DPO) for Nigeria, after the Bank’s approval of Lagos DPO in March
2011. The design of the First Edo State DPO (FESDPO) was built on lessons learned from the Lagos DPO
as well as DPOs for other federal states, in countries such as Brazil and India, where sub-national DPOs
were successfully used to support policy and institutional changes. The successful implementation of the
Lagos DPO was expected to have a demonstration effect on other State Governments in Nigeria, in terms
of showcasing the benefits of being reform-oriented. As outlined in the Nigeria Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for 2010-13 (Report No. 46816-NG), the DPO could be used in states with a good track
record in public sector reforms, strong fiduciary systems and low debt levels, and possibly twinned with
Technical Assistance (TA) operations to address governance and institutional capacity challenges. The
achievements of the Edo state administration during its first term (2008-12), using the CPS criteria,
provided a strong basis for selecting Edo state for a subnational DPO, after that of Lagos. FESDPO was
therefore developed in the context of the Edo State Vision 2020, which sought to improve the lives of its
people through good governance, human capacity development, infrastructure development and increased
private sector investment in productive sectors.

2.      The World Bank support to Edo State’s Government’s reform program was premised on the
State Government’s achievements since 2008; improvement in the PFM system, increased IGRs and
improved service delivery through infrastructure development and quality of education. FESDPO was
envisaged to be part of a series of three programmatic operations in equal amounts of US$75 million, over
the period 2012-2015. The implementation of the programmatic series was however cut short by a year’s
delay in the ratification of the First Edo State DPO (FESDPO), after the Bank’s board approval in March
2012. This was due to the delayed approval of the country’s borrowing plan by the National Assembly.
The Edo State Government (ESG) however continued with the reform program as envisaged under the
DPO.

3.       This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) assesses the contribution of the
first Edo State DPO (FESDPO) in achieving the program development objectives. Secondly, it takes
stock of government’s progress in implementing the reform agenda as defined in the DPO programmatic
series. The ICRR assessment is based on the performance of the FESDPO as at end June 2014, when the
program closed. However for results indicators that could only be measured at the end of each year,
December 2013 was the cut-off date. In general, the ICR report recognized the challenge of assessing the
impact of a one year operation on the program development objectives compared to what a three-year
operation was expected to achieve; the full complement of the program reforms had not been undertaken
at the time of the assessment because the programmatic series was cut short.

                                                   1
1.1 Context at Appraisal
4.      Soon after coming into office in November 2008, the new administration of Edo State
announced its plans of focusing on the rehabilitation and upgrading of the state’s infrastructure;
which had virtually crumbled following years of neglect, poor planning, and compromises in quality.
The Governor also embarked on a fiscal consolidation program with the view to expanding the fiscal space
for capital projects. Through improved efficiency and transparency in tax collection, as well as expansion
in the tax base, internally generated revenues (IGR) increased by 300 percent over the period 2008-2010.
This resulted in noticeable infrastructure development, focusing on construction and maintenance of roads,
drainage systems, schools, and health centers. According to the World Bank Report: “Innovations in
Infrastructure Development: A Study of Capital Spending in Edo State”, Edo State Government produced
an unprecedented number of roads of adequate quality and other social infrastructure during 2009-2013.

5.       Despite these achievements in infrastructure and service delivery, there were still challenges,
including the need to ensure sustainability of the gains made. The infrastructure development plan still
had huge financing gaps. Many schools at various levels of education needed rehabilitation. Similarly,
although work had begun on the master plan of the Benin City storm water drainage system, the financing
requirements of its full implementation were immense. Government systems also remained largely weak,
thus threatening the long-term sustainability of progress achieved. Against this background, the State
Government viewed the support of the World Bank in the form of a Development Policy Operation as a
critical vehicle needed to support the state’s development agenda; both in terms of additional financial
resources as well as the support to build a stronger institutional and regulatory framework that would create
the conditions for growth and improved service delivery.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
6.      The program development objective of FESDPO was to support Edo State‘s critical reforms
for improving the management of public resources and creating a better environment for growth
and employment creation in a socially accountable way. Two policy areas considered of primary
importance were: (i) improving the quality of management of public resources through effective budget
planning, better budget execution, financial reporting, external auditing and ensuring value for money; and
(ii) improving the environment for economic growth and employment creation by enhancing the investment
climate so as to attract more private investment while improving quality of education, particularly in the
technical and vocational field. It was expected that increased private sector investment would lead to more
job creation for which the well trained youth with employable skills, could take advantage of. Recognizing
the fiscal challenges posed by financing infrastructure projects and improving service delivery, the state
government’s development agenda had to be embedded in a medium-term fiscal sustainability framework.
Development Policy Credit was therefore considered as an appropriate instrument for supporting the
development agenda of transforming the Edo State economy while ensuring fiscal sustainability.

7.    The Edo State Government recognized that sustainable development would ultimately
depend on economic growth and the extent to which the state’s citizens could avail themselves of


                                                     2
employment opportunities. Growth of the state economy would not only lead to increased availability of
goods and services for individual consumers but would also improve the state’s revenues that were needed
to expand the provision of public services in order to keep up with a growing population. Employment
creation was also necessary for growth to have a significant impact on poverty reduction. This was even
more critical for Edo, because the state had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country,
particularly amongst the youth. 5 .

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

8.        There was neither a revision to the PDO nor to the key outcome indicators of the program.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

9.      The FESDPO focused on two main policy areas as mentioned earlier, with two sub-objectives
(pillars) under each policy area, namely: (1.1) Ensuring fiscal sustainability, (1.2) Improving public
budget institutions and practices, (2.1) Improving the investment climate and (2.2) Improving the quality
of education.

Pillar 1.1: Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
10.     The program supported the State Government in maintaining fiscal sustainability by
ensuring that spending plans were within the ability of the state to raise revenue and to keep debt
within acceptable limits. The program aimed at stepping up efforts to increase Internally Generated
Revenue (IGR) while ensuring improvements in efficiency of spending. In this context, reforms were
focused on promoting growth in IGRs through improvements in tax administration and the promotion of
non-oil sector growth. The program also aimed at dealing with all potential expenditure pressure points;
particularly the payroll - keeping the ratio of public sector payroll to total expenditure within acceptable
limits and thereby creating fiscal space for infrastructure spending.

11.      The State Government, among other things, sought to construct and rehabilitate roads with
the view to connecting many rural communities to urban centers for enhanced economic activities.
It also aims at improving the urban drainage system so as to prevent flooding (which was a major challenge;
particularly in the capital city of Benin) and the associated destruction to property and livelihoods. In
education, the Government sought to construct and rehabilitate schools with particular focus on improving
technical and vocational education. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, the State Government
needed not just to raise more funding but also needed to ensure that the State’s development agenda was
embedded in a medium- term fiscal sustainability framework.

Pillar 1.2: Improving Budget Institutions and Practices
12.     The program supported a medium-term reform agenda in strengthening the legal and
institutional framework for enhancing transparency and accountability in the use of public resources.
To improve on budget planning and execution, the program focused on procurement reforms,
improvements in public financial management system, as well as reforms in internal and external audit.
Policy actions under this pillar were; (i) the enactment of modern procurement legislation; (ii) usage of
selected IFMIS functions for transaction processing in the implementation of the budget; (iii) improving
transparency in procurement through the publication of contracts awarded; and (iv) strengthening external
oversight by clearing the backlog of audited financial statements that were required to be submitted to the
State House of Assembly.

Pillar 2.1: Improving the investment climate
13.     The program supported medium-term actions that would improve the business environment,
promote private investment and stimulate economic growth within the State. The specific focus of
reforms under this pillar was to improve access to investment land; through improvements in the land
information system, strengthening the capacity of the Land Registry Department and streamlining the
process of obtaining the Certificate of Occupancy (CofO). Policy actions under this pillar were; (i)
execution of an agreement with a concessionaire for devising and running the Edo State Geographical
Information System (EGIS), (ii) establishment of an online Land Information System (LIS), (iii)
recruitment of an adequately skilled professional personnel, whilst further improving the capacity of
current staff in electronic data management and (iv) reduction in the number of processes and time taken
in obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy (CofO).

Pillar 2.2: Improving Quality of Education
14.     The program supported medium term actions for improving the quality of education in order
to make school graduates employable. This meant that pupils were to be equipped with relevant
knowledge and skills obtained from institutions that were recognized by potential employers. The specific
focus of reforms under this policy area were in three targeted areas; (i) the development of Education
Management Information System (EMIS) to monitor quality performance targets, (ii) improvement in the
quality of public technical and vocational educational institutions and (iii) improvement in the availability
of certified teachers, in critical subjects, particularly female teachers in rural areas (as a key to boosting
female pupil completion rates).

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
15.    The policy areas were not revised
1.6 Other significant changes
16.     The first Edo State DPO of SDR 48.4 (US$75 million), was planned to be the first operation
in a series of three annual programmatic development policy operations. The delayed approval of the
government’s borrowing plan by the National Assembly led to a lapse of more than 24 months between

                                                      4
the board dates for the first and second operations. As such, the operation could no longer be considered
programmatic lending operation and hence the need for an ICR Report. The next operation, which builds
on the accomplishments and lessons learned from First Edo State DPO, is currently under preparation as
the first in a new series of two programmatic operations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1    Program Performance
17.     All prior actions under the First Edo State DPO were completed prior to Board approval in
March 2012 and were substantially sustained beyond the closing date of the operation. The
government also made satisfactory progress under all the four pillars of the reform program, including
policy actions supposed to be prior actions for the second DPO. The size of the payroll was kept within
target levels, while effectively utilizing the fiscal space to support infrastructure development, within a
fiscally sustainable framework. In terms of improving budget institutions and practices, government
focused on increasing value for money through sound procurement rules and automating the financial
management systems including budget management through the use of an oracle-based software platform-
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS).

18.     The investment climate has also improved due to the reduction in the procedures and time
taken to process land certificates of occupancy. While efforts at creating a GIS-based land information
system was delayed because of challenges with the contractual arrangements with the concessionaire,
government did not change its policy focus. The government has now contracted another service provider
to devise and run the GIS system to be piloted, in the urban areas first, on limited basis (Benin City only)
and thereafter roll out the system to more local governments across the state. Lastly efforts at improving
the quality of education comprised the setting up of the school-based management committees (SBMC),
investment in the facilities at the school level, particularly technical and vocational schools and the piloting
of an education information management system (EMIS).

19.    Despite the uncertainty caused by delayed approval of government borrowing in 2012, the
implementation of the reform agenda was maintained. The government remained committed to
deepening the reforms envisaged under the program. The Bank continued its engagement to support the
government; providing advisory services and technical assistance under the State Employment and
Expenditure Effectiveness for Results (SEEFOR) project.

20.    As seen in the policy matrix (See Table 1) below, all the prior actions were met and hence
there was no waiver for the disbursement of funds. Preparation was to the extent possible, aligned with
the government’s budget preparation cycle. Government’s showed commitment to the implementation
reform programs beyond the prior actions, despite the delay in the preparation of the second DPO. Policy
reforms that the Government undertook ahead of the second operation included the payroll audit which
was supposed to be benchmark for the third operation, the Public Procurement Regulatory Agency and
Council were set up and the oracle-based SIFMIS budget preparation module has been configured for use.
Others include the operationalization of school-based Management Committees for the Technical and
Vocational Schools.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation
21.    The State Government remained committed to the implementation of the reform
program despite a year’s delay in the disbursement of the first tranche of the Bank’s
programmatic support. The national external borrowing plan for 2012, which included the DPO,
was not approved by the National Assembly 6 that year. The FESDPO became effective on 28th
June 2013 and was disbursed in August 2013. During this period however the State Government
undertook policy reforms that were considered critical for the achievement of the triggers under
the Second Edo State DPO (SESDPO). The delayed disbursement however created a financing
gap for the State Government and hence caused some challenges for the State’s fiscal operations
in 2012.

22.    Second, changes in policy at the federal government level posed some challenges to
the maintenance of fiscal sustainability in Edo State. The amendments of the Personal Income
Tax Act (PITA) aimed to reduce the economic burden on low to middle income taxpayers by
lowering tax rates and requiring tax authorities to obtain a court order before confiscating a
taxpayer’s assets negatively impacted on the tax revenue from personal income taxes to the State
Government7. It also hampered tax recovery efforts. To maintain fiscal sustainability the State
Government had to find innovative ways of growing the IGR and to suspend some infrastructure
spending.

23.     Third, infrastructure bottlenecks, including ICT capacity and network connectivity
constraints have slowed down the pace of implementation of the ICT-related reforms. There
were some delays in the publishing budget execution information online due to capacity constraints.
As prior actions for the DPO-1, State Government published in government gazette and online,
quarterly budget execution reports disaggregated by MDAs and line items and also initiated a
system of regularly publishing procurement awards above N10m. However there were delays in
ensuring that these types of information were put online on a regular basis. The pace of the roll out
of the IFMIS to other MDAs has also been affected by network connectivity constraints.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
24.    The State Government has consistently utilized the M&E data pertaining to fiscal
sustainability to inform its resource allocation, expenditure policy decisions and debt
management. Most of the policy actions could be tracked easily because of the use of clearly spelt
out indicators. To ensure alignment with country-owned priorities, the process by which the
program implementation was tracked was based on reviews of data provided by the Government’s
Economic and Strategy Team. This was true for policy actions which aimed at maintaining fiscal


6
  Whilst US$ 50m of the US$75m was approved in the external borrowing plan of 2011, balance of US$25m
remained unapproved by October 2012 (Aide memoire, October 2012).
7
  The amended PITA was signed by the President in 2011 but it took effect from 2012.


                                                     8
sustainability and the management of budget and PFM reforms. The former relied on the fiscal
sustainability framework while later relied on selected indicators within the PEFA framework.

25.     The State Government relied on the M&E data pertaining to fiscal sustainability to
inform its resource allocation; however that of monitoring investment climate and quality of
education were relatively weak. The government regularly monitored the fiscal deficit, IGR
collections and adjusted expenditures (wage, overhead, and capital) accordingly. The debt
sustainability indicators have been employed to inform the government’s debt service burden, a
profile that is suitable for maintaining long-term debt sustainability. However M&E framework
monitoring progress in implementing reforms in the registration of investment land and that of
quality education were not readily available to policy makers. This is now being corrected as the
coordination M&E framework is being established at the office of the Government’s Economic
and Strategy Team.

2.4    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)
26.     The new programmatic series beginning with the Edo State Fiscal Improvement and
Service Delivery Development Policy Operation (ESFISDO) is expected to be approved by
the Board in April 2015. The program development objectives of the new series and pillars are
close to those of the FESDPO. The first pillar focuses on further improving fiscal sustainability
through improvements in IGR and reducing expenditure leakages especially through the payroll;
while the second pillar focuses on further improving budget institutions and practices. Reform
policies under Pillar 3 focus on changing the regime of land transaction costs to make them more
competitive while pillar 4 focuses on policy actions for improving the quality of education;
including the involvement of the established School-based Management Committees at the basic
education level in the monitoring of teacher and pupil attendance at schools and establishing
partnership arrangements between the technical and vocational education institutions and the
private sector to improve the relevance of TVET education.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
27.     Assessment of program outcomes after the implementation of FESDO was not
anticipated because it was intended to be the first of three in a programmatic operation.
While the ICR was planned at the end of the series, the delay of the second operation procedurally
called for an ICR. There were no monitoring indicator targets set for the end of the first operation.
The assessment of the outcomes has thus been based on the results indicator targets for the end of
the second operation. This therefore renders the assessment ambitious to the extent that results in
some of the DPO areas could not be realistically expected after the first operation. The assessment
takes stock of progress in implementing reforms over the period 2012 to June 2014 when the
FESDPO ended. For results indicators that could only be measured at the end of the year,
December 2013 was the cut-off date.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

28.     The objectives of the program were highly relevant because they were strongly
aligned with the development objectives of Edo State Strategic Plan. The success of State
Government in improving upon infrastructure development and service delivery was possible
because of improved efficiency of government spending and increased fiscal space for capital
spending, which were financed mainly by increased IGRs and borrowing. The first pillar of the
DPO program supported analysis and policies to ensure that Edo State’s medium-and longer-term
fiscal and debt position remained sustainable. The second pillar supported improvements in
comprehensiveness, transparency and accountability in budgeting and use of government
resources with the aim of enhancing the quality of public expenditure. The third and fourth pillars
supported improvement in investment climate and quality of education, thus leading to increased
private investment, economic growth and enhanced employability of the people.

29.     Overall, the design of the program is highly satisfactory in terms its support of the
government’s reform agenda. The design of the program (reform pillars and actions,
implementation capacity and financing instrument) was also highly relevant in terms of its support
to the government’s reform agenda and contribution to the achievement of the CPS objectives. The
reforms to improve budget planning and preparation, budget execution and the investment climate
and quality of education were critical to Edo State’s development objective; that of accelerating
infrastructure development, as well as promoting private investment and job creation.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
30.     This section evaluates the achievements of the program development objectives
(PDO) based on contributions from the reform pillars. The PDO covered two main policy
areas: (i) improve the management of public resources in implementing an infrastructure-oriented
development strategy and (ii) improve the institutional and policy environment for growth and job
creation in a socially accountable manner. The success of Edo state’s government in improving
infrastructure development and services delivery to its people involved large increases in capital
expenditures, financed largely by increased internal revenue generation and borrowing. In this
regard the first pillar of the DPO program, supported analysis and policies to ensure Edo State’s
debt position remained sustainable in the medium to long term. The second pillar supported
improvements in transparency, accountability and efficiency of government expenditures, with the
aim of enhancing the quality of public expenditure and consequently that of public services. Under
third pillar, improvements in the investment climate would contribute to increased private
investment and economic growth, and thereby lead to greater IGR in future and job creation. The
fourth pillar supported improvements in the quality of education especially in the area of basic
education, technical and vocational training. This pillar would therefore contribute to the
acquisition of employable skills and consequently lead to more employment and better living
standards in Edo State.

framework for the management of public resources. First, the state’s payroll system was sanitized by
putting in place an Oracle-based human resource system that captured biometric data of all civil servants
that was then used in monthly payroll calculation. Secondly, a new procurement law was enacted and a
more transparent system of procurement was introduced. Thirdly, a new Oracle-based system of processing
financial transactions was introduced. Improving the financial management system in Edo State contributed
to effective budget management, control of the size of payroll, and the creation of fiscal space for
infrastructure spending. The capital share of annual budgets increased from 42 % in 2007 to 58% in 2012 8.

32.     Similarly, some critical policy actions were also undertaken to create a better
environment for growth and employment creation. First, measures were taken to improve
access to investment land by publishing improved land information on the website. Improved
access to land was critical to improving private sector investment, and hence, growth and job
creation. Secondly, two reform initiatives were introduced to improve the quality of education –
one focused on improving education management information and the other on improving the
governance of technical and vocational education institutions through the establishment of school
based management committees. Improved quality of education was to have a dual positive impact
- improve the supply of skilled labor force for the private sector, which would in turn lead to
growth and job creation, but also improve people’s employability.

33.     The first objective of the PDO, on improving management of public resources was
overall achieved as seen by the following evidence: the target on percentage of public contracts
above the threshold using competitive practices was exceeded as it reached 100 percent although
the target was only 35 percent against a baseline in 2008 of 20 percent. Similarly, the target on
timeliness in the submission of audit reports to the National Assembly was exceeded as it improved
from a lag of 15 months after the end of the fiscal year, to 9 months, against a target of 10 months.
In addition, the target on the share of audit queries that were resolved was also exceeded as it
increased to 85 percent, from a baseline of 0 percent and against a target of 25 percent. However,
target on reducing the deviation of aggregate expenditure out-turns compared to the original
approved budget was not achieved as it was 23.7 percent compared to the target of 10 percent band
and against a baseline of 16.9 percent. This was mainly due to shortfalls in projected revenues.

34.     The second objective of the PDO, on creating a better environment for growth and
employment creation was also achieved based on the following evidence: First, the target on
the number of days it takes to register property was reduced from 69 in the baseline to 30 days
fully achieved according to the program target. Secondly, in the area of improving the quality of

education, the target on number of accredited courses in TVET institutions was fully achieved as
it was 24, against a program target of 24 and a baseline of 21. However, the target on the percentage
of certified female science teachers located in rural areas was not achieved as it was 11% against
a target of 15% and a baseline of 13%. This was because the critical action to improve the situation
had not yet been implemented at the time of the assessment – actual rollout of an incentive scheme
for attracting female teachers in critical subjects to rural areas had not yet been implemented.

35.     Overall, the achievement of the PDO is rated as moderately satisfactory. About 80
percent of the program development objectives were assessed to have been either exceeded, fully
achieved, or substantially achieved. The assessment of achievement of program development
objectives was based on the ten key results indicators, which took into account Government efforts
at reforms and the achievement of outcome indicators. Overall s eight result indicators reached
or surpassed their targets; namely the growth rate of IGRs, the maintenance of the ratio of payroll
expenditure to total expenditure, timely submission of audited financial accounts to the State
House Assembly, the percentage of audit queries resolved, publication of public contracts above
N10m, the number of accredited TVET courses, reduction in number of days to register
investment land and the reduction of dropout rate for female pupils in rural areas. . Two indicators
were not achieved: namely percentage of expenditure outturn compared with original budget
estimate and the ratio of female teachers in rural areas.

36.    Overall progress in the achievement of the majority of the key program objectives
were assessed to have contributed to development outcomes; namely increased inflows of
private investment to the State, increased employment opportunities, increased IGR and
improvement in infrastructure development.

Pillar 1- Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability

37.     The Edo State budget was firmly anchored in a fiscal sustainability framework in
order to ensure that the State’s fiscal operations were sustainable in the medium to long term.
This pillar aimed at promoting IGR growth and ensuring efficient management of the payroll;
thereby creating fiscal space in order to support infrastructure development and service delivery-
particularly in health, education, transport and environment. This objective was considered fully
achieved- (Table 2).

                                                                      registered a growth rate of
                                           Target: 6.5%               18.9% in 2013.

                                                                      2013 well within the target of
                                                                      no more than 60%.

38.     Government efforts to broaden the income tax net and other non-tax revenue sources
contributed substantially to IGR growth. The real IGR growth rate increased from -18.6% in
2012 to 18.9 % in 2013. The enactment of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) by the Federal
Government in 2012 affected the state government’s performance. The situation improved in 2013
through aggressive tax drive as well as other tax administration and policy reforms. The state
government also made efforts to raise IGRs by broadening the sources of IGRs in 2013. The Board
of Inland Revenue (BIR) embarked on a medium-term reform program that increased revenues by
promoting voluntary compliance with tax laws and developing effective mechanisms for collection
of taxes and levies. The IGR growth in 2013 was largely attributable to the increased share of
revenues from “fines and fees”.

39.     The objective of maintaining the share of payroll in recurrent expenditure was fully
achieved. In 2013, payroll performance, which was 49.3% of total expenditures, was an
improvement over that of the baseline record of 50.8%. Edo State introduced the biometric
registration of public sector employees, thus making it possible to monitor employee recruitment,
management of salaries and to control the phenomenon of ghost workers.

Pillar 2- Improving Public Budget Institutions and Practices,

40.    Policy objectives under pillar 2, which sought to improve upon the transparency and
accountability in the use public resources- were substantially achieved. The sub components
under this pillar were: (i) establishing a strong PFM institutional platform; (ii) improving practices
in budget planning and preparation; (iii) improving practices in budget execution and monitoring;
and (iv) improving practices in accounting, audit, and external oversight. Table3 below
summarizes the program performance under each of the results indicators for pillar 2.

                                                                shortfalls in projected revenues.

 (vi) Percentage of audit queries that    Baseline: 0%          Fully achieved. 85 % of queries
 have been resolved.                                            raised by the 2012 Audit report were
                                          Target:25%            resolved in 2013. This represents a
                                                                significant improvement over the
                                                                previous years where state had a
                                                                backlog of outstanding audits.

41.     As a first step towards achieving the outcomes under pillar 2, the State Government
enacted the new Public Procurement law, which provides the legal framework for
coordinating all procurement activities at the MDAs and for ensuring value for money in
state spending. In a bid to improve upon the transparency in the use of public resources, all
contracts above N10m awarded since 2009, were compiled in an electronic database and closely
monitored. The database showed the relevant MDAs, names of contractors, contract sum and date
of contract award. All contracts above N10 million were duly advertised and contractors selected
based on competitive criteria set by the state government. The State team is therefore expected to
expand the database to cover all MDAs and to include information on the type of procurement
method used in awarding the contracts.


                                                 14
42.     In order to ensure credibility of the budget, Government was expected to ensure that
total expenditure compared to the budget stayed within 10% deviation band – this objective
was not achieved. Actual expenditure fell short of budgeted expenditure by 23.7%, thus exceeding
the target of 10% deviation band. This was due to non-realization of projected revenues,
particularly federation account transfers. It is worthy of note that large expenditure deviations are
prevalent among all states in Nigeria, including the federal government due to revenue shortfalls
(World Bank PEMFAR Assessments 2010-2013). To improve budget credibility however, the
Government team could have been more conservative in its revenue forecasts based on its
historical knowledge of revenue flow patterns. It is however also worthy of note that is the practice
of rationalizing expenditure based on lower-than-projected revenues is good public expenditure
management practice as government is to align expenditure closely with mobilized revenue. The
alternative would have been to maintain projected expenditure despite a shortfall in revenue and
ramp up borrowing at a much faster rate.

43.     Ensuring improved accountability through timely submission of the annual audit
report to the State House Assembly was fully achieved. However the resolution of audit queries
by Auditor General was fully achieved. About 85 percent of queries raised in the 2012 audit report
were resolved in 2013. This represents a significant improvement over the previous years, when
the state had a backlog of more than 200 unresolved cases unresolved. The improvement in
resolving audit queries could be attributed to the state government resolve to ensure accountability
and efficiency in the use of public resources.

Pillar-3 Improving the Investment Climate

44.     The objective of the improving the investment climate pillar was to attract private
investment and thereby increase employment opportunities and to increase IGR. The
program focused on reducing the number of days to register investment land and obtain a C of O.
This objective was fully achieved (Table 4). Edo State Government sees improved private sector
investment in the state as critical to its efforts to promote growth, create employment opportunities,
and increase IGR. The objective of pillar 3 was to ensure transparency in land acquisition by
developing an electronic database of lands under the EGIS project and to reduce the time for
registering land. The number of days it took to register a land was expected to have dropped from
69 to 30days. This was based on reforms that had been undertaken to reduce the number of steps
and duration of each step in registering investment land.

45.     The indicator however excluded the average number of days it took the Governor’s
office to sign the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O). Thus while this indicator was fully met
based on the administrative processes at the state Ministry of Lands and Survey, a more ideal
measure would include the last step of obtaining the Governor’s signature. The introduction of
service standards which regulates the number of days it takes for each stage in the registration
process is a good way to sustain the progress.

Pillar-4 Improving Quality of Education

46.     The program objectives under this pillar (Table 5) were to (i) increase the number
accredited courses in the technical and vocational institutions, (ii) improve the share of female
science teachers in rural areas, and (iii) reduce the drop-out rate of female pupils in rural areas.
The first PDO indicator under this pillar was to increase the number of accredited courses in the
technical and vocational training institutions-this indicator was substantially achieved.

47.     The number of technical and vocational courses with accreditation was expected to have
increased from 21 (baseline) to the target of 24 after the second operation. To increase the number
of accredited courses, government invested in the training of teachers, ensured adequacy of staffing
and rehabilitated facilities in a number of institutions in order to satisfy the criteria for accreditation
of the different courses. Second, School Based Management Committees have been established
for the TVET institutions to improve governance at the institutional levels and school improvement
plans for each of the TVET institutions were been developed.

48.      The ratio of the certified female science teachers among teachers in the rural areas
declined from a baseline level of 13% to 11% in the 2012/13 academic year and relative to
the adopted target of 15%; indicating under-achievement on this indicator at face-value.
However, as was previously indicated, the target result for this indicator could not have been
achieved after just the first operation. It was under the second and third operations that hiring of
more female teachers was to take place. Under the first operation, an action plan for this was
developed. The assessment of this indicator was therefore deemed inconclusive. The state
Government had recently gone ahead to put in place incentive schemes to attract female science
teachers to the rural areas and a hiring process has recently been concluded. The incentives put in
place include the provision of accommodation and salary top-ups of 20-40 % of basic salary. On
the other hand, the female dropout rate of pupils at the primary level in the rural areas was 4.9%,
thus staying within the maximum target of 8%. This indicator was assessed to have fully achieved
its target.

                                                                  structures and revamping of
                                                                  infrastructure in a number of the
                                                                  TVET institutions in early 2014,

  Source: Edo State Government and World Bank Staff’s estimates

49.      Overall, significant progress has been made in improving the quality of education at
both basic and TVET levels based on the expected outcomes from improving the quality of
education under the operation. At the end of the program period, it was expected that reforms
for improving the quality of education supported by the DPO will result in (i) better governance at
institutional level that will lead to an increase in the number of accredited courses in technical and
vocational education institutions in Edo; (ii) increased share of certified female science teachers
in total number of female teachers located in rural areas; and (iii) reduction in drop-out rates of
female pupils at basic education level in rural areas. These were substantially achieved after the
first operation. More generally, Edo state has improved significantly in terms education sector
performance. The total pass rate of students obtaining five credits including English and
mathematics in WAEC over the past three years shows that Edo remains in the top five



                                                  17
performance compared to all other states; It has improved from a score of 48.14 in 2011 to 56.25
in 2013.

The Cross-Cutting Social Accountability Theme

50.     A cross-cutting theme across the policy areas supported by the FESDPO was that of
social accountability. Among actions to promote social accountability under the operation were
plans to strengthen participatory budgeting, particularly in the selection of capital projects;
improving public awareness of public procurement decisions, especially during and after the
selection of contractors; publishing the budgets, in-year budget execution reports and the audited
financial statements of the state government. During FESDPO implementation period, the state
government made good on its plans to ensure citizen participation in capital project selection. This
was achieved through the regular town hall meetings the governor and his team usually throughout
all the local government areas in the state. At these meetings, community leaders are able to
communicate to the government, the capital project needs of their communities. In public
procurement, journalists and other civil society representatives still get invited to witness the
opening of bids and the government introduced a system of regularly publishing awards of
contracts above N10 million.

51.       The government is yet to start publishing in-year budget implementation reports as
it still considers these as “management reports”. However, the annual budget and end-of-year
financial statements were regularly published on the state’s website, but more recently also on its
open data portal. It is worthy of note that the state government, in in its bid to build a strong
platform for social accountability, unveiled the open data portal in 2013 which is to some extent,
interactive and allows the state to better open up its activities to public scrutiny. This initiative has
become a reference point for other states in Nigeria; including the federal government.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
52.    Overall, the outcome of the FESDPO is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. This is based
on highly satisfactory relevance of the objectives, and design, satisfactory implementation of
program reforms and the moderately satisfactory rating for the PDO achievement.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
53.     The implementation of the reform agenda of the State Government, supported by the
DPO, has brought visible improvements to the lives of its citizens. Nigeria does not provide
state–level data on GDP or consumption aggregates. However anecdotal evidence suggests that
with increased infrastructural spending Edo State, the level of economic activities in Edo State
have increased coupled with increased employment opportunities around infrastructure-related
jobs. There are also indications of increased investor confidence in the state as demonstrated by

                                                   18
increased demand for investment property. In 2014, Dangote Nigeria Plc. Requested for, and was
awarded 50,000 hectares of land to establish a rice plantation where rice will be grown and fully
processed. Also, existing companies in the state are expanding their operations. For example,
Okomu Oil Palm Plc. And Presco Nigeria Plc. Have requested for additional land for increasing
their oil palm production capacities. Also, Nigerian Breweries Plc. is significantly expanding its
operations in the state. In October 2014, Azura Power Holdings Ltd. conducted the ground-
breaking for a new 450 megawatts Independent Power Project (IPP) on the outskirts of Benin-city.
The first phase of the plant, targeted to come on stream in 2017, is forecast to create at least 1,000
jobs during construction and operation. In 2012/13 the net primary school enrollment rate and
population using an improved water source have improved to 76.6 percent and 72.8 percent
respectively from 70.6 and 59.3 percent in 2008.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
54.    The program contributed to institutional changes and capacity development. The FESDPO
program complemented by technical assistance from SEEFOR institutionalized the use of an IT
platform to process financial transactions. The program has also laid a solid foundation for building
the procurement and audit systems and institutions. This has contributed directly to greater
transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the application of public resources. The incremental
approach to the reform under the programmatic design is helping to build the long-term capacity
of government officials in budget preparation and execution, reinforced by the annual budget
processes.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
55.     The use of consultants to manage the IT- based components of the reforms had the
advantage of kick- starting the implementation of the reforms. However the weak IT capacity
and limited ICT infrastructure slowed down the pace of rolling out the IFMIS to all MDAs. Thus,
in some cases, dual systems (manual and IT-based) for processing financial transactions have
existed. Thirdly, over time there would be the challenge of how to internalize the role of the IT
consultants in the civil service structure.

   N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate
56.    The risk to the development outcome – macro-fiscal, political and implementation
risks – is moderate. Changes in the macro and fiscal environments in Nigeria are outside the
control of the Edo State Government and pose a significant risk to program outcomes. The
continuous decline in international oil prices, for instance, could lower federal allocations to Edo


                                                 19
state and create further shortfalls in revenue projections and therefore impact negatively on
medium-term fiscal sustainability position of the State.

57.     Political risk associated with the upcoming State House and Governorship elections
in 2015 and 2016 respectively are considered moderate. The participatory nature of reforms
undertaken so far has strengthened the commitment of all relevant stakeholders in Edo State. The
outcome of pending elections is therefore not likely to change the continued implementation of the
State’s development agenda. Under this environment, the risk is assessed as moderate as the new
government will likely continue the reform program.

58.     Finally, a key implementation risk is the lack of IT capacity within the civil service.
Most reforms which require IT skills have been contracted out to experts in the private sector.
However, in order to operationalize the IT platforms that have been supported by the program, the
civil service will need to build capacity in IT skills. A number of program outcomes, such as the
successful and efficient working of all financial modules and GIS, depend to a large extent on
motivated, well-paid and trained civil servants with requisite IT skills.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rate: Satisfactory

59.    The design of the program was informed by comprehensive analytical work, and
implementation was supported by technical assistance where possible. The preparation of the
FESDPO benefited from extensive studies conducted by the Bank and other donors during 2007-
2010 including the PEFA Assessment of the PFM system over the period 2006-2008. These helped
inform the reform program under fiscal sustainability, budget planning and preparation and budget
execution pillars. The Investment Climate pillar, which was guided by the ongoing Investment
Climate Program and sub-national Governance Investment Climate, focused more on
administrative procedures.

60.    There were moderate shortcomings related to ensuring quality at entry. The risk to
IGR performance due to changes in income tax policy by the federal government was not
anticipated. Secondly, the design of the results framework had some weaknesses; particularly the
baseline information for some key development outcome indicators such as the proportion of
contracts (above N10m) awarded on competitive basis, the percentage of female teachers in rural
areas and the percentage drop out rate of female pupils were not easily verifiable during the
assessment.

(b) Quality of Supervision
   Rating: Satisfactory


                                               20
61.     The Bank team included the required expertise, namely: PFM Specialists,
Procurement Specialists, M&E Specialist, Social Development Specialist, Education
Specialist and PSD Specialist. The team maintained the policy dialogue with the government
even in the absence of the second operation. The engagement focused mainly on progress in
implementing the prior actions for the FESDPO and triggers for the SESDPO. The Implementation
Support and Results (ISR) reports did not however present the values for all M&E indicators;
particularly those indicators tracking progress in the improvement of quality of education.

62.     The progress in the implementation of the program reforms benefitted from the
frequent supervision missions by both the DPO team and SEEFOR team. The DPO team
supervision missions, which interfaced with that of the SEEFOR team resulted in the Bank team
visiting the borrower almost on quarterly basis. This helped to maintain the policy dialogue at the
DPO level, while technical assistance provided at the level of SEEFOR contributed to the effective
rollout of the automation of the public financial management system, as well as enhancing public
access and engagement through information and communication technology and Edo Open Data
Portal.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
   Rating:    Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

63.    Edo State Government, the implementing agency for the operation, demonstrated
firm commitment and readiness to implement the agreed prior actions for FESDPO and the
broad reform agenda. The overall reform program, was coordinated by the Ministry of Finance
(MoF) and the Fiscal Governance and Project Monitoring Office (FGPM). Besides, there was
broad-based commitment shared by all stakeholders in the various MDAs from the highest level:
from the Governor of Edo state to the second, third, and forth levels of government (Commissioner,
Permanent Secretary, and Director). All prior actions were implemented by key stakeholders in
MDAs without delays before the Board discussion. The Government also sustained reforms
beyond prior actions in order to achieve the twin of objectives of both the program objectives and
development agenda under the Edo SSP.

64.     However the use of M&E data for the government’s decision-making and resource
allocation was uneven. While the government regularly used M&E data under the first two pillars
to inform the maintenance of fiscal sustainability and budget institutions and practices, the use of
M&E data to strengthen the investment climate reform and improvement in quality of education
was weak. In particular, while the number of steps taken to obtain a CofO had been streamlined,
there was no clear mechanism for tracking the number of days taken to obtain a CofO, from the

                                                21
date of application to the date of obtaining the Governor’s. With respect to the pillar on quality of
education there was no central database for capturing the key development objectives under this
pillar, even though the data could be pulled out manually from administrative records.

6. Lessons Learned
65.     A key lesson is that the commitment of the State Government to reforms is critical to
the success of the state-level subnational DPOs. Given that there are several implementation risk
factors that are beyond the State. Despite the delay in disbursement of the FESDPO, the Edo State
Government continued to drive the reform program by finding innovative ways of growing IGRs,
strengthening budget preparation, budget execution and improving the investment climate. The
State Government’s desire to improve upon the livelihood of its people through improved service
delivery and infrastructure development was aligned with the achievements of the program’s
development objectives, which reinforced the State’s commitment to implementation benchmarks
and triggers. For example, the State Government recognized the positive relationship between
improving investment climate and attracting private investment to Edo State. Increased private
sector investment would in turn contribute to the growth of IGRs, hence more capacity to spend
on infrastructure development and service delivery.

66.     The use of DPOs at the state level to promote good governance and economic growth
is increasingly motivating other State Governments in Nigeria to sustain their reform-
oriented programs. Policy reforms under FESDPO have had a positive impact on Edo State,
similar to the success recorded under the DPO for Lagos State9. The key ingredient for success is
the government is commitment of the state government to institutional reforms and a dedicated
team of professionals to implement reforms.

67.     The existence of complimentary projects with funding for technical assistance
supported the implementation of prior actions and enhanced sustainability program reforms.
The SEEFOR project, contributed to the implementation of FESDPO prior actions and helped
achieve the expected outcomes under three out of the four pillars; budget institutions and practices
and improvement in investment climate and quality of education. Reforms under these pillars had
components that required ICT platforms and required the hiring skills that were outside the public
services. These activities were funded under the SEEFOR project. The policy reforms envisaged
under the FESDPO therefore moved forward even in the absence of a programmatic engagement
as evidenced by progress in implementing the prior actions and part of the subsequent DPO- 2
triggers.

68.     The use of private sector ICT experts helped with the speedy implementation of public
sector modernization components of the DPO such as the IFMIS and EMIS. However the
risks associated with internet connectivity and in-house ICT capacities have to be addressed in

                                                         22
order sustain such reforms. The FESDPO implementation was supported by the SEEFOR project
(Component on Governance and Capacity Building) to provide support in a number of areas,
including the implementation of the Oracle-based Integrated Financial Management Information
System and the creation of an electronic database on public contract awards. The maintenance and
roll out the ICT platforms to other MDAs have however progressed at a slower pace because of
less-than-reliable internet connectivity and inadequate ICT capacity within the public sector.

69.    Mainstreaming the M&E system during program implementation is critical for
ensuring effective monitoring of progress being made on key development objective
indicators. The existence of a results framework per se does not guarantee the availability of
M&E information needed by policy makers on real-time basis during the project implementation.
For example in the case of monitoring progress in achieving quality education, the indicators being
monitored were not captured in the EMIS. The result was that information on progress being made
under this pillar could only be obtained after a lag because of the need for a long search before the
information can be put together for policy makers.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
70.    The government counterparts at the MoF and FGPM expressed their appreciation
regarding the role FESDPO has played in government’s reform program. The funding
support under FESDPO provided a relatively cheaper development financing option compared to
other sources such as government bonds. Additionally, the technical assistance associated with
FESDPO reinforced government’s commitment to implementing PFM reforms, especially with
the budget preparations, budget execution, procurement and audit. Implementing agencies also
provided factual information to the drafting of the ICR report. Summary of the state government’s
comments on the draft ICR is included in annex 4 of the report.
