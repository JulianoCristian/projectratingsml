Edo State Growth and\n            Employment Support Credit for Nigeria received a moderately\n            satisfactory outcome rating with moderate risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            satisfactory ratings for their part in the project. The\n            project was restructured to extend the closing date by one\n            year. The extension was necessary to provide the Edo State\n            Government with adequate time for the operation given the\n            delay in national parliamentary approval of Nigeria\u0092s\n            2011/2012 External Borrowing Plan which in turn led to\n            delays in the signing of the credit agreements and\n            declaration of credit effectiveness. The project development\n            objective (PDO) and key outcome indicators remained\n            unchanged. There were several lessons learned from the\n            project and include the following: (1) a key lesson is that\n            the commitment of the State Government to reforms is\n            critical to the success of the state-level subnational\n            development policy operations (DPOs), (2) the use of DPOs at\n            the state level to promote good governance and economic\n            growth is increasingly motivating other state governments in\n            Nigeria to sustain their reform-oriented programs, (3) the\n            existence of complimentary projects with funding for\n            technical assistance supported the implementation of prior\n            actions and enhanced sustainability program reforms, (4) the\n            use of private sector information communication and\n            technology (ICT) experts helped with the speedy\n            implementation of public sector modernization components of\n            the DPO such as the integrated financial management\n            information system (IFMIS) and education management\n            information system (EMIS), and (5) mainstreaming the\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system during program\n            implementation is critical for ensuring effective monitoring\n            of progress being made on key development objective indicators."}, "docdt": "2015-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
