                         After the long delay in obtaining parliamentary approval for the Government's 2012/2013 borrowing plan, the US$ 75 million DPO tranche finally became effective on June 28, 2013,

                         following the completion of all administrative processes. The tranche proceeds were disbursed to Edo state in August 2013.

                         The long lag between approval and effectiveness notwithstanding, Edo State has shown commitment to implement salient reforms in public financial management, building on prior
                         years’ achievements, as an essential requirement to strengthening its overall economic governance and sustain its leadership within the group of States that have demonstrated the
                         culture of systematic pursuit of the needed reform actions as highlighted in its PEMFAR (2010). Edo State has made laudable progress in instituting a budget management system
                         that has the landmarks of transparency, comprehensiveness, and accountability. The State has achieved strong leadership among states in ensuring that: expenditure management
                         systems are progressively robust; all budget spending are transacted through a financial management system implemented under an Oracle based state-of-the-art computerized
                         system; the State government’s annual accounts are prepared on timely basis (within 3 months of the end of the fiscal year); and the external auditing of the State’s accounts are
                         completed and the audited accounts presented to the State House of Assembly within 9 months of the end of the fiscal year. The state is set to continue to deepen its PFM reforms
                         through the SEEFOR technical assistance loan which provides complementary support for PFM, mainly through technical consultancies. The Bank's mission to Edo state in October
                         2013 noted with satisfaction that significant progress had been achieved in the procurement processes of a number of these consultancies and that there was evidence of readiness
                         to commence or deepen key reforms with technical support of consultants across a number of frontiers

                         In terms of improving the state's business climate, Edo state has maintained its resolve to modernize and simplify its land registration procedures through creation of an Edo
                         Geographic Information System (EGIS) and publication of land maps. Following the execution of an agreement with a concessionaire - Agama Geoservices Consortium - for the
                         setup and running of the Edo State Geographic Information System (EGIS) and the introduction of transparency in the land information system by publishing the maps of four

                         communities (Okhoro, Useh, Ogbe and Uzebu) from the pilot project on the Edo State website and the open data portal, there was a contract failure with the concessionaire and a
                         new Ministry of Housing and Urban Development was created from the former Ministry of Lands, Survey and Housing with the responsibility for policy and regulatory framework for
                         Urban Development, Urban renewal, Physical Planning and Development Control, amongst other functions.The failure of the PPP contract has contributed to delays in completing a
                         first phase of EGIS (a DPO-2 trigger), but the new Ministry has now put in place a mechanism to use Land Information System (LIS) to renew and upgrade all urban centres in Edo
                         State via creation of Operative Development plans and maps. At the moment however, the Ministry of Lands & Survey is implementing streamlined procedures for the processing of
                         C of Os and it now takes about 26-30 days to process C of Os at the Ministry (excluding final approval which is still done by the Governor alone, and which lengthens the process
                         beyond 26 -30 days).

                         In terms of improving the quality of TVET institutions in Edo state, which is also a DPO sub policy area, School Based Management Committees have been established for the TVET
                         institutions to improve governance at the institutional levels and school improvement plans have now been developed. The Ministry of Education’s 2014 budget proposal contained
                         allocations towards the implementation of the school improvement plans for TVET institutions. Furthermore, a pilot scheme to incentivise female science teachers to locate in rural
                         areas has been designed and developed and budget proposal for this made in Ministry’s budget for 2014. The aim of this is to create a demonstration effect for girls in the rural areas
                         to study science and technology-based courses.
