STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT1
1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
1.01      Over the past five years, Korea's industrial sector has been
growing at nearly 20% p.a. almost twice as fast as the 11% rate of growth of
the aggregate GNP. The industrial sector, which accounted for 12% of GNP in
1961, reached 36% in 1976. Manufacturing alone contributed 43% of the
increment in GNP over the past decade. MIanufactured products represented
90% of commodity exports in 1976, compared with 82% in 1965 and 60% in 1960.
Industry has provided about one third of all jobs created since 1963 and as
much as 47% over the period 1971-75; with approximately 2.7 million employed,
the industrial sector accounted for 20% of the total population employed in
1975 against 11% in 1966. Notwithstanding its impressive contribution to
GNP, exports and employment, the industrial sect-or absorbed only 25.8% of
total investment outlays over the period 1972-76, reflecting the efficient
use of the economy's scarce capital resources by the industrial sector. In
spite of the recent efforts aimed at developing relatively capital-intensive
industries such as steel, petrochemicals and shipbuilding, there has been
no perceptible increase over the past ten years in the incremental capital-
output ratio for the manufacturing sector which remained at 1.3.
1.02      Recent Performance.  The Korean economy recovered remarkably well
in 1976, after the recessionary period of 1974-75.  The performance of
the manufacturing sector was particularly impressive with a 26% real growth
of value added in 1976,/l  second only to the exceptional growth rate of 31%
recorded in 1973. Exports increased by more than 40% in volume in 1976,
reaching US$7.8 billion, led by a strong demand for Korea's traditional
export products such as textile yarns, fabrics and clothing which maintained
a share of about 35% of total commodity exports. Korea's efforts at reducing
the concentration of its exports towards the US and Japan have met with
considerable success in recent years; in 1976 the combined share of the US
and Japan dropped to 56% from a level of 70% inI 1974, essentially as a
result of the development of new markets in Europe and the Middle East.
Commodity exports to the Middle East, earlier negligible, amounted to more
than US$300 million in 1975. In 1976, Korea won construction contracts,
mostly in the Middle East, worth about US$2.5 billion (including the cost of
materials and equipment supplied from Korea).
Structure of Industry

Within light manufacturing industries, food processing has declined from 29%
of total manufacturing value added in 1971 to 20% in 1975, while textiles,
footwear and leather increased from 23% to 32%, due to the sustained demand
for these traditional export items. Light manufactures have only marginally
declined from 67% of total manufacturing value added in 1971 to 64% in 1975.
Conversely heavy manufactures have risen from about 31% to 34% over the same
period.



Chemicals, petroleum and coal still make up the singli '  ;est subsector
within heavy manufactures but the expansion of lthese industries has been
slower than the overall growth of manufacturing value added and their con-
tribution to total manufacturing value added has consequrntly declined from
18% to 14%. Basic metals and metal products have roughly maintained their
share. A substantial increase has taken place in the share of transport from
4% to 6% and more strikingly in the share of machinery which has risen from
5% of manufacturing value added to close to 10%. Machinery manufacturing has
had the highest growth rate within the manufacturing sector with an average
of 37% p.a. A more radical shift in the structure of the manufacturing
sector will be encouraged by the Government in coming years towards more
skill-intensive subsectors such a.  -achinery and electronics where Korea
enjoys a competitive advantage over other developing countries because of the
relative abundance of its skilled labor. This deepening of the Korean
industrial structure represents a major objective of the Fourth Five-Year
Plan (1977-1981) and is expected to result in a relative reduction in the
share of light industries in manufactured exports and output.
Geographic Distribution
1.04      In 1975, approximately 27% of the population of Korea lived in the
cities of Seoul and Pusan; the Province of North Gyeongsang where Taegu, the
third major industrial city is located, accounted for another 14% of the
population. The following table shows that the regional distribution of
industry and industrial employment is also skewed in favor of Seoul and
Pusan.

There has been little change in the geographic dispersal of industrial
employment in Korea between 1971 and 1975; Seoul and Pusan remain by far the
largest industrial centers. The Government, however, has become increasingly
aware of the need to achieve, through a wider geographic dispersal of



industries, a better distribution of employment opportunities and a reduction
of the congestion and overcrowding in Seoul and Pusan. The Government has
been promoting the development of industrial centers outside these two areas
principally through the establishment of free trade zones and industrial
estates. Major examples of this policy are the iron and steel plants in
Pohang, the petrochemical complex in Ulsan, the integrated chemical industry
in Yeosu, and the machinery center at Changwon. The Saemaeul Movement,
initiated in 1971, also aims at creating industrial employment opportunities
in rural areas and at reducing the disparities of income between urban and
rural areas.
Financial Structure of Enterprises
1.05      The interest rate structure and slowdown in economic activity
during the period 1970-72 had resulted in a deterioration of the financial
position and structure of Korean enterprises. Companies had become highly
dependent on the high cost, short-term "curb market" for their financing. To
improve their situation, a Presidential Decree of August 1972 froze all loans
from the unorganized money market and new measures were adopted which length-
ened maturities of certain loans, reduced interest rates to 16.8% p.a. and
converted loans from shareholders into equity. These measures as well as the
remarkable performance of the Korean economy in 1973 resulted in a consider-
able improvement of the financial position and performance of Korean enter-
prises. The aggregate debt/equity ratio /1 of manufacturing enterprises fell
from 3.9:1 in 1971 to 3.1:1 in 1972 and 2.7:1 in 1973. The average interest
rate on borrowings of manufacturing enterprises concurrently declined from
13.4% to 8.6%. Profitability improved markedly with net profits increasing
from an average of 1% of total assets in 1971 to 7.9% in 1973. With the
quadrupling of oil prices at end-1973 and sharp increases in the costs of raw
materials, enterprises were again subject to considerable financial strains.
Capacity utilization declined and costs of production increased substantially.
In an effort to sustain economic activity and employment, the Government
helped finance the buildup of manufacturing inventories. Enterprises had to
resort to increased borrowings and the aggregate debt/equity ratio increased
to 3.2 in 1974 and 3.4 in 1975. Profitability decreased with net income
declining as a percentage of total assets from 7.9% in 1973 to 5.7% and 3.9%
respectively in 1974 and 1975. Although statistics are not yet available,
there is some evidence that with the upturn in economic activity from mid-1975
the financial structure and performance of Korean enterprises have improved.
Industrial Policies
1.06      Over the past ten years, industrial incentives in Korea have
been highly responsive to particular and changing circumstances, and varied
with Government policies and priorities for industrial development. These
policies aimed, with variable emphasis, at the promotion of export industries
/1 Source: Financial Statements Analysis for 1975. Bank of Korea.



and of foreign investment, geographic dispersal of- industry, assistance
to small and medium industries and, more recently, investment in heavy
industries.
1.07       A comprehensive incentive system was established during the first
half of the 1960s which generally favored exports over import substitution.
The main elements of the incentive package included unrestricted access to
and tariff exemptions on, imports of raw materials and capital goods, generous
waste allowances in determining duty-free raw material imports, direct and
indirect tax reductions, access to subsidized credit for working capital and
fixed investment, and rate subsidies on certain inputs. Key import substi-
tuting industries received protection from imports through tariffs and
quantitative import controls. Estimates of effective subsidy rates show,
however, that export activity was generally favored over import substitution.
The international competitiveness of Korean industry had substantially
improved between 1970 and 1973 due to several devaluations of the won, and the
Government consequently decided to reduce export incentives. Reductions in
corporate income tax were abolished and preferential interest rates increased.
In 1975, tariff exemptions on imported inputs were abolished in favor of a
system by which the tariff on imported inputs is paid at the time of importation
and rebated at the time of export. Tariff exemptions on imports of machinery
and equipment by export industries were abolished in 1974,/1 payment of
custom duties can, however, be stretched over a t'hree-year period.
1.08      XThile key import substituting industries have been granted many of
the preferences given to exporters, production for domestic sale has generally
been subject to higher duties, taxes and interest charges but has benefited
from tariffs and restrictions on imports. Over the last few years there has
been a modest decline in tariff rates,/2 and increased reliance on import
restrictions,/3 as a means of affording protection to domestic producers
/1  Only in the case of capital goods imported under foreign capital financing
is there still complete and automatic exemption from tariffs.
/2  The average tariff rate which has remained roughly stable between 22%
and 24% in 1969 to 1972 has rapidly declinedl to about 12.8% in 1975.
/3  The number of prohibited items has declined from 77 in 1968 to 66 in
1975, but items subject to import restrictions have increased from 398
to 579 in 1976.



-6-
particularly in the case of capital goods. As a counterpart for the protec-
tion afforded to domestic producers through import controls, the Government
has established price controls for major commodities./l
1.09      Incentives for the development of domestically manufactured
machinery include target ratios of domestically supplied capital goods in the
total fixed capital cost for a number of industries and the establishment of
specialized medium and long-term government funds to provide won financing
for procurement of domestically manufactured machinery. The largest of these
funds is the National Investment Fund (NIF) which over the Fourth Five-Year
Plan period is expected to finance nearly 18% of investment in the machinery
sector and roughly 13% of the total fixed capital formation in manufacturing.
Prospects
1.10      Export orientation has been the dominant feature influencing the
structure and rate of expansion of the manufacturing sector. Export growth
has been accompanied by a policy of selective import-substitution which has
helped the aggregate dependence upon imported intermediate inputs and capital
goods remain at roughly the same level over the last decade. Although import
substitution has played a significant role in some sectors and over specific
time periods, its contribution to the growth of manufacturing output has been
very limited. It is estimated that over the period 1960-68 domestic demand
contributed some 60% to the growth of manufacturing, while export expansion
and import substitution contributed respectively 38% and 2%. The emphasis
given to exports of light manufactures has resulted in a rather high degree
of dependence upon imports as a source of raw materials and intermediate
inputs, as is reflected in the fact that the domestic value added content of
Korea's exports is only about 50%. While it is clear that Korea's poor
natural resource endowment limits the scope for backward linkages, there is a
real need for Korea to undertake a deepening of its industrial structure.
Awareness of the desirability of deepening Korea's industrial structure was
present in the formulation of both the Second and Third Five-Year Plans and
lies behind the decisions to build the first integrated steel mill and
petrochemical complex. The long-term plan covering the decade up to 1981
which was published by the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in 1973 emphasized
the accelerated development of the heavy and chemical industries as a critical
element of Korea's future industrialization. The 1973-74 economic setbacks
had rendered a reexamination of this long-term development plan necessary and
while, in the Fourth Five-Year Plan, emphasis remains on developing heavy
industry and on increasing the domestic content of exported manufactures,
some heavy capital and energy-intensive projects have been deferred or
cancelled altogether.
/1 In March 1976, Government enacted the Price Stabilization and Fair Trade
Law.



1.11      Over the five-year period of the Plan (1977-81), the GNP is
expected to grow at a rate of 9.2% p.a. fueled by a 16.5% annual growth
in the volume of manufactured exports. The manufacturing sector which now
accounts for 32% of GNP is expected to increase at 14.2% p.a., a higher rate
of growth than that of GNP, which would bring the contribution of the mining
and manufacturing sector to 41% of GNP by 1981. It is expected that some 38%
of the two million new jobs to be created during the Fourth Five-Year Plan
period will be in the mining and manufacturing sector. As in previous years,
Korea's economic development would essentially be export-led, the ratio of
commodity exports to GNP which reached 27% in 1975 would rise to 42% by 1981.
However, compared to their real growth rate of 32% p.a. over the period of
1967-75, exports are projected to increase at a more modest 16.8% p.a. The
Plan is based on the assumption that Korea's exports of textiles, clothing
and other light manufactures have a limited growth potential and are subject
to encroachment by other developing countries. Korea's comparative advantage
will, therefore, increasingly lie in industries which require more skilled
labor and greater industrial sophistication such as machinery, electronics
and shipbuilding. The real growth of exports of these products would be
around 30% p.a. over the 1976-81 period. The share of manufactures is
expected to rise from about 85% of total merchandise exports in 1975 to 92%
by 1981. In order to sustain the projected GNP growth rate of 9.2% p.a.,
gross fixed investment would need to rise at 7.8% p.a. In relation to GNP,
the projected investment is slightly lower than in the Third Plan period
(26.2% of GNP as against 26.9% during the 1972-76 period). The share of
manufacturing investment in total gross fixed investment is projected to
increase by only 2% from its average share of 24.6% during the Third Five-
Year Plan to 26.7% during the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The shift in Korea's
export strategy towards more skill-intensive exports is reflected in both the
planned structure of industrial output and in projected investment allocations.
The share of heavy and chemical industries is expected to rise from 43% of
total manufacturing value added in 1975 to nearly 52% by 1981. Investment in
light industries is expected to decrease from 40% of total investment outlays
in the manufacturing sector over the Third Plan period to 36% over the next
five years; conversely, investment in the heavy and chemical industries would
increase from 60% to 64%. The share of highly capital-intensive industries
such as basic metals, shipbuilding and chemicals would be reduced in relative
terms from approximately 75% of investment outlays in heavy and chemical
industries over the Third Plan period to 61% over the Fourth Five-Year period
in favor of investment in machinery and electronics which would increase from
25% to 39%.

2. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY SECTOR
Definition
2.01      The official definition of small and medium industries (SMI)
in Korea is expressed in terms of employment or assets size and incorporated
in the Small Industry Basic Act and the Presidential Decree enforcing the
Medium Industry Bank Act which constitutes MIB's charter. This definition
was amended on January 18, 1977 to reflect the changes which have taken place
in the average size and structure of Korean SMI since 1961, date of the
original definition. The following matrix summarizes the new criteria
applicable to the various subsectors.
Total assets        No. of
(W million)       employees
Mining, manufacturing, transportation           Up to 500          Up to 300
Construction                                    Up to 500          Up to 50
Commerce and services                           Up to 50           Up to 20
Within the S2II sector, there is no official distinction between small and
medium enterprises. The official SMI definition governs principally the
qualification for membership in the specialized SMI cooperatives (see
para 2.14) and the eligibility for domestic currency financial assistance by
the Medium Industry Bank. The alternative definition of SMI in terms of
either employment or asset size actually leaves open the possibility for some
capital-intensive projects to qualify for financing by MIB as long as they
meet the employment size limit. This may have happened in the past when the
asset limit was fixed at the somewhat unrealistic level of W 50 million
(about US$100,0000). It is expected, however, that with the higher asset
limit adopted in 1977 most projects financed by MIB will qualify under both
criteria. Based on these new criteria, more than 95% of the loans committed
by MIB in 1976 complied with both the employment and asset limits.
2.02      Until January 18, 1977, SMI enterprises in the manufacturing
sector (which accounts for about 91% of MIB's portfolio) were defined as
those with total assets below W 50 million or with less than 200 employees.
Since enterprises which no longer meet the definition of SMI become in-
eligible for financing by MIB but qualify for financing only by the Korea
Development Bank (KDB)/l the previous definition resulted in an unduly
/1 At least within the government-owned development banking system since any
industrial firm, regardless of size, can approach the privately-owned
Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) for financing, although KDFC
generally does not finance small industries.



large number of firms, sometimes long-standing clients of MIB, being referred
to KDB (as they had grown to exceed both the employees and the assets
limits) even though KDB essentially caters to large and sometimes very large
industries. It is expected that, with the new SMI definition, previous
distortions in the respective operating scopes of MIB and KDB will be alleviated
or eliminated. At the same time, MIB, as its scope of operations has expanded,
will require access to increased long-term domestic and foreign currency
resources.
Role of SMI in the Korean Economy
2.03      In 1975, manufacturing enterprises employing less than 200 persons
numbered 21,438 and accounted for 94.1% of the total number of 22,787 enter-
prises operating in the Korean manufacturing sector. Based on the new (1977)
definition of small and medium industries (i.e. manufacturing enterprises
employing up to 300 employees), the SMI sector in 1975 employed nearly
650,000 persons (45% of total manufacturing sector employment) and accounted
for 96.2% of all manufacturing enterprises, 32% of total value added and 31%
of total output but only 20% of total fixed investment by manufacturing
enterprises.

/a  Figures in parentheses apply to enterprises employing up to 300 persons.
The above table shows that the relative share of SMI /1 in total employment
declined from 54% in 1968 to 38% in 1975. Over the period 1968-1975, the
growth of the manufacturing sector has been very rapid: employment increased
at an annual average rate of 9.5% and value added in current prices by an
average of 38% p.a. The foregoing data suggest that SMI units responded to
the expanding demand by increasing employment and moving into the large-scale
group of industry.  Indeed the average size of employment of Korean SMI units
increased by about 6% p.a. over that 7-year period from 17 employees in 1968
to 25 in 1975 while the average size of large enterprises increased only
marginally from 620 employees in 1968 to 656 in 1975, a growth rate of less
/1 SMI throughout the following discussion are defined as firms employing up
to 200 persons, unless otherwise stated.

than 1% p.a. Another indication of the efficiency of SMI is the fact that labor
productivity measured by the ratio of value added per person employed has
increased by an annual average of 26% for SMI compared with 23% p.a. for large
manufacturing enterprises.
2.04      Exports.  While Korean SMI account for just over 30% of total
value added and output in the manufacturing sector, their contribution to
Korea's exports is considerably greater amounting to US$2.9 billion or 37% of
all commodity exports in 1976. This represents an outstanding performance
considering that SMI have maintained their relative share at this level over
the last seven years even in 1975 and 1976 when Korea's overall export perfor-
mance was exceptionally good, and in spite of the rapid expansion of large
scale industry in the 1970s. These results show that Korean SMI have been
highly responsive to the Government's incentives aiming at an increased export
orientation of SMI. Korean SMI are essentially involved in the production of
light manufactures, particularly textiles and wearing apparel, which are
traditional export items for Korea (textiles and clothing accounted for 36% of
Korea's exports in 1975).
Industrial Structure of SMI
2.05      The following table shows the distribution of value added and
employment among manufacturing subsectors in the year 1975 for both SMI
and large enterprises. In terms of value added, textiles is the most important
subsector for SMI with 20.4%, followed closely by food processing (18.4%);
chemicals and fabricated metals account both for 17%. In respect of large
enterprises (i.e. with more than 200 employees), chemicals comes first with
23.4% followed in order by textiles, food industries and fabricated metals/
machinery. These four subsectors account together for about 73% and 84% of
the value added generated by SMI and large-scale enterprises respectively.
While these figures reflect a great similarity in the sectoral distribution of
SMI and large-scale enterprises, larger enterprises are preponderant in the
more capital-intensive activities covered under food processing, chemical
production, machinery manufacturing and even textiles. Variances in the
sectoral distribution of SMI and large-scale enterprises are more pronounced
for employment than for value added. This is particularly true for textiles,
chemicals and food industries essentially because of the higher productivity
of large-scale enterprises in these activities.

in the two major industrial centers of Seoul an,d Pusan. By way of comparison

these two centers.

Looking at the regional distribution of employment, it is clear that SMI have
been instrumental in creating employment opportunities outside the already
congested areas of Seoul and Pusan. Employment in other regions actually
increased from 58% of all SMI employment in 1972 to 60% in 1975. Considerable
progress has also been achieved by large-scale enterprises from 44% to 51% in
other regions but SMI appear to be an effective tool for achieving a balanced
geographic dispersal of employment, especially in the less developed
areas of Korea. Indications are that SMI located in urban areas tend to be
larger, more modern and efficient than their counterparts in other regions.
2.07      To encourage the location of SMI outside the main urban centers, the
Government has taken since the early 1970s a number of initiatives such as:
(a) the Saemaeul (New Community) movement started in 1971, which promotes the
development of small factories in rural areas so as to provide off-farm
employment opportunities for rural households /1; (b) the development of
Regional Industrial Estates located near secondary urban centers and directed
primarily towards the needs of SMI; and (c) Specialized Industrial Estates
where industries specialized in a particular activity (e.g. machinery manufac-
turing) are regrouped and in which larger industries are expected to provide
opportunities for subcontracting and the provision of ancillary services by
SMI.
Financing of SMI
2.08      Korean SMI receive financial assistance from three sources: (a) the
commercial banking system comprising the five nationwide commercial banks and
ten local commercial banks; (b) the Citizens National Bank (CNB); and (c) the
Medium Industry Bank (MIB). The following table shows the volume of lending
by these sources:

were expected to employ close to 50,000 persons and to generate exports
aggregating US$350 million per year.

Over the past three years loans to SMil have averaged about 35% of all bank loans
to industry. But most of the SMI financing (about 90% on an outstanding
basis) is in the form of short-term working capital loans. Commercial banks
do not normally lend long-term funds for equipment financing but have a
liberal policv of rolling over short-term lines of credit as they mature.
MIR, and to a lesser extent, CNB are the major sources of equipment financing
for SMI.
2.09       Commercial Banks.  The commercial banks, as shown in the above
table, are the major source of finance for SMI. The quasi totality of their
financial assistance, however, is in the form of- short-term working capital.
Commercial banks, including local banks, are statutorily required by the
Government to direct at least 30% of their lend:ing to SMI. Compliance with
this requirement is supervised by BOK. Loans are granted on the basis of
collateral appraisal and of the borrowers' credit standing.
2.10       Citizens National Bank (CNB).  The government-owned CNB was estab-
lished in 1963 to undertake consumers' credit and provide banking services to
households and very small enterprises of the cottage industry type. CNB is
not authorized to deal in foreign exchange but does provide domestic currency
term financing (up to five years) for eligible enterprises i.e. industrial
enterprises employing up to 100 persons (until February 1977, the limit stood
at 49 employees). Maximum loan size is W 30 million (US$60,000). (The
previous limit until February 1977 was W 5 million). The normal lending
rate currently stands at 18% p.a., except for cottage industries which are
financed from a special line of credit bearing interest at 8.5% p.a.  SMI
lending accounted for about 63% of CNB's portfolio which as of June 30,
1977, stood at W 293 billion.  The balance consisted of personal loans whose
term is usually less than three years. CNB derives its financial resources
mainly from deposits and from borrowings from the Government and BOK.
At end-June 1977, its total assets amounted to W 478 billion and its staff
numbered about 5,000 persons most of whom were employed in the 132 branches
and offices scattered around the country. CNB lends on the basis of colla-
teral and does not undertake project appraisal,.
2.11       Fixed Investment in SMI.   Total fixed assets investment by manufac-
turing industries reached W 838 billion in 1975; enterprises employing up to
200 employees accounted for about 16% of that total with W 130 billion (about
US$270 million). MIB estimates that about 66% of all SMI fixed investment in
1975 was in machinery and equipment while buildings and land accounted for
26% and 8% respectively. Studies by MIB have shown that SMI fixed investment is
financed up to 60% by the companies' own funds and the balance from borrowings.
Loans from institutional sources (e.g. commercial banks, 1IMB, CNB) accounted
for only approximately 60% of SMI borrowings, suggesting that SMI enterprises
had to rely to some extent on private borrowings, including those from the
curb market. However, the fact that over the past three years loans to SMI
had accounted for 35% of all bank loans to industry (para. 2.08), compared with
SMI's share of 30% of total industrial output, indicates that SMI units have
had relatively easy access to bank credits.

Nonfinancial Assistance to StI
2.12      Government Policy for SMI.  The Government's program of promotion
of SMI was initiated in the early 1960s with the establishment of the Small
Industry Division in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and of the Medium
Industry Bank in 1961. At first Government's efforts were largely confined
to channeling financial assistance and ensuring that adequate technical
assistance was available through MIB's extension services. Recognizing the
role of SMI in generating employment outside the main urban areas, in contri-
buting to the growth of exports and in complementing large industries through
subcontracting and the provision of ancillary services, the Government intro-
duced additional specific policy measures and incentives in favor of SMI.
These measures include: (a) the 1971 Saemaeul Program, under which loans are
provided at preferential interest rates, along with easy access to industrial
utilities, land and concessionary tax rates for SMI establishing in rural
areas; (b) incentives given to export-oriented SMI to relocate in industrial
estates and export zones and to create groups of exporting SMI for the
marketing of their production overseas; (c) special depreciation allowances
encouraging modernization of machinery and productivity improvements; and
(d) promotion of mergers. As for SMI at the smaller end of the spectrum
whose access to bank financing is hampered by the lack of collateral, the
Government has progressively strengthened the Credit Guarantee Fund which
issues guarantees to small industrial borrowers. Previously administered by
MIB, the Fund has been operating independently since 1976.
2.13      Small Industry Bureau (SIB).  Originally a division of the Ministry
of Commerce and Industry, the SIB is responsible for the formulation and
implementation of government policies for SMI. The SIB monitors progress in
the SMII sector and gathers information on SMI. Due to its small staff, the
SIB relies heavily on MIB, the National Federation of Medium Industry Coopera-
tives and the provincial governments to carry out its functions.
2.14      Korea Federation of Small Businesses (KFSB) /1.  Established in 1962
under the Small and Medium Industry Cooperatives Act, the KFSB is the apex
institution of SMI cooperatives throughout the country. The small business
cooperative structure comprises 64 federations at the national level and
109 cooperatives at the provincial level. These cooperatives perform a number
of functions for their members including provision of managerial and technical
guidance, dissemination of economic and business information, joint purchase
of raw materials, marketing assistance, etc. The cooperatives' operations
are partially funded by the Government either through direct grants or
indirectly through tax exemptions and subsidized loans.
/1 Previously named the National Federation of Medium Industry Cooperatives
(NFMIC).

Reexamination of SIlI Policies and Institutional Framework
2.15      In spite of the considerable success of the SMI sector in the
past, the Government is in the process of undertaking a comprehensive
review of its policies and institutional framework,with a view to further
strengthening it and enhancing the Government's assistance to it. MIeasures
being contemplated by responsible Government oifficials include the following:
(a)  an overhauling of the administrative machinery involved in SMI.
An "Office of SMI" is expected to be established, which would act as
the central authority in all SII mattLers. This office (to be
headed by a Government official with the rank of a Vice-Minister),
would be essentially an offshoot of the existing Small Industry
Bureau (para. 2.13), which it would absorb, but considerably strength-
ened in terms of statutory powers and staff;
(b) a strengthening and possible reorganization of the Korea Federation
of Small Businesses and of the system of SMI cooperatives referred to
in para. 2.14;
(c)  greater financial assistance to SMI by the Government including
increased access by MIB to government resources (e.g. budgetary
allocations and borrowings from the National Investment Fund);
(d) a reexamination of the existing system for delivery of extension
services to SMI enterprises (which aLt present relies essentially on
the Extension Services Department of MIB) with a view particularly
to facilitating the transfer of appropriate technologies;
(e) mergers of SIIl enterprises to achieve economies of scale; and
(f)  a general review of the overall incentives system concerning SMI.
3.  THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Institutional Setup
3.01      The financial sector of Korea consists of the Bank of Korea,
Deposit Money Banks and nonmonetary financial institutions. The Bank of
Korea performs regular central banking functions, including the supervision
of commercial banks.
3.02      Deposit Money Banks include commercial banks and specialized banks.
Commercial banks receive most of their funds through deposits from the public.
They can make all kinds of loans but have traditionally concentrated on short-
term lending although term financing through roll-over of short-term loans
is common.  There are 5 nationwide commercial banks, 10 banks with localized
operations and 11 branches of foreign banks which together had 693 branches/
offices around the country at end-1976 (all these fall into the category
of "commercial banks").  Four of the five nationwide commercial banks are



- 16 -
are fully controlled by the Government which, under Korean law, automatically
receives majority rights if its holding in a nationwide bank is 10% or more.
The fifth bank is controlled by the semiofficial Korean Traders Association.
All commercial banks are subject to control and supervision by the Bank of
Korea while specialized banks are directly controlled by the Ministry of
Finance. The specialized banks were all established under a Special Banking
Act and are subject to only a few specific Articles of the Bank of Korea Act
and General Banking Act. Specialized banks are government-controlled and/or
owned. As their name implies, they were founded for particular purposes or
sectors (such as small-scale industry financing or agricultural financing)
and government funds constitute a substantial part of their financial
resources in addition to resources raised otherwise, the bulk of which
consists of deposits raised from the public, hence their categorization as
Deposit Money Banks. Specialized Banks include the Korea Exchange Bank,
which was established in 1967 mainly to relieve the Bank of Korea of commer-
cial foreign exchange business, the Medium Industry Bank which extends finan-
cial and technical assistance to small and medium-scale industries, the Citi-
zens National Bank (mainly for mobilizing small savings and financing house-
hold loans and small enterprises), the Korea Housing Bank, the National Agri-
cultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) and the National Fisheries Cooperative.
3.03      Besides the above-mentioned banking institutions which, with the
BOK as supervising agency, constitute the "Monetary System," there are
several nonbanking financial institutions, namely: (a) development finance
institutions; (b) savings institutions; (c) life insurance companies; and
(d) investment companies. The development finance institutions comprise the
Korea Development Bank (KDB) which so far has received two Bank loans totaling
US$142.5 million,/1 Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) to which
Bank Group assistance, including IFC, amounts to US$240 million to date,/2
the Land Bank and the Export-Import Bank. Savings institutions comprise some
1,200 authorized credit unions (at end-1976) and 211 mutual savings and
finance companies. Five life insurance companies operate in Korea. in
addition to the postal life insurance and the Educational Insurance Company.
Investment companies include the Korea Securities Finance Corporation which
is the principal organization for securities financing in Korea, the Korea
Investment Corporation, primarily an underwriter and broker of corporate
securities, the newly established Korea Merchant Banking Corporation, ten
short-term finance companies/3 and the Korea Investment Trust Corporation
which is specialized in the establishment of investment trust funds. In
addition, three leasing companies have been established over the last few
years as joint ventures between Korean and foreign investors.

3.04      As of December 31, 1976, total loans outstanding to the manufactur-
ing sector by all banking institutions in Korea including KDB amounted to
W 2,437 billion (US$5.0 billion equivalent). About 70% of this amount was
for operating funds, mainly supplied by commercial banks. The largest
supplier of equipment fund loans is KDB which, as of December 31, 1976, had
an outstanding term portfolio of W 226 billion (US$466 million), about
45% of the total outstanding medium and long-term credit by banking institu-
tions to industry as of that date.
Capital Market
3.05      The Korea Stock Market was moribund for many years but showed signs
of life in 1972. Before then the yields on stocks were considered unattractive
as both savings accounts of commercial banks and the "curb market" gave
higher returns. The market was also thin because closely held companies were
reluctant to go public. With the mid-1972 economic boom and the adoption of
new financial measures by the Government (para. 1.05), the public showed
growing interest in the stock market. The curb market was severely checked
as a result of the August 1972 measures and with decreasing interest rates
served by commercial banks, yields on stocks became attractive. In addition,
the overall investment climate became more favorable after August 1972, and
the campaign for more stock listings and for companies to go public was
intensified. The result was a large increase in stock exchange activity in
the second half of 1972 and in 1973. In 1974, however, trading activities on
the exchange slowed down considerably, due to the gloomy business outlook;
new stock listings, however, continued to rise reaching almost W 500 million
at the end of 1974. The following table summarizes the stock exchange
activity over the last six years (figures are shown as of the end of each
period):
STOCK ACTIVITY 1971 - 1976

1972      66            103.3              174.3                246.0
1973     104            200.0              251.6                426.2
1974     128            199.9              381.3                532.8
1975     189            290.7              643.4               916.0
1976     274            764.9            1,153.3             1,436.1
3.06      With the general improvement of the business climate and improved
export prospects, trading picked up again around mid-1975 and for the year as
a whole the number of stocks listed almost doubled.
3.07      In 1976, the capital market was rather sluggish in comparison to
the previous year mainly because of the Government's tight monetary policy.



- 18 -
The general stock price index stood at 415.3 at end-1976, an increase of 8%
only during the year, compared with a 44% gain a year earlier. On the other
hand, the issuing market was very active during the year as a result of the
Government's efforts to promote the "going public" of privately held companies.
The number of listed companies increased by 85 to 274 in the year and a total
of W 263 billion was mobilized through the capital market, a 69.5% gain over
the previous year. During the year, the number of shareholders increased
substantially. Over the years, the ownership structure has broadened, though
as at October 31, 1976, more than 68% of all shareholders still held less
than 100 shares each and accounted for only 2.05% of all shares outstanding.
The importance of the Government as a shareholder of listed companies also
decreased; while the Government (including public bodies) held about 39% of
the total number of listed stocks in 1970, its holdings had declined to 13%
by October 31, 1976. The proportion held by banking institutions also
declined from 15% to 9% during the same period.
3.08       The rapid increase in the volume of operations on the Stock Exchange
had rendered certain improvements necessary. Among others the call market
has been replaced by a continuous auction market, investment trust companies
have been established, and the information system greatly improved. Several
weaknesses remain, however. One of the more important problems lies in
existing laws which stipulate that new equity issues have to be at par
irrespective of the market price of stocks. These regulations are currently
under review by the Government.
Interest Rates
3.09       The Government through the Monetary Board determines interest rate
ceilings on deposits and loans which apply to all banking institutions.
Although private specialized financial institutions such as KDFC or the short-
term finance companies are not legally bound, in practice, they too have to
follow government policies. The development of Korea's interest rate structure
has, between 1968 and 1973, seen a continuous reduction in both deposit and
lending rates. The lowering of the rates coincided with the Government's
success in gradually bringing inflation down until late 1973. With the
emergence of the oil crisis and worldwide inflation, Korea's price structure
was particularly hard hit because of its high foreign trade dependence.
T7holesale prices are estimated to have increased by nearly 80% between the
end of 1973 and the end of 1975. While the Government selectively increased
interest rates at the end of 1974,/i a general increase of interest rates
was postponed because enterprises were already facing severe financial
strains and the Government hoped to succeed in bringing inflation under
control. During the year 1976, wholesale prices are estimated to have
increased by 12.1% on an annual basis.
/1 Raising rates on time deposits for over three months and over six months
from respectively 12% and 13.2% to 15%, and preferential rates for
loans from the NIF and IRF from 9% and 8% respectively to 12%.



- 19 -
3.10      On August 2, 1976, the Government made an extensive upward adjust-
ment in the interest rate structure in order to contain excessive loan demand
and to better allocate funds. To stimulate domestic savings, the interest
rates on time deposits were raised by 1.2% to a level of 16.2% p.a. for long-
term deposits and by 2.1% to the level of 15% p.a. for short-term savings
deposits. "General lending rates" /1 have correspondingly been increased by
1.5% to 3.5% and now range between 17% and 19% p.a. depending on (a) the
credit standing of the borrower for working capital loans (with a differen-
tial of 1% in the applicable rate); and (b) loan maturity for equipment
financing (with rates of 17% p.a. for loans maituring in less than three
years, 18% for three to eight years and 19% over eight years). Preferential
interest rates applicable to loans from specialized government funds such as
NIF and IRF also differentiate according to maturity and have been increased
from 12% to 13% for three-year loans and 14% for those in excess of three
years.
3.11      Prior to August 1976, Korean commercial banks had already resorted
to various practices which resulted in increased collateral requirements and
higher effective lending rates for their less creditworthy borrowers. Such
practices include the collection of interest in advance, /2 the establishment
of compensating balances on time deposits or even the opening of installment
saving accounts which are used both as collateral and sinking funds. Actual
requirements vary among borrowers depending on their credit standing. The
August 1976 measures can, therefore, be construed as ratifying and rational-
izing a system which already differentiated between borrowers on the basis of
the risks involved. The Korean financial authorities now have established
a list of criteria for enterprises to qualify as prime borrower which should
eliminate subjective judgments on a company's creditworthiness.  The intro-
duction of a prime rate system for working capital loans and of differential
rates according to loan maturities constitutes an important step towards
improving the overall allocation of funds to iLndustry.
3.12      Effective July 1, 1977, the Government replaced the previous
excise, business and consumption taxes by the value added tax (VAT) system,
all goods and services being assessed at a flat rate of 10%. There is some
apprehension amongst the general public and business community that the new
taxation system might result in an increased tax burden on industrial
enterprises and consequently in sharp rises in the cost of living. While the
Government did not subscribe to this thinking, it had decided to moderate the
/1  Unless otherwise specified, this discussion applies to the so-called
"general lending rates" as opposed to the "preferential rates" appli-
cable to various priority sectors. Generally speaking, general lending
rates are applicable to loans made by KDB, MIB and Deposit Money Banks
from their own funds (essentially deposits and equity); preferential
rates apply to loans made from specialized government funds (NIF, IRF,
etc.). At end-1976, loans at preferential interest rates accounted
for approximately 40% of the total outstanding portfolio of banking
institutions in Korea.

possible adverse impacts of the new tax system by introducing various anti-
inflation measures including a lowering of the banks' lending rates by 1%
effective July 1, and by another 1% October 1, 1977. Time deposit rates have
also been lowered by 1.8% from October 1, 1977. While Korea maintained
positive real interest rates from 1965 through 1973, inflation as measured by
the Wholesale Price Index reached 42% and 26% in 1974 and 1975 respectively,
thus resulting in substantially negative interest rates in real terms.
Inflation was sharply reduced to just over 12% p.a. in 1976 and is expected
to remain at the same level in 1977, in excess of the Fourth Five-Year Plan
target of 7% p.a. Even assuming that inflation slightly exceeds the Plan
target in coming years, the overall decline in the interest rate structure
mentioned above should leave real interest rates at a positive level.
4. THE MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK /1
A. Legal Framework, Organization, Policies and Procedures
Legal Framework and Ownership
4.01      Until 1961 loans to small enterprises in Korea were handled by
commercial banks and the government-owned Korea Agricultural Bank as an
addition to its normal agricultural credit activities. The Medium Industry
Bank (MIB) Act of July 1, 1961 provided for the establishment of a new finan-
cial institution specializing in extending financial and technical assistance
in various forms to small and medium-scale industries (SMI), as defined in
the Presidential Decree of August 1, 1961 enforcing the MIB Act. As a special-
ized financial institution, MIB's operations are governed by the provisions
of the MIB Act and are subject to the broad supervision of the Ministry of
Finance. The Articles of the General Banking Act which govern the operations
of commercial banks apply also to MIB's commercial banking activities,
e.g. mobilization of deposits, discounting of bills, letters of credit; these
activities are further subject to the supervision of the Bank of Korea. The
Act constitutes MIB's charter and establishes the broad framework for its
policies, scope of activities, administration and capitalization. The Act
also specifies the scope of the supervision to be exercised by the Minister
of Finance whose approval is required for the adoption and/or revision of
MIB's by-laws, operating manuals, annual plan of operations, appropriation of
earnings and the appointment of MIB's top management.
4.02      Although the MIB Act stipulates that government ownership of
MIB's share capital shall be 50% or more with the balance to be held by small
and medium entrepreneurs, private shareholders held only 0.1% of MIB's share
capital as of June 30, 1977. These private hsldings, amounting to W 16 million,
actually resulted from arrangements made for the disposition of excess divi-
dends following the liquidation of the Federation of Financial Associations
of Korea at the time of MIB's establishment. The MIB Act was last amended in
December 1975, essentially to accommodate an increase of W 24 billion (from
W 6 billion to W 30 billion) in MIB's authorized share capital. At end-June
1977, MIB's paid-in share capital stood at W 13.1 billion, a W 10 billion

increase over the December 1975 level. This increase resulted from cash
subscriptions to MIB's share capital by the Goverrnment in accordance with an
agreement reached during negotiations of the first: IBRD loan in 1975. The
Government at that time undertook to further increase MIB's share capital as
needed in the future, so as to maintain its long-term debt/equity ratio
within the agreed limit of 10:1.
Organization and Operational Autonomy
4.03      The MIB Act provides for a dual Board setup.  The Board of Policy,
which deals with broad policy matters, comprises seven members including
MIB's President who acts as its Chairman, one representative each from the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Bank of
Korea, the National Federation of Small and Medium Industry Cooperatives and
two representatives of small entrepreneurs (the latter two being selected by
the Minister of Finance). The Board of Policy convenes on an average of three
times a year, primarily to approve the settlement of MIB's annual accounts
and the appropriation of earnings, any amendments to the by-laws and operating
manuals, and MIB's annual plan of operations. Resolutions of the Board of
Policy regarding the above matters are subject to the approval of thvt Minister
of Finance.
4.04      Executive authority, including the approval of loans and guarantees
exceeding certain ceilings, is vested in the Board of Directors. The lat-er
is composed of seven members, including MIB's Pre!sident, acting as Chairma-
the Deputy President and the five Directors in charge of MIB's various
departments. The dual Board setup and the demarcation of functions between
the two Boards, as described above, have proved to be appropriate and effec-
tive. On the one hand, it enables key government: officials and represen-
tatives of the SMI business community to participate in broad policy dlelib-
erations within the Board of Policy, thus facilitating the flow and exchange of
information between MIB, the Government and the private sector. On the other
hand, it concentrates executive authority in the Board of Directors, which,
in effect, is a full-time professional body comprising MIB's senior management
team. With this dual Board setup, MIB operates within the ambit of govern-
ment policies while enjoying full autonomy in its operational decisions. The
composition of the two Boards is given in Annexes 1 and 2.
Management
4.05      Mr. Nam Sang Jin, a former Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Finance,
was appointed as MIB's President and chief executive officer in Nay 1976. He
has extensive experience in banking and financial matters. He is assisted by
a Deputy President (formerly an Assistant Governor of the Bank of Korea) and
five directors, all of whom have had long experience with MIB and its prede-
cessor, the Korea Agricultural Bank. Each Director is in charge of 3 to
4 of MIB's 17 departments (see Organization Chart). Historically, NIB's
Presidents have been appointed from the senior levels of the government
hierarchy. Although there has been a rapid turnover of Presidents in the
last four years (Mr. Nam is the third President within that time span),
management continuity has been maintained through the Directors and Department
Mtanagers. MIB has an experienced and competent cadre of managers in its
departments and branch offices. It also has considerable depth at the deputy
manager level.

Staff
4.06      The mobilization of demand and savings deposits, which represents a
major source of funds for MIB's operations, requires a nationwide network of
65 branches and 13 smaller depos,4 offices.  As a result, the size of MIB's
staff as well as the level of its administrative expenses are more comparable
to those of commercial banks than to conventional DFCs with which the Bank is
associated. Of its total staff of 3,533 as of June 30, 1973, only 23% were
employed at the head office with the remaining 77% in MIB's branches and
deposit offices. Under MIB's own classification all employees with a college
degree are considered as professionals; some 84% of its total staff would
qualify as such. This percentage includes, however, a large number of
personnel performing clerical, banking (e.g. tellers) and administrative
functions typically categorized as subprofessional. Excluding those, the
proportion Qf professionals to total staff is about 25%. NIB recruits mainly
college graduates who undergo throughout their professional career compre-
hensive on and off-the-job training and whose rotational assignments are
planned so as to develop versatility.  While this policy may sometimes cause
a certain disruption in the activities of the departments affected, it has
also enabled NIB to build up a solid cadre of experienced and well-rounded
professionals at the middle management level. Staff training at the various
levels is comprehensive and methodical. The overall quality of MIB's staff
is good.
4.07      The growth of MIB's staff has averaged 4% p.a. over the past five
years, which has been sufficient for MIB to cope with the growing volume of
its business. MIB's departments appear to be adequately staffed including
the Foreign Loan Department (FLD), which is responsible for processing loan
applications in foreign currency, and the Extension Services Department (ESD),
which provides technical assistance. A strengthening of the staff of
these two departments was urged by the Bank and agreed to by MIB at the time of
negotiations of the previous Bank loan. This undertaking has been satisfac-
torily implemented, but a further and gradual strengthening of the FLD may
prove necessary as its volume of business increases.
4.08      Staff turnover at the professional level, which was very moderate
through the first half of 1975, increased rapidly thereafter and is likely
to exceed 10% in 1977 as it did in 1976. This is attributable to a gradual
erosion, in relative terms, of compensation in the government banking sector
vis-a-vis the industrial private sector. Turnover is particularly heavy
at the middle-management level and for staff with a working knowledge of
English. The Government, which determines the level of salaries in government
banks, recently acceded to the request of the management of these banks for a
sizeable salary increase which should come into effect around the end of
1977. While the recent staff turnover has had no discernible adverse impact
on MIB's operational efficiency, NIB's management is keeping the situation
under close review and is prepared to intensify recruitment of suitable
additional staff.
Operating Policies and Development Strategy
4.09      In conjunction with the securing of the first ADB loan in 1969,
MIB's Board of Policy adopted a Policy Statement which supplements the broad



- 23 -
policy and operational guidelines contained in the I4B Act (Annex 20). Aside
from restrictions on the maximum exposure which NIB is normally authorized to
take in any single enterprise, this statement defines in broad terms the
industries which are to be given priority for MIB's assistance (essentially
export-oriented and import-substituting industries as well as labor-intensive
projects). The financial guidelines do not specify any statutory limit on
IIB's long-term debt/equity ratio. A contractual limit of 10:1 has, however,
been agreed to by MIB with IBRD and ADB. NIB's debt/equity ratio stood at
7.4:1 as of June 30, 1977.
4.10      In order to emphasize its immediate developmental objectives,
MIB formulated in 1975 a Development Strategy covering the period 1976-77
which outlined the following areas on which it intended to focus:
(a) a greater geographical dispersal of portfolio outside the main industri-
alized areas of Seoul and Pusan; (b) intensified assistance to Saemaeul rural
industries; (c) intensification of its extension services; and (d) increased
mobilization of long-term domestic currency resources. NIB has made substantial
progress in implementing these objectives and intends to continue to give
them high priority in the next two-year period. MIB has consequently updated
its strategy statement with renewed emphasis being placed on geographic
dispersal, rural industries, development of small, labor-intensive projects
and the provision of extension services to SMI (Annex 21).
Project Appraisal
4.11      For short-term working capital loans, IIB's lending decisions are
essentially based on an assessment of the borrowers' credit standing and of
the collaterals available rather than on projecit analysis, a practice in
line with commercial banking. MIB's appraisal work for term loans is sound.
Technical analysis in MIB's appraisal reports is generally quite thorough
and benefits from the assistance received from the engineers of the Extension
Services Department and, since April 1977, from the Korea Institute of
Science and Technology (KIST) for technical matters in which MIB's engineer-
ing staff does not possess sufficient expertise. Technical feasibility as
well as the borrower's credit standing are given foremost consideration by
MIB, which is an appropriate approach for small business lending. The
quality of market analysis often suffers from the lack of information on
small and specialized markets relating to SMI projects, but the widespread
practice of subcontracting for Korean SMI limits the marketing uncertainties.
Financial and economic analysis has gradually been expanded and improved by
MIB in connection with the submission of some 140 subprojects under this
first Bank loan. Sensitivity analysis has recently been introduced using
different price and cost assumptions, and partial economic indicators
(i.e. employment, value added and balance of payments impact) are routinely calcu-
lated. The calculation of economic rates of return was recently undertaken
for a few projects requiring MIB's financing in, excess of $0.5 million.
Although there is room for further upgrading various aspects of MIB's appraisal,
the desirability of a more refined appraisal work (which would necessarily be
more time-consuming) ought to be weighed against the desirability of accelerat-
ing loan processing, especially for a small industry lending institution such



- 24 -
as MIB. MIB takes the reasonable view that its appraisal work at present is
basically satisfactory and that it is more important to speed it up than to
attempt to further refine it. During appraisal, NIB agreed that: (a) with a
view to speeding up loan processing by IIB, substantially simplified criteria
and procedures will be applied under the proposed loan by NIB to free-limit
subloans. Instead of a full appraisal report, MIB will submit to the Bank a
simplified "Project Summary" giving the essential financial and economic
project data for these subloans; and (b) the calculation of economic rates of
return will be made for projects requiring subloans exceeding US$500,000,
with, however, the exception of expansion projects (i.e. for additional
capacity), for which the economic rates of return are usually less meaningful,
and of export-oriented projects, for which a reasonable financial rate of
return would in most cases suggest economic viability as well.
Project Follow-up
4.12      Follow-up work is delegated entirely to the branch offices, except
for foreign currency loans, the supervision of which is the responsibility
of both the Foreign Loan Department at headquarters and of the branches.
Loan agreements with subborrowers give MIB the right to inspect, as need be,
the premises of the projects and specify reporting requirements which include
the periodic submission of financial statements, information on production,
sales and changes in management or production facilities. Field visits are
normally conducted at least twice a year and more frequently for problem
projects. Because most term borrowers also receive working capital loans and
maintain both current and time deposit accounts with MIB, branches have
frequent contacts with clients and an early knowledge of the liquidity
situation and of any financial difficulties which borrowers may face.
Recognizing this special position of its officers in the branches, MIB
recently started training the branch deputy managers in simple managerial and
technical diagnosis with a view to improving consultancy services at the
branch level. (More complex problems are referred to the Extension Services
Department at the head office.) Referral of problem projects to the Loan
Settlement Department (LSD) takes place when a loan officer recommends that
the loan be rescheduled or that legal proceedings be undertaken to foreclose
the account. Write-offs, too, are subject to scrutiny by the LSD and approval
by the Loan Settlement Committee./l The effectiveness of MIB's follow-up
work is reflected in the quality of its portfolio and the low level of arrears.
4.13      Following discussions with the Bank at the time of negotiation
of Loan 1175-KO, MIB introduced a Project Monitoring System for a sample
of 50 subprojects appraised by the Foreign Loan Department. The objective
of the system was to evaluate progress at critical stages of implementation
of the projects and to analyse actual projecL costs and benefits for compar-
ison with earlier appraisal estimates. In spite of the substantial staff
time required to carry out such a system, MIB appreciates its benefits
and intends to gradually expand it.

managers of the LSD and Auditing Office.



- 25 -
Procurement and Disbursement
4.14      MIB's procurement and disbursement procedures are laid out in
detail in its Operating Manuals and duly enforced. Procurement procedures
for foreign currency loans are tailored to meet the requirements of each
line of credit. The technical staff of the Extension Services Department
helps MIB's borrowers draft invitations for bids and supervises the opening
of bids. Procurement is normally based on at least three competitive quo-
tations from foreign suppliers and the final contract is subject to MIB's
approval. Under domestic currency term loans, funds are deposited into a
special account in the borrower's name and released according to the progress
made in implementing the project as certified by the loan officer. MIB's
procurement and disbursement procedures are satisfactorily designed to ensure
the efficient and appropriate use of funds.
B. Operations and Developmental Impact
Scope of Operations
4.15      Within Korea's institutional framework f-or industrial financing,
MIB occupies a median position between, at one end, the government-owned
Korea Development Bank (KDB) and the privately-owned Korea Development
Finance Corporation (KDFC) which both concentrate on relatively large entel-
prises and, at the other extreme, the government-owned Citizens National Bank
(CNB) which operates primarily in the unorganized subsector of small-scale
enterprises and provides consumer loans and small domestic currency loans to
firms of an individual, household or cottage type. MIB caters mainly to the
needs of modern medium-sized firms, but is also expected to have a significant
impact on smaller companies as well.
4.16      The MIB Act confines MIB's financing to "small and medium enter-
prises" as officially defined by the Presidential Decree enforcing the Act
(see para. 2.01). Since MIB's inception in 1961 through 1976, SMI enterprises,
i.e. those eligigible for MIB's financing, were defined as those with total
assets not exceeding W 50 million or with less than 200 employees./l A
Presidential Decree of January 18, 1977, changed these limits to W 500 mil-
lion and 300 employees /1 respectively, to take into account the steady
increase in the size of SMI enterprises in Korea since 1961. Within the SMI
sector, no official distinction is made between "small" and "medium." As
mentioned earlier in para 2.01, the alternative eligibility criteria for MIB
subborrowers in terms of either employment or asset size may be a cause for
distortion when the asset limit is set too low, as was the case until January
1977. The alternative employment criterion can then be applied, which may
lead to the financing of relatively large, capitail-intensive units. In view
of this shortcoming, foreign lenders to MIB, who usually regard asset size
/1 The employees and assets limits mentioned in this paragraph apply to
manufacturing enterprises, which constitute the overwhelming bulk of
MIB's portfolio. Slightly different limits are set for other SMI
activities such as mining, transportation, trade and services. The
employment and asset size limit apply at the time of application for
financing by MIB.



- 26 -
as a more meaningful criterion for the definition of SMI often have imposed a
single asset limit on the use of their funds. In recognition of the fact
that direct foreign exchange finaning is in greater demand by enterprises at
the medium end of the SMI spectrum this limit normally is higher than the
asset limit applied for domestic currency borrowers. Under the first Bank
loan to MIB the asset limit was set at W 600 million. Under the proposed
loan the limit would be raised to W 1 billion (US$2 million) in line with the
ceiling agreed to by ADB under its latest line of credit. The two size
limits mentioned above (W 500 million and 300 employees) constitute an
official demarcation of functions between MIB and KDB, in that an enterprise
qualifying under either of these two limits (assets or employees) is eligible
for borrowing from MIB but not from KDB, and conversely an enterprise exceed-
ing both size limits is eligible for borrowing from KDB but not from MIB.
When an existing MIB client has grown to exceed both size limits, it becomes
ineligible for MIB's financing and eligible for KDB's financing. The demarca-
tion of functions between MIB and CNB derives from the official restrictions
put on CNB's financing, of which the principal ones are: (a) CNB is not
allowed to lend to enterprises with more than 100 employees; (b) CNB is not
authorized to make (domestic currency) loans in excess of W 30 million; and
(c) CNB is not empowered to deal in foreign exchange, thus leaving foreign
exchange lending to MIB for the entire SMI sector. In practice, CNB concen-
trates on the informal/cottage subsector of small industry, while MIB operates
in the organized, relatively modern subsector. The foregoing indicates that
MIB is the predominant institutional source of domestic currency term finance
and, in effect, the sole source of foreign exchange for small and medium-scale
industries in Korea.
Overall Lending Operations
4.17      Overview.  The most noteworthy feature of MIB's financing activity
is that it is geared to meet both the long-term and short-term resource
requirements of its clients. MIB's long-term financing consists of equipment
(term) loans in both foreign and domestic currencies. Its short-term
financing comprises three types of accommodation: discounting of trade
bills, overdrafts and general working capital loans. The latter two cate-
gories account for the great bulk of MIB's short-term operations and are
financed from deposits while bill discounting is financed through the Bank of
Korea's rediscounting facility. As of June 30, 1977, MIB had a total outstand-
ing portfolio of W 266 billion (or about US$548 million). Equipment loans
(W 82.3 billion or US$170 million equivalent) accounted for roughly 31% of
the total with foreign exchange equipment loans representing about 56% of
total term loans outstanding. MIB's cumulative commitments of equipment
loans since its inception in 1961 to June 30, 1977, totaled W 151.4 billion
(US$312 million equivalent), of which foreign currency loans accounted for
W 67.8 billion (US$140 million). MIB began lending in foreign currency in
1965, but substantial foreign exchange resources became available to it only
in 1973 with its first loan from the ADB. MIB estimates that its disburse-
ments for equipment loans, which totaled W 70.5 million over the three-year
period 1974-76, accounted for about 23% of SMI fixed investment during that
period. MIB's extensive coverage of the SMI sector is reflected in the fact
that, as of June 30, 1977, its clients numbered over 15,000, or almost 70% of
the total number of SMI enterprises (slightly below 22,000) operating in
Korea.



- 27 -
4.18      Recent Operational Performance.  Except for 1975, MIB's commitments
for equipment loans (both foreign and domestic currencies) have rapidly
increased in recent years. From a level of W 6.1 million in 1972, these
commitments increased by an average of 50% p.a. to W 32.3 billion in 1976.
The growth pattern of commitments has, however, been irregular with sharp
increases of 180% in 1973 and 85% in 1976 compensiating a modest 15% growth in
1974. The annual level of MIB's commitments of term loans has generally been
a function of the availability of resources. The decline in commitments in
1975, following a sharp increase during 1972-74, was attributable to a
shortage of long-term won resources made available by the Government to MIB.
Conversely, the significant expansion (by 85%) of commitments in 1976 was
made possible by the availability of the first IBRD loan (which became
effective in January 1976), a cash subscription of W 5 billion to MIB's share
capital by the Government and an unusually high level of collections on
domestic currency loans (W 11.6 billion, against W 4.2 billion in 1975). The
fact that MIB was able to increase fivefold the volume of its annual commit-
ments for equipment loans over the four-year period 1972-76 clearly indicates
the magnitude of the demand from SMI for its financing. Assuming the avail-
ability of adequate resources, MIB should face no difficulty in continuing to
expand its term financing at a rate which it projects at around 25-30% p.a.
over the next several years.
4.19      MIB's lending for working capital has been growing steadily at
a pace of about 27% p.a. since 1972, with the outstanding working capital
loan portfolio (a more meaningful indicator than the level of commitments,
due to the short maturities and the rollover of funds) rising from W 59.6 bil-
lion in 1972 to W 183.7 billion at end-June 1977. This increase in MIB's
working capital financing reflected the growth of deposits (by an average of
23% p.a. over the same period) which represents the main source of funds for
these operations. NIB's loan operations from 1974 to June 30, 1977, are
summarized in Annex 4.
Characteristics of MIB's Lending Operations
4.20      Sectoral Distribution.  The manufacturing sector accounted for 91%
of MIB's total outstanding portfolio as of June 30, 1977 and close to 99% of
all equipment loans outstanding. The nonmanufacturing sectors (construction,
transportation, services, and commerce) accounted for only 9% of all outstanding
loans and 96% of MIB's assistance to these activities was in the form of
working capital loans/l (hence the fact that nornmanufacturing accounted for
about 1% of equipment loans outstanding). Within the manufacturing sector,
textiles and metal products/machinery are the twro most important subsectors in
MIB's portfolio. Textiles and garments accounted for 31% of the outstanding
portfolio at end-June 1977 and fabricated metal products/machinery for 21%;
chemicals/rubber/plastics was the next largest subsector with 11% of all loans
outstanding. The industrial distribution of MIB's portfolio has remained
practically unchanged over the last two years.
4.21      The concentration of about one half of MIB's total portfolio and
about 70% of its portfolio of equipment loans, :in the two subsectors of
textiles and metal products, does potentially expose MIB to the risk of
/1   On an outstanding basis as of June 30, 1977.



- 28 -
cyclical or external factors affecting the performance of these industries.
No such risk exists at present and although a sectoral distribution of MIB's
arrears shows that textiles accounted for 41% of all arrears at end-June
1977, a higher proportion than their 31% share of outstanding loans, the
portfolio of textile loans affected by arrears was less than 9% of all
outstanding loans to textile industries, which is low.
4.22      The relatively heavy concentration of MIB's portfolio in textiles
reflects to a degree MIB's emphasis (as embodied in both its Act and its
Policy Statement) on assisting export-oriented and labor-intensive indus-
tries. Textiles meet both criteria well. Of the 62 textile projects
financed by MIB under the first Bank Loan, No. 1175, 51 (or 82%) are expected
to export at least one half of their output. The 36% share of textiles in
Korea's total exports for 1975 exceeded their 31% share in MIB's portfolio
of equipment loans. Textile projects financed by MIB in 1976 generated
jobs at an average gross capital cost of US$4,360, which is well below both
the Bank's UPP threshold for Korea (US$5,120 at 1976 prices) and the average
gross capital cost per job (US$8,700) of all MIB's projects financed under
the first Bank loan (para. 4.28).
4.23      It would be impractical and perhaps unwise for MIB to curtail
its financing of textiles in an attempt to achieve a more balanced sectoral
distribution of its portfolio, irrespective of the actual demand for funds.
While MIB is concerned about the present portfolio concentration in textiles,
its management takes the reasonable view that there is no ground for MIB to
reduce lending to this activity as long as Korea remains competitive in export
markets by upgrading the quality of its products and diversifying its markets.
Under Korea's Fourth Five-Year Plan, the share of textiles in total exports
is projected to decline from 36% in 1975 to 26% by 1981, and its share in
Korea's total manufacturing investment is also expected to decline marginally,
from 23% to 21%. In keeping with this prospective evolution, the share of
textiles in MIB's financing is also expected to decline marginally in the
years ahead.
4.24      Size Distribution.  While the average size of MIB's working capital
loans increased from just over W 3 million (US$6,200) in 1974-75 to about
W 6 million in 1976-77, the average size of equipment loans has shown a down-
ward trend from W 22 million (US$45,000) in 1974 to W 16 million (US$33,000)
in 1977 for domestic currency equipment loans and from W 98 million (US$200,000)
to W 61 million (US$125,000) for foreign currency loans. In parallel with
this downward trend in the size of individual loans there has been a sizable
general reduction in the average maturity of all types of loans. The average
duration of working capital loans/i has declined from a 2.1 month average in
1974 to 1.6 months in 1976-77 and the weighted /2  average maturity of domestic
/1   Based on the ratio of total annual commitments to end-year outstanding
balance.
/2   By amount.



- 29 -
and foreign currency equipment loans has declined respectively from 7.7 years
to 4.3 years and from 8.7 years to 6.9 years. Both of these trends may be
an indication of the fact that MIB has been facing a relative shortage
of funds over the past years and has consequenvlly tried to reduce loan
amounts and to tighten maturities in order to increase the rollover of its
funds (at least in the case of domestic currency loans).
4.25      Geographic Dispersal.  A significant shift occurred between 1974
and 1977 in the geographic distribution of MIIB's financing. While Seoul
City accounted for as much as 50% of MIB's outstanding portfolio at end-
1974, its share had been reduced to 37% by end-June 1977. Conversely the
share of the surrounding Kyung-Gi Province increased from 5% to 17%. Pusan
City's share remained stable at 12% throughout that period, as did its
surrounding area (South Kyung-Sang Province) with 4% of MIB's portfolio.
Taegu, the third major industrial area in Korea (North Kyung-Sang Province)
which is an important textile center marginally increased from 13% to 14%.
This geographic pattern is generally in line with the present distribution
of Korean industry./I The transfer of industries from Seoul proper into
the surrounding province of Kyung-Gi, while other regions maintained their
share of industrial investment, is the result of adequate government incen-
tives and policies. MIB has done well in implem-enting the policy guide-
lines embodied in its Development Strategy Statement for 1976-77 which
emphasized the need for a greater geographic dispersal of its financing.
Also in line with this emphasis, MIB has been financing about 50% of all the
Saemaeul rural industries established since the introduction of the Govern-
ment's program in 1973 and lending ceilings have been raised for branches
located in the less developed areas /2. Other relevant characteristics
of MIB's loans are shown in Annex 5.
Guarantee Operations
4.26      MIB's guarantee operations are undertaken as a part of the services
it renders to its borrowers in connection with iLts commercial banking activi-
ties. Since 1976, almost all the guarantees issued have been short-term
guarantees against trading documents, payment of- import duties, etc.
Long-term guarantees are issued mainly to other financing institutions
lending to clients of MIB whose collateral is aLready pledged to MIB. Since
1976, issuance of such long-term guarantees has been negligible. Outstanding
guarantees amounted to W 4.7 billion as of June 30, 1977 (Annex 6).
Equity Operations
4.27      MIB does not intend, in the immediate future, to undertake such
operations. First, most small entrepreneurs in Korea do not welcome insti-

tutional equity participation; they do not keep accurate financial information
on which institutions like MIB can rely and their accounts are rarely audited.
Second, MIB's management (quite rightly) believes that the amount of manpower
effort that would be needed to monitor SMI equity investments would be totally
disproportionate to the benefits realized either by the enterprise or by
MIB. Third, neither MIB's financial structure nor its management/staff
orientation allow it to engage in operations as inherently risky as provid-
ing venture capital. Finally, a considerable gap in providing sufficient
debt finance on reasonably secure terms needs to be bridged before riskier
equity operations can be contemplated by MIB.
Utilization of Bank Loan No. 1175-KO
4.28      As of June 30, 1977, MIB had approved 132 subprojects for financing
under Bank Loan No. 1175-KO for a total amount of US$26.9 million. (Since
then, the loan balance of US$3.1 million has been fully allocated on account
of six other subprojects.) Subloans ranged in size from US$31,000 to
US$985,000 with an average of US$204,000. Bank funds accounted for 46% of
the total investment cost of these projects and for 76% of the fixed assets
costs. An aggregate amount of US$16.1 million (close to 60% of total loan
amount) was committed for projects in the textile subsector. The subprojects
are expected to generate a total of 6,665 new jobs at an average capital cost
of US$8,700 per job.
4.29      The poverty threshold for Korea has been estimated by the Bank
at about US$5,100 for 1976 which roughly coincides with the period of commit-
ment under Loan 1175-KO. Available data on the subprojects financed under
the previous loan show that projects with a cost per job below US$5,000
(which could, therefore, be construed as conforming with the Bank's Urban
Poverty Program), accounted for approximately 20% of the total loan amount.
In terms of size of the subborrowers, approximately 11% of the loan amount
went to subprojects with fixed assets (including the fixed assets financed
under the proposed subloans) below US$250,000. These figures show that MIB's
financial assistance has not been unduly skewed towards the "medium" end of
the industrial spectrum at the expense of the "small" end.
Extension Services
4.30      Shortly after its establishment, NIB started providing managerial
assistance to Korean SMI on a limited basis. Subsequently, it expanded the
scope of its technical assistance to SMI to cover technical consultancy as
well. This was achieved with the technical and financial assistance of the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and of the International Labor
Organization (ILO), which, between 1968 and 1974, made available to MIB the
services of a number of expatriate advisors and experts. At the same time
these experts helped train MIB's staff, and a specialized Extension Services
Department (ESD) was established in charge of managerial, financial and
technical consultancy services for small and medium enterprises irrespective
of whether or not they were borrowers of MIB. Following the departure of the
UNDP/ILO experts in 1974, the ESD became understaffed and consultancy
services declined from their early 1970s level. At the time of appraisal
of the previous Bank loan, NIB acknowedged that the ESD needed both qualitative



- 31 -
and quantitative strengthening, especially in thie light of the specific
objective outlined in the 1976-77 Development Strategy Statement to intensify
extension services. In accordance with that objective, MIB has increased the
staffing of the ESD from 34 in 1974 to 38 in 1976 and 45 at end-June 1977.
This net increase was achieved in spite of the relatively high number of
technical specialists who have left MIB to join private industries.
4.31      MIB's consultancy services range from assistance on minor technical
and/or managerial problems which can be solved by correspondence to plant
visits by MIB's staff in the branch offices (for relatively simple problems)
or in the Extension Services Department (for more complex problems).  NIB's
technical consultancy covers a variety of subjects including textiles,
electrical engineering, metallurgy and mechanical engineering. Managerial
assistance includes product management, accounting, inventory control,
marketing, etc. In addition, the ESD staff are called upon to conduct profes-
sional seminars, to prepare feasibility studies for individual subprojects
and to produce various professional publications which are circulated among
the Korean small business community.
4.32      In spite of the strengthening of the ESD's staff, the number
of field visits, professional seminars and other consultancy services has
considerably declined in recent years/l and MIB's assistance is now confined
to MIB's own clients. Even though larger, more sophisticated firms are now
in a position to obtain technical services from private consulting firms
against payment of a fee, there is clearly a gap between the needs of the
22,000 SMI firms operating in Korea in 1975 and the 155 cases handled by ESD
during that year. The fees charged by MIB for extension services are nominal
and do not allow full recovery of the costs involved. A full-scale organization
for providing adequate extension services with experienced professionals, how-
ever, is a high-cost operation which could seriously impair MIB's profitability.
The Government is aware of the existing gap in the provision of adequate
technical assistance to SMI and realizes that MN[B might not be the best
channel. The Government is currently considering a major reorganization of
the administrative departments and agencies deaLing with SMI, which is likely
to involve a reexamination of the system for delivery of extension services
to SMI (para. 2.15).
C. Financial Position and Resources
Assets and Liabilities Structure
4.33      Assets.  NIB's balance sheets for the years 1974 through
June 30, 1977 appear in Annex 8. As of June 30, 1977, NIB's total assets
stood at W 377.8 billion (US$779 million) following a steady growth averaging
24% p.a. over the last two and a half years.  Current assets increased
rapidly at an average of 34% p.a and now account for 65% of MIB's total
assets as against 52% in 1974.
/1   In-plant consultancy services reached just over 100 cases in 1976 as
against 350 in 1970 and 150 in 1974 and 1975.



- 32 -
Current assets essentially comprise: (a) reserves deposited with BOK against
deposits;/1 and (b) short-term working capital loans. Both increased rapidly
reflecting MIB's success in mobilizing demand and savings deposits, which
grew at an overall annual average of 26% (38% for short-term demand deposits).
MIB's total loan portfolio, including short-term working capital loans,
however, remained at the level of approximately 70% of total assets throughout
the two and a half year period ended June 30, 1977.
4.34      Liabilities and Equity.  Since the end of 1974, the increase in
MIB's assets reached W 164 billion, 74% of which was financed by the growth
of MIB's current liabilities, 19% by long-term debt and 7% through
increases of equity. Current liabilities, of which short-term deposits
accounted for 78% at end-June, 1977, have grown steadily at an average of
36% p.a. over the past 30-month period and have more than doubled. As
indicated earlier, short-term deposits increased by an average of 38% p.a.
and have actually financed about 60% of the increase in MIB's total assets
during that period. Long-term liabilities /2 grew by an annual average of
10% only. The growth of MIB's term debt has been irregular (with a mere 1%
increaset in 1976 following the 16% increase of 1975) and was entirely due
to MIB's drawdown on its foreign currency lines of credit (whose outstanding
balance increased by an average of 20% p.a.) and higher savings deposits
(which increased by an average of 9% p.a. in spite of a slight decline in
1976). Domestic currency term funding from the Government (including budgetary
allocations, NIF and IRF) actually declined in absolute amount from an
aggregate of W 27.6 billion at end-1974 to W 26.4 billion by June 1977.
This decline in available long-term won resources, however, was more than
compensated by the W 10 billion contribution made to MIB's share capital in
1976-77. MIB's equity grew even faster, in relative terms, than current
liabilities, with an average 45% annual growth between January 1975 and June
1977. MIB's equity stood at W 17.9 billion (US$36.8 million) as of June 30,
1977.
4.35      The W 10 billion government contribution to MIB's share capital
was paid in by installments in early 1976 and early 1977. As a result,
MIB's long-term debt/equity ratio /3 which stood at 17.4:1 at end-1975 had
declined to 9.8:1 by end-1976 and 7.4:1 as of June 30, 1977. These contri-
butions to MIB's share capital were made in accordance with the Government's
undertaking, recorded in the legal documents under Bank Loan No. 1175-KO, to
provide MIB with additional equity capital as needed to enable MIB to main-
tain its long-term debt/equity ratio within the agreed 10:1 limit. This
undertaking was reconfirmed and incorporated in the legal documents under the
proposed loan. It is further recommended that the limit of 10:1 be maintained
under the proposed loan.
/1 Reserve requirements set by BOK are 24% for demand deposits and 17% for
savings deposits.
/2 Including savings deposits with maturities exceeding one year.
/3 Long-term guarantees are included in long-term debt.



- 33 -
4.36      MIB's total debt/equity ratio which stood at 32:1 at end-1974
rose to 39:1 in 1975 but dropped to 26:1 and 20:1 by end-1976 and end-June
1977 respectively, following the W 10 billion increase in share capital.
This indebtedness is not excessive for an institution which, unlike most
DFCs associated with the Bank, is heavily involved in commercial banking
operations and which derives a large part of its resources from deposits,
particularly short-term demand deposits. In spite of the growing volume of
MIB's current liabiities, a total debt/equity limitation (or alternatively, an
additional limitation on short-term indebtedness) appears unnecessary, and
would unduly constrain MIB's efforts at mobilizing deposits while only higher
amounts of deposits can allow a reduction, in relative terms, of the cost of
maintaining MIB's nationwide network of branches and deposit offices. This
would also run counter to the Government's objectLive of intensifying the
mobilization of domestic savings by financial institutions.  The Government's
existing undertaking to maintain at all times MIB3's long-term debt/equity
ratio within 10:1 adequately covers the need for continually strengthening
MIB's equity base in the future. As for financial prudence in handling
short-term commercial operations, BOK's reserve requirements (para. 4.33) and
the supervision exercised by the Superintendent of Banks are designed to
ensure that MIB, like other deposit banks, should at any time have sufficient
liquidity to service deposits.
4.37      In spite of the sharp increase in current liabilities, NIB's
liquidity ratio remains adequate at 1.1:1 at end-1976 and end-June 1977. A
conservative /1 estimate of the debt service cover for term borrowings shows
that it satisfactorily ranged from 1.1:1 to 1.2:1 over the past three years.
Earnings Performance
4.38      Income statements and indicators of financial performance
for the past three and a half years are shown in Annex 9. For 1976, the
latest year for which audited accounts are available, NIB's net profit
reached W 612 million, an increase of 18% over 1975, but slightly below the
level of 1974. It should be noted that in 1975 and 1976 MIB made substan-
tial provisions for bad debts of W 280 million and W 630 million respectively,
which sharply reduced the level of net income. At any rate MIB's profita-
bility is modest, reaching about 0.2% of average total assets in 1975 and
1976 and having declined from 7.7% of average equity in 1975 to 6.3%
in 1976 following the large increase in MIB's share capital.
4.39      MIB's low profitability is not attributable to an inadequate gross
spread, which in spite of a slight decline from 4.4% in 1974-75 to 3.9% in
1976 remains in line with the spread received by other government-owned
banking institutions in Korea. In fact, MIB's gross income from loans,
whether expressed in terms of average total assets or as a percentage of the
average loan portfolio, has increased sizeably over the past two years,/2 but
/1 Excluding collections of term working capital loans.
/2 From 11.1% in 1974 to 11.9% in 1976 as a percentage of average total
assets and from 12.8% to 14.6% as a percentage of the average loan
portfolio.



- 34 -
this increase was more than offset by a parallel increase in financial
expenses, with the result that MIB's spread has remained practically
unchanged. MIB's low profitability results from the high level of
administrative expenses, particularly salary expenditures, which in turn is
attributable to: (a) the wide range of nonprofit development-oriented
activities undertaken by MIB partly at the request of Government (e.g.
extension services to nonclient companies, assistance to Saemaeul projects,
issuance of import licenses, etc.); (b) the mobilization of petty savings
from small depositors through a costly nationwide network of branches and
deposit offices; and (c) the high overhead usually associated with lending to
small-scale enterprises. The level of MIB's administrative expenses compares
well with that of other nationwide deposit money banks in Korea.
Portfolio Quality and Provisions
4.40      MIB's portfolio is of unusually good quality considering that MIB
operates in the small business sector which is generally considered high-risk,
and given its large clientele./I As of June 30, 1977, total arrears of
principal and interest amounted to W 9.2 billion and represented 3.5% of the
total short and long-term outstanding portfolio, a level which has remained
practically unchanged over the past four years. Principal affected by arrears
stood at W 14.5 billion as of June 30, 1977, a slight increase in relative
terms over end-1974 from 4.4% of MIB's total portfolio to 5.5%. Owing to the
larger average size of term loans, the principal affected by arrears repre-
sented 11.4% of equipment loans and 2.8% of working capital loans outstanding.
Loans under litigation accounted for about 42% of the total principal in
arrears. Debt collection has been highly satisfactory, averaging 91.9% for
equipment loans and 99.3% for working capital loans in the past three years.
The excellent repayment record of MIIB's clients is partly attributable to the
strong performance of the Korean economy, particularly in the SMI sector, over
the past several years. Annexes 11, 12, and 13 show data on MIB's collection
performance and provide an analysis of loans in arrears.
4.41      Loan reschedulings are kept under tight control by MIB's management.
On an annual basis, the principal of equipment loans rescheduled accounted
for only about 1% of total equipment loans outstanding, and no equipment
loan in MIB's portfolio has been rescheduled more than once. The incidence
of reschedulings is higher for working capital loans, but this reflects the
practice of rollover of loans, which is common in commercial banking.
Working capital loans rescheduled during 1976 represented 46% of the year-end
outstanding amount. It is, however, more appropriate to relate reschedulings
of working capital loans to commitments during the year; the resulting ratio
of 6.1% is low. Write-offs have been negligible over the past four years,
except in 1976 when they reached W 605 million, or about 0.3% of total
outstanding portfolio and 1.7% of MIB's total expenses during that year,
which was still moderate.
/1  As of June 30, 1977, MIB's portfolio consisted of over 40,000 accounts
outstanding with some 15,000 clients.



- 35 -
4.42      Reserves and provisions have remained at about 1.9% of MIB's
total portfolio over the past four years but reserves and retained earnings
alone account for 95% of the total. Its accumuLated provisions for doubtful
accounts have so far enabled MIB to cover write-offs without having to
reduce its net worth, but provisions accounted for less than 0.1% of the
total outstanding portfolio at end-June 1977. in 1975, NIB started to make
provisions exceeding actual write-offs in accordance with the agreements
reached with the Bank at the time of appraisal of Loan 1175-KO. NIB further
undertook during negotiations of the proposed second loan to instruct the
external auditors to certify the adequacy of the provisions for bad debts in
their audit report for the year 1977 and thereafter based on the auditors'
review of NIB's portfolio arrears.
Terms and Conditions of Lending
4.43      The lending rates charged by MIB are not set independently by
MIB's Board, but are regulated by the Government through the Monetary
Board and apply to all banking and financial institutions. On the domestic
currency side, the complex interest rate structure which prevailed through
the early seventies has gradually been simplified. A dual rate system still
exists with, on the one hand, the "general lending rates" which apply to
the operations financed by MIB's own funds, also called banking funds
(deposits and equity), and "preferential lending rates" which, on the other
hand, are applicable to priority projects financed from governmental budgetary
allocations or lines of credit. The "general Lending rates" stand since
July 1, 1977 at 16% for prime enterprises and 17% for other enterprises in the
case of equipment loans; for working capital loans the rates applicable are
17% and 18% respectively. "Preferential lending rates" apply to NIE loans
and loans for export industries, both of which are funded by BOK and carry an
interest of 13% p.a. and 8% p.a. respectively. Loans for SMI cooperatives
and for the modernization of export-oriented SAI are funded by a mix of
governmental budgetary resources and MIB's own funds, and carry interest
rates ranging from 13% to 13.5%. To the extent that MIB finances such
projects with its own resources (which could otherwise be lent at an average
of 17%), it receives from the Government an interest subsidy of 3.5% to 4%.
On the foreign currency side, MIB normally on-lends the funds with a spread
of two percentage points above its own borrowing rate and passes on the
foreign exchange risk to its subborrowers. The weighted /1 average interest
rate payable on MIB's outstanding domestic and foreign currency borrowings
was about 10.1% as of June 30, 1977 which compares with a weighted average
lending rate of 15.2% for its outstanding portfolio. The average 5% interest
f spread on MIB's borrowings is adequate.  Maximum maturities on MIB's subloans
do not normally exceed 14 years for foreign ciiEency loans, 8 years for
domestic currency equipment loans and 3 years for working capital loans.
Audit
4.44      MIB's accounts have been audited since 1965 by Chong Un Accounting
Company, a Korean firm asdbciated with Touche Ross & Co.  Both in 1975 and
/1 Weighted by outstanding amounts at end-June 1977.



- 36 -
1976, the auditors issued a qualified opinion, pointing out that their
interpretation of the implications of MIB's retirement plan showed that
the employees' retirement liability had been underestimated. This,
however, represented a minor qualification. Other aspects of MIB's accounts
were found satisfactory. MIB has since, with the Bank's consent, appointed
as its auditors for the year 1977, San Kyong & Co., a company well-known to
the Bank. In discussions with San Kyong's representative, the appraisal
mission requested that the long form audit report for 1977 specifically
address the question of the retirement liability and include a judgment by
the auditors on the adequacy of provisions for bad debts based on a review of
MIB's accounts in arrears./l MIB's concurrence with this request was
confirmed during negotiations.
Resources
4.45      Domestic Currency Resources.  NIB's resource position as of
June 30, 1977 is shown in Annexes 14 and 15. Total domestic currency
resources amounted to W 300.2 billion (US$619 million equivalent); deposits
amounted to W 240.7 billion, over 80% of the total, while equity and borrow-
ings (from the Government and BOK /2) accounted for 6% and 14% respectively.
W 116.3 billion or 39% of MIB's total domestic currency resources were
long-term, of which savings deposits (with maturities exceeding one year)
accounted for 62%. Short-term deposits accounted for 92% of MIB's total
short-term resources of W 183.9 billion.
4.46      Foreign Currency.  The MIB Act was amended in 1964 to authorize
foreign currency term lending operations. NIB obtained its first line of
credit in foreign currency from KfW of Germany in 1965. By mid-1977, MIB
had raised, either directly or through the Government, a total of US$171.8 mil-
lion in foreign currency consisting of US$7 million from USAID, US$9.6 mil-
lion from KfW, US$40.2 million from the Export-Import Bank and OECF of
Japan, US$85 million from ADB (four loans) /3 and US$30 million under the
first IBRD Loan No. 1175-KO. In addition, the Government has made available
to MIB foreign currency funds amounting to US$1.7 million in 1976 and US$5 mil-
lion in 1977 thus bringing MIB's cumulative foreign currency resources
since 1965 to a total of US$178.5 million. The US$1.7 million amount was
/1   A review of each account in arrears is feasible if limited to equipment
loans. Provisions for working capital loans can be based on past write-off
experience.
/2   MIB receives from BOK (a) short-term funds to cover its commercial
banking operations (essentialy discounting of bills); and (b) long-
term funds such as NIF borrowings. IRF borrowings which MIB received
until 1975 were channeled through KDB.
/3   ADB started lending to MIB in 1969; the fourth loan of US$30 million
became effective in April 1977.



- 37 -
part of a US$6 million line of credit made available to MIB for promoting
export-oriented projects of which US$4.3 million was used to finance commercial
imports of raw materials, (these funds were part of a US$200 million foreign
commercial loan raised by the Korean Government in 1976.) The US$5 million
line of credit may, to a limited extent, be used for financing raw material
imports as well, but is used by MIB for financing equipment imports since it
carries a maximum term of eight years. The latter line of credit is part of
the so-called "Korea Foreign Exchange" (KFX) financing scheme sponsored by
the Ministry of Finance and funded from the foreign exchange reserves of the
Central Bank (BOK). It is expected that a total of US$500 million will be
allocated over the year 1977 primarily to domestic banks dealing in foreign
exchange for on-lending to large /1 industrial borrowers at a rate of LIBOR +
1.75%./2 By making substantial foreign exchange resources available at
a relatively low cost to firms which would otherwise rely on foreign commer-
cial sources, pressure is indirectly being exerted to lower the interest
rates at which Korean enterprises borrow on the Euro-dollar market to a
comparable level. NIB does not deal with large enterprises borrowing on the
foreign capital markets /3, and its participation in that scheme is largely
a reflection of the Government's concern to increase its assistance to the
SMI sector. Additional KFX funds are expected to be allocated to MIB in 1977
and in the future as the need arises.
4.47       As of June 30, 1977, NIB had foreign currency resources available
for future commitments amounting to US$38.6 million. The fourth ADB credit
line accounted for most of it (US$29.6 million) while the balance of Bank
Loan No. 1175-KO and KFX funds amounted to US$4. 6 million and US$4.2 million
respectively.
D. Prospects and Resource Requirements
Business Projections
4.48      MIB's disbursements of equipment loans accounted for approximately
23% of total expenditures on fixed assets in the SMI sector over the past
three years. MIB has projected its future operations for the five-year period
1977-81 (Annex 16) on the basis of the following assumptions: (a) SMI
fixed investment would increase in current terms by 15% p.a. (or 8% in real
/1  Subloans of up to US$20 million are authorized under this scheme.
/2   LIBOR + 2% including a guarantee fee of 0.25%.
/3   Lending conditions are different in the case of MIB, e.g. the maximum
loan amount is US$500,000 and terms are slightly longer (eight years
including three years grace). The lending rate, however, is the same.



- 38 -
terms assuming an inflation rate of 7% p.a.), the same as the growth rate for
investment in the overall manufacturing sector projected in the Fourth
Five-Year Plan; (b) MIB's share in the financing of SMI fixed investment
would gradually rise from 23% for 1974-76 to 25% in 1977, 27% in 1979 and 33%
by 1981; and (c) the proportion of MIB's foreign currency lending in relation
to its total equipment (term) financing would gradually decline from 42% for
1974-76 to 40% in 1978 and 37% by 1981, reflecting the steady development of
the domestic machinery industry and the resulting increased availability of
domestic capital goods. It is expected that, in line with the Government's
new emphasis on SMI development, adequate domestic currency financial resources
will be made available by the Government (from both budgetary allocations and
NIF funding) to MIB to enable it to achieve its projected volume of term
lending. In regard to working capital loans, MIB has projected for the same
1977-81 period a growth rate of 30% p.a. in net disbursements, which essentially
reflects: (a) the projected growth rate of MIB's deposits, based in turn on
MIB's actual deposit growth rate over the past five years; and (b) increased
short-term borrowings from BOK.
4.49      Total commitments of equipment loans are projected to increase
by 32% in 1977, a higher growth rate than the average 23% projected over
the following four-year period owing to the expanded scope of MIB's financ-
ing following the revision of the definition of SMI enterprises in January
1977 (para. 2.02) whereby manufacturing enterprises with up to 300 employees
(instead of 200 as has previously been the case) now qualify for MIB's finan-
cial assistance. Net commitments of working capital loans are forecast to
increase by an average annual rate of 30% over the 1977-81 period. Total
projected commitments would increase from an actual level of W 57.6 billion
(US$119 million) in 1976 /1 to W 195 billion (US$402 million) by 1981.
Equipment loans (in both foreign and domestic currencies), which accounted
for 56% of total commitments, would marginally decline to 51% by the end of
the five-year projection period. With its present and prospective staff
capacity, MIB should be able to achieve this projected volume of operations.
Resource Requirements
4.50      Domestic Currency Resource Position and Requirements.  MIB's cumula-
tive commitments of domestic currency loans are projected to reach a total of
W 540.6 billion (US$1,115 million) over the projection period 1977-81 consist-
ing of W 210.6 billion for equipment loans and W 330 billion for working
capital loans. As of December 31, 1976, total domestic currency resources
available for commitment amounted to W 20.7 billion of which W 8.3 billion
were short-term resources. MIB plans to raise a total of W 207.4 billion in
long-term domestic currency resources and W 367.5 billion in short-term
resources over the five-year period 1977-81 as follows:
/1 Including net increase in commitments of working capital loans.

4.51      Of the total W 207.4 billion term resources which MIB plans to
raise, an amount of W 90.4 billion or 44% is expected to be provided by the
Government consisting of: (a) W 21.9 billion /1 as additional contributions
to MIB's share capital; (b) budgetary allocations totaling W 16.4 billion;
and (c) W 52.1 billion through NIF borrowings. The level of financing which
MIB hopes to receive from the Government exceeds that of the past few
years but does not appear unrealistic considering the Government's intention
to enhance its financial assistance to Korean SMI, particularly through
MIB.
4.52      Foreign currency resources.  During the first half of 1977,
MIB committed only US$9.4 million (W 4.6 billion) out of total projected
commitments of US$36 million for 1977. The 1977 target, however, does not
appear unreasonable given that: (a) it represents a 29% increase over the
1976 commitments of foreign currency loans, which is in line with the
30% average annual growth rate of commitments over the period 1974-76;
(b) fixed assets investment in 1975 by SMI manufacturing enterprises
employing between 200 and 300 persons (the new limit of eligibility for
financing by MIB since January 1977) represented about 29% of total fixed
investment by enterprises employing less than 200 persons (the former
limit); and (c) MIB's uncommitted approvals of foreign currency loans
amounted to US$13.6 million as of June 30, 1977. Over the period July
1977-December 1981, total commitments of foreign currency loans are
expected to reach a total of US$261 million, an average of about US$58 mil-
lion per year. Table 4.15 shows that as of June 30, 1977, NIB had
foreign currency resources available for further commitment amounting to
US$38.6 million./2 In order to cover the projected level of operations,
MIB would therefore need to borrow about US$222 million. NIB hopes to
secure approximately US$200 million over that period by borrowing from the
Bank and ADB in alternative years. The balance is expected to be covered
by additional lines of credit to be made available by the Korean Government
under the KFX scheme (see para. 4.46).
Financial Forecasts
4.53      MIB's projected balance sheets, income statements and financial
ratios for the years 1977-81 are shown in Annexes 17, 18 and 19. Net
income is expected to increase from W 0.78 billion in 1977 (0.2% of
average total assets) to W 7.1 billion by 1981 (0.7% of average total
assets) which is probably an optimistic assumption.  While financial
expenses are expected to remain close to their 1976 level of 8% of average
/1   Of which W 5 billion have already been paid in by the Government
in early 1977.
/2   Approximately US$12 million would be left by end-1977, enough to cover
projected commitments in the first quarter of 1978 before the proposed
Bank loan comes on stream.



- 41 -
total assets, gross income would increase marginal:ly from 11.9% in 1976 to
12.4% by 1981 as balances of low interest yielding loans made in earlier
years decline. NIB's gross spread would consequently increase from about 4%
in 1976 to 4.5% in 1981. Administrative expenses are expected to remain at
their 1976 level of 3.5% to 3.6% of average total assets. With provisions
and income tax at about 0.1%, the increase in MIB's gross spread would result
in a parallel increase of net income from 0.2% of average total assets Ln
1976 to 0.7% in 1981.
4.54      The growth of MIB's net income is likely to prove more moderate
than is projected if, as is desirable, the annual level of provisions is
increased to provide for a gradual accumulation of provisions instead of
being based solely on projected write-offs for the following year. An under-
standing was reached in 1975 that, the excellent quality of its portfolio
notwithstanding, NIB would start accumulating provisions in accordance with
sound banking practice so as to enable it to write off bad debts without
having to deplete its equity in the event that, due to unforeseen circumstances,
bad debts were to exceed past historical levels. MIB has adhered to this
understanding over the past two years and its annual provisions exceedled the
level of actual write-offs.  Assurances were obtained from MIB at negot:-uctirns
that the adequacy of provisions for bad debts will be certified by its
external auditors in their annual audit report on MIB's accounts.
4.55      Total assets are forecast to increase from W 342.2 billion at
year-end 1974 to W 1,055 billion (over US$2 billion) in 1981, an average
growth rate of 25% p.a. NIB's total loan portfoliLo would also grow at an
average annual rate of 25% and therefore retain its 1976 level of about 70%
of total assets throughout the projection period. Equipment loans are
expected to marginally increase as a share of total assets from 22.2% in
1976 to 23.9% in 1981. The ratios of financial performance and structure
show a satisfactory and improving trend. NIB's l:lquidity position is
expected to improve, with the current ratio incre;asing from 1.12 in 1976 to
1.31 in 1981. The long-term debt/equity ratio which stood at 9.8:1 as of
end-1976 is expected to decline to 8.6:1 by end-1977 (as the result of the
W 5 billion increase in MIB's share capital earlier in the year) and to
further decline in 1978 and 1979 with additional cash subscriptions to MIB's
share capital by the Government. It would then increase in 1980/81 and reach
9.6:1 by end-1981 which would still be within the contractual limit of 10:1.
The debt service cover is expected to gradually improve from 1.2 in 1976 to
1.4 in 1981.
5. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Recommendation and Justification
5.01      MIB's performance in the past two years has been highly satisfac-
tory from both the institutional and developmental standpoints, generally
living up to the expectations set out by the Bank at the time it approved
its first loan to MIB. With its operational capaLbility, including its
satisfactory project appraisal and follow-up work, NIB is a particularly
suitable allocator of Bank resources to SMI enterprises in Korea. A new Bank
loan of $55 million is recommended, which is expetcted to cover slightly more



- 42 -
than one half of MIB's foreign currency commitments over a two-year period
1978-1979, with the balance to be met with additional borrowings from other
sources including the Asian Development Bank.
5.02      One specific and important objective under the first Bank loan
to MIB was to enable the Bank to assist small industrial projects in
Korea which, owing to their size, are not usually financed by the other two
financial intermediaries assisted by the Bank, namely KDFC and KDB.
This objective has, by and large, been achieved. For the 132 projects
financed by MIB under the first Bank loan, the average subloan size was
about US$210,000, the average cost of the projects financed US$0.4 million
and the average total assets of subborrowers US$0.6 million. By comparison,
the average size of KDFC's subloans in 1976 was about US$1.0 million, the
average cost of its projects US$3.0 million and the average total assets of
its subborrowers US$5.0 million. KDB's projects are generally comparable to,
or larger than, KDFC's. Apart from being much smaller, MIB's projects are
also considerably more labor-intensive than KDFC's and KDB's. The average
gross capital cost per job of the above-mentioned 132 NIB projects was
US$8,700, which was not substantially higher than the Bank's UPP threshold
for Korea of US$5,120 on the basis of 1976 prices. (By comparison, the
average gross capital cost per job for projects financed by KDFC in 1976 was
US$21,500). MIB's subprojects under the first Bank loan were also highly
export-oriented, with about 55% of their output expected to be sold on export
markets. Although MIB does not routinely calculate the economic rates of
return (ERR) of the projects it finances, an ex-ante calculation on a repre-
sentative sample of 20 projects approved by MIB in 1974 shows ERRs in excess
of 30% and financial rates of return in excess of 20% for a vast majority of
these projects.
5.03      The foregoing indicates that Bank funds put at MIB's disposal have
been allocated to industrial projects which are financially as well as
economically viable, especially in terms of export earnings and employment
generation. The projects to be financed under the proposed loan are expected
to achieve similar or greater financial and economic benefits. Lending to
MIB represents an efficient means of transferring Bank resources to Korea's
key industrial sector and enables the Bank, through a continuing relationship,
to deepen its institution-building impact on MIB which started in 1975 with
the first Bank loan.
Main Features of the Loan
5.04      Component for Financing Projects Addressing the Alleviation of
Urban Poverty. As noted in para. 5.02 and elsewhere in this report, MIB
has achieved satisfactory results in terms of allocating the proceeds of the
first Bank loan to small entrepreneurs and labor-intensive projects. It
is important that under the proposed loan MIB should continue or even inten-
sify its endeavor to reach smaller enterprises (in terms of total assets) and
finance more labor-intensive projects (as measured by the capital/labor
ratio). This would be consistent with both the Government's new emphasis on
small-scale enterprises and the Bank's objective of contributing to the
alleviation of poverty through the financing of labor-intensive investment
projects.



- 43 -
Toward that objective, it is recommended that a component of US$20 million
(or 36% of the proposed loan amount of US$55 million) be earmarked for
financing specifically: (a) projects which create employment at a gross
capital cost per job not greater than US$6,000; or (b) enterprises with
fixed assets not exceeding US$250,000. The proposed US$6,000 capital/labor
limit is slightly higher than the Bank's UPP threshold for Korea of US$5,120
on the basis of 1976 prices, but appears appropriate considering that MIB's
commitments under the proposed loan will take pFlace in 1978-1979 and taking
into account the inflation factor. The proposed US$250,000 fixed assets
ceiling coincides with that suggested for small-scale enterprise lending in
the recent Bank report entitled "Employment Creation and Small-Scale Enter-
prise Development" (No. 1543 dated March 22, 1977). Based on an analysis of
the available data on the 132 subprojects financed under the first Bank loan
(para. 5.02), MIB is expected, with a reasonabLe but not excessive effort on
its part, to be able to fully utilize the spec:Lal component as described
above.
5.05      Financing of Foreign Exchange Component of Domestic Equipment.
Aside from the financing of direct imports of machinery and equipment, it is
recommended that MIB be authorized to use the proceeds of the proposed loan
for financing the foreign exchange component of domestically manufactured
capital goods estimated at 60%. This authority should enhance MIB's potential
for financing smaller projects under the proposed loan in view of the fact
that such projects often require domestically produced, rather than imported,
capital goods.
5.06      Free Limit.  It is recommended that the free limit of US$0.5 mil-
lion, set under the previous Bank loan, be maintained. The maintenance of
the free limit does not imply any dissatisfaction with MIB's project appraisal
work which remains satisfactory. It rather reflects the recognition that the
previous free limit of US$0.5 million was on the high side, as evidenced by
the small number (3 out of 132) of projects above the free limit under the
first Bank loan.
5.07      Ceiling on Subloans and Size of Subborrowers.  Under the previous
Bank loan, a ceiling of US$1 million on individual subloans and a limit of
W 600 million on total assets of eligible sub'borrowers, were set. It is
recommended that these figures be raised respectively to US$1.5 million and
W 1 billion under the proposed loan (outside the special component referred
to in para. 5.04 above), to bring them in line with the Government's recent
decision increasing the total assets limit for borrowers eligible for MIB's
foreign exchange financing (para. 4.16), and to take into account the steady
expansion in the size of industrial projects/enterprises in Korea.
5.08      Debt/Equity Limit.  Under the first Bank loan, a limit of ten times
its equity was set on MIB's long-term debt, (with all government loans and all
deposits with maturity exceeding one year to be included in debt.) Furthermore,
the Government undertook specifically, (as recorded in the Guarantee Agreement),
to provide NIB with additional equity capital as needed in future to enable
MIB to keep its debt/equity ratio within the 10:1 limit (para. 4.35). It is
recommended that this debt/equity limit be maintained under the proposed
loan, and that the Government's undertaking as described above be recorded
again in the Guarantee Agreement.



- 44 -
5.09      Relending Rate.  MIB intends to relend the proceeds of the proposed
loan at a rate of 9.9%, which would give it an adequate spread of 2 percentage
points (assuming a Bank lending rate of 7.9%). The two percentage point
spread over MIB's own borrowing rate is in line with the practice of government-
owned development institutions such as NIB and KDB in relending the proceeds
of their borrowings from institutional sources (ADB, IBRD, et al.). The
spread is adequate to cover the cost associated with the processing of
foreign currency lending. The onlending rate to the subborrowers of about
10% p.a. represents a positive real rate of interest provided the Government
is able to maintain inflation at the rate of 7% p.a. projected in the Fourth
Five-Year Plan. Should the Government fail to achieve this objective and
inflation in Korea exceed present projections, adjustments of the won/dollar
exchange rate could be expected to take place which, considering that sub-
borrowers will bear the foreign exchange risk, would maintain the real
interest rate at a positive level. Over the period 1960-76, when inflation
ran at an average of 15% p.a. the depreciation of the won vis-a-vis the
dollar averaged 7% p.a.
5.10      Amortization Schedule.  As usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming sub-
stantially with the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the subloans made
by MIB. The loan is expected to be fully repaid within a period of 17 years
including a grace period of 3 years. The estimated disbursement schedule of
the loan is shown in Annex 22.
Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
5.11      During negotiations, the Bank reached agreement:
(a)  with the Government (recorded in the Guarantee Agreement) to
the effect that it will continue to provide MIB with additional
equity as needed in future to keep MIB's debt/equity ratio within
the 10:1 limit (para. 4.35);
(b) with MIB on:
(i) the maintenance of the long-term debt/equity limit at
10:1 (para. 4.35);
(ii) a component of US$20 million within the loan for financing
projects that would create employment at a gross capital cost
per job not greater than US$6,000, or for enterprises with fixed
assets not exceeding US$250,000 at the time of submission of
the loan application to MIB (para. 5.04);
(iii) a percentage of 60 representing the foreign exchange component
of domestically procured capital goods (para. 5.05);
(iv) the maintenance of the free limit at US$0.5 million (para. 5.06);
and
(v) a US$1.5 million ceiling on individual subloans and a limit of
W 1 billion on total assets of eligible borrowers (para. 5.07).

5.12      In addition, the following matters were reviewed with MIB at
negotiations:
(a) the objectives outlined by NIIB in its statement of Development Strategy
for 1978-79 (para. 4.10); and
(b) MIB's plans for establishing provisions for bad debts (para. 4.42).

KOREA
MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK
Policy Statement
(Adopted by Board of Policy on November 13. 1969
and Amended on May 30. 1974)
I. Economic Role
MIB shall assist in the economic development of Korea in
conformity with its purposes as stated in the Medium Industry Bank Act
and By-Laws and in accordance with the Government's plans, policies and
priorities. In order to accomplish this objective, MIB will promote the
development of privately controlled medium and small enterprises (as
defined from time to time by the Government of the Republic of Korea) in
the country by (i) providing various types of financial assistance to
them in the form of short-term credits for working capital purposes,
medium- and long-term loans, equity participation, guarantees and under-
writings; (ii) providing technical and managerial consulting services; and
(iii) undertaking promotional activities in the identification and develop-
ment of new projects.  The term "privately-controlled" enterprises will be
taken to mean enterprises which are privately operated and managed and in
which the controlling interest is held by private investors. The mere fact
that such enterprises have secured loans from government financial institu-
tions, or that the Government holds a minority equity position will not
exclude such enterprises from receiving financial assistance from MIB.
II. Development Policies
In extending its assistance NIB shall give preference to enter-
prises which will effectively contribute to broadening the base of the
national economy and improving the balance of payments. Priority will be
given to:
(a) Export industries as designated by the Government.
(b) Import-substitution industries and industries producing
raw materials necessary for export and import-substitution
industries.
(c) Specialized industries or industries ancillary to large
firms and machinery industries.
(d) Industries with potential for exports or import-substitution.
(e) Industries which will develop new products.
(f) Indigenous industries and industries which make use of labor
intensive technologies.

III. General Policies and Procedures
(a)  MIB will carry out its operations in accordance with sound
management and business principles and practices. It will
increase its operations in the field of development finance.
(b) MIB will extend financial assistance only for projects which
appear viable from economic, technical and financial points
of view.  MIB will pay special attention to the quality of the
management of the enterprise and to the market prospects of
the project.
(c) MIB may assist applicants in the preparation of project
applications and feasibility studies.
(d) NIIB will require eligible borrowers to finance a reasonable
portion of the total project cost from their own resources to
ensure that they have a reasonable stake in the projects
financed by MIB.
(e)  Borrowers must not be in arrears in the repayment of either
principal or interest on any existing loan.
(f) For the projects assisted by it, MIB will ensure availability
of all financial requirements, incLuding working capital, for
the successful implementation of the project.
(g) MIB will appropriately supervise tlhe use of its funds, the
progress of the project financed and the performance of the
enterprise so and to ensure that remedial action is promptly
taken when problems arise. WJhenever necessary, MIB will
endeavour to provide the necessary technical services to such
enterprises.
(h) MIB will determine the repayment period of loans, including
grace period, in accordance with the nature and the individual
circumstances of the project.
IV.        Financial Guidelines
(a) MIB will finance its medium- and long-term operations from
its long-term resources and it shall endeavour to diversify its
investments in terms of the type of industries, the location of
such industries and the type of financing.
(b) MIB will not seek to control any of the enterprises in which
it has invested nor will it participate in the management of
such enterprises except for the purpose of safeguarding its
interest.



ANNEX 20
Page 3
(c) In accordance with sound banking practices, MIB will secure
its loans and guarantees with appropriate collateral from
its client; but MIB will have due regard to its developmental
functions in the Korean economy. In making investments in
equity participations and in underwriting stocks and debentures
of its clients, MIB will be guided by considerations of technical
feasibility, financial viability and economic justification of
the projects and enterprises so assisted.
(d) MIB will not subscribe to stocks in excess of its unimpaired
paid-up capital, legal reserves and surplus. As a rule, MIB's
equity participation in any single enterprise shall not exceed
25% of the paid-in capital stock of an enterprise. MIB's equity
investment shall serve mainly as a catalytic agent for the
establishment of new enterprises and MIB will endeavour to
dispose of such equity investments as soon as this becomes
feasible at a fair price.
(e) MIB's total commitments in any one single enterprise in whatever
form, i.e. loans, equity participation, guarantees or a combination
thereof, will normally not exceed 25% of the sum of its unimpaired
paid-in capital, legal reserves and surplus.
(f)  In general, HIB's total commitments in any one single enterprise
will not exceed 60% of the total assets of the enterprise
including MIB's own investments. Exceptions to the above may be
made in respect to MIB's financing of small and medium industry
cooperatives, local governments and nonprofit seeking corporations.
V.    Accounting
(a) MIB will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect its
business operations and affairs in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and standards.
(b) MIB will engage a qualified and independent public accountant
to audit its books and financial statements every year.
VI.   Provisions and Reserves
(a) MIB will annually make appropriate allocations to a provision
for the protection against bad debts and investments until such
provision equals 10% of MIB's portfolio.
(b) MIB will allocate at least 25% of its annual net profits to a
reserve fund until such a reserve fund reaches a sum equal to
its paid-up capital.

In parallel with the projected expansion of its financing
operations in the two-year period 1978/79, MIB will endeavour to further
enhance its impact on the Small and Medium Industry (SMI) Sector through
the implementation of some of the developmental objectives outlined below.
(a) Notwithstanding the recent upward revision of the official
definition of SMI enterprises eligible for MIB's financing, it is
MIB's policy and intention, apart from financing medium-sized
enterprises (as presently redefined), to make special efforts to
seek out and assist an increasing number of small enterprises (in
terms of total assets) and labor intensive projects (in terms of
the labor/capital ratio). This emphasis on financing small,
labor intensive projects will apply to the use by MIB of IBRD
resources as well as its other resources.
(b) As it has done since 1975, MIB will continue to gradually
increase the proportion of its financing to areas outside metro-
politan Seoul and Pusan. It is intended that such proportion
would be below 50% for the 1978/79 period. One specific objective
of this geographic dispersal is to achieve the transfer of- excess
manpower from rural areas to small factories located in nearby
small towns.
(c) MIB will continue to intensify its assistance to small rural
industries within the Saemaul Program.
(d)  MIB will reexamine its role, methods and means for providing
appropriate extension services (technical, managerial) to SMI
enterprises, within the context of the general study on Korean
SMI and on extension services which the Government is planning
to undertake in the near future.
(e) MIB will intensify its research activities, with particular
emphasis on feasibility studies and market studies for selected
SMI activities.
