The principal objectives of the\n            Fourth Power Project were to: (a) assist the Egyptian\n            Electricity Authority (EEA) in alleviating power shortages;\n            (b) meet growing demand for electricity; (c) improve the\n            efficiency of the existing power plants; (d) transfer\n            technology related to installation and operation of\n            high-efficiency combined-cycle power plants; (e) help\n            strengthen EEA by improving accounting, management\n            information systems (MIS). The principal objectives of the\n            Kureimat Power Project were similar to those for the Fourth\n            Power Project. Overall, Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory. The overall performance of EEA was\n            satisfactory, particularly with regard to the physical\n            implementation of the projects. The economic goals of the\n            projects have not been achieved, but the physical objectives\n            have for the most part been achieved. Key Lessons Learned:\n            First, facilitating financial reforms in public utilities\n            through sector reforms would be more effective than the\n            standard financial covenants adopted by the Bank; Second,\n            improving project risk analysis and management during\n            project appraisal and adapting covenants to evolving\n            conditions would minimize the risk of, if not completely\n            avoid, project suspension/cancellation; Third, clearly\n            ranking and prioritizing project objectives and identifying\n            development impact indicators and project performance\n            monitoring indicators would improve the management and\n            implementation of projects; Fourth, for large-scale projects\n            with significant co-financier/donor involvement, the Bank\n            should have a common policy agreement with the financing\n            partners and with the client."}, "docdt": "1997-02-05T15:38:01Z"}
