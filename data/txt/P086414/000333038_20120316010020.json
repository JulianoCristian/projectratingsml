satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: impact of\n            compliance with the negative pledge clause: This process\n            required a careful and lengthy preparation of the security\n            package by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited\n            (POWERGRID) which delayed loan effectiveness by about six\n            months (July 31 to December 15, 2006). It would have been\n            useful to resolve this aspect earlier during preparation so\n            that implementation could proceed according to the planned\n            timeline. This is a broader lesson for the India portfolio.\n            However, the resolution of this issue and experience gained\n            during the approval process resulted in the streamlining of\n            the approval of PSDP IV and V by the World Bank. Using\n            operational and project management experience, POWERGRID has\n            effectively contributed to the success of the project.\n            Moreover, this project has shown that continuous reviews and\n            improvements of POWERGRID's technical implementation,\n            procurement and safeguards systems have elevated the\n            standards to be followed by others. Procurement is a\n            delicate matter and with its overlapping synergies with the\n            technical aspects, it is always a tough and contentious\n            issue. Thus, even though there was a regular communication\n            (both formal and informal) between POWERGRID and the Bank\n            during the entire project period, an additional exchange\n            forum, which could be in the form of regular face-to-face\n            meetings, between the Bank and POWERGRID to discuss such\n            complex matters in even more detail shall help in future engagements."}, "docdt": "2012-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
