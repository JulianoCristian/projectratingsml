The Project would support\n            POWERGRID's investment program of system strengthening\n            in the various regions and developing inter-regional\n            transmission links to enhance the power exchange capacities,\n            eventually helping enhance the national power grid. There\n            are two project components. Component A, transmission system\n            strengthening schemes, includes strengthening of the intra\n            and inter-regional transmission systems for greater energy\n            security, system reliability and to enhance inter-regional\n            power exchanges. Technical assistance will be considered for\n            enhancing inter-regional power exchange capacities and\n            building a data base of the system. Component B, completion\n            of balance works of the PSDP-I1 project, finances the\n            completion of some of the investment schemes financed under\n            the Second Power System Development Project (loan 4603-IN,\n            report no. 21609) after its closing date."}, "docdt": "2005-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
