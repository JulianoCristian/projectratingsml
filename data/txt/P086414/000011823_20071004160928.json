Expected negative environmental impacts can\n            be mitigated as follows: Avoid affecting natural and\n            socio-cultural resources by carefully selecting routes using\n            techniques/tools like GIS and GPS aerial photography. Obtain\n            prior approval and have forestry department supervise when\n            passing transmission lines through forest and protected\n            areas. Provide construction crews with fuel wood or\n            alternative fuels to minimize fuel collecting. Pay\n            compensation for crop damage or other damage to farmland,\n            and restore on-farm works after construction ends. Reroute\n            telecom circuits, convert overhead telecom circuits into\n            cables, etc. to minimize voltage interference. Maintain\n            adequate clearance between transmission lines and railways,\n            civil aviation, and defense installations. Paint airport\n            towers beyond specified height for easy visibility and place\n            warning lights on top of these towers. Where drainage is\n            affected, train flow and guide it to safe zones. Adopt\n            safety measures to avoid fires due to flashover from lines.\n            Resurface the areas where excavation works are done. Restore\n            surfaces with topsoil. Select dumping areas to for rocky\n            material and use as fill for tower foundations. Plant trees\n            along roads to buffer visual effect. Paint towers to blend\n            into background. Provide sound and vibration dampers, and\n            maintain equipment to reduce noise. Reduce nuisance to\n            nearby properties by using tractors and manual labor.\n            Execute work during light traffic periods. Avoid rainy\n            season, cut and fill slopes, use retaining walls, and sow\n            soil-binding grasses to control erosion. Protect worker\n            health and safety.
