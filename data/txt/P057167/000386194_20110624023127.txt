                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
        In support of the Zambia Technical Education Vocational and Entrepreneurship
Training Development Support Program (TDP), an IDA Credit (Cr. 3521-ZA) in the
amount of SDR 19.5 million (US$ 25 million equivalent) was approved on June 14th,
2001, and became effective on February 13th, 2002. This Credit represented 26 percent
of the estimated US$ 95 million total program costs at appraisal, to be co-financed by the
Government of the Republic of Zambia, the Netherlands, DANIDA and GTZ. The credit
closed on December 30th, 2008, after a two-year extension, having disbursed 96 percent
of the original commitment.

        This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the performance of the
TDP as a whole and the performance of the Bank in supporting the program. It is based
on reviews of the Implementation Completion Report, the Project Appraisal Document,
legal documents, and project files; on discussions with Bank staff involved with the
project, and on interviews with relevant stakeholders – government officials, NGOs,
donor partners, private sector representatives – and visits to training institutions, during a
mission to Zambia in January 2011. The mission appreciated the courtesies given by the
Ministry of Science, Technology and Vocational Training and by TEVETA.

        The evaluation was undertaken to provide input to IEG’s upcoming evaluation of
the World Bank’s support to skills development and youth employment. It also provides
lessons for governments and donors attempting major reform of the TVET sector – from
supply-driven to demand-driven provision of training – particularly in countries with a
large informal sector and limited experience of public-private partnerships.

      Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
relevant government officials and agencies for their review and feedback. Their
comments are presented in Annex E.

Summary
         This document reviews the performance of the Zambia Technical Education
Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Development Program (TDP) and the
performance of the World Bank in supporting the TDP through an IDA Credit (Credit
3521-ZA), approved in June 2001. The objectives of the TDP were to create a high-
quality, sustainable, demand-driven and equitable training system capable of improving
skills in both the formal and informal sectors of the economy.

        As in many African countries and in other parts of the world, Zambia’s traditional
TVET system had comprised a network of centrally funded and managed institutions,
primarily taking sixteen to eighteen-year olds straight from school into full-time (often
boarding) vocational courses of one to three years. Typically, the high capital and
recurrent costs of this type of training, combined with lack of incentives to innovate, led
to progressive deterioration of buildings and equipment, the use of outdated machinery,
materials, curricula and teaching methods, and a scarcity of well-qualified instructors
with industry experience. Such systems showed mixed to poor results in the employment
and incomes of graduates. They were unable to respond flexibly to changing technology
and labor market conditions, ill-suited to reaching the informal sector or meeting in-
service training needs, and too expensive to sustain. Policy for the sector has thus shifted
internationally towards institutional reforms that can help orient training to employment
needs and diversify both the forms of training and the sources of funding.

         In this context, the TDP was designed to support an ambitious transformation of
Zambia’s TVET system, involving a comprehensive package of reforms: granting
financial and managerial autonomy to the publicly-owned training institutions under
management boards; establishing an autonomous national training authority (TEVETA)
responsible for regulation and quality assurance; financing training in all types of training
institutions through a competitive fund (TEVET Fund) to be managed by TEVETA; and
diversifying sources of funding through cost recovery (student fees) and a proposed
payroll levy on enterprises. Implementation authority for TVET would be devolved from
central government to the new training authority and training institutions, while the role
of the line ministry (MSTVT) would shift to information management, policy
formulation and change management. The new Technical Education Vocational and
Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET) Policy, which the TDP was designed to support,
explicitly incorporated entrepreneurship and other training for the informal sector and
covered all types of training in private and NGO as well as government-owned training
institutions.

        To help finance transition of the system, the TDP was proposed to mobilize
additional external assistance. The principles of a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) were
followed in so far as the IDA Credit was combined with assistance from three other
external partners and government resources in an agreed common sector program of nine
components (costed at a total of US$95 million). However, the external partners adopted
different funding modalities and country systems were not used. The Netherlands and
IDA funds were managed by the line ministry (MSTVT) while DANIDA’s TEVET
                                           viii


Sector Program Support by-passed the ministry and was implemented directly with
TEVETA and with four individual training institutions. GTZ maintained its on-going
program with individual training institutions.

       The program objectives were highly relevant to Zambia’s economic and social
needs at the time of appraisal and remained relevant at closing of the IDA credit in
December 2008. Improving skills of the work force was considered to be critical to the
development priorities of economic diversification through improvement in productivity
and competitiveness in new sectors, and of inclusive growth which depended on raising
productivity and incomes in Zambia’s very large informal sector. The objectives,
however, were found to be excessively ambitious in relation to the allocated time and
resources and the available capacity.

        The TDP experienced substantial difficulties in implementation, attributed in part
to a lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities and insufficient consensus or
willingness to cooperate between the various parties involved in implementation and, in
particular, to delay in the legislation to allow establishment of the TEVET Fund. The
closing of the Credit was extended for two years to allow completion of many of the
planned outputs but still only allowed for two years of operation of the Fund.

        Program reporting and M&E were not strong, making it difficult to assess the
achievement of objectives. On the basis of available evidence, the TDP made
considerable progress towards raising the quality of the system, in particular through the
new quality assurance and curriculum development procedures implemented by
TEVETA, which could be expected to lead to improvements in the quality of training
over time. Also with the aim of improving quality, civil works and new equipment were
procured for training institutions, although some shortcomings were evident in needs
assessment and quality control. Progress was also made towards increasing the demand
orientation of training, by involving industry experts through TEVETA in setting
standards, reviewing curricula, and developing modular and in-service training capacity.
Other demand-relevant measures, including strengthening the influence of the private
sector through local management boards of training institutions, and the channeling of
government and private finance for training through the TEVET Fund, were not
successfully accomplished: management boards were established, with some delay, but
they had limited authority and did not take on an important role; and the TEVET Fund
was only briefly piloted with donor funding, without contribution from the government or
private sector. On the objective to create an equitable system, bursaries were awarded and
sector policies were developed for gender and HIV/AIDS; however, the available
information does not point to more than modest overall effect on equity of the system.
The TDP failed on its sustainability objective and the TEVET Fund ceased operation
when external funding ended.

         The broad objective of creating a system capable of improving skills for the
formal and informal sectors was only modestly achieved, as the TDP did not succeed in
establishing the relevant sector governance and financing framework. The intended
activities for sector information management, skills development strategy and policy
development were not accomplished. For the informal sector, training initiatives were
                                             ix


successfully piloted through the TEVET Fund, but over a shorter period and with less
funding than planned and these initiatives ceased when donor funding ended. Efficiency
was Modest due to delays and to wastage in some activities. Overall, the Outcome of the
TDP was thus Moderately Unsatisfactory.

         The Risk to Development Outcome is Substantial, due to failure to sustain
commitment to the reform policy or to secure financial sustainability. The initial proposal
of introducing a payroll levy to help finance the TEVET Fund was not followed up and
no alternative mechanism for private sector contributions was put forward. In the two
years following closure of the IDA Credit, government funding for the sector was not
channeled (as had been agreed) through the TEVET Fund which therefore ceased
operation. At the time of the PPAR mission in early 2011, the proposed autonomous
status of the ministry-affiliated training institutions was not fully implemented in practice
and their training operations continued to suffer from shortage and uncertainty of
funding. The mission found substantial disagreement among stakeholders on the best way
forward for these institutions: whether to revert fully to direct MSTVT funding and
management, or pass control fully to the management boards and TEVETA. On the
positive side, the capacity built in TEVETA had not been lost (with the exception of
TEVET Fund management where senior staff had to be let go). Although its operations
continued to be constrained by the uncertain financing and policy environment, TEVETA
had maintained its regulatory and quality assurance functions, and was developing new
initiatives in liaison with industry representatives towards a national qualifications
framework and a TEVET Learnership Scheme linking training providers and employers.

         Performance of the World Bank was Moderately Unsatisfactory, a major
shortcoming being underestimation of key risks: in particular, the challenge in sustaining
political will to implement difficult reforms; and the shortage of skills and capacity for
implementation. Insufficient attention was given during preparation to ensuring clarity in
institutional and implementation arrangements, and readiness for implementation. At
approval of the credit, the legal basis for the TEVET Fund had not been established; there
was no agreement or confidence concerning the proposed payroll levy or other
mechanism to secure sustainability of the Fund; and plans for M&E and capacity building
were insufficiently developed. During implementation, more support was needed from
the Bank team to M&E, planning for financial sustainability, and earlier revision of the
complex implementation arrangements. Borrower performance was variable. Strong
performance by TEVETA contrasted with lack of continuity in policy commitment,
inadequate M&E, and delays and deficiencies in annual budget plans, procurement and
reporting. On balance, Borrower Performance was Moderately Unsatisfactory.

       The experience of the Zambia TDP exemplifies the challenges in shifting the
TVET system from supply- to demand-driven provision of training in a country with little
experience in public-private partnerships and a large informal sector. Key lessons are:

Political Economy Challenges

      Design of TVET reform should be based on in-depth information and analysis of
       the relevant strength, perceptions, interests and incentives of different stakeholder
       groups.
      Before attempting nationwide implementation of radically new governance and
       financing arrangements in TVET, piloting should be considered and flexibility
       should be built into the plans.
      Clear definition of respective roles and responsibilities -- for the sector as a whole
       and in project or program implementation – is crucial for successful
       implementation of TVET reform.
      Devolving managerial authority for publicly-owned training institutions from
       central government to local management boards is liable to be de-railed by lack of
       sufficient autonomy, capacity building or financial resources.

TVET Financing

      A national training authority can provide a good base for a competitive fund
       channeling resources for training, so long as it is professionally managed and
       clearly independent from the provision of training.
      A competitive training fund under non-government management can be effective
       in addressing needs in the informal sector and for in-service training (as well as
       formal pre-employment training) but sustainability is a major challenge.
      The use of a payroll levy for the training sector is best suited for finance of in-
       service training and is difficult to apply in low-income countries or for the
       informal sector.

1. Background
1.1     After decades of declining standards of living, Zambia’s economy started growing
and per capita incomes started rising slowly in the late 1990s and strongly in the 2000s. Good
macroeconomic performance coupled with fast pace of growth in mining, construction,
telecommunications and tourism, helped spur GDP growth of 5.4 percent on average in
2001-2009. However, this growth did not translate into significant poverty reduction. In the
late 2000s, some 60 percent of the population were living below the poverty line (80 percent
in rural areas) and 37 percent considered to be in extreme poverty. With high rates of child
malnutrition and high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, Zambia had the lowest life expectancy in the
world in 2007.

1.2     Growing importance of the informal sector within total employment – to some 88
percent from the 2005 labour force survey (Table 1-1 below) – was related to the decline of
the copper mining industry during the 1990s, combined with the effects on other industries of
import liberalization. The mining sector, accounting for less than two percent of
employment, continued to dominate the formal economy (contributing two thirds of total
export revenue in 2005), despite vast potential for diversification. Of the employed
population in 2005, 72 percent were engaged in the agriculture sector (Table A-11) while 81
percent were either self-employed or unpaid family workers. Of the total labor force of some
5 million, unemployment in Zambia was estimated at 16 percent, youth unemployment close
to 25 percent (Table A-12), and under-employment of employed persons at 84 percent.

1.3     To accelerate growth and reduce poverty, Zambia’s strategic priorities are to promote
diversification by increasing national competitiveness and productivity in new sectors, and to
ensure that the informal and the rural economies – on which the majority of the population
depends for its livelihood – contribute meaningfully to overall growth. Strengthening human
resources, through broader access to higher quality education and training, is considered
crucial to addressing these priorities and realizing Zambia’s “Vision 2030” of becoming a
prosperous middle income nation within the next 20 years.

1.4      Zambia has been successful in rapidly expanding enrolments in all levels of education
and training over the last two decades. The emphasis has been on primary and basic
education – with the support of external donors including the World Bank through the Basic
Education Sub-Sector Investment Program – and Zambia is within reach of meeting the
Millennium Development Goal of ensuring that “by 2015, children everywhere, boys and
girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling.” Post-basic education
opportunities have also expanded but are still much scarcer: of children completing Grade 7
in the late 1990s, about one in five went on to complete Grade 12, and one in 22 was
                                                       2


admitted to a tertiary institution. TVET institutions accounted for just over half of the tertiary
admissions, the remainder admitted to one of Zambia’s two universities. However, the
expansion in education enrolments has not been adequately funded, resulting in a “low-cost,
low-quality” education system.1 Public funding to education fell substantially below
comparator countries and, within total education expenditure, the share to basic and
secondary schooling fell especially short (Table A-6).

1.5     The government has identified the shortage of skilled labor as a constraint to national
competitiveness, diversification, and equitable growth. Employers express concern that the
quality of secondary school graduates is poor, particularly in knowledge of math and science.
They also complain that TVET graduates lack relevant knowledge and skills: they have to
invest heavily themselves in their own training or re-training of workers and recruit
expatriates for many positions. Productivity in the informal sector is low overall and is
related to level of education: a recent study found that secondary education, in particular, had
a significant impact in raising productivity.2

1.6      Most TVET in Zambia is at the tertiary level. Zambia’s TVET system comprises
some 60 government-affiliated training institutions (TIs) of different types and more than 200
registered non-government TIs (Table 1-2 below). Twenty-three TIs – Technical Colleges
offering programs of up to three years, and Trades Training Institutes offering programs of
up to two years, mostly with boarding facilities – are affiliated with the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Vocational Training (MSTVT) and admit students selectively from grade 12
secondary school graduates. Prior to 1998, these were managed directly by the MSTVT and
their staff were on the government payroll. Overall quality was poor and deteriorating, due to
lack of funding for capital improvements and equipment, inadequate and uncertain funding
of recurrent costs, combined with outdated curricula and teaching methods, overstaffing, and
shortage of qualified instructors. Other ministries had also established TIs, some geared to
the needs of school drop outs as well as secondary graduates, and similarly under-resourced.
These include the Ministry of Education (Colleges of Continuing Education); the Ministry of
Community Development and Social Services; and the Ministry of Sport and Youth Services.

1.7     Total enrolments in registered TIs were reported at 22,564 in 2006, of which 9,304
were in MSTVT-affiliated TIs (Table A-8).3 Most TVET in Zambia is provided by non-
government providers (Table 1-2). These include: private for-profit training providers, a
rapidly growing sector, ranging from thriving modern institutions to small, opportunistic

   Zambia Education Public Expenditure Review, World Bank 2006. In 2004, government expenditure on
education, including TVET, amounted to 3.2 percent of GDP (compared with an average above 5 percent in
comparator countries in the region); education’s share of the public service wage bill, at only 26 percent, was
about half that found in comparator countries; and while comparator countries allocated an average of 75
percent of their total education expenditure to primary and secondary schooling, the share in Zambia was only
66 percent.

  Zambia Business Survey, 2010, found that secondary education of the firm’s owner had a statistically
significant positive impact in the productivity of Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises, while the impact of
TEVET or tertiary education was not significant and was smaller than in similar studies in other countries.

start-ups; industry-run or in-company training centers; and numerous NGO and faith-based
providers oriented to the needs of the poor and disadvantaged for informal sector jobs and
self employment as well as formal sector employment. There is also a hybrid category of TIs
formerly associated with parastatals and governed by boards of trustees. The number of
unregistered institutions in operation is unknown but thought to be substantial.

1.8     From the early 1990s, the government focused attention on the inadequacies of the
TVET sector which had been established to support the mining and former parastatal
industries and was not geared to the challenges that resulted from opening up of the Zambian
economy: growth of the informal sector; and the pressures of competition in the formal sector
whose skill needs were rapidly evolving. With assistance from DANIDA and the Netherlands
from 1994, and the World Bank and others from 1998, the government embarked on
reforming the skills training system. A new policy for the sector was approved in 1996, a
Strategy Paper in 1997, and a new Act in 1998.

1.9      The Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET) Policy
(1996) stated that the system needed to be highly responsive to employment patterns of the
economy. It aimed to address the needs of the informal as well as formal sectors, adding
entrepreneurship training as a core function, reflected in the name of the new policy.
Institutional and non-institutional training inside and outside of government establishments
would be recognized and encouraged. Toward those objectives, the organizational and
management structure for TEVET would be reviewed. In order to increase and diversify
sources of financing, a training fund would be established.

1.10 The TEVET Act of 1998 enabled the government ministries to appoint Management
Boards for government sponsored training institutions, assigning them some autonomy in
management functions including staffing and cost recovery. It also created a Technical
Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Authority (TEVETA) and specified its
functions (Box 1-1). The Act also transferred some responsibilities formerly carried out by
MSTVT to TEVETA and the boards of training institutions, but it did not describe the
residual responsibilities of MSTVT following the creation of Management Boards and
TEVETA. It also did not provide a legal basis for the proposed TEVET Fund, through which
public, private and external resources for training were to be channelled.

1.11 The TEVET Development Program (TDP) was proposed to mobilize additional
external assistance to help finance transition of the system. According to the program
implementation plan, the TEVET Act would be reviewed and amended by 2002, so that the
                                                          4


TEVET Fund would be operationalized by September 2002. The question of the feasibility of
introducing a payroll levy for sustainable financing of the Fund was deferred, on the grounds
that the private sector would be more willing to consider this when the TEVET Fund was
operating effectively and improvements had been demonstrated in the quality and relevance
of training.

Box 1-1. TEVET Legal Framework


The 1972 Act officially charged the Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training
(DTEVT) of the MSTVT with administration of TEVT in Zambia, providing for the department to
operate a centralized, publicly supported training system with the aim of producing specialists at the
crafts, technician and technologist levels for employment in the formal sector of the economy.
DTEVT was responsible for decisions on course offerings, curriculum and training modes, staffing
and student places, and for budgeting and administration of funding for salaries and other expenses in
the MSTVT institutions. The Act also made DTEVT responsible for registering and monitoring
private training providers and for training standards and certification throughout the country.
The 1998 Act, replacing the previous legislation, defined a more decentralized governance
framework. It established the Technical Education Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training
Authority (TEVETA) as an independent legal entity charged with regulating, monitoring and
coordinating TEVET in coordination with industry, employers, workers and other stakeholders. The
functions assigned to TEVETA included: advise the MSTVT on TEVET in Zambia; regulate and
advise Management Boards of publicly owned TIs; develop curricula; set standards; administer
examinations and trades tests; register and inspect both public and private TEVET institutions.
TEVETA was to be headed by a Director-General, reporting to the TEVETA Board composed of
government and non-government stakeholder representatives.
The Act also enabled MSTVT, in consultation with TEVETA, to establish legally autonomous
Management Boards of publicly-owned TIs, charged with providing training, developing curricula,
maintaining standards prescribed by TEVETA, staffing and compensation, administration, and cost
recovery through fees for tuition, boarding and other services. The principal of the TI would be
appointed by and accountable to the Management Board.
These provisions represented a radical change in TEVET governance, decentralizing decisions and
management to semi-autonomous entities, with the potential of developing new means and incentives
for quality improvement, efficiency and demand-responsiveness in the provision of training. What the
1998 Act did NOT do, however, was to define the revised, residual role (or closure) of DTEVT, when
most of its functions had been transferred to TEVETA, or to fully clarify the nature of autonomy of
TEVETA or the TI Management Boards. The MSTVT, with overall responsibility for the sector,
would appoint the members of the TEVETA Board, the TEVETA Director General, and members of
the TI Management Boards; MSTVT would also approve the terms and conditions of service for
TEVETA staff, and the charging of fees for tuition or other services by TI Management Boards.
The 1998 Act also did not allow for establishment of the proposed Training Fund under TEVETA.

1.12 The Government’s TDP Statement of Sector Policy (April 2001) built on the policy
and legal documents mentioned above. It says that “MSTVT will coordinate policy
formulation, monitor and evaluate the system, and provide financing to the system. The
autonomous training institutions, along with TEVETA, will be the main bodies implementing
                                                       5


TEVET.” Regarding financing: “Government is committed to giving the MSTVT training
institutions a grant to pay the salaries of their staff in the short term. In the long term,
MSTVT will finance TEVET through the TEVET Fund”. The TEVET Fund, to be located
within TEVETA, would be innovative in two important respects: (a) it would be accessible
competitively by private as well as public TEVET providers; (b) it would be “demand-
driven” in the sense that demonstrated success in labor market placement would be an
important criterion for courses to qualify for subsidization.

1.13 A joint appraisal of TDP by representatives of DANIDA, GTZ, the Netherlands, and
the World Bank took place in January 2001, resulting in a Joint Appraisal Report. The EU
and JICA also participated in some of the plenary meetings in Lusaka. According to its terms
of reference, the Joint Appraisal would provide directions for support “through the principles
of Sector Wide Approach (SWAP).” 4

1.14 The IDA Credit in support of TDP was approved in June 2001, and became effective
in February 2002.

2. Program Objectives and Design
Objectives
2.1     The objectives of the program as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
were “to develop a Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training
(TEVET) system that has the potential to improve skills for both the formal and informal
sectors of the economy through creating a high-quality, sustainable, demand-driven and
equitable training system.”

2.2     The objectives as stated in the legal agreement of the Credit (DCA) were phrased
differently: “The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in developing and carrying
out a technical education, vocational and entrepreneurship training (TEVET) program which
will create a high-quality, sustainable, demand-driven and equitable training system capable
of improving skills in both the formal and informal sectors of the economy.” This statement
in the DCA is used as the benchmark for evaluation in this PPAR as it is more evaluable.

Design
2.3   The objectives of the IDA Credit were the same as those of the overall TEVET
Program (TDP) which would be implemented through a partial form of Sector-Wide

4
  The World Bank defines the Sector-Wide Approach as “an approach to a locally-owned program for a
coherent sector in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, moving toward the use of country systems.
SWAps represent a …shift in the focus, relationship and behavior of donors and governments. They involve
high levels of donor and country coordination for the achievement of program goals, and can be financed
through parallel financing, pooled financing, general budget support, or a combination.‖ While the literature
offers a wide array of SWAp definitions, attributes, and interpretations, it is consistent in highlighting an
evolving partnership between governments and development partners (DPs), coalescing around their joint
support of nationally-defined programs and focused on results.” Do Health Sector-Wide Approaches Achieve
Results? IEG Working Paper, 2009.
                                             6


Approach. The approach met the definition of a SWAp in so far as external assistance to the
sector was combined with government funding in an agreed common program. The use of
country systems, however, was not considered feasible. External assistance from the four
partners would take two different forms: funding through MSTVT (IDA and the
Netherlands); and parallel programs with specific institutions (DANIDA and GTZ).

2.4    The IDA credit represented 26 percent of the estimated total TDP costs, to be
administered by MSTVT and applied to any of the program components on the basis of
annually agreed expenditure plans. The Netherlands would finance 15 percent through the
same modality. DANIDA, through its TEVET Sector Program Support, would contribute 16
percent through separate arrangements, by-passing the ministry and working directly with
TEVETA and four individual TIs. GTZ, also working independently through its on-going
programs with selected TIs, contributed two percent. The balance was accounted for by an
estimated 32 percent from the GRZ and Zambian non-government sources (including user
fees and industry), and a six percent “financing gap.”

2.5     As described in the appraisal document, the agreed common program comprised nine
components with estimated total costs of US$95 million (36 percent of which were recurrent
costs):

      Program management, including MSTVT recurrent costs (US$4.26 M): Support
       Project Steering Committee, Program Coordination Office with Coordinator and TA,
       and MSTVT program management functions.
      Financing of the TEVET system (US$15.3 M): Support design, establishment and
       administration of the Training Fund to pilot financing of pre-employment and
       employer-based training; TA team to run the Fund for the first ; build capacity of
       TEVETA to take on Fund operation within 3-4 years.
      Organization and management of the system (US$5.39 M): Strengthen capacity in
       MSTVT, TEVETA and TIs in their respective responsibilities: MSTVT for national
       sector policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation; TEVETA for examinations,
       standards and other quality-related issues; and TIs for implementation of the reforms
       at the ground level.
      Training systems, testing and examinations (US$2.15 M): Assist TEVETA and
       build its capacity to perform its functions more efficiently, including inspection and
       regulation of training providers, monitoring standards, establishing consultative
       relationship with TIs, working with TIs and industry in curriculum development,
       taking over administration of examinations, advising on selection of TIs for
       refurbishment and equipment.
      Entrepreneurship and informal sector training (US$4.38 M): Assistance through
       TEVETA to public and private TIs in developing and implementing innovative
       approaches to training services for the informal sector: short term skill upgrading,
       funding through intermediate institutions. TEVETA would supervise implementation
       and develop capacity but management and implementation would be entrusted to
       team of experts with operational autonomy. The private sector and other key players
       would be involved and activities would be outsources where possible.
                                               7


      Human resources development (US$6.37 M): Because of its importance, the
       government insisted on a separate component focused on capacity building. Each
       level of institution – MSTVT, TEVETA and TIs – would be assisted in developing
       decentralized HRD plans as part of a business plan.
      TEVET information system (US$1.14 M): Under responsibility of MSTVT, build
       information system to provide the information and analysis critical for policy making
       under the new sector governance/management arrangements. Assist each level of
       institution in establishing a relevant information system for monitoring at each level,
       establish program indicators and milestones, produce and disseminate accurate timely
       information, implement surveys, build capacity.
      Infrastructure and equipment (US$55.14 M): Support rehabilitation of TEVETA
       facilities, rehabilitation and provision of equipment and training materials to
       institutions that can demonstrate they are operating in a demand-driven manner.
       Criteria to be developed by the PSC and, over time, the functions would be taken over
       by the Training Fund.
      Gender, HIV/AIDS and cross-cutting issues (US$0.5 M): Support studies to
       analyze impact and introduce information on HIV/AIDS in training curricula and,
       with other stakeholders, support peer group meetings; support MSTVT efforts in the
       national effort to combat the virus, tapping funds from multi-sector program. Support
       development of gender strategic plan for the sector and establishment of focal persons
       on gender issues in MSTVT, TEVETA and TIs.

2.6     The complex institutional arrangements for implementation of the TDP components
are outlined in Annex Table A-13. The components were not structured to reflect either the
respective statutory accountabilities of different institutions for TEVET implementation or
the different funding sources or modalities. Instead, with the objective of supporting
coordination and reporting across the different donor activities and implementing entities, a
Program Coordination Office (PCO) (with Coordinator, Financial Management Specialist,
Procurement Specialist and M&E Specialist) would be set up on a temporary basis (despite
concerns expressed by some of the partners that such “parallel” arrangements would not
support the necessary mainstream capacity building). In addition, a Coordinator would be
assigned for each program component.

3. Implementation
Implementation Experience
3.1      Implementation was subject to serious initial delays and was rated unsatisfactory by
the World Bank from 2003 to 2005. Following a Joint Review whose recommendations were
adopted in mid-2004, and a two-year extension of the closing date to December 2008,
somewhat better progress was made in the last two to three years of implementation. The
slow and difficult progress was attributed primarily to the complex and inappropriate
institutional framework for implementation, compounded by frequent turnover of MSTVT
leadership (just from 2001-03 there were five different regular or acting Permanent
Secretaries of MSTVT).
                                              8


3.2      The first consolidated Annual Work Plan and Budget was approved in early 2002.
The PCO was staffed beginning in January 2002 with persons on 2-year contracts, and was
set up in a government office building apart from MSTVT and TEVETA. Processes for
procuring office equipment, tools, and workshop equipment, for civil works rehabilitation,
and for recruiting consulting firms for various consultancies, got under way. But progress
was slow and contentious and cooperating partners became concerned that the Program was
underperforming in expenditure terms. In 2002, the rate of expenditure from the approved
annual plan of IDA and Netherlands funds controlled by the PCO was only 13 percent. For
the first nine months of 2003, the expenditure of IDA/Netherlands funds was only 16 percent
of the approved full-year amount. The ratio of actual expenditure to budgets under the
DANIDA assistance was better, but still below 50 percent. At the same time, key institutional
reform activities were lagging. Attempts to recruit consultants for the planned consulting task
on review of the TEVET Act were unsuccessful and the consultancy on establishment of the
TEVET Fund lagged behind the original timetable, with a contract awarded only in June
2003.

3.3     These bottlenecks in TDP implementation were attributed in large part to confusion
concerning roles and responsibilities, leading to tensions between MSTVT, the PCO, and
TEVETA. Some degree of resistance would be inevitable on the part of parent-ministry staff
in releasing control of longstanding functions to as-yet unproven and semi-autonomous
entities (TEVETA, and the boards of TIs that had until recently been managed directly by the
ministry). In this case, the tensions appear to have been exacerbated by duplications of roles
and lack of clear accountability for the implementation of specific activities and program
components. The administrative environment was further complicated by the creation of the
PCO. Donors perceived that the PCO was functioning in a semi-detached manner, similar to
a Project Implementation Unit, contrary to the principle that TDP functions would be carried
out to the maximum extent possible by the respective departments of MSTVT and TEVETA.
Also, a coordinator had been assigned for each program component but without sufficient
regard to matching the assignees to their respective established responsibilities in MSTVT
and TEVETA. Further, the disparity in compensation between MSTVT civil servants on the
one hand, and TEVETA and the PCO on the other hand, was reported to be de-motivating
contributions from MSTVT civil servants.

3.4    The funding agencies proposed in 2003 that a “Joint Review” be carried out, and this
was agreed. The Review took place in November/December 2003, led by a Bank staff
education specialist, with thirteen people selected by five appointing agencies: MSTVT,
TEVETA, DANIDA, the Netherlands Embassy, and the Bank. A draft report was presented
to government stakeholders in December 2003, and the Joint Review Report was finalized in
2004. Major findings of the review were:

      Outputs: Implementation progress toward component outputs had lagged seriously
       behind plans for all components. Reasons included overambitious annual plans and
       budgets, insufficient administrative capacity, cumbersome approval and procurement
       procedures, and an insufficient assessment of the implications of the reform process.
      Outcomes: Very slow progress had been made toward achieving the Development
       Objectives of quality, sustainability, demand-responsiveness, and equity. (This
       assessment was based on site visits and interviews since many of the objective
                                               9


       indicators depended on setting up new M&E systems and on baseline data that were
       still not available.)
      Institutional issues: The TEVET Act did not provide sufficient clarity and the TDP
       administrative design compounded the lack of clarity. “Reluctance to cooperate” was
       found.
      Financial issues: Domestically-resourced government funding for TEVET had
       decreased substantially in real terms (to half the agreed level of 0.8 percent of
       discretionary expenditure). TEVETA was heavily financially dependent on DANIDA,
       with DANIDA funds being 73 percent of TEVETA’s income in 2002. Because of
       weaknesses in accounting and financial reporting, the true financial condition of the
       MSTVT-affiliated training institutions was not very clear, but many had fallen into
       arrears to suppliers and other creditors, and some were “technically insolvent”.
       Development of financial management capacity in beneficiary institutions had been
       neglected.

3.5     The Review made 33 recommendations, including dissolving of the PCO and
mainstreaming its staff and functions, some into MSTVT and others into TEVETA,
expediting revision of the TEVET Act to allow establishment of the TEVET Fund, and
clarifying the responsibilities of TEVETA. It was quickly agreed in principle that the PCO
would be dissolved. However, the process between MSTVT and TEVETA on the details of
mainstreaming absorbed several months. A joint response of MSTVT and TEVETA was
approved in June 2004. The agreed changes in administrative arrangements included
discontinuation of the title of Program Coordinator, a new Program Technical Committee
chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MSTVT, and the allocation of responsibilities for
“component coordination” between MSTVT and TEVETA in a way that reflected better their
respective established responsibilities.

3.6     The IDA DCA was amended in 2005: (i) to reflect the changes in implementation
responsibilities; (ii) to note agreed dates for covenants relating to revision of the TEVET Act;
and (iii) to cover the Operations Manual and financial management requirements for TEVET
Fund activities, as well as reallocating funds between categories. At this stage, the IDA credit
was 37 percent disbursed, primarily on Goods (such as tools, workshop equipment,
computers and other office equipment). The closing date was subsequently extended by two
years, to December 2008, to allow the remaining activities to be completed.

3.7    An amendment to the TEVET Act was passed in May 2005, allowing the TEVET
Fund to be established under the jurisdiction of TEVETA by late 2005; and the number of
TEVETA Board Members was reduced from the originally specified 22 to a more
manageable 11 with a majority of non-government members. The TEVET fund became fully
operational in 2006, disbursing through three windows for recurrent funding and one
investment funding window (Box 3-1).

3.8     Following the agreed changes in coordination arrangements and the establishment of
the TEVET Fund, progress and disbursements improved considerably from 2005-2008,
although implementation continued to be impeded to some extent by tensions between
MSTVT and TEVETA. It appears that MSTVT was reluctant to lose control over financing
of the MSTVT TIs to the TEVET Fund: government funds were not channelled through the
                                                 10


Fund; and when MSTVT TI proposals for significant infrastructure projects were approved
through Fund procedures, these were taken on and administered directly by MSTVT, on the
grounds that the size of contracts was beyond the TEVETA threshold. Continuity of external
financing was also a continuing issue affecting planning and implementation of activities. By
June 2004, the programs of assistance in the TEVET sector of EU, GTZ and JICA had all
been completed without being renewed. DANIDA financing, which had been crucial to the
development and on-going operation of TEVETA, was cut back and its program closed in
mid 2006. The Netherlands, which had suspended its disbursements (while remaining in the
policy dialogue) from mid-2004 to mid-2005 because of its disappointment with TDP
implementation, resumed its disbursements directly to TEVETA instead of through MSTVT.

3.9    Despite the constraints, by closing of the IDA credit in December 2008, the TDP had
implemented many of its planned activities, although with significant shortcomings in some
areas:

       Development and implementation by TEVETA of quality assurance procedures,
        registration, accreditation, certification, standards and curriculum review, were
        achieved.
       Equipment and tools were provided to approximately 120 public and private TIs,
        although some of the equipment remained unused due to lack of essential parts or
        appropriate facilities, the equipment that arrived did not always match the TIs needs,
        and quality problems were reported. Wastage was attributed to inadequate initial
        needs assessment and attention to specifications.
       Civil works were carried out in all 23 MSTVT TIs, although with significant
        shortcomings reported in some cases due to inadequate supervisions of works, while
        10 TIs also benefited from infrastructure/rehabilitation projects through the TEVET
        Fund.
       The TEVET Fund, albeit very late in the program and with reduced funding (Table
        A-4), developed transparent procedures and was successfully piloted, disbursing
        some US$4 million for pre-employment, in-service, informal sector training, and
        training of instructors, in public and private TIs, and infrastructure needs in MSTVT
        TIs, during its two years of operation (Box 3-1). There was no direct government
        contribution to the TEVET Fund at any stage, although the Treasury was reported to
        have released funds to MSTVT for this purpose in 2007.5
       TDP fell far short of its plans for the Organization and Management of TEVET
        component and for Information Systems: meetings were conducted of the National
        TEVET Stakeholders Consultative Forum but national skills development plans and
        sector policy reviews were not produced; twinning arrangements were not pursued;
        M&E outputs were few and of mostly poor quality; equipment and software were
        purchased and delivered to 14 TIs but the MSTVT had no functioning MIS when the
        IDA credit closed, despite the importance placed on this in the appraisal document.

       Capacity building activities, incorporated in every component (and often duplicated
        across components) were not well documented. Without an overarching plan, these
        activities appeared often to have been ad hoc and supply-driven.

 Box 3-1. Implementation of the TEVET Fund


 From 2006 to 2008, the Fund received 552 proposals from government and non-government TIs in
 response to its information dissemination and advertisements, of which 129 were approved, with
 total contract value of ZK 20,380 million (US$ equivalent approx. 4 million). Disbursements stood
 at ZK 14,757 at the end of 2008. The value of the approved contracts was distributed between four
 windows as follows:
 Window 1: 45%
 To finance pre-employment training, mainly of school-leavers, in formal training institutions.
 Window 2: 10%
 To subsidize in-service training in formal sector firms (proposed to be pilot-tested with external
 funds for scaling up when funds provided through the proposed private sector levy).
 Window 3: 22%
 To subsidize training for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and the informal sector.
 Window 4: 23% (of which 80% was for infrastructure)
 To support the investment needs of TIs (civil works, equipment, and staff development).
 MSTVT TIs were awarded about 60 percent of the total contracts value, two thirds of Window 1
 for pre-employment training, and almost all of Window 4 for investment needs. The high
 percentage for MSTVT TIs in contracts for pre-employment was explained by the shortage of
 competition from private sector providers in the identified priority fields (such as power electrical,
 mechanical fitting and sheet metalwork) especially at technician and technologist level.

3.10 By the end of 2008, disbursements by the main cooperating partners amounted to 97
percent for IDA, 40 percent for the Netherlands and 53 percent for DANIDA of the
respective commitments at appraisal (Table A-3). The breakdown of expenditures by
category or component is not available for the TDP as a whole. For IDA, comparing the
appraisal estimates with actual expenditures by component (Table A-1), more funds than
estimated were applied to MSTVT-related components and less to TEVETA: expenditure on
infrastructure and equipment (through MSTVT procedures), at US$8.28m., was more than
three times the original estimate; actual costs on the TEVET financing system and training
systems together amounted to US$6.7m., only 63 percent of the appraisal estimate. Similarly,
IDA actual disbursements by category (Table A-3) greatly exceeded the appraisal estimates
for goods and for operating costs, and fell far short on the category for training grants.
Essentially, with the delay until 2006 in operation of the TEVET Fund, the bulk of IDA
resources was administered through the traditional, centralized, supply-driven procedures
instead of through TEVETA and the TEVET Fund.
                                                    12


3.11 Government financing to the TDP (Table A-5) was some 40 percent below the
committed level until 2007 and 2008 (although above the very conservative estimate at
project appraisal). At closing of the credit, the government had agreed to pick up on
financing of the TEVET Fund until a sustainable alternative was in place to secure
contributions from the private sector. But the concept of a payroll levy was still not
considered workable and there were no concrete plans as to what the sustainable alternative
would be or how to develop it.

Developments since Closing of the Credit
3.12 The PPAR mission in January 2011 reviewed developments in the sector in the two
years since closing of the Credit. From available documents and interviews with
stakeholders, it appeared that the 1996 sector policy and related legislation had not been
consolidated in practice and that the issue of financial sustainability had still to be addressed.

3.13 From the perspective of some stakeholders, the disengagement of the Bank at the end
of 2008 was unduly abrupt, with no follow up on still unresolved policy and financing issues.
The role of MSTVT and the status of the MSTVT TIs6 remained ambiguous and contentious,
while the uncertainty of funding continued to impede planning and management of the
TEVET Fund. It was suggested that a terminal review, involving all stakeholders and higher
levels of government, might have helped to clarify the outstanding issues and identify options
on the way forward.

3.14 After the IDA Credit closed, operations of the TEVET Fund wound down. The
Netherlands extended its financing for a further six months, enabling some TEVET Fund
plans and commitments to be followed through. Still, there were instances where TIs had
been left without funding for the second year of a training program or instructors were unable
to complete their professional development courses. Most significantly, MSTVT had
declined to channel any funds from the government budget for TEVET through the TEVET
Fund, despite the agreement at closing of the IDA credit, and instead reverted to its own
budgets for each of the MSTVT TIs: TEVETA’s role in TEVET financing had been reduced
to that of a “post office,” disbursing subsidies to the MSTVT TIs on the instructions of the
MSTVT. Without any funds, the TEVET Fund was no longer operating and TEVETA had
had to let go the expert technical and financial staff who had managed it.

3.15 Within MSTVT, due to staff turnover, relatively few current officials had been
closely involved in TDP implementation. From the perspective of MSTVT staff, the main
benefits of TDP were seen to be in the quality of training through provision of badly needed
equipment and rehabilitation of TIs (although the opinion was expressed that it was a mistake
to have included non-government training providers in this program). The ministry continued
to play a hands-on role in managing and regulating its TIs, regulating the fees they can
charge to students, procuring goods and providing maintenance services, for example, as well
as budgeting their annual public subsidy and allocating bursaries.


6
 Strictly speaking, these are ex-MSTVT TIs, governed by their own management boards, but they are still
commonly referred to as MSTVT institutions
                                                    13


3.16 The 23 MSTVT TIs appeared to be in limbo, having lost the security of government
protection and civil service status without yet gaining the potential benefits of real autonomy.
Their management boards were reportedly not playing a significant role in most cases,
unclear when they could make decisions and when the ministry had to be consulted. They
were struggling with financing, depending primarily on student fees to meet training costs
and lacking funds for maintenance and capital expenses. The heads of TIs were divided on
the solution. Some argued for reverting to their original MSTVT status while others wanted
to see the policy fully implemented to allow a level playing field for all training providers,
passing control to TI management boards and TEVETA.

3.17 The TEVET quality assurance system embarked on through TDP had been sustained
and further developed. Although TEVETA’s operations were constrained by shortage of
funding, it was continuing with a staff of 40 to provide and develop its regulatory and
support services to all training providers, and to facilitate linkages between TIs and
employers. The TEVET Qualifications Framework was launched in 2010 as well as a new
Learnership Scheme whereby trainees or employees can gain recognized qualifications
through a combination of theoretical training in TIs and work experience. The TEVETA
Board was considered to be strong, providing a forum for collaboration across government
ministries with direct interest in the training sector as well as industry.

4. Achievement of Objectives
Efficacy
4.1    The achievements considered here are those of the TDP as a whole, in line with the
appraisal document and M&E framework which incorporates the contributions of the
government and four external partners (IDA, the Netherlands, Danida and GTZ) in a
common agreed program with shared objectives.7

OBJECTIVE 1: CREATE A HIGH QUALITY TRAINING SYSTEM (Substantial)

4.2     To achieve this objective, the TDP aimed to upgrade facilities and equipment in
public and private TIs, and to support TEVETA’s quality assurance functions, including
curriculum development, inspection and examinations.

4.3    Rehabilitation of physical infrastructure and the provision of training equipment and
materials were badly needed, following a period of serious underfunding of TIs, and the
program provided these for some 40 TIs. From interviews with 15 TIs, the TDP Terminal
Evaluation Report found very positive opinions concerning the benefits of this program for
the quality of training; and this view was expressed also to the PPAR mission. However,
shortcomings in needs assessment, specifications, and supervision of works were
documented in mission reports and also reported to the PPAR mission: in some cases the

7
  The PPAR mission found different perceptions among stakeholders concerning what exactly constituted the
TDP. In some cases, the TDP was referred to as the program with IDA and Netherlands, administered by
MSTVT, excluding the programs of DANIDA and GTZ which worked directly with TEVETA or individual
training institutions.
                                                      14


equipment delivered was found to be unused because it was inappropriate or lacked essential
parts, while the quality of tools was found to be substandard; some civil works projects also
failed to meet the required standards or were left incomplete.

4.4     Most significant from the point of view of the system as a whole, the quality
assurance system introduced standards and incentives for continuing improvement in the
quality of training in all TIs, through inspection and registration of institutions, certification
of instructors, curriculum development and examination procedures. The high targets (>90
percent) set at appraisal for annual inspection and registration of TIs were almost met. TDP
performance indicators tracked the migration of TIs between grades 1,2 and 3 under
TEVETA’s inspection and registration process and found a positive trend. More than 80
curricula were reviewed and revised by TEVETA with input from industry and concerned
ministries, backed by guidelines for competency-based modular training. A basis was
established for improving teaching standards, through the TI registration requirement for
certification of instructors. This was backed by finance through the TEVET Fund that
enabled more than 100 TI staff to complete the required qualification in modern teaching
methodology. This training was reported by recipients (in PPAR mission interviews) to be
highly useful but, once again, a systematic assessment of effectiveness was not available.

4.5     Overall, efficacy is rated Substantial on this objective, on the grounds that the new
quality assurance system and curriculum procedures can be expected – from experience
elsewhere – to lead to improvements over time in the quality of training across all types of
TIs. 8 Although a great deal remains to be done, the systems and procedures introduced
through TEVETA are important achievements and constitute an essential basis for a high
quality system.

OBJECTIVE 2: CREATE A SUSTAINABLE TRAINING SYSTEM (Negligible)

4.6     The TDP aimed to achieve this objective through establishment of the TEVET Fund,
to channel resources of the government, employers and donors; improving the attitude of
employers to contributing financially to TEVET; and increasing total resources to the sector
by maintaining the level of government funding and increasing funding from employers and
trainees.

4.7     On this objective, none of the relevant output or outcome indicators was met. Only
the trainees increased their contribution to training, through higher fees in the MSTVT TIs,
but comprehensive data on fees were not available. The government contribution declined (to
about half the agreed share of public expenditure) until 2007; this was increased at the end of
TDP, to compensate partially for external assistance, but these government funds were not

8
  As evidence of the achievement of TDP on its quality objective, the ICR cites the results of the 2008 tracer
study, which attempted to gauge the satisfaction of employers with the quality of 2004-2006 graduates of the
system. However, many of the TDP interventions had not started or were only just getting under way when
these students graduated. On the basis of this study, the relevant TDP key performance indicator – “60 percent
of industries surveyed annually express satisfaction with quality of human resources produced” – was
surpassed: 98 percent of employers found training to be relevant (this compared with 95 percent from a similar
study conducted in 2004) and 81percent were satisfied with the quality of training. However, aside from the
problem of timing, the information is of doubtful value due to methodological weaknesses of the study.
                                               15


channeled through the TEVET Fund which therefore ceased operation. Plans for the payroll
levy to help finance the TEVET Fund were not pursued and no alternative mechanism was
introduced for private sector contributions to sector financing. Despite successful piloting on
a small scale of the in-service training window of the TEVET Fund, there is no indication
that the attitudes of the private sector improved with respect to funding TEVET (a DCA
indicator that was not tracked in implementation reports).

4.8    As of 2010, external assistance to the sector had withdrawn from MSTVT and
TEVETA and was confined to small programs with individual TIs or industries. There
appeared to be limited national-level understanding of the TEVET reform strategy supported
by TDP and no consensus on the best way forward.

4.9    Efficacy on this objective is therefore rated Negligible.

OBJECTIVE 3: CREATE A DEMAND-DRIVEN TRAINING SYSTEM (Modest)

4.10 The TDP aimed to achieve this objective through (i) involving the private sector in
TEVETA management and operations; (ii) developing capacity in MSTVT for labor market
information management and strategic planning for skills development; and (iii) the
autonomy of government-owned TIs under local management boards, in competition with
other TIs for training funds. It succeeded only in the first of these. From the PAD, it also
aimed to raise the fees from trainees to at least 50 percent of the recurrent income in at least
50 percent of formal TIs, but this indicator does not appear to have been tracked and relevant
data on student fees were not reported at TDP closing.

4.11 The TEVETA Board, with non-government majority, has been chaired by a
representative of the private sector; TEVETA worked through private sector networks in
various functions, including developing the qualifications framework; industry practitioners
were incorporated in teams to define occupational standards and review curricula; and
technical assistance of TEVETA helped develop linkages between individual TIs and
employers for trainee work experience. These are important achievements that have proved
difficult to secure in other similar projects. However, no progress was made through TDP in
developing mechanisms for private sector financial contribution to training, through a payroll
levy or other means. The proposed activities for labor market information management were
not implemented and the intended National Skills Development Plan was not produced.
Management Boards of MSTVT TIs were appointed, with some delay, and included local
private sector representatives, but it seems that in most cases their engagement was not
strong because, in practice, the Boards lacked independence beyond routine decisions. A
competitive, demand-driven Training Fund, with its technical evaluation committee chaired
by a private sector representative, was successfully piloted on a limited scale with donor
resources, but not sustained when this funding closed.

4.12 In the TDP results framework, achievement of this objective was to be measured by
employment rates, and speed of finding employment, of recent graduates as measured by
tracer studies. By this measure, targets were close to being met: the 2008 tracer study
reported that 55 percent of 2004-2006 TEVET graduates found employment within six
months of graduation and 90 percent within a year (although this was a slight deterioration
                                                     16


from results of a similar study in 2004). A more specific and potentially more useful
indicator in the DCA and PAD -- “employability of TEVET graduates is better than a control
group of similar non-trainees” -- was not tracked in implementation or completion reports.
These indicators neglected the important question of whether the employed graduates were
working in a field related to their training: the tracer study reported that this was the case for
only 51 percent of males and 37 percent of females. But it is doubtful in any case that any
trends in graduate employment up to 2008 could be attributed directly to the TDP,
considering the late timing of TDP interventions and the role of other factors, such as the
relatively strong growth of the economy during the period of program implementation.

4.13 Efficacy on this objective is therefore rated Modest, on the basis of relevant
improvements in the system and not on employment results. The TDP made a good start in
increasing the influence of employer demand in the training system, through the role of
employers and the private sector in TEVETA management and operations, but it failed to
implement other crucial reforms.

OBJECTIVE 4: CREATE AN EQUITABLE TRAINING SYSTEM (Modest)

4.14 The TDP aimed to achieve this objective through the provision of bursaries to the
most vulnerable students, and through the development of national TEVET policies for
gender and HIV/AIDS.

4.15 The available evidence does not indicate that the TDP had more than a modest impact
on equity of the TEVET system. Data were not available on the relevant outcome indicator –
“share of TEVET graduates from socio-economically disadvantaged groups increase by 10
percent” – which was intended to be measured through the tracer study. Instead, this was
measured by the share of students allocated government bursaries (reported to reach 25
percent of students in MSTVT TIs in 2005) and, on this measure, the target was exceeded.
However, this is not a strong indicator of overall equity of the system, considering that (i)
under the TDP, the MSTVT TIs increased student fees; (ii) an assessment was not available
of the targeting efficiency of bursaries to students in ministry-affiliated TIs and stakeholders
have expressed skepticism;9 (iii) some 60 percent of the population of Zambia was defined as
below the poverty line; and (iv) the grade 12 graduates proposing themselves for selection
into MSTVT TIs and aiming for formal sector employment were thought rarely to be among
the most disadvantaged (although drop-out due to inability to pay the fees was found to be a
fairly common problem).

4.16 Improving equity of the system would have required specific efforts to strengthen
skills for the informal sector, which accounted for almost 90 percent of employment. Despite
its short period of operation, the TEVET Fund did make a start here, through its window for
financing training for SMEs and the informal sector (aside from its graduated subsidies to
students in identified priority formal programs). The Fund financed short courses targeting
economically marginalized groups, integrating core skills with entrepreneurship and business

9
 For example, the TDP Terminal Evaluation Report, from interviews with 15 TIs, found particularly negative
opinions concerning TDP performance on its equity objective and admissions that the most vulnerable students
were not necessarily prioritized in the allocation of bursaries.
                                               17


skills development. It also worked through intermediaries, such as the Chamber of Small and
Medium Business Associations for needs analysis, and financed training through informal
providers to meet identified gaps. On anecdotal evidence, these programs were highly
appreciated by the participants; and at least one successful program was picked up by other
donors and the SMEs themselves when the TEVET Fund pulled out. The 2009 Evaluation of
the TEVET Fund found that subsidization of pre-employment training fees through the Fund
led to a substantial reduction in drop-out of trainees (during the short period of the Fund’s
operation). However, these initiatives were not followed up or institutionalized due to closure
of the TEVET Fund when the TDP ended.

4.17 The outcome indicator on gender balance had an unrealistic target of 25 percent
increase in the share of female TEVET graduates, which was unsurprisingly not met. The
overall proportion of female graduates remained around 40 percent, which is relatively high
for TEVET systems. No baseline was available for the objective of increasing the share of
females in traditionally male-dominated disciplines such as engineering – the share was
reported at 12 percent for 2006 and 2008. Bursaries and awareness campaigns are reported
to have been used by MSTVT to encourage female participation in these fields. A disability
policy was developed and disseminated in 2007, at which time the share of TEVET graduates
with disabilities was reported to be one percent. The TDP financed extensive activities
related to HIV/AIDS awareness, including the participation of more than a thousand people
from 230 TIs in several workshops, a peer educator program, and development of curriculum
modules and materials. However, evidence was not available on the effectiveness of TDP
activities related to disability and HIV/AIDS.

4.18   Overall, efficacy on this objective is therefore rated Modest.

OBJECTIVE 5: CREATE A TRAINING SYSTEM CAPABLE OF IMPROVING SKILLS FOR BOTH THE
FORMAL AND INFORMAL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY (Modest).

4.19 As a result of the TDP, Zambia’s TEVET system has developed increased potential
in some areas to improve skills for the formal and informal sector, but realizing this potential
would depend on resolving outstanding institutional, policy and financing issues to fully
implement the 1998 sector policy. A strong professional team was developed in TEVETA,
with procedures instituted for (i) registration, accreditation, inspection, certification of
instructors, design and review of curricula, and examinations; (ii) working through private
and public sector networks and facilitating TI-employer linkages for both formal and
informal sectors; and (iii) providing advisory and support services to TIs and financing
demand-led training through a competitive TEVET Fund for both formal and informal
sectors. However, other essential reforms were not implemented. The autonomous status of
TEVETA and the MSTVT TIs was not fully secured. Essential central government functions
were not developed. The TEVET Fund was not sustained and the system lacked a viable
financing strategy when the TDP ended.

4.20 The only program indicator relevant specifically to the informal sector – “60 percent
of a sample of clients of self-employed graduates are satisfied with goods/services” – did not
have a baseline and was not followed up in program reporting. The 2008 tracer study found
that 97 percent of employed graduates were in the formal sector (although the
                                                             18


representativeness of the sample is in doubt). Program outputs related to the informal sector
were achieved primarily through TEVETA which developed entrepreneurship curricula for
all TIs and, most significantly, through the TEVET Fund which financed training oriented to
the informal sector. With the demise of the TEVET Fund at the end of TDP, due to absence
of sustainable financing, the capacity of the system to improve skills in the informal sector
does not appear to have been substantially improved.

4.21 Capacity building activities were carried out at all levels of the system but were not
well documented and no assessment of effectiveness is available. Capacity constraints
continue to be very significant, especially in monitoring and information management for
national policy development and in planning and financial management at the TI level. Most
of the planned activities for information management and policy development by MSTVT,
including a National Skills Development Plan, were not carried out during TDP.

4.22      Efficacy on this objective is therefore rated Modest.

5. Ratings
Relevance of Objectives
5.1      The TDP objectives were highly relevant to Zambia’s economic and social needs at
the time of appraisal and remained relevant at closure. The shortage of appropriate skills in
the Zambian labor force, due to poor quality and rigidity of the existing education and
training system, had been identified as an important constraint to national development.
Improving skills continued to be seen as critical for the more recently defined development
priorities of economic diversification through improvement in productivity and
competitiveness in new sectors, and of inclusive growth which depends on raising
productivity and incomes in the informal sector. To address the shortfall in skills, a case
could have been made for an alternative approach within the education and training sector –
such as addressing the deficiencies in quantity and quality of general secondary education --
but the priorities and linkages within the education and training sectors were not explicitly
considered in the project rationale. Nevertheless, there was a clear and pressing need to
improve the relevance, efficiency and financing of TVET institutions. Support to TVET was
included in the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 1999-2003,
incorporated in its first strategic pillar of Removing Constraints to Sustainable, Diversified
Growth.10 Although the Bank is no longer allocating IDA lending resources to the social
sectors, the 2008-11 CAS highlights the need to address human resource constraints and
proposes analytical work related to strategies for post-basic education and its relation to
TVET.

  August 1999 CAS text: “Knowledge and Innovation. Given Zambia’s need to diversify and compete on world markets in
areas other than basic commodity exports, capacity building and knowledge generation are central to its growth prospects.
This and the changing structure of Zambia’s formal employment sector, following retrenchments in mining and public
service sectors, have lent increased importance to investing in people to produce a workforce that has the capacity to acquire
new skills. With others, IDA is helping to prepare a Training Subsector Investment Program which will focus on the cost
effective provision of new skills, including for retrenched workers. It will involve intensive collaboration with the private
sector in its design and implementation.”
                                              19


5.2    Although the stated objectives were highly relevant, the expected outcomes were
excessively ambitious in relation to the available time, resources and country capacity.
Considering the institutional challenges and the incentives required in shifting TVET from
supply to demand orientation, involving changes in the expectations and behavior of public
and private sector stakeholders, as well as the time needed to achieve demonstrated
improvements in graduate outcomes throughout a reformed TVET system, it was unrealistic
to expect to achieve the program objectives within five years or within the TDP budget.

5.3    Overall, relevance of objectives is Substantial.

Relevance of Program Design
5.4     The rationale for achieving objectives was mostly sound, based on three fundamental
governance and financing reforms: (i) giving the publicly-owned TIs financial and
managerial autonomy, under local management boards with private sector representation,
thereby introducing the means and incentives for them to improve efficiency and respond to
local demand; (ii) establishing an independent training authority (TEVETA), representing a
broad range of public, private and civil society stakeholders and with non-government
majority on the board, responsible for regulation and quality assurance across the training
sector, covering public and private providers, and the formal and informal sectors; and (iii)
establishing an autonomous training fund (TEVET Fund) under the jurisdiction of TEVETA,
to finance training of all kinds – including in-service training and training for the informal
sector – on a competitive, demand-driven basis. Together, these measures could improve
quality of the system (through the regulatory and support functions of TEVETA), increase
the influence of demand in training provision (through TI management boards, TEVETA
functions, and the TEVET Fund) and equity (through the TEVET Fund by financing training
for the informal sector and subsidizing vulnerable students).

5.5     Program design was less sound on the objective of making the system sustainable.
Financial sustainability was to be achieved by diversifying funding sources through cost
recovery and through private sector contributions to the TEVET Fund. However, while cost
recovery would theoretically enable public and private TIs to compete on a level basis, it
would need to be balanced in large part by subsidies to the students who could not afford
fees. The proposal to introduce a payroll levy to finance the TEVET Fund was tentative at
the time of appraisal, lacking clear support from either government or the private sector. It
was not ideally suited to conditions in Zambia: from experience in other countries, it has
worked best for in-service training and has tended to be of less benefit to smaller companies
or the informal sector.

5.6      TDP design was not well adapted to prevailing country conditions in other respects as
well. Much stronger capacity would have been needed, in overall public sector management
and in the responsible ministry, to justify the ambition and comprehensive scope of the
program or the attempt to work through a sector-wide approach. Having nine separate
components, the program took on nationwide implementation of major governance reforms
at all levels of the system with insufficient attention to piloting and phasing and with
conservative estimates of the required time and resources. Insufficient thought was given to
the possible need for piloting of TI autonomy in selected institutions and/or of industry
                                               20


involvement in selected sectors, to better define the requirements, to test mechanisms for
employer involvement, and to ascertain and demonstrate the potential benefits – especially
considering the weak public sector context and the lack of experience or trust in public-
private partnerships.

5.7    The relevance of program design is therefore Modest.

Efficiency
5.8     No estimate is available of the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) to the program’s
investments and efficiency cannot be assessed on this basis. The PAD estimates an ERR of
17 percent for the Bank’s contribution to the program, based on expectations of increased
cost effectiveness of the TEVET system through raising graduate employment rates, reducing
costs, enhancing competition and increasing private contributions. However, the program did
not generate relevant data and it is not possible to validate the estimates or clarify the
assumptions. The relevant planned activities under the program component for TEVET
information systems – the development and monitoring of internal and external efficiency
indicators for the sector, as well as studies on the costs and cost effectiveness of training –
were not accomplished.

5.9      Cost effectiveness in delivering the project or program outputs was also not addressed
in project documents at completion. Assessing efficiency on this basis is constrained by lack
of relevant monitoring outputs but several factors point to weak overall efficiency: long
delays in executing program activities, such that many planned activities were not
accomplished even with a two-year extension of the credit; wastage in the provision of
training equipment and machinery, some of which was found to be unused, unusable, or of
poor quality; inadequate supervision of civil works, leading to delay and substandard quality
or incomplete projects in some cases. Some wastage was also reported in capacity building
activities that were not sufficiently responsive to specific needs in different institutions.

5.10 One of the intentions of introducing a demand-driven training fund that would
allocate resources on a competitive basis was to promote more efficient use of training
resources. However, delay in setting up the TEVET Fund – until the last two years of the
seven-year implementation period – resulted in the majority of IDA resources (and overall
TDP resources) being expended through the traditional centralized approach instead of, as
planned, through the new Fund.

5.11   Efficiency is therefore rated Modest.

Outcome
5.12 The overall outcome rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory is based on the above
discussion of the relevance of objectives, and on the efficacy (Section 4) and efficiency in
achieving the objectives. Although the TDP objectives were substantially relevant, efficacy
and efficiency were modest.
                                              21


5.13 The most significant positive outcomes of the TDP – development of systems for
quality assurance through inspection, registration, accreditation and certification procedures
covering public and private TIs, the involvement of industry in review of curricula, and
successful piloting of a demand-driven fund for financing training in both formal and
informal sectors. – were achieved through TEVETA. The capacity and on-going practices
developed in TEVETA provided an essential basis for improving skills across formal and
informal sectors. However, this was not sufficient for an effective TEVET system without a
supporting institutional framework and sustainable funding through a financing system that
ensured appropriate incentives for demand-responsiveness. The TDP was unsuccessful in
core elements of the program. In particular, it failed to consolidate (i) autonomy of TEVETA
and the MSTVT TIs, (ii) the role and capacity of central government in strategic policy,
monitoring, and information management, or (iii) sustainable funding for training in the
informal as well as formal sector through a demand-driven fund. The intended new system
was thus only very partially developed.

Risk to Development Outcome
5.14 Risk to development outcome is Substantial. At closing of the credit, there was no
clear strategy for resolving the continuing tensions on governance and finance issues –
concerning the status of MSTVT TIs and the appropriateness of channeling public funds
through the TEVET Fund – or for securing financial sustainability. The official TEVET
policy is only partially followed in practice.

5.15 Financial support to the TEVET system in Zambia is extremely constrained. External
partners have pulled out of the sector, including IDA whose program no longer includes
lending for education or training. Despite government assurance at closing of the credit,
government funding for TEVET has not been channeled through the TEVET Fund. Two
years after closing of the IDA credit , no mechanism has been developed to promote private
sector contributions to funding. The TEVET Fund, which was intended to be financed in part
by the private sector, and which was successfully piloted with external funds under TDP, is
no longer in operation and expert staff had to be laid off. More positively, TEVETA is
continuing to provide and further develop its regulatory and support services, although
constrained by shortage and uncertainty of funding.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

5.16 The Bank team brought strong sector expertise to the design of TDP, ensuring
Zambian stakeholders benefited from knowledge of international experience. The rationale
for the proposed reforms was sound and consistent with relevant international practice,
devolving management functions to multi-stakeholder, employer-led bodies (TEVETA, the
TEVET Fund, and the management boards of TIs) in order to make training more responsive
to employment needs. Program design (discussed in paragraph 2.11, page 8) incorporated a
comprehensive range of “good practice” measures, encompassing public and private training
providers for the formal and informal sectors and addressing poverty and social issues.
However, this assessment finds significant shortcomings. In summary: the political economy
                                              22


challenges of shifting the system from supply- to demand-orientation were underestimated;
the risks were underestimated; and the time and resources required to accomplish the
objectives were underestimated; the institutional framework for implementation was
inappropriate; and the program was not ready for implementation at approval of the credit.

5.17 Although some of the risks were accurately identified, they were greatly
underestimated and mitigating measures were inadequate. A very significant risk area,
evident from experience in similar projects, was neglected: continuity in government
commitment, including the responsible line ministry, to devolving control and resources to
non-government bodies and, in particular, to channeling sector resources through an
autonomous training fund. This risk could have been anticipated and mitigated through
greater attention to broadening ownership – and roles in implementation – across relevant
government ministries and other stakeholder agencies. In particular, the risk would have been
reduced by ensuring readiness for implementation – including detailed agreement and
legislation -- of the TEVET Fund, which was a crucial pillar of the new system, intended as
the primary channel for public, private and donor resources to the sector. Instead, the
program was to begin with large scale procurement by MSTVT – contrary to the new
institutional roles. Agreement had not been reached on the strategy for financial
sustainability, which tentatively involved a payroll levy to secure contributions from the
private sector. Program design should have taken more account of the political economy
factors in implementing the proposed reforms, and the incentives and disincentives facing
different stakeholders.

5.18 In addition, the centralized institutional framework adopted for implementation,
putting full management responsibility in the hands of MSTVT (for IDA and Netherlands
funds), ran counter to the sector policy of devolving implementation authority to TEVETA
and the training institutions. The nine program components were confusing and duplicative:
each component combined relevant activities to be implemented by MSTVT, TEVETA and
the TIs, thus obscuring the respective implementation roles and responsibilities. Despite
TEVETA’s clear role as an independent legal entity in the sector, its separate accountabilities
were not distinguished even in the structure of components, much less through a separate
implementation agreement. Instead, a temporary Program Coordination Office was created at
the Bank’s instigation, with the objective of ensuring coordination across the different
agencies involved in implementation. This was contrary to the principle of working through
mainstream structures in a Sector-Wide Approach; it could also have been expected to add to
confusion rather than clarify who was accountable for what in implementation of the
program.

5.19 The risk of inadequate skills and implementing capacity was correctly identified at
appraisal but the mitigating measures – TA and capacity building – were insufficient.
Although program design recognized the need to building human resources in the TEVET
sector, a comprehensive capacity building plan was not developed and the immediate need
for financial management capacity in the newly autonomous TIs was not specifically
identified. The risk of inadequate funding for such an ambitious program should also have
been considered. Thought was needed to prioritizing, reducing and phasing the extremely
comprehensive scope of proposed activities. The activities needed anyway to be sequenced
more carefully: for example, giving priority to building capacity in TEVETA and the TIs in
                                              23


managing their new functions, and to establishing indicator baselines and monitoring
procedures and capacity in MSTVT; and postponing large scale procurement of equipment
and materials for TIs until curricula had been reviewed and needs of individual TIs
thoroughly assessed and prioritized, based on their own plans. Piloting could have been
considered, in selected TIs and/or industrial sectors, before attempting to implement the full
package of reforms on a nationwide basis.

5.20 Considering also some shortcomings in the results framework (under M&E below)
and the lack of baseline data at appraisal, Bank performance on quality at entry was
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

QUALITY AT SUPERVISION

5.21 Bank performance on supervision was variable and Moderately Unsatisfactory
overall. The team collaborated effectively with the co-financing partners throughout
implementation, meeting jointly with government and implementing partners, collaborating
on joint communiqués and on the major joint review in 2003. Although supervision was
hindered by political turnover, the response to early problems and delays could have been
more proactive with respect to clarifying implementation roles and accountabilities and
establishment of the TEVET Fund. Mission reports and interviews indicate an intensive
period of supervision from the stage of the Joint Review. The team was strengthened with
additional resources, extensive field visits were carried out, reporting was candid and issues
were strenuously followed up. However, the crucial issue of the private sector levy or
alternative mechanism for financial sustainability was still relatively neglected, as was M&E.
At closing of the credit, reporting was superficial and less candid. Considering the
uncertainties and challenges facing the sector at that stage, consideration might have been
given to a major terminal review to help identify lessons and options for the future.

5.22   Bank Performance overall was Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
5.23 Government performance was satisfactory in preparation but unsatisfactory during
implementation, leading to an overall moderately unsatisfactory performance. The TDP was
preceded by substantial work on policy development and legislation. Commitment to the
proposed reforms was quite strong during TDP preparation. However, this commitment was
not sustained in practice in implementation through the frequent turnover in MSTVT
leadership. Amendment to the TEVET Act – to allow establishment of the TEVET Fund –
was seriously delayed. Resources allocated to the program were insufficient to ensure
successful implementation: the program aimed at maintaining the share of discretionary
government spending allocated to TEVET at 0.8 percent from 2002 but this target was not
reached until 2007. After closing of external assistance, public resources for training were
not applied as agreed through the TEVET Fund which therefore closed.

5.24 Performance was unsatisfactory of the implementing agency, MSTVT, and of its
Program Coordinating Office (PCO), which failed to facilitate the transfer of functions to
TEVETA and the TIs. Although the functions formally assigned to the PCO were confined to
                                              24


TDP coordination, procurement, FM and reporting, the PCO assumed a more dominant role
(this is attributed in part to frequent changes in Minister and Permanent Secretary). Housed
in a separate location from the MSTVT for the first four years, the PCO was criticized for not
conferring or coordinating effectively with the responsible Ministry staff or the beneficiary
training institutions. Plans, reports and procurement activities were often long delayed and
the M&E function was particularly weak.

5.25 The performance of TEVETA in implementation was satisfactory, especially so
considering the very large agenda it took on as a new organization over a short period of
time, the constraints of uncertain funding, and the delay in clarifying relevant legislation.
TEVETA developed transparent procedures and built relations with TIs and the private and
informal sectors for the introduction of a comprehensive quality assurance system and
piloting of the TEVET Fund.

5.26 Overall implementing agency performance and overall Borrower Performance were,
therefore, Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Quality of Monitoring and Evaluation
DESIGN

5.27 From the DCA (Annex C), the achievement of objectives was to be measured as
follows: increase in the total resources available to the TEVET sector from the government,
private sector, and trainees; employers’ attitude towards contributing to TEVET; the share of
courses approved by the new training authority (TEVETA); the employment rate of TEVET
graduates; and increase in the share of the poor and disadvantaged among employed TEVET
graduates. Indicators in the DCA differed from those in the PAD (and ICR) and, where they
diverged, were not monitored in implementation.

5.28 Although a results framework was in place with indicators established for
development objectives and for each component, there were a number of shortcomings:

      The theory of how inputs and outputs would produce outcomes to meet objectives
       was not explicitly laid out. Including explanation of the intermediate steps needed to
       affect outcomes could have helped M&E implementation and performance of the
       program. A more explicit results chain might also have made clearer the time and
       costs involved in reaching the higher level objectives.
      Selection and definition of some of the outcome indicators, such as the employability
       of graduates, needed more thought in terms of the practicality of measurement, the
       plausibility of producing demonstrated impacts by the time of credit closing, the
       question of attribution and controlling for other factors.
      Indicator baselines were missing and some targets, established before baselines were
       available, appeared arbitrary.
      The lack of existing M&E culture, experience or capacity warranted a simpler and
       clearer design of M&E, and a less ambitious component for sector information
       systems. The proposed TEVET MIS, incorporating labor market data, to be operated
       and maintained in MSTVT and 30 TI sites within two years of credit approval,
                                               25


       needed much more detailed preparation and phasing and strong TA. The respective
       roles of MSTVT, TEVETA and the TIs in information collection and management
       were not clarified.

IMPLEMENTATION

5.29 Although the program funded a dedicated M&E specialist in the PCO, M&E outputs
were delayed, minimal and not of good quality. The most significant outputs were two tracer
studies which had significant limitations in design and implementation, including the lack of
control groups as well as sampling difficulties due to the lack of contact data in TIs. The
2008 study noted unwillingness of employers to participate, particular difficulty in tracking
workers in the informal sector, and shortage of time for data collection. Some key
performance indicators were not tracked during implementation, baselines for others were
not established at all or not established until 2004, and there was a lack of consistency across
different reports on which of the multiple indicators was included.

5.30 The program component for sector information systems was unsuccessful. Equipment
and software were delivered to 14 TIs but the lack of internet connections limited their use
and the central MIS was never fully operational as planned. The original plan of gathering,
analyzing and disseminating data on the labor market was not incorporated, nor was the
planned development and monitoring of internal and external efficiency indicators or studies
on the costs and cost effectiveness of training accomplished. A database was established in
MSTVT and annual statistical reports were produced for 2005 and 2006 but sector statistics
were not published after that, reportedly due to malfunction of the database. It was reported
to the PPAR mission that the system is now in the process of being re-designed.

UTILIZATION

5.31 No indication was found of the use of M&E outputs to inform decisions on program
implementation or broader policy.

5.32   The overall quality of M&E is rated Modest.

6. Lessons
6.1     The experience of the Zambia TDP exemplifies the challenges in shifting the TVET
system from supply- to demand-driven provision of training in a country with little
experience in public-private partnerships and a large informal sector. As in many African
countries and in other parts of the world, Zambia’s traditional TVET system comprised a
network of centrally funded and managed institutions, staffed by civil servants, taking sixteen
to eighteen-year olds straight from school into full-time (mostly boarding) vocational courses
of one or three years. Typically, the high capital and recurrent costs of this type of training,
combined with lack of incentives to innovate, led to progressive deterioration of buildings
and equipment, the use of outdated machinery, materials, curricula and teaching methods,
and scarcity of well-qualified instructors with industry experience. Such systems showed
mixed to poor results in the employment and incomes of graduates. They were unable to
respond flexibly to changing technology and labor market conditions, ill-suited to reaching
                                                   26


the informal sector or meeting in-service training needs, and was too expensive to sustain.
Policy for the TVET sector has thus shifted internationally (Box 6-1) towards institutional
reforms that can help orient training to employment needs and diversify both the forms of
training and the sources of funding.

Box 6-1. Evolution of TVET Policy


A policy review by the World Bank in 1991* was based on evidence of generally poor results from
the projects that had financed training through traditional public systems. It emphasized that the dual
goals of TVET policy should be to encourage private provision and financing and to improve the
efficiency of publicly provided training. The proposed two-step strategy focused on (i) improving
access and quality in general education and creating a supportive regulatory environment for human
capital development and growth in employment; and (ii) the reform of TVET policies and institutions
to orient the supply of training to local labor market needs and conditions.
As a result, the emphasis in assistance for the sector from the 1990s shifted to policy and institutional
reforms that could allow better responsiveness of training provision to employment needs and
diversify sources of funding. The menu of measures adopted has included: giving financial and
managerial autonomy to publicly-owned TIs, subsidies and other incentives for private training
provision, the establishment of national training authorities, autonomous training funds, private sector
payroll levies, industrial sector councils, national labor market observatories, and graduate tracking
systems. The measures have often proved difficult to implement, especially in low income countries
and when economic growth is slow, and the evidence of impact in such cases is limited. Within Sub-
Saharan Africa, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and Tanzania have established
independent training authorities with training funds. Reforms in South Africa centered on
establishment of the institutional framework for a national qualifications system and sectoral
education and training authorities, financed by a training levy.
        * Vocational and Technical Education and Training: A World Bank Policy Paper, 1991


6.2     In this context, the TDP represented a brave and ambitious attempt to transform the
system through a particularly comprehensive package of reforms: granting financial and
managerial autonomy to publicly-owned training institutions; establishing an autonomous
national training authority; and financing TVET through a competitive training fund. Where
it appears to have fallen down is through taking on too much too quickly with insufficient
resources or analysis of the political economy challenges. Since the planned reforms were
only partially implemented (and M&E was weak), the TDP experience cannot provide much
information on their impact but it does yield many lessons on the planning and
implementation process.

Political Economy Challenges
     Design of TVET reform should be based on in-depth information and analysis of
      the relevant strength, perceptions, interests and incentives of different stakeholder
      groups.
                                            27


    Much attention was given in TDP design to the policy and technical soundness of the
    vision for the new system but not enough to the implementation challenges. Change in
    the fundamental governance structure of TVET, which produces winners and losers,
    needs buy-in by multiple different stakeholders to their new roles. The design assumed
    that policy commitment would be sustained throughout implementation, despite
    indications from the outset of opposition to the plans for channeling public funds - for
    private as well as public training provision - through an autonomous training fund, and
    widespread doubts about the viability of a payroll levy to finance the fund. The natural
    concerns and the challenges facing central government staff and the staff of publicly
    owned TIs were seriously underestimated: sector ministry staff were set to pass control
    of sector resources and management to as yet unproven non-state agencies while
    assuming new and different functions themselves in policy, monitoring and information
    management; staff of the MSTVT–affiliated TIs faced losing the security of civil
    service status and were ill-equipped to take on their own financial management and
    planning in a competitive environment. Cooperation in implementing the changes
    would depend on all key groups being assured not only of the long term viability of the
    changes but also of sufficient financial and technical assistance to protect their
    immediate interests. Similarly, TDP neglected the incentives for private finance of
    training: the doubtful assumption at appraisal was that demonstrated improvements in
    the general quality and relevance of training would be sufficient to inspire willingness
    on the part of enterprises to contribute to the TEVET Fund through a payroll levy.

   Before attempting nationwide implementation of radically new governance and
    financing arrangements in TVET, piloting should be considered and flexibility
    should be built into the plans.

    The experience of the TDP suggests that, when understanding of the proposed reforms
    is not widespread and implementing capacity is constrained, it would be better to
    consider piloting, learning and demonstration in selected sectors and institutions. This
    would provide the opportunity to clarify the requirements, refine and adapt procedures,
    demonstrate benefits, and enlist stakeholder support before detailed plans for scaling
    up. The The TDP was highly unrealistic – in terms of time, resources and capacity -- in
    expecting to accomplish the institutional reforms and achieve nationwide improvements
    in the quality of TEVET graduates within a five year time frame. Considering the
    difficulty in predicting the course of institutional change, when the constraints and
    opportunities are often influenced by individual leaders or personalities, some
    flexibility and contingency planning should be incorporated from the outset.

   Clear definition of respective roles and responsibilities -- for the sector as a whole
    and in project implementation – is crucial for successful implementation of TVET
    reform.
    Many of the problems experienced in TDP implementation might have been avoided
    through ensuring legislation to support the TEVET Fund before approval, clearer
    distinction of the responsibilities of MSTVT and TEVETA in appraisal documents,
    structuring project components to match the respective responsibilities, and underlining

    activities for which it was responsible. The attempt in TDP to address the coordination
    challenges through a Program Coordination Office was unsuccessful and
    counterproductive, adding to the confusion as to who exactly was responsible or
    accountable for what.
   Devolving managerial authority for publicly-owned training institutions from
    central government to local management boards is liable to be de-railed by lack of
    sufficient autonomy, capacity building or financial resources.
    The new legal status of publicly-owned TIs in Zambia was introduced abruptly, prior to
    TDP implementation. Their staff were stripped of civil servant status but the
    government undertook to finance salaries for a further three years, while the new
    institutions established financial viability. In other respects, the transition was not well
    supported and, with hindsight, should have been piloted. The TIs were already in bad
    shape through lack of investment while their staff lacked experience or capacity in
    financial planning and management. Without clear autonomy, the management boards
    were subject to MSTVT regulation – including limits on the fees they could charge --
    constraining their scope for initiative and for securing financial sustainability. As a
    result, the TIs were naturally resistant to the new competitive arrangements and the
    policy tended to be perceived more as a response to budget constraints than a whole-
    hearted measure to improve their capacity to provide quality services. Their evident
    lack of preparedness, in turn, reinforced the temptation of the parent ministry to revert
    to managing and supporting them through a centralized approach. A successful
    transition to management boards would have required more funds, effective capacity
    building, and enough autonomy to allow management boards to function effectively.

TVET Financing
   A national training authority can provide a good base for a competitive fund
    channeling resources for training, so long as it is professionally managed and
    clearly independent from the provision of training.
    The training sector straddles three sets of public sector interests: (i) education sector
    strategy, in terms of coherence and pathways between general secondary education,
    universities, and the technical and vocational options at each level; (ii) industrial
    strategy, promoting productivity and national competitiveness, and (iii) labor market,
    employment and social protection strategy, including active labor market programs.
    Non-government stakeholders are heterogeneous, in terms of the governance, funding
    sources and interests of different types of training provider and forms of training,
    different industrial sectors, and firms of different size. The role played by TEVETA in
    Zambia illustrates the benefits of a technical, non-political, umbrella authority in
    management and regulation of the sector.

    This type of agency, given sufficient autonomy, is well placed to (i) provide a forum for
    mediating the interests of all stakeholders – several different government ministries,
    industry, public and private TIs and trainees – to serve multiple purposes; and (ii)
    helping to match training to employment needs by involving employers closely through
    a variety of mechanisms in the design and delivery of training. The progress made in
                                             29


    developing the capacity of TEVETA through the TDP owed much to its strong
    leadership. However, the neutrality of TEVETA and its independence from training
    provision was questioned at times, due to the role of MSTVT as the parent ministry
    responsible for TEVETA but also maintaining a stake in training provision, through a
    hands-on role and natural allegiance to the needs of its own TIs. In the short pilot phase
    of the TEVET Fund, questions on the its neutrality and its role beyond the public
    provision of training were not fully resolved. Some stakeholders perceived that
    MSTVT TIs were treated preferentially in Fund allocations, while others felt strongly
    (contrary to the official policy) that non-government providers should not be eligible
    for “public” funding. Training authorities elsewhere have often been placed under the
    wing of the ministry of labor, which may tend to minimize conflicts.

   A competitive training fund under non-government management can be effective
    in addressing needs in the informal sector and the needs for in-service training (as
    well as formal pre-employment training) but sustainability is a major challenge.

    Piloting of the TEVET Fund in Zambia demonstrated the potential for such a fund to
    work with the range of stakeholder groups and develop new initiatives both for the
    informal sector and for in-service training in the formal sector. Given that formal sector
    TIs are naturally geared to the formal sector, Zambia’s TEVET Fund illustrated some
    mechanisms that can be used to (i) provide means and incentives for formal TIs to
    focus on entrepreneurship curricula; and (ii) work through NGO and informal networks
    to reach the informal sector. However, the Fund depended entirely on donor resources
    and the reluctance of government to channel any of its own resources through the
    TEVET Fund rendered it unsustainable.

   The use of a payroll levy for the training sector is best-suited for finance of in-
    service training and is difficult to apply in low-income countries or for the
    informal sector.

    The experience of payroll levies to finance training in other countries indicates that
    such levies are usually oriented to in-service training and that smaller firms have tended
    to benefit less than larger ones. In Zambia, the levy was proposed to contribute to the
    TEVET Fund as a whole, with financing also from the government and donor agencies.
    In practice, the private sector was unwilling to trust the government with training funds
    and the government was reluctant to attempt imposing a payroll levy for the TEVET
    Fund. It was not considered viable to tax the formal private sector to support training
    for the informal sector. The four “windows” of the TEVET Fund were well designed
    but more attention could have been given to distinguishing sources of funding for each
    window. More progress might have been made with the private sector through a distinct
    sub-fund, under their control, to finance in-service training. Similarly, organizations
    (including government) focusing on social and poverty objectives could be expected to
    participate in a sub-fund for the informal sector. For formal pre-employment training –
    which needs coordination with public secondary and university education -- the TEVET
    Fund piloted useful approaches, including contracting of training in priority areas based
                                              30


     on the full costs, with graduated subsidies of fees (a legitimate public cost) for the
     poorest students.

    TVET M&E
    In the absence of an existing information culture, substantial time and resources
     are needed to develop sector capacity in M&E for results-based TVET policy.

     Much more attention was needed in TDP from the outset to detailed requirements of the
     new role of MSTVT in sector monitoring, information management and policy
     development. The program set out ambitious plans for a new information system,
     regular sector policy updates and skills development plans, but the implications for the
     structure and recruitment of MSTVT staff, the TA and training requirements and the
     time needed were not thought through. The role of TEVETA – as the agency dealing
     directly with TIs – was not clearly distinguished. As a result, the proposed information
     system was never fully functional and the proposed M&E and policy development
     activities were mostly not implemented or were not implemented well. It is likely that a
     less ambitious design with stronger technical support and clearer specification of
     respective responsibilites could have produced better results. Although some aspects of
     data collection and management were eventually picked up by TEVETA, the core
     sector policy and strategic functions were neglected. The proposed National Skills
     Development Plan, for example, which was intended to provide a basis for
     prioritization in TEVET Fund allocations, was not prepared.

    The selection of outcome indicators for a TVET reform project should focus on
     results that can be clearly and directly attributed to the project interventions.
     By focusing on higher level outcome objectives, such as the employment of TEVET
     graduates, the TDP results framework failed to make explicit the linkages or chain
     between program outputs and outcomes. It would be better in many cases – when
     higher level outcomes cannot be expected within the time frame of the project, or the
     specific contribution of the project interventions cannot readily be separated from other
     factors – to focus on the intermediate outcomes for which the project or program can
     clearly be held accountable: for example, an established system for regular on-going
     tracking of employment and incomes of TEVET graduates, with strong analysis and
     dissemination of the information, would have been a good outcome of the TDP. That is,
     it may be more useful to focus on intermediate steps – such as creating the national
     capacity for on-going monitoring related to downstream objectives – than on trying to
     demonstrate higher level impacts within the course of one institutional reform project.

“Sector-Wide Approach”
    For TVET institutional reform, the potential benefits of a SWAp may be difficult
     to realize unless country capacity is strong enough to support the use of country
     systems in a results-based framework.
     The TDP design incorporated elements of a Sector-wide Approach, in so far as the
     agreed financial contributions of the government and four donors were combined in the
                                        31


overall financial framework of the sector program which was jointly appraised.
Shortcomings in country systems and capacity precluded a full sector-wide approach,
pooling support to the sector budget, although the TDP benefited from strong donor
coordination throughout design and implementation. Only two of the partners,
including IDA, channeled resources jointly through the line ministry for the program as
a whole, with expenditures to conform to agreed annual work plans and budgets. Other
partners had separate arrangements for direct support to the training authority and/or
individual training institutions. In the event, the activities funded through MSTVT were
subject to bureaucratic delays in reaching agreement on plans and in procurement and
implementation, as well as resistance to delegating authority. Efforts to build M&E
capacity in the MSTVT were unsuccessful and the focus stayed on process, rather than
results.
The problems seem to have arisen from two sources: country conditions were not fully
conducive to a SWAp; and the implementation arrangements for the IDA credit and
Netherlands funds were inappropriate for a SWAp and also out of line with the new
sector institutional arrangements. Through separate arrangements, the direct support by
Danida to TEVETA’s capacity and operations appears to have been instrumental in the
positive outcomes that the TDP did achieve. The strengths of their approach, as
reported by the institutions concerned, included intensive and highly flexible technical
assistance and training, which was responsive to demand and based on frequent re-
assessment of needs and priorities, as well as their close presence in the field.

Comments from the Technical Education, Vocational and
Entrepreneurship Training Authority (TEVETA) on the Project
Performance Assessment Report: The Technical Education, Vocational
and Entrepreneurship Training Development Support Programme (CR.
3521-ZA) – May 30, 2011

Introduction

1.      The Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) provides a useful insight into
the design, implementation and impact of the Technical Education, Vocational and
Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET) Development Programme (TDP) implemented in
Zambia during the period 2002 to 2008.

Borrower Performance

2.      The reforms of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training system in
Zambia involved the dissolution of a Government Department and the disengagement of a
large number of public workers. Management Boards were introduced at 21 of the 23 public
training institutions under MSTVT within a very short period. The impact of these “sudden”
changes may have not been fully understood because the pace of institutional reforms was
not sufficiently in synchrony with changes in attitudes and perceptions of public servants.

3.     Private sector training providers were not sufficiently ready or aware of the reforms
and the roles that were anticipated of them.

4.      The Programme Coordinating Office (PCO) was coordinated by a public service
official who was part of the old system which was undergoing reform. The PCO was not
adequately prepared for the coordination role which it was expected to perform.

5.    Following the “Joint Review” in 2003 and the re-allocation of responsibilities for the
components of the TDP, there was appreciable improvement in coordination and
implementation of the programme. The Programme Coordinating Team, with the Director
General of TEVETA as its Chairman, provided an improved mechanism for coordination,
implementation and better definition of roles between TEVETA and MSTVT.

6.      Although not all the recommendations of the “Joint Review” were fully implemented,
the realignment and improved clarity of the roles of MSTVT and TEVETA (defined through
the Components of the TDP) resulted in improved implementation.

7.    There were frequent changes of leadership MSTVT, especially at the critical level of
Permanent Secretary. Some of the implementation difficulties are attributable to these
changes in leadership at MSTVT.

8.      The PPAR finds that the performance of TEVETA in implementation was
satisfactory. TEVETA, as the main implementing agency of MSTVT, did therefore achieve
appreciable outcomes on behalf of the borrower. Further developments by TEVETA (such
as the TEVET Qualifications Framework and the TEVET Learnership Scheme) have built on
the results of the TDP.

9.     TEVETA considers that overall Borrower Performance was Moderately Satisfactory
