and Entrepreneurship Training Development Support\n            Program Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included:  the experience of the Zambia\n            Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TEVET)\n            Development Program (TDP) exemplifies the challenges in\n            shifting the TVET system from supply- to demand-driven\n            provision of training in a country with little experience in\n            public-private partnerships and a large informal sector.  As\n            in many African countries and in other parts of the world,\n            Zambia's traditional TVET system comprised a network of\n            centrally funded and managed institutions, staffed by civil\n            servants, taking sixteen to eighteen-year olds straight from\n            school into full-time (mostly boarding) vocational courses\n            of one or three years.  In this context, the TDP represented\n            a brave and ambitious attempt to transform the system\n            through a particularly comprehensive package of reforms:\n            granting financial and managerial autonomy to publicly-owned\n            training institutions; establishing an autonomous national\n            training authority; and financing TVET through a competitive\n            training fund. Where it appears to have fallen down is\n            through taking on too much too quickly with insufficient\n            resources or analysis of the political economy challenges."}, "docdt": "2011-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
