Modify the\n            implementation arrangements, in view if the dissolution of\n            the former Program Coordination office, and mainstreaming of\n            functions formerly performed by it into the Ministry of\n            Science, Technology, and Vocational Training, and the\n            parastatal TEVET authority;

It is proposed to amend the DCA\n            substantially, to provide for the changes to the\n            implementing arrangements, and to reflect in the Project\n            description that the training fund (TEVET Fund) established\n            under the second component, is indicated to support training\n            programs and TVET investments In the absence of the proposed\n            amendment, it would be difficult to justify continuation of\n            Bank support for the TEVET Development Program. The\n            amendment provides a framework, including milestones for key\n            institutional measures, within which it would be justified\n            to allow the Government of Zambia more time to achieve\n            results in the TEVET sector.
