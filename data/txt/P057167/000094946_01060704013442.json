demand-driven, and equitable training system.\n            The project consists of nine components. 1) It will\n            establish an overall Program Steering Committee to approve\n            annual work programs and budgets and receive reports on\n            implementation. 2) This component will establish a Training\n            Fund, which will test the demand for, and the effectiveness\n            and efficiency of, both pre-employment training as well as\n            employer-based training. 3) This component will develop\n            managerial capacity to coordinate the operation and\n            financing of the TEVET system, and provide support to\n            trainers. 4) This component will support curriculum\n            development by the training institutions. 5) This component\n            will finance public and private training institutions in\n            developing and implementing approaches to training services\n            aimed at enhancing the dynamism and economic viability of\n            the informal sector. 6) This component will assist each\n            level of institution in developing decentralized, human\n            resources development plans as a part of a business plan. 7)\n            An information system will be set up. 8) This component will\n            support rehabilitation of facilities and equipment. 9) The\n            impact of HIV/AIDS on supply and demand will be studied."}, "docdt": "2001-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
