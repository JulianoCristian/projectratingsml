We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement) of even date 
herewith between the Republic of Zambia (the Borrower) and the International 
Development Association (the Association).  Pursuant to Resolution No. IDA 183 of the 
Board of Governors of the Association and, more particularly, to the definition of 
"Participating Countries" to be found in Section 1.01 (a) of the Agreement, we have to 
inform you that, for purposes of the Agreement, the following countries are not 
"Participating Countries" and, therefore, not eligible to supply goods and services 
under the Credit:
Bahamas, Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Cyprus, Qatar, Oman, Singapore
and United Arab Emirates.
This list of ineligible countries is in addition to the list of ineligible 
countries under paragraphs 1.6 and 1.8 of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD 
Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January 
and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999 (the Guidelines).
In accordance with the operational policies of the Association, the term 
"ineligible countries" applies both to the nationality of bidders, and to the source 
of goods and services provided.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing the enclosed copy of 
this letter and returning it to us for our records.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
