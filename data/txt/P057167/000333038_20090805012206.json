Training (TEVET) Development\n            Program Support Project for Zambia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            implementation or sustainability of a project may be\n            jeopardized when key actions are triggered by legislation\n            that needs to be approved at the highest levels of\n            Government. In order to guarantee success, the need for new\n            legislation should be carefully assessed or secured prior to\n            project approval. Experience from other countries and\n            regions have already shown that private sector taxation to\n            support the TEVET system is unlikely to be supported unless\n            the country has an established, diversified private sector.\n            Also, in countries where accountability systems are weak,\n            the private sector may be reluctant to agree on increased\n            taxation levels to support skills development. The\n            involvement of key stakeholders (association of training\n            providers, trade associations, and industry) from the early\n            stage of policy discussions is to build trust and continued\n            participation in the process of change."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
