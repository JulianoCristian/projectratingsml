MZMORANDUM AND RECOJONDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONA BANEM FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ROMANIA
OR A TECHNXCAL ASSSTANCE   D CRITICAL XMPORTS QOEC
1.         I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Romania for the equivalent of US$180.0 million to help finance a
Technical Assistance and Critical Imports Project. The loan would be on standard
IED terms repayable over 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.          Backargund.  Romania stopped borrowing from the Bank in 1982 and
prepaid all its debt to the World Bank by 1989.   The proposed Technical
Assistance and Critical Imports Loan would be the first Bank operation since
1982. Following the overthrow of the Ceaucescu regime, the Government of Romania
(GOR) has embarked on a comprehensive reform program to transform the economy
from a planned to a market based system. The new Government took immediate and
important steps to initiate economic reformss (i) framework legislation for
privatisation was enacted and the transformation of State enterprises into joint
stock companies was Introduced; (ii) land reform was initiated; (iii)
restrictions on private enterprises were largely removed; (iv) the monopoly of
the State over foreign trade was eliminated and the official exchange rate was
devalued by a cumulative 60 percent; and (v) prices in rural markets were freed,
followed by a first stage price liberalization (in November 1990) in which about
half of previously regulated prices were also freed and administered prices for
some important industrial inputs, including cnrde oil, were raised to
international levels.
3.          In early 1991, the Parliament legislated a new law on unemployment
benefits, a banking law establishing an independent central bank and commercial
banks, and a law on foreign investment. To replace the previous ad hoc exchange
controls, the Government introduced a dual exchange rate system, involving
partial foreign exchange retention rights and an interbank market, as an
explicltly temporary mechanism during the transition towards entablishment of
full currency convertibility. A transition tariff structure was put in place,
a permanent scheme is under preparation consistent i,ith the requirements of GATT.
A second phase price liberalization took place on April 1, along with a 71
percent devaluation of the official exchange rate, and full liberalization of
interest rates. An income policy was imposed in January 1991 to prevent a wage-
price spiral in reactlon to the administered prics increases. A system of
monthly compensation to workers and pensioners for these price increases has been
introduced to soften the impact on household incomes.
4.          Further  legislation  to  implement  privatization  of  commercial
enterprises is nearly finalized.   The privatization of land is progressing
rapidly with almost 70 percent of agricultural land privatized. Reforms on
taxation and the tariff regime and a broad scale decentralization of government
functions are underway. The Government has indicated the intention to undertake
ambitlous reform of social policy system, including reform of pensions and health
and education policies.                                            I
5.          The rapid breakdown of previous structures of command and control
in the economy resulted in severe disruptions of doestic supply and trade
patterns. Two major external shocks--a 40 percent increase in oil pricee and
the accelerating breakdown of the CHIA--contributed to sharp reductions ln



- 2 -
exports and in supplies of energy and raw materials. For the whole of 1990,
industrial output declined by 20 percent and overall GDP by 10 percent. The
current account shifted from the arcificially high aurplue maintained under the
Ceaucescu regime to a deficit of 7 percent of GDP, financed entirely by drawdown
of reserves. initial wage increases following the revolution permitted a surge
in private consumption. With a decline in budgetary revenues accompanying these
developments, the previous budgetary surplus was eliminated during the year but
the budget remained in balance, mainly due to a sharp cut in investment
expenditures.
6.          A strict stabilization program for 1991 was adopted with support
from an IMF Stand-by and compensatory fund facility, both approved in April 1991.
The stabilization program entails flrm budgetary discipline (with a maximum
budgetary deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP) and tigh.t monetary and credit policies.
Economic performance in the first quarter of 1991 appears to be deteriorating
further, with industrial output declining 17 percent compared to the same period
of 1990. The decline in industrial production in the first quarter was mainly
concentrated in heavy and energy-intensive subsectors. Fiscal developments have
ben encouraging so far and monetary indicators have been kept within the limits
of the INr Stand-by program.
7.          RtLlonale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank economic mission which
visited Romania in November 1990 has undertaken a detailed analysis of the
economic reform program launched by the Government. It has found the program
courageous and comprehensive, and it endorsed its broad directions.  Based on
the assesment and recommendation of the economic mission, the Bank is preparing
a Structural Adjustment Operation which would support the reform program, in
particular, the major policy and institutional masures that appear necessary
to improve resource m=bilization and allocation, support private sector
development, and develop a social safety net. Several investment operations are
also  under  preparation,  including  a  technical  assistance  project  for
infrastructure, a health project, and an agrlcultural development project.
S.          In spite of Romania's negligible external debt, comuercial lenders
do not yet seem prepared to extend financing.  Due to contLnued political
uncertainties, other donors, such as the group of 24 countries associated with
the ZC, have only recently initiateu providing support to Romania.  Their
.'lnancial assistance has so far been largely limited to humanitarian aid.
Because of the collapse of the CMEA and other reasons, foreign exchange reserves
are very low.
9.          Given the important reform measures already undertaken, and the
hesitancy of other donors to provide external resources, rapid involvement of
the Bank in the financing of technical assistance and urgently needed forelgn
exchange is required to avoid further collapse of the production system.
10.         Project Obiectives.  The object wes of the Project are to provides
(i) technical assistance to support the on4oing economic reform process; and
(Li) foreign exchange for the import of essential spare parts and equipment to
the irrigation, telecommunications, power, lignite, petroleum, gas and
transportation sectors, and spare parts for machinery to sustain output
performance.
11.         Prot¢t Desciotion.  The project comprises a technical aIsistaneX
cc=flron  and an lanorts_ comnonent.  The technical assistEaco-oJemnent is
focused on macroeconomic and sector policy formulation, in areas where change.
ln polLiy orientation are anticipated or under preparation.  Some technical



-3-
assistance in the energy and agricultural sectors address more longer torm issues
where GOR intends to undertake reforms but requires a thorough sector analysis.
specifically, the technical assistance component includess
(a)   National Economic Management (US$2.6 million).  The component is to
strengthen the National Reform Council and the Ministry of gconcr,
and Finance (MEF) to improve policy analysis, forecasting and policy
formulation. In the MET, advisory services are needed to strengthen
macroeconomic, foreign trade and quantitative analysis. Advisory
services to the Reform Council would enhance strategy formulation
capacities incorporating both economic and leal reform measures.
(b)  Accounting and Auditing (US$0.4 million).  The TA component would
flnance a resident advisor and training to help establish the
development of an international recognized accounting and auditLag
system.
(c)   Privatization and Restructuring of Industrial Enterprises  (US$2.4
million).  The priX&tlzatLo  component has been designed to assist
the National Agency for Privatization ins (i) designing and
formulating a general privatization strategy and legislation; (Li)
conceptualizing  the  institutional  structures  for  exercising
ownership; (iii) developing techniques for small scale privatization;
and (iv) carrying out on a pilot basis a limited number of operations
for privatization of state enterprises.
(d)   Under the industrial restructuring component, support would be
provided to: (i) define sectoral strategies for industrial
restructuring and the definition of the appropriate institutional
framework to implement restructuring programs; and (ii) develop
model restructuring programs for seven to eight enterprises, selected
from different subsectors. Model restructuring programs prepared
by joint teams of foreign consultants and Romanian experts, would
serve as demonstration cases and would be disseminated widely to show
various analytical and restructuring approaches.
(e)   Commercial Banks (US$2.0 million).  The TA component would support
the newly established commercial banks, which have been transformed
into profit-oriented companies. The project would provide financing
for the preparation of strategic plans, staff training plans and
assessments of computer hardware requirements for the Commercial
Bank, the Development Bank, the Agricultural Bank, and the
Cooperative Bank, and the Savings Bank.
(f)   Energy Component (US$3.8 million).  The component would finance an
(i) energy cost and pricing study; (ii) advisory services to COR to
design a program of full price liberalization in line with economic
cost; and (iii) an energy policy advisor to the Ministry of
Industries to assist in analyzing projected energy demand,
institutional policy, and investment requirements. The component
would also provide some computer equipment and related training for
selected staff. The component would further finance two important
studies for the petroleum and gas sectors,  (iv) an Oil and Gas
Reserves Audit and Assessment of the Operations, and (v) an
evaluation of Hydrocarbon Prospects in Romania.



(g)   Irrigation Sector Development (US$2.7 million).  Technical assistance
would be provided to carry out a major irrigation sector review (155
months). The study would be an important effort in assessing the
role of irrigation in the altered economic conditions of a market
economy, examine the competitiveness of various existing schemes,
make restructuring proposals taking into account competitive
conditions, provide recommendations regarding appropriate irrigation
and drainage technology, investigate impact of privatization of on -
- farm irrigation. Consultants would further a6sse0 the required
level of operation and maintenance expenditures and recommend levels
of water charges.
(h)   Employment Services Component (US$3.6 million). Substantial levels
of unemployment are expected in Romania as a result of the transition
process to a market economy. It is thus essential to establish a
well-functioning employment office, which administers unemployment
benefits and assists in redirecting labor to new employment. The
TA would supportt (i) improvement of the labor market information
system;  (li)  enhancement  of  employment  services  including
occupational counseling and developments and techniques to deal
effectively with mass layoffa at the local level; (iii) adult
training; (iv) employment promotion including mioro-enterprise
development; (v) refinement of the social insurance system; (vi)
automation of labor offices and services; and (vii) advisory services
to support project implementation of this 7omponent.
(i)   National Commission of Statistics (US$3.0 million).  The component
would suyport the National Commission of Statistics in the processing
and analysis of statistics required for the monitoring of economic
development in a market based system. The component would provide
a mainframe computer, software and related staff training in the use
of the computer.
12.         The objective of the LML-tj     comnonnt is to provide foreign exchange
for spare parts and equipment for key sectors of the economy to help maintain
production. Only those sectors have been selected for import financing which
are judged to be economically viable in the competitive environment of a market
economy.   Sectors which require major restructuring and where comparative
advantage remains uncertain - such as in industry - have been excluded from the
project.   Sectors included ares power, petroleum, gas, mining, irrigation,
agricultural machinery, telecommunication, and transportation. The component
would:
(a)   Imports for the Petroleum/Gas Sector (US$35.0 million). Spare parts
financing would permit to reactivate 1,290 shut-in wells which are
inactive due to lack of material and equipment. Annual incremental
production resulting from the financing of spare parts is estimated
to be 4 million tons of oil and 1.5 DCM of gas per year. Foreign
exchange savings resulting from import substitution from oil would
amount to US$217 million annually at 1991 cif import prices.
(b)   Imports for the Power Sector (US$40.2 million).  The objective of
the power component is to assist Regia Autonoma a Gazalor Naturale
(PIRNL) in increasing the soonest possible the production of
electrical energy generated from non-tradable indigenous coal (poor
quality lignites) by assuring the functioning of four of the largest
generating units while safeguarding the performance of the existing



- 5 -
electrostatic precipitators.    The  component would  assist the
Oovernment to save annually an estimated US$ 204 million in foreign
exchange by substituting domestically produced for imported
elrtcri.etty. The component would X (l) help rehabilitate four 330
MW generating blocks; (ii) safeguard in a limited way the protection
system of two 400 kv transformer stationo and the 750 kv transformer
station which receives imported energy from the USSR; (iii) restore
and maintain the operating safety of the central and regional
dispatching centers; and (iv) regain the original performance of four
electrostatic  precipitators  thus  ameliorating   environmental
pollution.   EIB would cofinance this component in the amount of
US$17.4 million.
(c)   Imports for the Lignite Mining Sector  (US$26.6 million).   The
objective of 'he lignite mining component is to meet the incremental
demand of 8 million tons of lignite for the RovinarL and Turceni
power plants required after their completed Phase I rehabilitation.
The component is to restore the production capacity of surface mines
of RAL from presently 42 million tons to 52 million tons, through
financing of critical spare parts and management consultancies which
would assist 'in organizing the mines more effectively and would
prepare long-term restructuring plans.
(d)   Imports for the Transport Sector (US$35.0 million).  The transport
investment component would provide spare parts for the trucks and
buses, the Constanza Port and the Bucharest Metro. As spare parts
for vehicles are widely traded on black markets and an appropriate
scarcity price is difficult to establish, tires, engine parts, and
batteries would be distributed under an auction system to private
and public buses and trucking companies.
(e)   Imports for the Tslecommunications Sector (US$6.8 million).  The
existing telecommunications system continues to deteriorate due to
lack of spare parts, in particular cables. The project would provide
for spare parts to assure continued functioning of telecommunications
facilities. The proposed sum for import financing is small, but if
carefully targeted would have an immediate impact by helping to keep
the network functioning until more substantial investmentps can be
made.
(f)   Imports for the Irrigation Sector (US$1S.9 million).  More than 30
percent of arable land in Romania is under irrigation, producing
more than 50 percent of agricultural value added. But due to lack
of spare parts and inoperative pumping equipment, agriculture in
many of the irrigated areas is reverting back to rainfed agriculture
causing substantial output losses to the economy. The proposed
project would provide spare parts and pumping equipment to 15
irrigation schemes, which are considered to be economically viable.
Only pumping equipment for major pumping heads would be provided to
not prajudge possible restructuring programs, which would break down
large scale schemes into smaller units and require different pumping
technology in the secondary system.
(g)   Imports for Agricultural Machinery (US$7.0 million).  A significant
pArt of the 1991 crop is likely to remain in the field, as large
parts of the agricultural machinery park is inoperative due to lack
of spare parts. The project would finance imports of batteries and



- 6 -
transmiasion belts for 20,000 combine harvesters. if implementation
of the component proceeds as scheduled, harvesters could be equipped
in time, to function during the latar part of the harvesting season.
Imported spare parts would be distributed throughout the country to
machinery stations which rent agricultural machinery to private
farmers and agricultural cooperatives.
13.         3X Cironmental Issue:s  Pollution is a serious problem in Romania,
but until recently little effort was made to control pollution other than
particulate emissions. As a result of this neglect no relieble data exists
regarding ambient levels and power plant emissions. Without such data it Ls
not possible to determine the possible need for equipment to reduce emissions.
GOR is now determined to proceed toward the adoption of international standards
for pollution control in the power, petroleum and other sectors. As part of the
power import component, the project would provide for spares and replacement
parts for overhauling and upgrading electrostatic precipitators whose efficiency
ha been substantially reduced over the years. The project would furthermore
provide for financing of laboratories with equipment to measure pollution levels.
Technical assistance to help GOR examine the current pollution problems is being
provided for under grant financing from EC-PHARE. The environmental impact of
the irrigation system and the petroleum anti gas sectors would be examined under
studies included under the technical assistance program of this loan.
14.         gnlondi*  Term*s  The proposed loan would be made to GOR for a term
of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate. Technical assistance would be provided as a budgetary contribution to
agencies fully funded under the budget; agencies only partially dependent or
fully independent from the budget would repay MEF for the cost of technical
assistance. Beneficiaries of imUorted goods would receive a loan from 3E3 under
onlending agreement. only exception to this is the Ministry of Agriculture which
would receive imported goods for the irrigation component as a budgetary
transfer. Loan amounts under onlending agreements would be expressed in US$
terms or in Deutsche Mark and repaic either in foreign exchange or in ll with
foreign exchange valued at the interbank market foreign exchange rate at the date
of repayment. Beneficiaries thus would carry the full foreign exchange risk for
the maturity period of the subloan. The interest rate charged for funds onlent
would be LI1OR plus a minimum of 1.S percent p.a. for loans denominated in U8S$
and FIOR plus a minimum of 1.S percent p.a. for loans denominated in Deutsche
Xark. Maximum maturity periods for onlending would be 10 years with 3 years of
grace.
15.         Imoln2ritation Aranaements: The project would be executed by MEF
in coordination with different Government agencies and semi-autonomous and
commercial companies benefitting from technical assistance and import financing.
A project implementation unit has already been established and is fully
operational.
16.         Actions Agreeds  During negotiations agreement was reached that
based on the energy pricing study and irrigation study action programs be
developed which would be jointly discussed between GOR and the Bank. Based on
the work of the management consultants provided to the lignite mines, GOR would
also present for Bank review a restructuring program to improve the financial
and economic viability of lignite mines. With support of the long-term advisor
provided to M3F for the preparation of public investment program, GOR would
present to the Bank a proposed public investment program for 1993 and a program
outlining which of the many unfinished investments should be completed over which
timeframe. O0R agrees to implement action programs adopted for energy pricing



reform, lignite minlng restructuring, and public investment programming, as
agreed upon between the Bank and OR during joint reviews.
1?.         Conditions of Effectvnesu   (i) Signature of two on-lending
agreements between ME? and beneficiaries; (ii) eignature of management agrement
between ME? and Development Bank, and 14r and Agricultural amn4 to administer
onlending agreements; and (iii) establishment of two Special Accounts, one
denominated ln US$ and one denominated in Deutsche Mark, in ban-ks and on terme
acceptable to the Bank and the provision of information by GOR on the respective
allocatiore of disbursement catogories to each accounts.
18.         gonditiong of Disbursementas  Disbursements for import components
would be conditioned on signing onlending agreement by MEF and the respective
beneficiary.
19.         Total Cost and Finanaing Plan.  The total cost of the project is
US$262.4 million, of which US$197.4 million is in foreign exchange. The proposed
loan (US$180.0 million) would finance 68 percent of the total project cost.
20.          ofinjpJlM:s SIB is expected to finance US$17.4 million (7 percent
of the total project cost), and the Government of Romania would provide US$65.0
million for the local cost (25 percent of the total project cost).
21.         Benefits and Risks. The technical assistance component wou3d support
ongoing economic reforms throvjh strengthening policy formulation and
implementation. The imports component is expected to maintain output if ,ritical
sectors of the economy. Aggregate output offects are expected to be substantial.
Maintaining or restoring production in the petroleum, gas and power sector would
have important import substitution effects, as much of Romania's energy is
presently imported. Annual output attributed to the provision of spare parts
are estimated at 4 million tons of oil, 1.5 BSC gas and 4,000 @5W of power,
corresponding to an annual output value of US$ 421 million in 1991 cif prices.
Spare parts and equipment provided to the irrigation sector and for agricultural
machinery would sustain agricultural production, otherwise lost to rainfed
agriculture or left in the field, as no possibilities for harvesting exist..
Through spare parts and equipment financing 35,000 ha of lnd is expected to be
maintained under irrigation.   Combine harvesters for which spare parts would
be provided, would harvest 6 million tons of wheat, soybeane and maize. Spare
parts supplied to the transportation sector would ascertain continued funztioning
of tha port and the Bucharest Metro and would maintain 25 percent of '.ae fleet
of trucks and buses in operation. Spare parts for the telecommunications network
should assure continued functioning of the existing system, until improved
technology can be introduced under a more comprehenslve program.
22.         Possible political instability leading to changes of key personnel
pose a xl s  to successful implementation of this program. Lignite production
may not be sufficient to feed the Turceni and Rovinari power plants rehabilitated
under the import component. The mining component included under this project
is designed to minimize this risk. There are further risks that domestically
produced complementary spare parts would not be available leading to failure of
machinery in spite of the supply of imported goods provided for under the
proposed project. Spare parts and equipment for import financing have been
carefully selected to minimize this risk by identifying, as far 6s possible,
packages of equipment relatively little dependent on complementary domestic
goods. Through careful specification of goods to be imported and targeting of
spare parts and equipment to selected economic activities, output effects are
axpected to be assured in the short - term. Maintaining production in the longer

term would depend, among others, on further price liberalization, which w*uld
assure the financial viability of many of the beneficiaries. it would iluo depend
on efficient allocation of foreign exchange which would allow beneficiaries
access to imported spare parts and equipmnt in the future.  Longer - term
project success thus depend  on continuing economic reforms.   Future Dank
adjustment and investment lending is expected ..o play an important role in
helping to sustain this reform process.
23.         Reco.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articlos of Agreement of the Bank and recommnd that the Executive
Directoro approve it.
