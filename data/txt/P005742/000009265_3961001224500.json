macroeconomic stability while\n            overcoming the balance of payments shock caused by the Gulf\n            crisis. The main areas covered under the program are: (i)\n            the virtual completion of the liberalization of external\n            trade and prices, along with institutional reforms to assist\n            the correct functioning of markets; (ii) reforms to promote\n            financial markets and to bring bank regulation gradually up\n            to international standards; (iii) reforms of the special\n            incentives to make them economically more efficient and less\n            costly to the budget; (iv) reform of the social security\n            system to enlarge its coverage and to make it more\n            financially viable, and reduce obstacles to labor mobility;\n            and (v) the establishment of coordinated external debt\n            management, to enable Tunisia to resort increasingly to\n            international financial markets."}, "docdt": "1991-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
