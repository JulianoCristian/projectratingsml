The Project will also\n            participate in a loss reduction program in response to the\n            introduction of remote metering, automated billing, and\n            demand side management (DSM) in the pilot areas. The\n            learning expectations to be documented through this pilot\n            include the economic, and financial impacts of the\n            distribution program; the distribution of automated\n            technologies; the impact of changes on the institutional\n            capacity of the Electric Power Company of Montenegro (EPCG);\n            and, the social responsiveness to alternative service\n            practices. The two main components will: 1) provide funds\n            for the supply, and installation of equipment required for\n            the provision of remote metering, automated billing, and DSM\n            in selected areas. Technical assistance (TA) will be\n            provided for the design, procurement, training, and\n            implementation of pilot projects, as well as for monitoring\n            and evaluation; and, 2) finance the supply, and installation\n            of a computer-based management information system (MIS) in\n            EPCG, which also includes TA for its design, procurement,\n            training and implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
