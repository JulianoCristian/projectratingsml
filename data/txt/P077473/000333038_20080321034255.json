          the risk to development outcome was low or negligible, the\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Application of modern metering technology provides utilities\n            suffering from high network losses and poor collections with\n            a means of mitigating these problems. However for any\n            metering project to be effective, it will be accompanied\n            with an investment program of rehabilitation of Latvia (LV)\n            networks and feeders where the metering project is\n            implemented. Given the associated cost of modern metering\n            and network rehabilitation, utilities are advised to\n            gradually expand new metering technology in areas that will\n            yield the highest benefits as determined by a cost/benefit\n            analysis performed for the metering project. To avoid delays\n            in project implementation, adequate time and effort is\n            required to develop a suitable design for a proper metering\n            system, tender packages, the bid evaluation process, and to\n            develop a realistic plan for project implementation.\n            Significant costs will be associated with the initial stage\n            of an automatic meter reading (AMR) System project. However,\n            costs of subsequent scale up stages of the AMR system may be\n            lower due to increased implementation efficiency by utility\n            staff and the economies of scale."}, "docdt": "2007-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
