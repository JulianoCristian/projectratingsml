A: LIC Justification
1. What is to be learned (why the piloting)?
The metering and billing systems in electric power utilities did not fundamentally change
throughout the last century even in developed countries. Advances in computers and
telecommunication technology started to affect these systems only recently due to unbundling of
vertically integrated power utilities and full commercialization of independent distribution
companies. In addition, there were widespread collection problems and growing distribution losses
associated with a reduction of subsidies in many developing countries. This increased the interest
in remote metering and automated billing systems which could improve payment discipline and
reduce distribution losses through introduction of demand side management techniques. In this
context, demand side management (DSM) comprises a remote connection and disconnection of
non-payers and an introduction of modem tariff systems which enable distribution companies to
offer a variety of prices to match different patterns of consumption.
The main purpose of the Project under the Learning and Innovation Credit (LIC) is to test whether,
and to what degree, electric power distribution consumers in Montenegro will improve payment
discipline and participate in a loss reduction program in response to an introduction of remote
metering, automated billing and demand side management in pilot areas. Because of the many
unknowns involved in bringing about behavioral change of this type, a pilot project is trusted to be
the only way to reliably test response rates among the target groups of distribution consumers.
Also, the pilot will help learn about prospects of DSM techniques as applied to local infrastructure
which fell behind developments in modern distribution systems during the last decade. The current
situation in the power distribution sector in Montenegro and the project design are described in
Annex 2.
Reduction of distribution losses (particularly illegal consumption of electricity) and improvement
of collection rates is a complex task, not only technically but also culturally and institutionally. In
response to a major shortage of electricity, which caused rolling blackouts in winter 2001-2002, the
Government of Montenegro (GoM) and the power utility (EPCG) adopted a "Program for
Stabilization of EPCG" which places an emphasis on demand side measures and a financial
recovery of EPCG. The Program combines the introduction of a new tariff system, modernization
of the financial management system of EPCG and gradual introduction of DSM techniques in pilot
distribution branches followed by replication and scaling up. Therefore, GoM and EPCG view the
LIC as an instrument to develop, verify and adjust approaches that would enhance the service to
distribution consumers and enable stabilization of electricity supply through the reduction of losses
and improvement of the financial condition of EPCG.
2. How are the results going to be used (vis a vis CAS objectives and any follow-on operation)?
The Bank's program in FRY is currently within the framework of a Transitional Support Strategy
Update (TSS), which was discussed by the Board on August 8, 2002. This TSS Update' covers
FY03 and includes the LIC. The TSS Update has as key objectives the restoration 'of
macroeconomic stability and balance, stimulation of near term growth and creating a basis for a
sustainable supply response, and improving governance and building effective institutions. The
TSS outlines a program weighted towards adjustment lending (of around 80%) complemented with
key investment operations in line with the Bank's comparative advantage.
' The TSS Update continues the program established under the original FRY TSS, discussed by the Board of
Executive Directors on May 8, 2001.
6



In line with the TSS objectives, the Bank is implementing an Emergency Rehabilitation investment
operation in Serbia (with a significant institution building component in the Electric Power
Company of Serbia, EPS) as well as supporting policy reform under a SAC to reduce the
substantial quasi-fiscal liability to public finances represented by the losses incurred by EPS. In
Montenegro, a SAC was approved by the Board on August 8, 2002, which supports policy
measures to improve the fiscal position of the EPCG, among other reforms.
The proposed LIC is designed to complement the policy reforms supported by structural assistance,
towards the objectives of the TSS, by piloting mechanisms that have proven effective in other
transitional economies for improving the sustainability of the power sector. It is intended that the
knowledge generated through implementation of the LIC will facilitate the eventual privatization of
distribution services, towards a key TSS objective of creating the basis for a sustainable supply
response. The LIC is also intended to lay the basis for comprehensive institutional strengthening in
the energy sector.
2. Other countries or situations where similar efforts have shown promise
Similar demand side management measures have shown promising results in the city of Skopje and
Struga, FYR Macedonia, based on an independent review prepared by Harza in 1998. The best
economic results were achieved with usage-shifting programs, such as time-of-day rates for
thermal storage heating and load control of end-user equipment including water heaters and space
heaters. In Hungary, recently privatized power distribution company EDASZ reported significant
improvements in its financial performance and operating efficiency after the introduction of
demand side control measures, such as ripple control of household boilers. Reports on these
programs can be found in the project files.
B: Structure of the Pilot
1. How will the learning take place?
The learning will take place through a structured pilot which will define baseline performance
indicators and target values in each test area, monitor DSM impacts and costs, evaluate the
response of consumers' groups to specific measures, and adjust the program to achieve aimed
performance. The key performance indicators and the monitoring and evaluation program are
described in Annex la. The pilot will be considered ready. for replication and larger scale
implementation if the collection rate among target consumers improves and if distribution losses in
participating distribution branches are significantly reduced. A comparison of patterns of end-use
of electricity will be performed before and after the implementation of DSM pilots to determine the
energy efficiency gains at the demand side and assess the potential impact of these energy savings
on the overall energy balance in Montenegro.
It is expected that the pilot project will help identify organizational changes needed in distribution
companies to improve their financial management and provide better quality and lower cost service
to the consumers. Introduction of a state-of-the-art financial management system in conjunction
with DSM pilots and improvements in procurement methods through the adoption of Bank's
standards for competitive bidding will provide a learning experience to EPCG's staff and
management which is essential in preparing the company for eventual privatization. The company
or at least its distribution segment will be considered ready for privatization, if it returns to
profitability after years of financial losses.
2. Outcome-level test to be conducted
The pilots will test whether, and to what degree, distribution consumers will improve payment
discipline and participate in a loss reduction program in response to an introduction of remote
7



metering, automated billing and demand side management in pilot areas. A comparison of
distribution losses and collections will be made before and after the pilots to determine the
effectiveness of the distribution automation program. Also, a comparison will be made between
pilot areas and similar distribution areas in EPCG where the pilot project is not implemented.
3. Steps involved in implementing the Pilot
As detailed in the Conceptual Design of Pilot Projects (a part of the report "Reduction of Losses
-and Improvement of Collections in Electricity Distribution Companies in Montenegro" prepared by
EPCG and its consultants), the pilots will be undertaken utilizing the following steps: (i) prepare a
detailed analysis of pilot areas based on the developed technical, economic and social criteria; (ii)
explain and solicit participation of distribution consumers; (iii) organize training and consultations
with EPCG staff; (iv) conduct a public campaign to promote the reduction of losses and increase in
collections; (v) undertake preparatory works and network improvements in pilot areas; (vi)
implement the pilot projects; (vii) conduct a survey of distribution consumers and EPCG staff
involved with pilots; and (viii) analyze and report results.
4. Learning expectations to be documented in the Pilot
Economic:  The economic and financial impacts of the distribution automation program to be
developed and tested under the pilots will be evaluated during project implementation. At this
stage, it is not possible to forecast the rate of reduction of distribution losses and the rate of
collections improvement. However, a simplified analysis undertaken for selected distribution areas
indicates three groups of economic benefits: (i) short term benefits related to the disconnection of
non-payers and better access to the metering data during the preparation of pilot areas; (ii) midterm
benefits after the implementation of pilot projects include accurate and synchronized reading of
meters, better protection of meters; easier identification of illegal connections; remote connection
and disconnection of non-payers; reduction of staff in EPCG involved with meter reading and
billing; and (iii) long term benefits stem from the potential replication and scaling up of the
distribution automation program including application of tariff management and remote load
control. Data will be collected on project performance indicators to allow a full cost-benefit
calculation of the various elements of distribution pilots. The aim is to come up with an effective
and affordable model of distribution automation that can be replicated on a larger scale by
distribution companies in Montenegro with or without donor support.
Technical: The distribution automation technologies to be tested in the pilot areas and adapted to
local conditions include: (i) electronic meters; (ii) telecommunication system; and (iii) control
center computer system. The electronic meters with communication interface will be selected on
the basis of their ability to register electricity consumption, save the registered data and transmit
them via the telecommunication system, identify and register all unauthorized interventions on the
meter, and limit the load and perform control actions ordered from the control center. The main
criteria for selection of the telecommunication system includes system reliability, response time,
data protection features (safety and confidentiality) and the system cost. The hardware and
software in control centers will be tested with respect to their fail-over time, response time,
organization of database and application functions. The aim is to identify a modular and open
system design that can be extended beyond the pilot areas and efficiently cloned in other
distribution branches of EPCG.
Institutional: The distribution pilots are not merely introducing a different brand of meters. The
remote metering replaces not only the existing meters, but also introduces a new billing system and
profoundly changes the reading of meters and the administration of revenue collection. The
implementation of remote metering would change the mind set of consumers and EPCG staff, the
way the revenue collection is managed and operated, and the relationship between EPCG and its
8



distribution customers. The project will document the impact of these changes on the institutional
capacity of EPCG to improve its financial condition and increase the quality of services to
distribution consumers. Furthermore, the Management Information System (MIS) component will
help improve the institutional capacity of EPCG and learn about organizational changes needed to
support a sustainable transformation of EPCG into a financially viable company.
Social and Enviromnental: The project will concentrate upon the development of a socially and
culturally acceptable alternative to traditional practices in order to improve the service to
distribution consumers and the financial condition of EPCG. The focus on reduction of losses and
increased public awareness of resource limitations is expected to lead to technically more efficient,
socially more responsible and environmentally beneficial use of electricity. Consumers in pilot
areas will be able to directly participate in energy savings programs and will learn how to budget
for electricity expenses and how to manage their consumption patterns to achieve technical,
economic and financial benefits.
Participation: The distribution pilots rely on a high degree of participation of consumers in all
project phases starting with the public awareness campaign, the process of upgrading distribution
and supply facilities and the monitoring and evaluation of project activities. The active
participation in implementing the project is expected to raise the level of awareness and
responsibility for loss reduction among the distribution consumers and lead to improvements in
their payment discipline. The on-going preparation of the new energy law, supported by USAID,
and the energy efficiency program, funded by EAR, should facilitate the project implementation
through the necessary changes in the legal and regulatory framework including transferring of
ownership of new meters to EPCG. Also, the broader economic reforms, including improvements
in the financial condition of EPCG, supported under the SAC, should help achieve the LIC
objectives.
5. Triggers for a follow-on operation
A follow-on operation may be justified if:
* commercial (non-technical) losses in distribution pilots are significantly reduced;
* collection rates reach a high level among participating distribution consumers; and
* EPCG is successful in introducing cost cutting measures in the distribution area.
6. Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation System
The project monitoring and evaluation framework is shown in Annexes I and la. Monitoring will
be done at three levels: (i) delivery of inputs including goods and services by the project
components; (ii) project outputs at the level of pilot projects and the corporate level; and (iii) the
extent to which project objectives have been achieved. The capacity of EPCG to undertake the
monitoring and evaluation plan will be enhanced through the provision of consulting services and
training under the project.
It was agreed at negotiations that a detailed monitoring plan, including description of the process
and formnat for Project input and output monitoring, will be developed by the PMU with assistance
from the technical consultant and in consultation with customer representatives from the pilot areas
by October 1, 2002. Monitoring indicators will be both quantitative and qualitative. The key
performance indicators are presented in Annex la. This list will be expanded with a number of
different progress indicators as the monitoring plan is developed. The monitoring plan will be
reviewed semi-annually and modified as needed. It was agreed at negotiations that a progress
report including results of the on-going monitoring would be furnished to the Bank every six
months, beginning October 1, 2002.
9



The evaluation of project results will be performed by the PMU on an ongoing basis. There will be
a continuous evaluation of what works and areas that need improvements. In addition to reporting
on monitoring indicators, the PMU will include in the quarterly reports an evaluation of constraints
and proposed solutions. The main technical advisor will support the PMU and pilot supervisors in
each distribution area in reviewing project progress, issues and options for improvement.
The final evaluation will be conducted by an independent consultant based on terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank. Project impact will be evaluated based on: (i) monitoring and evaluation
reports produced by PMU; and (ii) a survey of distribution consumers who have participated in the
project. The findings of the project impact evaluation will be reviewed and discussed with EPCG
management and the Government. An action plan for the promotion of successful interventions and
possible replication and scaling up of distribution automation techniques tested under the project
will be prepared by EPCG as a part of its contribution to the Implementation Completion Report.
C: Project Components and Implementation Arrangements
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for detailed description):
The proposed project will comprise:

Note: detailed project costs are provided in Annex 3.
2. Implementation Arrangements:
a.    Administrative Arrangements. The federal and republican authorities have agreed that
EPCG will have overall responsibility for project implementation and will assure that the project
will be carried out in accordance with the Operational Manual which was adopted by EPCG on
July 16, 2002 and may be amended from time to time in agreement with the Bank.
To ensure timely and efficient project implementation, a Project Management Unit (PMU) was
established in EPCG on July 4, 2002. The PMU will oversee the implementation of the project and
will be responsible for the technical and administrative functions under the project, including the
procurement of works, goods and services. EPCG has agreed to maintain until project completion
10



the PMU with functions and responsibilities agreed with the Bank and ensure that at all times the
PMU: (i) is headed by an experienced Project Manager; (ii) has adequate staff; and (iii) is assisted,
as necessary, by consultants with qualifications, experience, and terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank.
b.    Procurement. The procurement of works, goods and services of the Bank-financed
components will be done in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The project
components not financed by the Bank would be procured in accordance with national regulations
or the co-financing institution's procurement regulations. The detailed procurement arrangements,
including a procurement plan describing the packages and the schedule for the main procurement
actions are in Annex 6.
c.     Financial Management. EPCG will be responsible for managing the project funds and for
maintaining the accounts for the project. A project-specific financial management system was
established within EPCG during project appraisal, in May 2002. A Financial Management
Specialist conducted a review of the financial management systems proposed for the project and
found the systems adequate for the purposes of implementing the project
Details of the financial management and disbursement arrangements are given in Annexes 4 and 7.
Corporate accounts will be prepared by EPCG in accordance with International Accounting
Standards (IAS) and will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. Audited
corporate accounts will be submitted to the Bank no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal
year. Project accounts, including related financial information, will be prepared by EPCG on a
cash basis and audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. The project audit report,
which will be submitted to the Bank no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, will
also include an opinion on the adequacy of SOE procedures. EPCG has agreed that that the auditor
who audits EPCG's accounts will be retained to audit the project accounts. Also, EPCG agreed to
prepare a short list of eligible audit firms that will, no later than October 1, 2002, be invited to
tender for the above mentioned audits.
d.    Project Monitoring and Bank Supervision. Project implementation will be monitored by
EPCG and the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Montenegro. The following documents
will be prepared by EPCG to facilitate project monitoring:
*  quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs), which will (i) set forth actual sources and
applications of funds for the project, both cumulatively and for the period covered by the
report, and (ii) contain an update of the project cost and procurement plan indicating the
progress in project implementation and explaining variances between the actual and
previously forecast implementation targets;
*  a Mid-Term Report prepared by EPCG and furnished to the Bank by December 31, 2003,
which will integrate the results of the monitoring and evaluation activities on the progress
achieved in carrying out the project during the period preceding the date of report. The
report would also set out the measures recommended to ensure the efficient completion of
the project and the achievement of its objectives. Based on this report, a mid-term review
would be carried out with the Bank and the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of
Montenegro by March 1, 2004; and
*  annual audit reports of EPCG and project financial statements for each fiscal year (which
coincides with the calendar year in Montenegro) prepared by independent auditors by June
30 of the next year.



The Bank's monitoring of the project will include regular supervision by the Bank's Task Team
which would review the project implementation and exchange views with EPCG and the
Government officials.
D. Risks
1. Social and environmental risks:
a. Safeguard Policies
Environmental impacts are expected to be positive as a result of the likely reduction of distribution
losses. A small scale upgrade of the distribution network in pilot areas, which is associated with the
introduction of new metering system, does not require disposal of distribution transformers.
Existing distribution transformers in pilot areas are less than 20 years old (their normal life time is
40 years) and will be moved to other locations in the network, which is a standard practice in
distribution companies. Due attention will be paid to the technical specifications of new
distribution transformers to ensure their full compliance with the latest international technical and
environmental standards.
The project seeks to promote socially responsible behavior and to introduce billing systems which
should make it easier for poor consumers to pay, benefiting both the poor and the power utility.
Also, it would reduce implicit subsidies to nonpaying consumers which often belong to a better-off
part of the population. No safeguard policies will be triggered as a result of the proposed LIC.
Environmental Category: []A  []B   [x] C  []D  []FI
b. Other Social Policy
The social risks of undertaking the project are low, as the political situation is improving and the
need to stabilize supply of electricity is widely recognized and accepted as a social priority by all
stakeholders that will be involved in the pilot projects. Project benefits are not limited to pilot areas
and any obstruction that may come from influential groups (trying to continue illegal use of
electricity) would be isolated and unacceptable to the public. The Bank's reputation is likely to
benefit from the LIC as a result of improved supply of electricity and better service to distribution
consumers which are expected outcomes of the pilot projects. The potential positive social
outcomes are high and far outweigh the low social risks to the Bank of undertaking the operation.

Annex 2
FRY: Emergency Stabilization of Electricity Supply in the Republic of Montenegro Project
Project Description
Background
The electric power sector plays an important role in the economy both directly and indirectly,
accounting for about 20 percent of industrial production in Montenegro. The power sector is
beleaguered by many problems, including deferred maintenance and lack of investments, most of
which result from electricity tariffs set by the Government well below the economic cost of supply.
In addition to the declining production, poor collections and high distribution losses critically
weaken the financial condition of EPCG which struggles to pay for electricity imports and meet the
growing demand. If these issues are not resolved, EPCG will not be able to provide a reliable
supply of electricity to households and industry, which in turn would cause a decline in the
economy and an increase in the trade deficit due to the growing electricity imports.
The supply of electricity in Montenegro depends on imports which reached 40 percent of total
demand in 2001. The evolution of electricity balance (supply and demand) during the last ten years
is shown in Table A, which illustrates a structural deficit of electric energy in Montenegro. A brief
reduction in electricity imports in the mid 1990s was caused by the collapse of industrial
consumption, which is dominated by the aluminum smelter, KAP. The re-start of KAP (which
consumed 1.74TWh in 2001) and a sharp increase in the household consumption (which practically
doubled during the last decade) caused imports to reach a level which is close to the network
physical capacity and its stability limits.

The risk of power outages and system blackouts is exacerbated by the poor condition of the Pljevlja
coal mine which supplies the only thermal power plant in Montenegro (a single 210 MW unit) and
a prolonged drought which limits the production from hydropower plants. During the last winter
the fragile electricity balance caused rolling blackouts for sixteen hours a day. In this situation, the
demand side measures appear to be the most effective means to safeguard a stable electricity
supply in the short to medium term. In addition, the improvement of the financial condition of
EPCG is also critical to secure funding for electricity imports which is currently supported by
donors. The Government of Montenegro has already initiated steps to address this problem by
increasing the price of electricity to 3.5 c/kWh in 2001. Also, the Government began preparation of
a new Energy Law which should provide a legal and a regulatory framework to support structural
reforrns in the power sector.
The proposed project will support EPCG in preparing for the sector reform through learning about
the potentials of modem computer-based technologies to reduce distribution losses, improve
17



collections and strengthen the company's financial management. It has two components: (i)
distribution pilots which deal with the introduction of remote metering and automated billing
systems in Podgorica, Niksic, Herceg Novi and Bijelo Polje; and (ii) upgrade of financial
management system in EPCG.
Project Component 1: Power Distribution Pilots (US$2.8 million)
Distribution sector of EPCG consists of 16 branches which serve all consumers at 35 kV, 10 kV
and 0.4 kV in Montenegro. Table B summarizes main features of each distribution branch
including its total losses in 2001. Table B shows major differences in per capita consumption
between distribution branches, which is due to geographical, climatic and economic reasons. The
relative consumption is highest in the coastal area (Budva and Herceg Novi) where the main
economic activity is tourism, while the mountainous areas (such as Berane and Rozaje) have about
five times lower consumption per capita. About half of the total distribution demand is
concentrated in two urban areas (Podgorica and Niksic) in central Montenegro, which account for
about 40 percent of population. The distribution consumption is dominated by households (65
percent of the total distribution consumption) while the industrial consumers at 35 kV and 10 kV
and the commercial consumers at 0.4 kV account for 20 percent and 15 percent, respectively.

Historically, distribution losses in Montenegro were 3 to 5 percent higher than the average
distribution losses in former SFR Yugoslavia due to a lower level of network development and a
high share of rural networks in the distribution system. During the last ten years, the condition of
distribution networks deteriorated because of the lack of maintenance and investments, while the
loading of network components practically doubled. While these factors contributed to a significant
increase in technical losses, the overall increase in distribution losses from 13 percent in early
1980s to almost 25 percent in 2000 was primarily driven by increasing commercial losses including
illegal and unaccounted consumption of electricity.
18



Based on the analysis of technical losses in EPCG, it is estimated that the commercial losses
account for about 10 percent of the total distribution demand or about 200 GWh in 2001. At the
current average price of electricity (3.5 c/kWh) this corresponds to the EPCG's financial losses of
about $7 million per year. In addition, it is estimated that EPCG spends about $1.1 million per year
on identification and disconnection of non-payers. The reduction of commercial losses, therefore, is
among the highest priorities in improving the company's financial condition which is critical in
ensuring a stable supply of electricity in Montenegro.
The introduction of remote metering and automated billing in pilot distribution areas under this
LIC will enable EPCG to test a modem technology which has significant potential to help reduce
commercial losses and improve collections. The program is designed to support these objectives by
installing a hierarchical metering system from the distribution supply points (at the medium voltage
side of primary distribution transformers), through the distribution network all the way to the final
consumers at 0.4 kV. The metering and associated supervisory control and data acquisition system
will enable EPCG to identify and locate the sources of commercial losses so that measures can be
taken to reduce these losses. The new electronic meters at the consumer level will enable remote
reading and disconnection, as well as automatic protection against tempering of meters. In addition,
the new system will improve the services to the distribution consumers through automatic billing
and faster response to consumers' requests.
The new metering system will be tested in carefully selected representative pilot areas in central
Montenegro (Podgorica and Niksic), on the coast (Herceg Novi) and in northern Montenegro
(Bijelo Polje). Key features of each pilot area are shown in Table C.

The selected pilots comprise 19 distribution transformer (DT) sub-areas which are located in urban
and suburban areas of Podgorica, Niksic, Herceg Novi and Bijelo Polje. They include 2686
household consumers and 627 commercial consumers, i.e. the total of 3313 consumers, which
represents 1.3 percent of all distribution consumers in Montenegro. Collection rates and estimated
commercial (non-technical) losses in the selected pilot areas are close to the EPCG's average in
Podgorica and Bijelo Polje, worse than the average in Niksic and better than the average in Herceg
Novi.
Project Component 2: Financial Management System (US$2.2 million)
EPCG is a joint stock company established on March 18, 1998, as the only successor to the public
enterprise Elektroprivreda Cme Gore. As a result of the Mass Voucher Privatization (MVP)
process in the Republic of Montenegro, the ownership structure of EPCG, on April 5, 2002,
included the Republic of Montenegro (67.7%), MVP Funds (20.2%), citizens and employees of
EPCG (12.1%). EPCG is headed by a seven-member Board of Directors which is elected by the
general meeting of shareholders. EPCG is a vertically integrated utility which comprises three
branches for production of electricity; two branches for transmission and dispatch of electricity;
sixteen branches for distribution of electricity; and one branch for construction of electric power
facilities.
19



A review of EPCG's financial management and performance confirms that, as in most transition
countries, EPCG has been adversely affected by both extemal and internal factors. The external
factors pertain to the overall economic with many industrial enterprises (especially KAP, the
aluminum plant which accounts for about 45% the country's electricity demand) being supported at
the cost of EPCG through preferential and below-cost prices without corresponding reimbursement
to EPCG. The overall economic reforms, including the efficiency enhancement at KAP and other
enterprises, hold promise for EPCG also and are being supported under the complementary SAC.
These reforms, including pricing, are critical for EPCG's ability to cover costs and undertake the
much needed and delayed modernization and rehabilitation. In addition, debt relief is also expected
to help EPCG return to profitability sooner.
At the same time, certain areas under EPCG's control are key to reduce losses (both technical and
non-technical), improve collections, control costs and investments, etc. The proposed project would
assist EPCG in undertaking these measures during in medium-term as the sector and the company
aim to tum around the performance.
The Project will initiate the establishment of a modem financial management information system
(FMS) as a part of an overall MIS in EPCG. The MIS will include systems and procedures to
enable EPCG to exercise better and timely control over critical matters, including its financial
transactions. The strategy involves a phased approach to developing a corporate wide MIS, with
the first phase under the Project aimed at financial management (especially working capital
management), which would be designed and implemented first at headquarters and the distribution
operations of EPCG. This will assist EPCG in automated information exchange and analyses of
critical data related to sales/billing, collections, technical and commercial losses, etc. The system
could also assist in the monitoring and evaluation of the Project activities, in addition to serving
corporate wide needs. A consultant will be recruited to design the FMS, define the specifications
and assist in procurement of suitable IT systems, supervise the implementation of the selected
system and organize a training for the EPCG staff under the Project.
The design phase of the MIS is expected to span over a two-year period. Technical assistance
estimated to cost about US$0.3 million will cover design, procurement and implementation of MIS
in EPCG. The consultants will first design an appropriate MIS for EPCG, prepare the specifications
and tender documents and assist EPCG in the procurement of the necessary IT systems. The design
scope includes both hardware and software and any required customization. Subsequently, the
consultants will also assist EPCG in supervision of the implementation of the MIS and in training
of EPCG staff. A firm with expertise in the full range of data/system analyses and design,
procurement and supervision of implementation will be recruited under Bank guidelines.
The MIS will be implemented with all necessary hardware and software in a LAN/WAN
configuration with tele-connectivity as required and will be suitably customized for EPCG's needs.
The systems would link at a minimum EPCG's headquarters with the distribution operations.
Implementation is expected to span about 15-18 months under a supply-and-install type contract.
The estimated cost of this phase of MIS is about US$2.0 million. The implementation would be
tested in pilot areas selected by the Project for testing the new meters to ensure full functionality
and subsequent monitoring and evaluation. A team of EPCG staff would work closely with the
consultants and contractors during implementation.

Financial Management
Financial Management Arrangements. EPCG is responsible for managing the project funds. A
PMU, headed by EPCG's Sector Director, was established during project appraisal and includes a
project financial specialist. The project does not involve complex financial flows. It is anticipated
that the project will generate approximately 10 procurement packages requiring not more than 30
payment transactions over the three year life of the project. The PMU's financial specialist who is
responsible for maintaining the financial records has only limited accounting knowledge. However,
given the small number of payment transactions expected, his experience is sufficient to perforrn
this role.
Accounting Arrangements and Fund Flows.   The PMU will maintain a spreadsheet based
accounting system, separate from EPCG's financial accounting system, to track project funds. The
spreadsheet package comprises a cash book, a sources and uses of funds statement, a procurement
monitoring report, an implementation progress report, and a schedule of project monitorable
indicators. The project accounting system will allow for the automatic production of a source and
application of funds statement. The final format of the reports to be presented to the Bank was
agreed during negotiations. The project accounts, which will be maintained on a cash basis, will be
reconciled to the corporate accounts periodically.
Because of the limited number of payment transactions anticipated under the project, and because
of the PMU's lack of prior experience of administering World Bank projects, the PMU will not
maintain a Special Account. It is anticipated that the majority of transactions will be funded
directly by the Bank with a limited number of payments reimbursed to EPCG against properly
authorized Statements of Expenditures (SOE's) or full documentation.
Audit. EPCG currently prepares annual financial statements in accordance with Montenegrin
accounting standards. The company will prepare, throughout the period of project implementation,
corporate financial statements in accordance with IAS (the new Montenegrin accounting law,
which should become effective by January 1, 2003, mandates the use of a subset of the current
international standards). The company will appoint, on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank,
an auditor acceptable to the Bank to audit the corporate financial statements and the project
accounts. The audit of the project accounts will include an opinion on the use of funds reimbursed
via SOEs.
Financial Management Action Plan. The EPCG has agreed on the following time bound action
plan to further strengthen project financial management:
* EPCG to prepare a shortlist of auditors acceptable to the Bank that will be invited to tender for
the corporate and project audits by October 1, 2002.
* PMU's financial specialists to attend FM course by December 31, 2002.

Procurement Arrangements
All Bank-financed procurement will be in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for "Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 as revised in January and August 1996,
September 1997, and January 1999)". Procurement of consultancy services under the project would
follow the Bank's Guidelines for "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers (January 1997 as revised in September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002)". Table A
provides the details of the procurement arrangements for main expenditure categories, including

Note 1: Local costs financed by EPCG.
All procurement under the project will be conducted by EPCG. During the project appraisal, a
Bank mission performed a procurement capacity assessment of EPCG and the project PMU,
including an interview with its lead procurement specialist. The main findings were discussed and
an Action Plan was agreed with EPCG, as recorded in the Procurement Capacity Assessment. The
company was rated high-risk from a procurement standpoint. Therefore, the PMU's procurement
capacity needs strengthening to ensure satisfactory project implementation. To achieve this goal,
the following key actions should be taken:
*  EPCG needs training in procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. A one week training
will be provided by the Bank's procurement specialists by September 1, 2002.
*  EPCG should use technical consultants funded under the LIC for preparation of bidding
documents, evaluation of bids and project implementation, specifically for two IT packages.
*  The PMU which was established in EPCG on July 4, 2002 (Decision Number 1001-7879)
should be fully staffed and operational throughout the project implementation.
24



* Procurement activities will be overseen by the PMU's procurement specialist who will be
assisted by a procurement assistant. They will be responsible to quarterly update the
procurement plan for the LIC and to carry out the procurement.
IT Systems.  Two contracts will be awarded for computer-based systems under the LIC: (i)
contract for supply and installation of an automated distribution metering and billing system; and
(ii) contract for supply and installation of a MIS in EPCG. Both systems will be procured under the
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) method, following a prequalification of bidders.
Goods, Vehicles and Materials. All bidding packages for the procurement of goods, vehicles and
materials for distribution automation estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equivalent per
contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$1,500,000 equivalent, may be procured
under International Shopping procedures and will be subject to the Bank's prior review. The IS
procedure will be followed for procurement of distribution transformers, medium voltage (MV)
and low voltage (LV) cables, test vehicles, cranes and tools. The NS (National Shopping)
procedure may be used for miscellaneous equipment, supplies, materials and products estimated to
cost less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed
US$200,000. Contracts following the Bank's National Shopping (NS) procedure for supply of
materials and goods would be subject to the Bank's ex-post review after contract award except for
the first two contracts which will be submitted for prior review by the Bank.
Consulting Services. Two contracts will be awarded to consulting firms under the project: (i)
contract with a consulting firm with intemational expertise in distribution automation, awarded
under the Quality-Based Selection (QBS) method; and (ii) contract with a consulting firm with
intemational expertise in power sector restructuring and management information systems,
awarded under the Quality-Based Selection (QBS) method. EPCG will fund engineering
consultants with local expertise to assist in preparing detail technical specifications for
procurement of goods and materials under the project. However, the consulting firm advising
EPCG on distribution automation will also be involved in reviewing and quality control of bidding
documents for procurement of goods and materials associated with this project component.
The threshold for prior review will be $50,000 for consulting firms and $20,000 for individual
consultants. In addition, terms of reference for all consulting contracts will be also subject to the
Bank's prior review. Individual consultants will be selected (per Sections 5.1-5.4 of the Bank's
Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants) to assist EPCG in monitoring and
evaluation of distribution pilots.

Disbursement Arrangements
Table A shows the allocation of Credit proceeds by category and disbursement percentages in each
category. The Credit closing date would be August 31, 2005, i.e., six months after the estimated
completion of the project.
Table A: Allocation of Credit Proceeds
Expenditure Category           Amount               Financing Percentage
In US$ million
1. Goods, including supply and   4.0       80% of foreign expenditures;
installation of IT systems                 83% of local expenditures.
2. Consulting Services           0.5       81% for services by firms;
75% for services by foreign individuals; and
68% for services by local individuals.
3. Unallocated                   0.5
Total                            5.0
Statement of Expenditures (SOE) Some of the proceeds of the grant are expected to be disbursed
on the basis of Statement of Expenditures as follows: (a) goods costing less than US$50,000
equivalent for each contract; (b) service contracts for firms costing less than US$50,000 equivalent
each; and (c) service contracts for individual consultants costing less than US$20,000 each.
Disbursements against goods and services exceeding the above limits will be made against full
documentation and in accordance with respective procurement guidelines. Related documentation
in support of SOEs will not be submitted to the Bank but will be retained by the PMU for at least
one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement is
made. The PMU will make these documents available to the auditors and supervision missions for
review. If ineligible expenditures, including those not justified by evidence furnished, are financed
from Bank funds, the Bank will require that the funds be repaid to the Bank.
It is anticipated that the majority of expenditures under the project will be settled via direct
payment. A limited number of eligible expenditures paid by EPCG will be reimbursed on the basis
of SOEs or full documentation.
Internal Controls. Operational procedures and guidelines for project financial management are
documented in an Operational Manual, encompassing all levels of project management and
administration. An Operational Manual, including financial management procedures and staffing,
identification of accounting and auditing standards and procedures used for the project, project
reporting and monitoring, procurement procedures and the format of financial monitoring reports
was adopted by EPCG/ PMU on July 16, 2002. EPCG will review with the Bank and update the
Operational Manual at least once a year starting in September 2002.
