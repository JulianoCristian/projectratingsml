          INDIA: SECOND NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL PROGRAM

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



1.     The closing date for the Second National Tuberculosis Control Program
(P078539) (Credit No. 4228-IN) will be extended from March 31, 2012 until September
30, 2012.

2.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) (from the Credit Agreement) is to
support the Government of India’s Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program
(RNTCP), aimed at treating and reducing the incidence of tuberculosis (TB). Specific
objectives (from the Project Appraisal Document) are (i) to achieve the global targets of
70% case detection and 85% cure rate in 100% of the districts; and (ii) for the zones
where Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) has been under
implementation for five or more years, the incidence of smear-positive TB starts to
decline. The project has made significant progress on the first outcome, as the number of
districts that have reached the global targets has increased to 284 from the 2006 baseline
of 168. With regard to the second outcome, the estimated incidence of TB has declined to
1.10% from a baseline of 1.50%. Nationally, the program has overall met the global
targets, exceeding 70% detection of new smear positive TB cases (73.5% to the third
quarter of 2011) and successfully treating over 85% of those cases (87.6% to the third
quarter of 2011). The program has had considerable success in collaboration with the
national HIV/AIDS program, has expanded care for pediatric cases, and has started scale-
up of response to multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB).

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow time for appraisal of a government
request for additional financing and extension of the project. A detailed action plan for
the next six months has been agreed with the Project. Project activities will continue
during this period.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project.
