as\n            follows: overall outcome was satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low to moderate, and both the Bank\n            and the borrower performance were satisfactory. The\n            following are key lessons that have been derived from the\n            implementation of this project: (1) Government commitment,\n            leadership and support are paramount for increasing case\n            detection and cure rates. (2) Sharpening the focus on\n            targeted groups and setting realistic project targets.\n            Having realistic project targets within the life of the\n            project are critical to guide future implementation.\n            Sharpening the focus of the program on specific groups with\n            higher probability of TB case concentration will bring more\n            return on investment. (3) Investing in new technologies is\n            essential for moving the program to its next phase of\n            universal coverage. Adopting newer diagnostic technologies\n            is more technically appropriate and cost effective in the\n            long run. (4) The need for more information regarding the\n            emergence of Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in\n            India. More work should be done to find out the reasons\n            behind the emergence of MDR-TB and how to mitigate the\n            incidence through lessons from other countries. (5) More\n            focus on quality. Improving the quality of physical\n            infrastructure of the laboratories, improving biosafety\n            measures and medical waste management practices,\n            strengthening the training and technical capacity of\n            providers to improve the quality of clinical care, and\n            improving the quality of supervision and reporting are\n            critical for the success of the program. (6) Addressing\n            gender issues should be integral to program design and\n            operations. The current program does not focus on the impact\n            of the disease on gender. Documenting health seeking\n            behavior by gender and the social factors that impact it\n            could provide useful lessons for TB program in India and for\n            other countries."}, "docdt": "2013-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
