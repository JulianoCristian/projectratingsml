70 percent case detection and 85 percent cure\n            rate in 100 percent of the districts; and (2) in those the\n            zones where Directly Observed Treatment, short course (DOTS)\n            has been under implementation for five or more years, to\n            cause the incidence of smear-positive Tuberculosis (TB) to\n            start to decline. The closing date for the will be extended\n            from March 31, 2012 until September 30, 2012. The project\n            has made significant progress on the first outcome, as the\n            number of districts that have reached the global targets has\n            increased to 284 from the 2006 baseline of 168. With regard\n            to the second outcome, the estimated incidence of TB has\n            declined to 1.10 percent from a baseline of 1.50 percent.\n            Nationally, the program has overall met the global targets,\n            exceeding 70 percent detection of new smear positive TB\n            cases (73.5 percent to the third quarter of 2011) and\n            successfully treating over 85 percent of those cases (87.6\n            percent to the third quarter of 2011). The extension is\n            necessary to allow time for appraisal of a government\n            request for additional financing and extension of the\n            project. A detailed action plan for the next six months has\n            been agreed with the Project. Project activities will\n            continue during this period. This will be the first\n            extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
