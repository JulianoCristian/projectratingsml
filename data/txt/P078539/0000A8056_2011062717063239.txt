                         (i) to achieve the global targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure rate in 100% of the districts; and (ii) for the zones where DOTS has been under
                         implementation for five or more years, the incidence of smear-positive TB starts to decline.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In 2008, out of the estimated 9.4 million new TB cases worldwide, 2 million were estimated to have occurred in India, making it the country with the largest number of new TB cases
                         annually. In 2008, among all ages in India, tuberculosis (TB) was the third most common cause of death due to infectious diseases. At the same time, among the 15-49 age group,
                         TB was the most common cause of death due to infectious disease, accounting for 28% of infectious disease deaths and 6.4% of all deaths. In 2009, it is estimated that 280,000
                         Indians died of TB. The program supported by IDA has had a substantial impact on the TB epidemic in India, estimated to have saved over 2 million lives since its inception in 1997.
                         Although performance varies across districts and states, the program has met key national level objectives, in 2010 diagnosing 71% of new smear positive TB cases and

                         coordination with the HIV/AIDS program, which referred almost 400,000 people to the TB program in 2010, of whom over 35,000 were diagnosed and provided treatment. The

                         emerging plan for the 2012-17 period. This will entail continued expansion of first-line diagnosis and treatment using the DOTS strategy, as well as scale-up of the response to MDR-

                         TB. The partners concluded that the program provides an excellent basis for further expansion and absorption of anticipated substantially increased domestic funding. This includes
                         experience so far with engagement with the private sector, which provides a basis for the greatly scaled-up effort that will be needed to achieve the new "universal access" objectives.
                         The program expressed the desire for continued technical engagement and support from international partners during its next phase.
