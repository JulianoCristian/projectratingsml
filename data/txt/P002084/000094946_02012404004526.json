Lessons are outlined as\n            follows. While the project was limited in its scope to\n            rehabilitation, and institutional building within the State\n            Water Agency (SWA), thus limited in its impact, the Bank\n            rightly used the project to initiate, and promote policy\n            reforms. To this end, the sector was well positioned on the\n            national agenda - once political stabilization was achieved\n            - and, it is important to note that this could not have been\n            achieved, had it not been for the interest emerged,\n            championed within the country, for initiating, and\n            implementing reforms. However, it also holds true that in a\n            country where logistics are often difficult, projects should\n            be kept focused only on few states: management\n            infrastructure was weak to supervise the large number of\n            subprojects, which led to delays; rather a focus on full\n            rehabilitation would have been preferred, which could have\n            raised awareness, and capacity building within all SWAs.\n            This obviously led to a large number of small contracts,\n            which could not attract international contractors, but\n            instead overstreched national capacity. In designing water\n            supply works, perspectives should lie on getting water to\n            the ultimate beneficiary: benefits however were constrained\n            by inadequate distribution networks, a factor which could\n            have been solved by the SWAs financing additional works\n            themselves, provided political stability existed. Other\n            lessons reinforce project preparation be well advanced prior\n            to loan effectiveness; funds should be secured; Project\n            Preparation Facility mechanisms be used as needed; and,\n            reliable performance indicators facilitate the monitoring process."}, "docdt": "2001-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
