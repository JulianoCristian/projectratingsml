agrees to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
I.
Loan Agreement:

in paragraph "(m)"; and (c)  adding a new paragraph at the end of paragraph "(m)" 
which shall read as follows:
    "(n) ‘Action Plan’ means the Borrower’s plan of action, acceptable to the 
Bank, set forth in a letter from SEOPC to the Bank dated November 30, 2001, 
which plan includes the  Project activities that remain to be carried out by 
the Borrower and a timetable for said Project activities.".

follows:
      "(b)  Without limitation to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
Section and except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall carry 
out the Project in accordance with the Highway Investment and Maintenance 
Programs, the Institutional
Development Program, the Environmental Manual and 
the 
Action Plan, with due regard to the Performance Monitoring Indicators.
(c)  Without limitation to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
Section, the Borrower shall allocate in each of its annual budgets for Fiscal 
Years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and make available promptly as
