been accompanied by solid poverty reduction.\n            Between 2000 and 2013, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at\n            eight percent per year, resulting in a 170 percent increase\n            in real GDP. As the poor almost uniquely depend on labor to\n            generate income, the strong reduction in poverty suggests\n            tangible improvements in employment outcomes over this\n            period. This jobs and employment study focuses on the recent\n            dynamics in Rwanda\u2019s jobs\u2019 landscape. Using data from a\n            variety of sources, mainly the three integrated households\n            living conditions surveys (EICV1, EICV2, and EICV3) and the\n            2011 establishment census, the report looks at what workers\n            in Rwanda are doing and what they are making, and how this\n            has changed over the past ten to fifteen years. Most of the\n            report focuses on the five years between 2006 and 2011,\n            although at times, the authors will also look at the\n            evolution since 2001. The report concludes with a number of\n            ideas to address Rwanda\u2019s jobs challenge in the near future."}, "docdt": "2015-06-01T01:18:02Z"}
