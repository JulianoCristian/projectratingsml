Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Project implementation has progressed satisfactorily since the previous ISR. Data production and dissemination activities advanced well: data
 processing for the EICV4, Rwanda’s main source of poverty and household consumption information, has been completed and data analysis is ongoing.
 New poverty numbers are expected to be released in June 2015. The Establishment Census has been completed, data analysis is ongoing and the
 report is expected to be published in June 2015. The Integrated Business Enterprise Survey has also been completed and data analysis is ongoing.
 Data collection for DHS-5 is ongoing and results are expected in time for final reporting on the Millennium Development Goals. All key economic
 statistics (most notably the CPI and quarterly GDP figures) have been published according to the established timetable. The second User Satisfaction
 Survey has been completed and the report will be disseminated in May-June 2015.
 On capacity development, statisticians in all 30 Districts have been trained on the web-based software for the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics
 Systems. By January 2015, all Districts were using the system and were able to generate the required reports. 13 staffs of NISR benefited from a
 training on the production of Trade Expenditure statistics by the IMF. Another 13 staffs were trained on poverty analysis in the framework of the EICV4.
  NISR continued its efforts in the dissemination of statistical products: Census district profiles and the Census Geo Atlas have been finalized in
 December 2014 and were posted on NISR’s website. Data from the 2013 National Agricultural Survey and 10 percent of the data of the 2012 Population
 and Housing Census will be made available on NADA in June 2015 for users to download.
 The last two advances under the project (Rwf 289,675,271 and Rwf 524,766,774) were disbursed to NISR in January and March 2015, respectively.
 Disbursement now stands at 99.8%. Since the previous ISR, the team worked closely with the client to settle all outstanding expenditure documentation.
 Due to staff turnover at NISR at the time, the PIU failed to submit a withdrawal application to document expenditures worth Rwf 1.26 billion
 (approximately $1.8 million). The outstanding expenditures were properly documented in February 2015.
 On the procurement side, a new Procurement Specialist was hired in to replace the former PS who left in July 2014. Procurement issues that were
 identified during the PPR of the last fiscal year have largely been addressed, which has led to the upgrading of the procurement rating from MU to MS
 follwoing this year's PPR.
