       satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Grantee performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: establishing a functioning donor coordination and\n            engagement mechanism is a key for effective project\n            monitoring and timely identification of problems. The GoR\n            has demonstrated a high level of commitment to statistical\n            development as witnessed by the increasing budget allocation\n            to the NISR and the presence of top government officials at\n            the NISR\u2019s outreach and dissemination events. This high\n            level of commitment kept pressure on the NISR to deliver in\n            a consistent and timely fashion. The SRF\u2019s alignment to a\n            nationally defined ambitious though realistic plan increased\n            the sense of ownership of the project and ensured that the\n            implementation of NSDS-1 amounted de facto to the\n            implementation of the SRF. In addition, the culture of\n            accountability and performance contracts within the\n            government meant that specific NISR staff members were\n            individually accountable for the implementation of\n            well-defined SRF activities, contributing to effective\n            implementation of the project. Finally, Bank teams need to\n            be realistic about the timeline for project implementation.\n            The too short timeline (25 months) that was originally\n            planned for implementation was one of the elements\n            warranting a project restructuring. Especially in cases\n            where the client has no prior experience in working with\n            Bank procedures and regulations, timelines need to be set\n            realistically as start-up delays will likely occur."}, "docdt": "2015-12-10T22:58:05Z"}
