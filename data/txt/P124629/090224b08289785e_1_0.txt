Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily after having overcome start-up difficulties that warranted a modest project restructuring and an
 extension of the closing date (see previous ISR). With the support from the Bank and other development partners, the National Institute of Statistics of
 Rwanda (NISR) completed the first National Strategy for the Development of statistics (NSDS-1, covering 2009-2014) and the second NSDS (2014/15-
 2018/19) has been approved by Cabinet in September 2014.
 NISR has made progress during the NSDS-1, witnessed by Rwanda’s increasing score on the World Bank’s statistical capacity indicators (from 67 in
 2008 to 73 in 2013). By the end of 2013, Rwanda ranked 6th on statistical capacity in Sub-Sahara Africa.
 To allow NISR to complete all ongoing but unfinished NSDS-1 activities and kickstart NSDS-2 activities, the MOU for the NSDS Basket Fund (between
 The World Bank, DfID and the EU on the one hand and the GoR on the other hand) that expired on June 30th, 2014 was extended for one extra year.
 Data production and dissemination activities advanced well since the previous ISR. Results from the 2012 Population and Housing Census were
 disseminated during a public event on April 1st, 2014, heavily attended by Ministers, members of Parliament, development partners, academia and civil
 society. The census put Rwanda’s population at 10.5 million and highlighted strong progress in public health and education. Microdata from the census
 are however not publicly available yet. Results from the experimental National Agricultural Survey were launched on April 17th and provided much-
 needed information for planning, monitoring and evaluation of agricultural programs. This agricultural survey will now be conducted annually. Fieldwork
 for the fourth Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (the EICV-4, the main source of poverty data in Rwanda) progressed according to plan
 and was completed on October 18th. Data processing is ongoing and the new poverty figures are expected to be released in the first quarter of next
 calendar year. For the first time the EICV-4 also collected panel data, which will offer valuable insights on individual poverty dynamics over the 2011-
 2014 period. The fifth Demographic and Health Survey was launched in August 2014. On labor and businesses statistics, the first Integrated Business
 Enterprise Survey and the second establishment census (a census of formal and informal businesses) both kicked off in July 2014.
 Related to macro statistics, NISR continued to publish the CPI before the 10th of each month. The National Accounts have been rebased with base year
 updated to 2011 (from 2006) and the methodology has been upgraded to adhere to SNA2008. Results of the rebasing were launched in May 2014 and
 the new SUT was published in June. The rebased GDP figures were similar to the old ones (2013 GDP was PEACE% higher with the updated base
 year).
 On the procurement side, the NISR Procurement Specialist, who had been trained in Bank procurement protocols, left in July 2014 and has not yet
 been replaced (recruitment is expected to be completed by end of November). This could potentially negatively impact procurement operations over the
 coming period. For now, the procurement rating is held at moderately satisfactory.
 On the FM side, NISR continued to upgrade its capabilities in the project unit with the assistance and guidance of World Bank specialists. This is
 reflected in the timely preparation and submissions of IFRs, in form and content acceptable to the Bank (with however recommendations for
 improvement). In March 2014 NISR received an unqualified audit for the fiscal year 2012-2013 from the Auditor General.
 There has been no disbursement since the previous ISR, which is largely due to the departure of the DDG for Corporate Services, and the replacement
 with a new DDG who is not an accredited Signatory and does not have a token to log into the withdrawal application system. NISR is working with the
 Bank to resolve this at the soonest and is confident that disbursement rate will reach 100% by the end of June 2015. Current disbursement stands at
 88%.
 In March 2014, in the framework of a DECDG project, NISR, the World Bank, and UNWOMEN co-hosted a 3-day workshop on gender statistics in
 Rwanda (financed by the Bank). The workshop brought together staff of NISR, line Ministries and staff from the Ethiopian Central Statistics Agency to
 build capacity in the production, compilation and dissemination of gender statistics. Building on this workshop, NISR staff attended a South-South
 exchange meeting on gender statistics in Addis Ababa in September 2014.
 Since the previous ISR, a World Bank team prepared a PforR operation on Public Sector Governance in Rwanda. This PforR was approved by the
 Board on October 31st, 2014 and will, among others, support the development of statistics within the framework of NSDS-2.
