1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In 2011, Rwanda was on a development path that most observers would not
have anticipated 15 years earlier. Between 1996 and 2011, the gross domestic product
(GDP) grew at an average rate of more than 8 percent per year, resulting in a threefold
increase in the size of the economy. During the same period, the government of Rwanda
(GoR) embarked on an ambitious long-run development strategy (Vision 2020) to
transform the country from a low-income agriculture-based economy to a middle-income
knowledge-based service economy by 2020.

2.     Toward the late 2000s, Rwanda’s National Statistical System (NSS) was
inadequately structured and equipped to meet the growing demand for data. The
National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) had only been recently established (in
2005) and the constraints of the NISR and other official data producers included (a) limited
technical experience; (b) scarce human and financial resources; (c) limited coordination
within the NSS; (d) inadequate dissemination mechanisms; and (e) fragmented funding
arrangements that financed statistical activities on an ad hoc basis. Earlier initiatives to
address the constraints had been patchy, uncoordinated, and partly driven by the
availability of external resources. There had been little opportunity to develop a long-term,
sustainable, coherent, and realistic strategy for the development of the NSS.

3.      In a bid to address the abovementioned challenges, the GoR developed the first
National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS) covering 2009 to 2014. The
NSDS provided a framework for developing the NSS and aimed to provide relevant,
reliable, coherent, timely, and accessible statistical information and services to various
sectors of society in a coordinated and sustainable manner. The NSDS consisted of five
main components: (a) data development and management, (b) information dissemination
and services to users, (c) coordination of the NSS, (d) capacity development (human and
infrastructure), and (e) financing and other corporate services. The NSDS was officially
launched in October 2010.

4.     At project appraisal, other development partners (DPs) were already aligned
around a common strategy—the NSDS. As of October 2010, the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development (DFID) and the European Union (EU)
supported the NSDS program activities through a basket fund (BF) arrangement, while
other partners (United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF], United Nations Development
Programme [UNDP], United Nations Women, United Nations Population Fund [UNFPA],
African Development Bank [AfDB], and the Belgian Technical Cooperation) were
providing support through separate financing mechanisms. DP support to the NSDS was
coordinated through a national partnership group (NPG)—the Steering Committee (SC)—
that met every three months to review progress made over the past quarter and discuss and
approve work plans and budgets for the coming quarter.




                                             1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

5.      The original PDO, as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the
Grant Agreement (GA), was to improve the quality and timeliness of statistical information,
as well as making it accessible to users. Progress toward the PDO was measured by three
PDO-level indicators, each corresponding to a key element of the PDO:

       (a) Data quality. Adherence to standards on data quality set by NISR on agreed
           methods of compilation of statistics related to Government Finance Statistics
           (GFS), Balance of Payments (BoP), and national accounts (NA) through
           adoption of International Standards for Industrial Classification (ISIC),
           Standards for International Trade Classification (SITC), and International
           Standards for Classification of Occupations (ISCO).

       (b) Timeliness. Timeliness and frequency of publication of key statistics in line
           with national standards agreed with the NISR and ministries, departments, and
           agencies (MDAs).

       (c) Data access. Data readily available to users through an open data portal.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

6.     Although the project underwent a Level II restructuring in 2013, the original PDO
and results framework remained unchanged as they continued to be adequate and relevant.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      According to the PAD, the main beneficiaries of the operation are key producers
and users of statistics in Rwanda. They include (a) the NISR and key MDAs, local
government authorities, and the Common Performance Assessment Framework and
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) monitoring systems;
(b) policymakers and planners in the public and private sectors; (c) researchers and
academia; (d) non-state actors; (e) international organizations, including the DPs; and (f)
the general public (through better and faster access to information). Benefits were expected
to materialize through the strengthened capacity of data producers to produce high-quality,
timely, and relevant data, which would be made easily and readily accessible to data users.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

8.     In line with the government’s program (NSDS), the project had five components:

Component 1 - Data Development and Management (US$6 million)
9.     This component supported a number of activities to strengthen the quality of data
that was produced, including (a) financing of agreed NSDS priority surveys and censuses,
including the 2012 Population and Housing Census (PHC), that are specified in the NSDS


                                             2
Integrated Work Plan for 2011/12–2013/14; (b) providing technical assistance and training
for adapting internationally accepted standards and methodologies in data collection,
compilation, and validation by the NISR and key MDAs; (c) development of economic and
social statistics on issues relating to NA, price statistics, business statistics, agriculture,
health, education, poverty and living standards, and employment; (d) improvement of the
basic elements of the statistical infrastructure, particularly statistical registers, sampling
frames, classifications and methodologies, acquisition of statistical computer packages,
and a Geographical Information System for statistical mapping; and (e) improving quality
control and assurance of statistical production processes.

Component 2 - Information Dissemination and Services to Users (US$1 million)
10.      This component supported improvements in services for users, including (a)
consultancy services aimed at improving publication and dissemination of regular
statistical publications produced by the NISR and its key partners in the implementation of
the NSDS; (b) updating of the NISR website; (c) strengthening of the NISR metadata for
surveys and censuses; (d) digitization of statistical information for storage and use in the
NISR library; and (e) developing an information dissemination and micro data access
policy framework—including carrying out workshops, financing statistical advocacy, and
other activities directed toward creating demand for data—based on the principle of equal
access to data and consistent with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics adopted
by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 1994 and General Data Dissemination
System. It also supported consultancy services for the development of an open data portal
which enabled civil society, nongovernmental organizations, researchers, and the private
sector to access NISR and NSS data for policymaking, commercial, or research purposes.
It further supported consultancy services for the establishment of an electronic national
data archive that enabled the NISR to allow users to access micro data while at the same
time safeguarding confidentiality of the survey respondents.

Component 3 - Coordination of NSS (US$1 million)
11.     This component supported the institutionalizing and strengthening of frameworks
for coordination of the NSS. It supported consultancy services and workshops for review
and improvement of existing institutional frameworks so that the interaction and dialog
between the NISR and statistical agencies in the MDAs is institutionalized and streamlined,
thereby increasing the efficiency of the system. It also financed the development of
protocols, standard methodologies, instruments, structures, and programs and the provision
of information and communication technology solutions to promote coordination among
the various institutions in the NSS and enhance efficiency in data development,
management, and dissemination. Among other things, protocols emphasized the placement
of all key MDAs’ official statistics on the open data portal, developed by the NISR in
collaboration with other MDAs and information and communication technologies
providers in Rwanda. It was also to support the NSS-wide expenditure analysis (public
expenditure review) that reviews the current NSS-wide allocation of resources, suggests
areas for rationalization, and provides an estimate of the overall resources required to carry
out statistical activities in the entire NSS on a sustainable basis.




                                              3
Component 4 - Capacity Development (Human and Infrastructure) (US$1.5 million)
12.     This component supported capacity development that would help address the
shortage of professional staff currently prevailing in the NISR and the selected MDAs. It
provided staff with training in basic and advanced statistical methodologies and techniques,
particularly those that support the priority indicators for the EDPRS and the Millennium
Development Goals. It also supported the establishment of twinning arrangements between
the NISR and other national statistics offices. The NISR would work closely with a
university to develop appropriate syllabi for teaching of applied statistics at the college and
university level. This component further supported acquisition of computer hardware, data
management systems, and other equipment needed for field data collection and analysis. It
supported development of statistical infrastructure and data management systems.

Component 5 - Financing and Corporate Services (Project Implementation) (US$0.5
million)
13.     This component supported the project’s operating costs. The NISR was the main
executing agency of the NSDS program and is responsible for its management. To
effectively carry out project implementation and daily project administrative work, the
NISR identified the need to strengthen the NSDS coordination team—and committed to
doing so—to coordinate activities of the NISR and MDAs that were expected to benefit
from project funds; manage reporting and auditing activities; and ensure compliance with
the procurement, disbursement, and financial management (FM) policies and procedures.
The functions of this office included expenditure management and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) of the activities of the NISR and project-benefiting MDAs.

1.6 Revised Components

14.     Following the Level II restructuring of August 20, 2013, approved by the country
director, the following activities were added to the components:

Component 4 - Capacity Development (Human and Infrastructure)

15.    Two additional activities were added to this component:

       (a) Supporting the review and development of the second phase of the program
           (the elaboration of NSDS-2)

       (b) Carrying out office rehabilitation and refurbishment to provide for a modern
           conference and training room at the NISR building, including fitting of audio,
           visual, and video conferencing facilities.

Component 5 - Financing and Corporate Services (Project Implementation)

16.    Under this component, the activity ‘Carrying out monitoring and evaluation and
auditing of the project’ was replaced with ‘Establishing an automated monitoring and
evaluation system and carrying out monitoring and evaluation and auditing of the project’.



                                              4
17.      The revisions were aimed at (a) facilitating a seamless and smooth transition
between NSDS-1 and NSDS-2, (b) progressively reducing the NISR’s dependence on
expensive external facilities for conferences and trainings, and (c) improving and
facilitating M&E practices within the NISR.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

18.     The project was restructured on August 20, 2013. Besides a number of additional
activities (see previous section), the restructuring changed the allocation of funds across
categories and extended the closing date from June 30, 2014 to June 30, 2015. US$1 million
of unused funds were reallocated from category 2 (Components 2, 3, and 4) to category 1
(Component 1).

19.     The extension of the closing date was requested by the GoR to allow enough time
to complete all key project activities and attain the PDO given the time lost during start-up
(project implementation had been behind schedule in the early days of the project due to
procurement and FM-related issues that were progressively resolved in 2013). The
reallocation of funds to Component 1 (data production) aimed at supporting the NISR in
the implementation of NSDS-2 priority surveys such as the fourth Integrated Household
Living Conditions Survey (EICV) and the fifth Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
and at facilitating a smooth transition from NSDS-1 to NSDS-2. One important point to be
highlighted is the consistency of these financed activities with the PDO and initial
indicators, knowing that NSDS-2 aimed to consolidate the NSDS-1 results.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis

20.     Overall, the analysis conducted during project preparation effectively identified the
key challenges and constraints faced by the NISR and the broader NSS. The challenges
identified during preparation broadly echoed those identified in NSDS-1 and related mainly
to the lack of sectorwide statistical quality frameworks, inadequate communication and
dissemination of statistical data, weak coordination of the NSS, and low institutional and
human capacity. In addition, the Bank team carefully reviewed lessons learned from the
first two years of NSDS-1 implementation (NSDS-1 implementation started in 2010) and,
in response, decided to focus the operation on improving the quality of economic statistics,
an area that had received only marginal attention in the early years of NSDS-1.

Project Preparation

21.     Consultations held in the framework of the present Implementation Completion and
Results Report (ICR) learned that the Statistics for Results Facility (SRF) was prepared in
a participatory fashion. Key DPs (notably the EU and DFID) confirmed to having been
regularly consulted and closely involved in project preparation and particularly appreciated
the alignment of the SRF with the objectives of NSDS-1 and the Bank’s willingness to join



                                             5
the BF to support NSDS-1 (together with the EU and DFID). This was frequently
mentioned as a key factor in explaining the successful completion of NSDS-1 and the SRF.

22.    Consultations with the Recipient and DPs revealed that project preparation took
place when the NSDS-1 was already in the initial stages of implementation. While this may
not have been ideal, the project design and proposed activities were closely coordinated
with the Recipient and other DPs to ensure the Bank-financed activities would be relevant
and non-duplicative once the project became effective. Though DPs and the IA felt project
preparation took a long time, the 16 months between Identification and Approval does not
seem particularly long in comparative terms, quite to the contrary.

Assessment of the Project Design

23.     According to consulted stakeholders, the design of the project was largely
satisfactory. Two design elements were considered key in attaining project and NSDS-1
objectives:

       (a) Alignment to NSDS-1. The SRF was not designed as a stand-alone project,
           with objectives and components distinct from those of the national plan. In
           contrast, the project was fully aligned to the NSDS-1 objectives and even
           adopted the components of NSDS-1 (including the results framework). As other
           key partners were also fully aligned, all stakeholders effectively pooled efforts
           to support a nationally owned strategy to develop statistics. This alignment to
           national priorities was key in attaining NSDS-1 (and, consequently, SRF)
           objectives.

       (b) BF arrangement. In the PAD and GA, the Bank expressed the intention to join
           the NSDS BF, set up in 2010 between the DFID, EU, and GoR to channel
           support to statistics. According to the implementing agency (IA) and other
           stakeholders, the BF proved to be an effective instrument of harmonization of
           support from different DPs and provided much-needed flexibility in financing
           priority activities as outlined in NSDS-1. Though the Recipient and IA
           emphasized the importance of the BF as a key element in explaining the success




                                            6
                     of NSDS-1, the joining of the BF by the Bank also prompted the delays in the
                     early stages of implementation (see next section). 1

24.     The alignment of the project (and those of other DPs) with the national strategy
greatly facilitated implementation, as the IA could focus exclusively on conducting the
priority activities formulated in the nationally owned plan, with minimal risk of straying
due to individual DP’s own priorities.

Adequacy of Government Commitment

25.     The GoR was fully involved in the design, preparation, and implementation of the
project. Rwanda’s results-driven approach to development and attachment to measurable
                                                              targets have created a strong

Assessment of Risks

26.     The operational risk assessment was conducted during preparation and the overall
risk was classified as Medium-I. The key risks identified were (a) capacity risks related to
the lack of experience of management and project staff in handling large multi-agency
projects and the inexperience of FM and procurement staff in applying Bank guidelines;
and (b) design risks related to the weak coordination of the NSS and the impact that
insufficient collaboration between the various NSS agencies may have on attaining the
PDO. 3 The procurement assessment conducted during preparation rated the overall project

  Following favorable reviews of the BF and a positive audit by the European Court of Auditors, the EU
and DFID will continue to channel their support to statistics through the BF. Since current Bank support to
statistics is through a program for results (PforR) on Public Sector Governance, the Bank is no longer part
of the BF.

    Other risks were rated as either Medium-I or Low.


                                                        7
risk for procurement as High. The residual FM risk for the project was assessed as Medium-
I.

27.     The risk mitigation measures for the main risks were as follows: (a) the NISR would
recruit a procurement assistant to support the understaffed procurement unit; (b) Rwanda
Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) would organize trainings for the internal tender
committee; (c) the Bank would conduct trainings on Bank procurement guidelines for the
National Coordination Team (NCT); and (d) the NISR would liaise closely with key MDAs
to make sure the MDAs’ priority data needs are included in the NSDS (to avoid the MDAs
engaging in parallel data production activities). While the proposed mitigation measures
were adequate in principle, not all mitigation measures appear to have been implemented
in a timely manner 4. However, the risks that did materialize did not ultimately prohibit the
successful achievement of the PDO.

28.   Quality at Entry. The project’s quality at entry was not reviewed by the Quality
Assurance Group.

2.2 Implementation

29.     The project was approved by the Bank on December 11, 2011, for an SRF
Grant in the amount of US$10 million. The GA was signed on March 26, 2012 and the
project became effective on June 18, 2012. The original closing date was June 30, 2014,
but was extended by one year following a request for restructuring by the GoR, dated June
20, 2013.

30.     Overall, project implementation is considered satisfactory despite the start-up
issues that delayed implementation in the early months following effectiveness and
warranted a restructuring. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the events that led to the
delays (both the Bank team and the counterpart team have changed since the start of the
project and the TTL at preparation retired), the ICR team understands that the delays
stemmed from (a) the IA’s insufficient understanding of the Bank’s procurement
guidelines; (b) inconsistent FM guidance on the part of the Bank; and (c) frequent task
team leader (TTL) turnover at the beginning of the project, which complicated effective
communication. These reasons for the delays are explained further as follows:

       (a) Procurement. Before the Bank joined the BF, procurement using BF resources
           was carried out in accordance with the national procurement law. When the
           Bank joined the BF (July 19, 2012), Bank procurement guidelines prevailed (as
           stated in the addendum to the Memorandum of Understanding [MoU]), though
           the IA continued procuring following the national procurement law. This led to

4
 In particular, no additional procurement assistant was hired until 2013 (a procurement
specialist as part of the NCT) and training on Bank procurement guidelines appears to have
only taken place in 2013 when the new procurement specialist was hired.




                                             8
          a number of ineligible expenses and the need for retroactive no-objections by
          the Regional Procurement Manager (RPM) on certain contracts.

       (b) FM. Communications between the Bank and the IA show that the Bank had
           initially accepted the financial reporting routinely conducted by the NISR for
           the quarterly SC meetings. However, following FM staff turnover, this routine
           financial reporting was deemed insufficient, and a new interim financial report
           (IFR) format had to be agreed upon.

       (c) TTL turnover. There was frequent TTL turnover at the beginning of the project
           which, according to discussions with the Recipient and the IA, complicated
           effective communication about the project. In the first six months of the project,
           the IA found it hard to communicate with the Bank (there was no focal point)
           and get practical solutions for the problems they were struggling with.

31.    Though procurement and FM-related issues were observed at the beginning
of project implementation, they did not keep the project from reaching its intended
objectives. Based on desk reviews and consultations, the key factors that contributed to
successful implementation can be summarized as follows:

       (a) Strong accountability, ownership, and leadership. NSDS-1 was designed by
           the NISR through a participatory process with all internal (other MDAs) and
           external (DP) stakeholders. The result was a nationally driven and owned
           strategy with broad support and determination to implement the plan. As in
           other public institutions, the NISR staff have so-called performance contracts
           (‘imihigo’) with clear targets and responsibilities, which establish
           accountability for individual achievement and non-achievement. According to
           the Bank team’s consultations, these performance contracts have been key in
           driving NISR performance. The consultations also stressed the importance of
           strong and motivated leadership within the NISR, with senior management
           committed to stay the course and implement the strategy.

       (b) Availability and flexibility of financing. Statistics in Rwanda is well funded.
           Despite occasional delays in DP disbursement, there have not been real issues
           in financing NSDS-1. The BF played a key role in the flexibility of funding; if
           disbursement from one of the BF partners was delayed, the IA could still
           finance the NSDS priority activities with contributions from the other partners.

       (c) Existence of an effective SC. An SC was put in place to monitor the
           implementation of NSDS-1. The SC consists of representatives from the NISR,
           other MDAs, and DPs and is chaired by the government chief economist. The
           SC—an NPG group for statistics—convenes quarterly to review progress
           during the previous quarter and approve work plans and budgets for the coming
           quarter. During NSDS-1, the SC has proved to be an effective forum for
           dialogue between all relevant stakeholders and for monitoring progress and
           tackling problems whenever they arose. The SC instilled a strong sense of




                                             9
           involvement and ownership among all partners that was key in sustaining the
           commitment to the statistical development agenda.

32.     Besides the three key factors mentioned above, the IA stated that
implementation of the project really took off with the establishment of a new and
committed Bank team in 2013. According to the IA, the start-up issues were ultimately
related to the lack of a direct counterpart within the Bank and, as a consequence, poor
communication. With the new Bank team in place, all issues and misunderstandings were
gradually resolved, the project was restructured, and project implementation moved ahead
rapidly. It is also important to acknowledge that the preexistence of the BF arrangement
and the SC (both were set up in October 2010) facilitated the phasing in of the SRF; the
project was able to use the existing arrangements and mechanisms rather than having to set
them up.

33.     Project restructuring. The project was restructured on August 20, 2013. Details
of the restructuring are mentioned in sections 1.6 and 1.7. The restructuring and the
restructuring mission were considered, by the Bank team and the IA, as the definitive break
between cumbersome and smooth project implementation. The mission allowed the Bank
team and the IA to work out the remaining issues hindering implementation and to train
the newly recruited members of the NCT on project reporting requirements and
procurement guidelines.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

34.     M&E design. Progress toward the PDO was monitored through three PDO
indicators, each focusing on one distinct aspect of the PDO (quality of data, timeliness, and
accessibility). The PDO indicators had well-defined annual milestones and were monitored
through project reports and SC meetings. The PDO milestones had a logical and sequential
setup, where the achievement of each milestone flagged an important step toward PDO
achievement. Overall, the PDO indicators were adequate.

35.     M&E implementation. Project M&E was conducted at two levels. First, the NISR
reported on progress quarterly in the SC meetings. The SC reports summarized the progress
made over the previous quarter, including any complications encountered, and presented
the planned activities for the subsequent quarter. As the SRF supported the implementation
of NSDS-1, the quarterly SC reports fed into the monitoring of the SRF. Second, the NISR
used (and uses) a more elaborate in-house M&E system based on weekly flash reports.
Each Friday, all department heads submit a brief (flash) report summarizing progress over
the preceding week and plans for the coming week. All reports are consolidated and
summarized for senior management to take action, if/where needed. While this system has
potential, it is currently largely manual and will need to be digitized through an information
technology system to be more effective and sustainable.

36.     M&E utilization. The M&E arrangements that were established for NSDS-1 (SC
reports and flash reports) are being continued in NSDS-2. The extent to which the M&E
data is actually used for decision making is difficult to assess.



                                             10
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37.     No environmental and social safeguards were triggered during the preparation as
the project was rated category C.

38.     FM. An assessment of the FM arrangements for the project was conducted at
appraisal and found that they satisfy the Bank’s minimum requirements under OP/BP 10.02.
The residual FM risk was assessed at Medium-I. Despite this, financial reporting has been
a challenge throughout implementation. On many occasions, the unaudited IFRs were
observed to contain inconsistencies in financial information provided. However, over time
these have been rectified and the quality of reporting has significantly improved. The FM-
issues mainly stemmed from low technical skills and capacities (this improved in the later
stages of implementation), a somewhat high staff turnover in the finance directorate, and
insufficient Bank guidance early in the project.

39.    During implementation, the Office of the Auditor General found that the financial
statements of the IA give a true and fair view of the state of the IA’s financial affairs. The
FY13 audit opinion was unqualified, while in FY14 it was qualified regarding Financial
Statements and Continuing Entity aspects 5 (the FY15 audit report will be due at the end of
FY16). The final Implementation Status and Results Report FM rating of the project was
Moderately Satisfactory and the FM risk rating was Moderate (although it had previously
been Substantial).

40.     Procurement. Procurement capacity of the IA was assessed at appraisal. The
assessment identified several shortcomings and the overall project risk for procurement
was rated as High. The GA stated that within one month of effectiveness, the “Recipient
shall have recruited a procurement assistant with qualifications, terms of reference and
experience satisfactory to the World Bank,” but the ICR team could not find any evidence
of this actually happening. 6 Procurement caused delays early on in the project as the IA
kept using the national procurement law even after the Bank had joined the BF. The IA’s
inadequate knowledge of Bank procurement guidelines was compounded by the absence
of a procurement specialist in the Bank’s country office. The recruitment of a procurement
specialist by the IA in 2013 and his subsequent training on Bank procurement guidelines
resolved most of the procurement issues. The final Implementation Status and Results
Report procurement rating was Moderately Satisfactory (although it had been Moderately
Unsatisfactory before). There was also substantial turnover among procurement staff of the
IA, which negatively affected procurement performance.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.    Following successful completion of NSDS-1, the cabinet approved NSDS-2 (2014–
2019) in September 2014. NSDS-2 was developed taking into account lessons learned from
NSDS-1. It consolidates the gains of NSDS-1, mainly related to social and demographic
data production and dissemination, while addressing its shortcomings, mainly related to

    The audit revealed that a staff member had received unwarranted suspension benefits.
6
    Absence of evidence should not be confounded with evidence of absence.


                                                      11
the dearth of economic statistics, low quality of administrative statistics, and capacity
constraints within the NSS. The extension of the closing date of the SRF project allowed a
seamless transition between NSDS-1 and NSDS-2.

42.      NSDS-2 is supported through the Rwanda Public Sector Governance PforR,
approved by the Board on October 7, 2014. The PforR supports GoR programs in public
FM and statistics and covers the three fiscal years FY15–17. In line with NSDS-2, the
statistics component of the PforR focuses on economic statistics and public access to data
(open data). The PforR also supports the establishment of a functional statistics training
center to address the shortage of skills within the NSS. This continued support to national
statistical development increases the likelihood that the project’s results will be sustained.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

43.     Consultations with stakeholders revealed that the original PDO is still highly
relevant. While substantial progress has been made on all three elements of the PDO—
quality of data, timeliness of data, and accessibility of data—all stakeholders agreed that
achieving the frontiers of these elements is a long-term process that warrants continued
efforts. The continued relevance of the project objectives is testified by the new sector,
national, and Bank strategies. The new sector strategy—NSDS-2—puts continued
emphasis on improving the quality and timeliness of statistical and administrative data and
on public accessibility and dissemination of data. The new national strategy—EDPRS-2—
assigned an important role to the NISR in monitoring EDPRS-2 by implementing a
program of surveys and censuses to meet data and information needs for EDPRS-2. Finally,
the new Country Partnership Strategy (FY14–18) stresses that the Bank Group will
continue to support the development of strong statistical systems, which is all the more
relevant given the introduction of PforR financing instruments (and, hence, the need to
reliably track targets and indicators). As such, the relevance of the PDO is rated as High.
Given the important role of the BF in attaining the project’s objective, the relevance of the
design is also rated as High.

44.     The achievement of the PDO is rated Highly Satisfactory. 7 Over the course of
the project, the quality, timeliness, and accessibility of data and statistical information have
increased significantly. On data quality, targets on adherence to customized international
standards have been achieved: over 80 percent of key MDAs have adopted the ISIC4 and
ISCO08 manuals, completion rate of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM) version 6
road map stands at 85 percent, and 72 percent of the GFS 2011 manuals have been adopted.
Granting of survey visas is conditional on actually applying the international standards
described in the manuals. Moreover, DHS4, EICV3, and the 2012 census were
satisfactorily executed. On timeliness, the execution rate of the annual release calendar has
gradually improved over the course of the project and stood at 89 percent for FY15. 8 On
accessibility, the National Data Archive (NADA) is fully operational and users can access
and use survey and census data in a matter of minutes, following simple registration. A
detailed overview of the outputs per component is presented in annex 2.

45.      Exogenous sources confirm that the statistical capacity in Rwanda increased
over the course of the SRF. The Bank’s Statistical Capacity Indicator is a composite score
assessing the capacity of a country’s national statistical system on three dimensions:
statistical methodology, source data, and periodicity and timeliness. Countries are scored
against 25 criteria in these areas, using publicly available information and/or country input.
Rwanda’s score on the Statistical Capacity Indicator increased from 68 (out of 100) at the
end of 2011 to 79 at the end of 2014, indicating a large increase in statistical capacity

7
  It is difficult to establish an unambiguous causal linkage between the activities and financing of the SRF
project and the NSDS outcomes. The NSDS was supported by several DPs, who all aligned their support to
the NSDS. In addition, the SRF was disbursed through a BF with the EU and DFID. As a result, it is
difficult to distinguish the effects of the SRF from the effects of other BF partners.
8
  The number of statistical products to be released remained constant at 35 per year between 2012 and 2015
(except for 2013, with 32 products) which, given the higher execution rate, points toward increasingly
predictable dissemination dates.


                                                        13
(Error! Reference source not found.). Other IDA and SSA countries in contrast have
been stagnating.

46.     In the framework of the SRF project, the NISR conducted two User
Satisfaction Surveys (USSs) (2012 and 2014/15). The USSs solicit feedback from data
users within and outside the government on the usefulness, accuracy, frequency, and
accessibility of data and official statistics. The second USS showed improvements in user
satisfaction as compared to 2012; more users thought the available data and statistics met
their priority needs, a higher fraction considered the official statistics as accurate and
unbiased, and perceptions of the soundness of statistical methodologies improved (annex
5).

47.     It should, however, be noted that the progress during NSDS-1 cannot be
attributed solely to the SRF project. The SRF was fully aligned with the broader NSDS
and the NSDS was financed by a wide array of DPs and the GoR. Overall, the SRF
accounted for 21 percent of the NSDS’ expenditures though the contribution in later years
was notably larger at more than 40 percent (annex 1). In addition, the SRF became effective
only in June 2012, almost two years after the launch of NSDS-1. Progress during NSDS-1
has been the result of a concerted and harmonized effort on behalf of the GoR and DPs,
rather than of any single project.

48.     The SRF has, however, had additional impacts. According to an independent
evaluation of the SRF-CF model conducted in 2013/14, the SRF in Rwanda has played a
significant role in attracting additional resources from other DPs and in giving statistics a
more powerful and relevant role in the social and economic management of the country
(the SRF is said to have raised the profile of statistics). 9 In addition, the SRF has put an
emphasis on the production and dissemination of statistics that are routinely ignored by
other DPs: economic statistics. According to the consultations held in the preparation of
this ICR, the SRF has had a particularly positive impact on the availability and quality of
economic statistics in Rwanda. 10

3.3 Efficiency

49.     Though it is difficult to conduct a convincing value-for-money analysis for
these types of projects, returns to public investment in statistics are considered high.
Good statistics bring tangible benefits in the form of improved policy and better
development results and reduce waste due to misallocation of resources. In addition, timely
and high-quality statistics reduce sovereign borrowing costs on international capital
markets. Statistics are also a public good: Once produced, statistics can be used by different

   Within the framework of the SRF, the NA (and the CPI) were rebased and its methodology upgraded.
The National Agricultural Survey and the Integrated Business Enterprise Survey (IBES) were introduced
and technical assistance was provided to prepare the first ever Labor Force Survey (conducted annually as
of 2016).

levels of government, citizens, and businesses to facilitate evidence-based decisions in their
spheres of interest. Public investment in statistics thus creates positive externalities

50.     Keeping this in mind, the efficiency of the project is rated Substantial. The
project restructuring allowed the SRF to finance activities that were outside the original
scope, thereby increasing the efficiency of the project’s resources. In particular, the SRF
laid the foundation for the establishment of a statistics training center in Rwanda, with
potentially long-lasting positive effects on statistical capacity. As a result, efficiency is
rated as Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

51.     With relevance rated as High, achievement of the PDO as Highly Satisfactory,
and efficiency as Substantial, the overall outcome rating is Highly Satisfactory. All
PDO indicators have been achieved or overachieved; almost all intermediary results
indicators have been achieved (one exception is the IBES, which was pushed back due to
temporary financing gaps); and the project ended up financing activities that were not
originally planned for pre-restructuring (such as the design of a statistical training center
and the implementation of EICV4). Though there were procurement and FM-related
complications at the start of project implementation, they did not keep the project from
reaching the targets. As a result, the project is rated Highly Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

52.     Given the nature of the SRF, any impacts of the project on poverty,
gender, and social development are difficult to measure. However, focusing on the role
of statistics in evidence-based policy formulation and decision making, the project has
contributed to delivering the evidence base (EICV3, DHS4, quarterly GDP, monthly
consumer price index [CPI], BoP, civil registration, census, and so on) to review EDPRS-
1 and inspire EDPRS-2. As a concrete example, the rollout plan of Rwanda’s flagship
social protection program—the Vision Umurenge Program—was revised following the
release of the EICV3 results to achieve a quicker scale-up in the poorest districts. Also, the
project contributed, within the framework of NSDS-1, to establishing the Gender Statistics
Framework, which has greatly improved the compilation and dissemination of gender-
disaggregated data in Rwanda.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.     The SRF project increased the capacity of the NISR to better coordinate the
wider NSS. The SRF-CF requirement of establishing an NPG for statistics, which the
NISR had already taken on board through the operationalization of an SC, resulted in closer
collaboration and consultation between all relevant stakeholders in Rwanda. In particular,
the SC coaxed the main data producers (the NISR and the line ministries) into meeting
regularly and liaising closer on planned data collection activities. The introduction by the
NISR of a system of survey visas meant that all planned data collection activities by data


                                             15
producers need to have an official sign-off by the NISR, increasing the collaboration and
coordination between the NISR and MDAs. The SC setup also increased the institutional
capacity to monitor the progress of statistical activities at the national level.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

54.    No negative unintended outcomes were observed.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

55.    The SRF-CF requires that countries that receive funding carry out USSs to
measure the extent to which statistical outputs meet priority needs and the extent to
which official statistics are used in policy and decision making. The USS can be
considered as beneficiary/stakeholders surveys. So far, the NISR conducted two USSs, in
2012/13 and 2014/15. The main findings are the following:

       (a) The share of users who report that their priority data needs are well or very well
           met by the available official statistics increased from 52 percent to 63 percent.

       (b) The share of users who report that statistical methodology is well or very well
           explained increased from 35 percent to 39 percent.

       (c) The composite ‘user satisfaction index’ increased from 51 percent to 66 percent.

56.     The latest USS also focused on users’ appreciation of the evolution of statistics
since 2009 (the start of NSDS-1). The three areas that—according to users—experienced
the greatest improvements are (a) data accessibility, (b) methodological soundness, and (c)
frequency of publications and statistical undertakings.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

57.     The risk associated to the development outcome is rated as Moderate. The ICR
consultations unanimously confirmed the dependence on external financing as the key risk
for sustainability. DPs finance about half of the NSDS budget, which makes
implementation of NSDS-2 and the results achieved so far vulnerable to shocks to external
funding. Though the likelihood of external funding faltering is fairly low (the DFID, EU,
and the Bank are continuing their support to statistics for the next 3–4 years), this funding
will have considerable adverse effects on statistical development. A secondary risk relates
to the rapidly increasing demand for statistics and the strain this puts on the NISR’s
already-stretched staff. Failure to accommodate the increased demand in a satisfactory
manner can undermine the NISR’s reputation as a reliable and trustworthy producer of
national data.

5. Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

58.     The project’s quality at entry was not reviewed by the Quality Assurance
Group. Still, quality at entry can be considered Satisfactory. The Bank identified and
prepared the project in such a way as to maximize the impact of the project’s resources and
the likelihood of attaining the PDO. In particular, the Bank team’s decision to fully align
the SRF with the GoR plan (NSDS-1) and the joining of the BF to pool resources toward
a common goal were identified as crucial design elements explaining the success of the
project. The Bank team was however too optimistic in thinking the project could be
implemented in only two years (between effectiveness in June 2012 and the original closing
date of June 2014). Also, the Bank team does not appear to have been sufficiently clear
about the implications, with regard to procurement and FM, of the Bank joining the BF
(although these were explicitly mentioned in the BF MoU).

(b) Quality of Supervision

59.      A low and insufficient level of supervision at the beginning of the project
evolved to an excellent collaboration with the client one year into implementation. As
mentioned earlier, Bank supervision and responsiveness during the start-up phase of the
project was insufficient due to frequent TTL turnover and the absence of key procurement
staff in the country office. This situation delayed the takeoff of the project activities. The
Bank did, however, recognize the problem and assigned a committed TTL who brought
the team together and worked with the client to progressively address all complications.
The project was restructured during this process, after which implementation took off
rapidly and regular supervision missions were organized in the field. Overall, Bank
implementation support evolved from rather unsatisfactory in the early months in the
project to very satisfactory in the later years. As a result, quality of supervision is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

60.     Overall Bank performance is a result of Bank support in ensuring quality at
entry, quality of supervision, and the extent to which the PDO was achieved. Given
the satisfactory performance of the Bank in ensuring quality at entry, the moderately
satisfactory performance during supervision, and the highly satisfactory achievement of
the PDO, despite start-up issues during project implementation (which were, however,
effectively addressed once a stable Bank team was in place), the overall performance rating
for the Bank is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Recipient Performance

(a) Government Performance

61.   Government performance is rated Satisfactory. The GoR has been fully
committed to the development of statistics in general and the SRF project in particular and


                                             17
was closely involved in the preparation and design of the project and its implementation
and monitoring through the quarterly SC meetings. The GoR has steadily increased its own
allocation to statistics over the course of the project (figure 1) to respond to the NISR’s
expanding activities and hence the need for additional staff.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

62.     The performance of the IA (NISR) is rated Satisfactory. The NISR managed to
successfully implement the ambitious NSDS-1; conducted all priority surveys and censuses
according to plan; and established an effective forum for statistical dialogue, monitoring,
and consultation through the SC. The NISR struggled with insufficient procurement and
FM capacity at the beginning of the project, leading to delays in project implementation
and poor financial reporting. The establishment of a dedicated coordination team in 2013
with a procurement specialist and an FM specialist improved procurement and FM
practices and facilitated smooth implementation for the remainder of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance

63.     Overall Recipient performance is rated as Satisfactory. This rating is the result
of the Satisfactory rating of the GoR and the IA and the satisfactory achievement of the
PDO.

6. Lessons Learned

64.     Having a stable Bank task team with in-country fiduciary staff is essential for
smooth project implementation. Discussions held in the context of this ICR identified
frequent TTL turnover and absence of key staff in-country (procurement specialist was
only in-country as of April 2014) as key factors in explaining the delays experienced at the
start of project implementation. Perusal of the operations portal and key documents
(negotiation minutes) show that the project had three different TTLs between project
preparation and approval and another five during implementation. This instability
complicated effective communication between the NISR and the Bank as well as stalled
timely problem solving.

65.     Having client commitment, ownership, and accountability around a realistic
NSDS is key for the achievement of results. The GoR has demonstrated a high level of
commitment to statistical development as witnessed by the increasing budget allocation to
the NISR and the presence of top government officials at the NISR’s outreach and
dissemination events. This high level of commitment kept pressure on the NISR to deliver
in a consistent and timely fashion. The SRF’s alignment to a nationally defined ambitious
though realistic plan increased the sense of ownership of the project and ensured that the
implementation of NSDS-1 amounted de facto to the implementation of the SRF. In
addition, the culture of accountability and performance contracts within the government
meant that specific NISR staff members were individually accountable for the
implementation of well-defined SRF activities, contributing to effective implementation of
the project.




                                            18
66.    Establishing a functioning donor coordination and engagement mechanism is
key for effective project monitoring and timely identification of problems. To facilitate
donor coordination and stakeholder consultation, the GoR established an NPG/SC, chaired
by the government chief economist. The SC has consistently met each quarter to review
progress over the preceding quarter and approve work plans for the coming quarter and has
proved to be an effective forum for dialogue, monitoring, and coordination. The SC
meetings allowed close monitoring of the progress of the SRF (and NSDS-1 as a whole)
and timely anticipation of potential complications and their resolution.

67.     Establishing a BF arrangement provides the IA with much-needed financing
flexibility, though the rules governing the fund need to be clear from the start. Though
the Bank’s joining of the BF caused initial complications, the NISR and GoR frequently
mentioned the BF as an important element for the success of NSDS-1. The BF allowed
funding flexibility and ensured that implementation of priority activities was not dependent
on any single DP and potential delays. When several DPs jointly support a nationally
defined plan, a BF arrangement should always be considered as a potential financing
mechanism. However, the client should be well-briefed on the implications, with respect
to FM and procurement, of the Bank joining a BF.

68.     Finally, Bank teams need to be realistic about the timeline for project
implementation. The too short timeline (25 months) that was originally planned for
implementation was one of the elements warranting a project restructuring. Especially in
cases where the client has no prior experience in working with Bank procedures and
regulations, timelines need to be set realistically as start-up delays will likely occur.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.         The project consisted of five components:

     (a)      Data Development and Management

     (b)      Information Dissemination and Services to Users

     (c)      Coordination of NSS

     (d)      Capacity Development

     (e)      Financing and Corporate Services

2.      Component 1 - Data Development and Management. Major surveys and
censuses were conducted according to plan. EICV3, EICV4 (the poverty surveys), and the
PHCs were successfully completed, as were the 2011 and 2014 Establishment Censuses,
the pilot IBES, and the National Agriculture Survey. The quality and methodological
soundness of economic statistics was improved, though adherence to internationally
accepted standards (ISIC4, ISCO08, and SITC) and the NA and the CPI were rebased in
2014 with the new base year 2011. The NISR improved quality control over statistical
production by establishing a statistical visa system (the methodology needs to be formally
approved by the NISR for an organization to produce official statistics) and a National
Quality Assurance Framework.

3.       Component 2 - Information Dissemination and Services to Users. Under this
component, the NISR has established the NADA, where users can download survey and
census microdata free of charge, and an open data portal, where users can obtain
customized indicators based on all available survey and census data. All survey and census
reports are available on the NISR website and publication tables can be downloaded in a
machine-readable format. The microdata dissemination policy has been drafted, approved,
and published and frequent workshops and outreach events have been held to disseminate
the results of major statistical undertakings. In addition, an inter-university infographics
competition has been organized to promote interest and participation for academic
institutions and sensitize the wider public on the availability of microdata on the NISR
website.

4.       Component 3 - Coordination of NSS. The statistical information dissemination
policy has been drafted and approved, and statistical information produced by the NSS is
published in their respective statistical yearbooks with respect to the dissemination policy.
The NISR has drafted and piloted harmonized data collection tools with selected NSS
institutions.

5.      Component 4 - Capacity Development. A five-year capacity-building plan (July
2013–June 2018) was prepared and approved by the SC. It focuses on hands-on/on-the-job
training and specific short courses, as well as profile upgrading and long-term programs
(such as sending staff to pursue a Masters/PhD program). Following restructuring of the
project, the NISR has decided to use available space within its existing premises for the


                                              21
construction of a statistical training center and, with the support of the Bank, has completed
the conceptual architectural model. The actual construction of the training center will be
supported by the PforR and is expected to commence by the end of the calendar year 2015.

6.    Component 5 - Financing and Corporate Services (Project Implementation).
The NISR has hired an NSDS coordination team, functioning as the Single Project
Implementation Unit for the SRF. The coordination team was responsible for project
implementation and administration and all procurement and FM.

1.     An ICR mission was conducted between September 7 and September 18, 2015.
During the mission, all the main NSDS stakeholders were consulted, with a particular focus
on the BF partners (EU and DFID). The list of people and organizations consulted can be
found in annex 9.

2.      Overall, the consultations revealed a positive appreciation of the NSDS-1
implementation and achievements. The key aspects highlighted by the stakeholders were
(a) the consistent and timely production of routine economic statistics, (b) the successful
implementation of the census, (c) the fact that all main surveys were implemented
according to plan, and (d) effective coordination through the SC. In relation to SRF in
particular, stakeholders highlighted the solid design of the project and the alignment with
the NSDS objectives. However, stakeholders also mentioned the difficult start-up of the
project and the absence of key staff on the Bank’s side.

3.      Stakeholders emphasized the good performance of the IA, particularly in
establishing a culture of performance and accountability within the institution, and strong
leadership by the senior management. According to the consultations, the BF played a key
role in enabling the NISR to implement all activities according to plan, as shortfalls or
delays from one DP could be flexibly handled.

Summary of Grantee’s ICR

The SRF project aimed at supporting the implementation of Rwanda’s NSDS-1 (2009–
2014) which was developed to address key areas of weaknesses and challenges faced by
the NSS and the NISR, namely scarce finance, infrastructure, and human resources; limited
technical experience; limited coordination within the NSS; inadequate dissemination
mechanisms; and fragmented funding arrangements that financed statistical activities on
ad hoc basis. The PDO was to increase the quality and timeliness of statistical information,
as well as making it accessible to users.

Specifically, SRF focused on (a) institutional coordination and capacity building within the
NISR and a few selected MDAs; (b) data development; (c) promoting statistical
information sharing among data users to strengthen the quality of decision making; (d)
developing a data access and dissemination strategy in conformity with best international
standards; and (e) investing in statistical infrastructure and equipment. The SRF
complemented the existing technical assistance to the statistics sector in Rwanda provided
by various DPs through the NSDS BF (that is, the EU and DFID) and UNDP, UNICEF,
UNFPA, Belgian Technical Cooperation, and AfDB that provided additional support
through separate but parallel arrangements.

The support from the Bank-managed SRF program to Rwanda encompassed the period
between the inception of NSDS-1 to its completion and later the rollout of NSDS-2. The
Bank’s support produced significant success toward the achievement of the PDOs. All
three PDO indicators have been successfully achieved. The quality of statistical
information has improved and it has been disseminated promptly. Users can easily access
information they want both on the NISR website, through CDs, and at the institute’s library.

The project’s five components have also been achieved and they are Data Development
and Management; Information Dissemination and Services to Users; Coordination of NSS;
Capacity Development; and Financing and Corporate Services (Project Implementation).

For Component 1, high-quality statistical data were produced through successful
implementation of the PHC; a wide variety of surveys (ECIV, DHS, Agriculture Survey,
and so on); and the improved core economic statistics (CPI, producer price index, GDP,
trade statistics and so on).

For Component 2, the project has helped ensure the dissemination of produced statistics
from surveys and censuses online through the NISR website in a machine-readable format,
on CDs, and on hard copies available at the NISR’s one-stop center (library). These can be
easily and promptly accessed by users.

For Component 3, the project has supported the enhancement of planning, reporting, and
monitoring processes at the NISR and over 80 percent of key MDAs have adopted the

  The grantee only had two editorial comments on the Bank’s draft ICR. These comments have been
addressed.

ISIC4 and ISCO08 manuals. Completion rate of the BPM version 6 road map stands at 85
percent, and 72 percent of the GFS 2011 manuals have been adopted. Also, granting of
survey visas has been made conditional to their use.

Under Component 4, the NISR developed a five-year capacity-building strategy, whose
implementation has enhanced the skills of the NISR and NSS staff through conducting on-
the-job and in-house training in various statistical areas to both the NISR and NSS staff.
This includes capacity building with regard to infrastructure and systems.

For Component 5, the NSDS-1 priority 1 had been fully implemented considering proper
monitoring, evaluation, and effective management of resources by the NISR, as revealed
by different audit reports, independent evaluations, and appraisals.

Overall, the SRF project activities have progressed satisfactorily. Moreover, most of the
expected results were attained as initially planned despite operational challenges
experienced at the beginning of the project that were addressed. Out of US$10 million
allocated for the project, 99.8 percent has been disbursed.

The lessons learned from the SRF project include the need to set realistic milestones
relative to capacity-building challenges, a senior leadership role in promoting statistics, a
performance management system that helps secure high-level performance from staff, and
the role of technology in quality data production and dissemination.

The overall outcome rating of the project is highly satisfactory considering that all priority
1 activities of NSDS-1 have been achieved and all the PDO indicators were maintained.

The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory as the project has met the needs of what
it was designed for and has been successfully implemented despite challenges encountered
at the beginning.

The overall Recipient’s performance (GoR and NISR) is rated satisfactory. The GoR
fulfilled its commitment to support NSDS-1, and the NISR managed to successfully
implement all priority 1 activities.
