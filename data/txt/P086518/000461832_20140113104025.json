follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was negligible or low; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: a credit line accompanied by\n            a technical assistance component can contribute to a more\n            comprehensive project design by addressing both supply side\n            and demand side issues, components complemented one another\n            and led to effective synergy and improved outcomes. The\n            establishment of an autonomous Project Management Division\n            (PMD) right at the start of the project ensured\n            uninterrupted and seamless implementation of the project,\n            and facilitated successful project implementation.\n            Countercyclical funding to viable businesses can be an\n            effective post-crisis measure, not just in terms of\n            providing funding but also the 'signaling effect'.\n            Expansion of project activities in low income states can be\n            greatly facilitated by a strategy that relies on identifying\n            appropriate existing financial intermediaries with local\n            presence and providing them adequate support. Strong\n            commitment and ownership, good technical and human resource\n            capacity, proactive approach for resolving implementation\n            issues; advance planning for disbursements and competent\n            staff on the part of the client, and close coordination with\n            the donors, are important for the smooth implementation and\n            achievement of the project objectives"}, "docdt": "2013-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
