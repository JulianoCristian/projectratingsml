﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and Sector Background: The Tenth Five Year Plan (2003) of the Government
of India (Gol) had noted that achieving and sustaining growth and higher employment
would require a sharp step up in industrial and services growth, spurred by small and
medium enterprises (SMEs), which have the greatest potential to provide high-wage
employment for the 70 percent of the labor force still working in agriculture.
SMEs in India, unlike their counterparts in many developed as well as some emerging
economies, had been unable to achieve the competitiveness that would allow them to
drive manufacturing sector and overall economic growth, employment and poverty
reduction. In part this was due to the financing constraint faced by Indian SMEs which
was attributable to a combination of factors that were rooted in: (a) a legal regulatory
framework that made recovery of bad loans to SMEs and contract enforcement difficult
for creditors; (b) institutional weaknesses, such as the absence of good credit appraisal
and risk management monitoring tools, that increase banks' transactions costs in dealing
with SMEs; (c) absence of reliable credit information on SMEs; and (d) lack of
acceptance of SMEs as good credit risks by financial institutions. This made it difficult
for lenders to assess risk premiums properly, creating differences in the perceived versus
real risk profiles of SMEs and resulting in untapped lending opportunities to SMEs.
While absolute amounts of lending to the Small Scale Industries (SSI) sector had
increased over time, as a percentage of net bank credit, credit to SMEs had declined
sharply since the late 1990s. Furthermore, whereas Indian SMEs had a strong demand for
term financing (Maturity of 3+ years) to meet their capital formation and technological
up-gradation needs, crucial to spur growth and employment, bank financing available to
SMEs was typically of a shorter tenor. This was because banks faced difficulty in raising
longer term resources, and also as banks were reluctant to assume longer term exposures
on SMEs for the reasons discussed above.
Project Background. The project was designed to achieve its objective through a multi-
pronged approach that would address key bottlenecks to SME financing and development
in India, by focusing on: (a) creating a more enabling policy, regulatory and institutional
framework for SME financing by banks; (b) helping banks gain better access to longer
term financing for lending to the SME sector, thereby facilitating capital formation and
technology up-grading; (c) mitigating banks' risks related to SME lending and reducing
transactions costs of such lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks would
enhance the quality of their SME loan portfolios; and (d) strengthening business
development services and market linkage programs for SMEs, thereby helping SMEs to
improve profitability and competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.
Rationale for Bank assistance: The Gol, Small Industries Development Bank of India
(SIDBI), and a number of commercial banks, had requested the Bank to support efforts to
remove the bottlenecks that constrained SME access to finance (including term
1


﻿financing), and that fostered SME development. Over the medium to longer term, this
required support to addressing policy and regulatory issues, institutional weaknesses and
capacity constraints that had hitherto distorted bankers' risk-return signals in SME
financing and hampered the efficient functioning of SME credit markets. It also required
improving business development services for SMEs so that they become more efficient,
creditworthy and "bankable". The loan and the technical assistance were requested to
demonstrate progress on some of these issues.
The project's objective was consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) 2004. By improving access to finance and business development services, the
higher level objective of the project was to foster SME growth and employment creation.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The objective of the project was to improve SME access to finance (particularly longer
term financing) and business development services (BDS), thereby fostering SME growth,
competitiveness and employment creation, which are key to achieving Gol's overall
objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction.
Key Indicators were:
Parent Project:
* Increased lending (including term loans)'
* Reduced net Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio on the SME loan portfolios of all
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)
* Improved profitability of SME business in all PFIs
* Benefiting SMEs scale-up operations
* The participating banks increase lending to SMEs (on market-based terms)
* PFIs increase term-lending (loans with a maturity of 3 to 15 years) to SMEs.
Additional Financing:
* Increased lending (including term)
* Reduced net Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio on the SME loan portfolios of all
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)
* Improved profitability of SME business in all PFIs
* Benefiting SMEs scale-up operations
The indicator, 'The participating banks increase lending to SMEs (on market-based
terms)' under the Parent Project was dropped because this indicator had been highly
1 With this indicator, measurement of relative growth of SME credit to overall credit, which was one
dimension that was intended to be captured, was not pursued since the institutions were largely only SME
focused banks (and not broad based banks). Similarly, on the profitability indicator, this was not compared
between the SME line of business and overall credit business, for the same reason.
2


﻿surpassed and was not adding much value in assessing the direct outcome of the project.
Likewise, the indicator, 'PFIs increase term-lending (loans with a maturity of 3 to 15
years) to SMEs' was dropped because the focus of the Additional Financing was
developed in the context of the global financial crisis, when not just term lending but
even working capital loans were in considerable short supply, and this financing,
therefore included both types of financing.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The objective was not revised.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
The expected beneficiaries of the project included: Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
(MSMEs), bankers, financial institutions, including Non-Bank Financial Institutions
(NBFCs), clusters, industry associations, BDS providers, and large enterprises including
multinationals (as procurers of goods and services).
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The parent project consisted of three components as follows:
Component 1: Credit Facility (CF) (Cost: US$100 million): The CF was focused on
addressing the term financing constraints faced by commercial banks, and hence,
enabling SME clients to access longer term funds needed for capital formation and
technological up-gradation. SIDBI/PFIs provided a counterpart contribution (US$10.0
million). While 60 percent of the total funds allocated to the CF was tentatively targeted
to be utilized by SIDBI for on-lending to eligible commercial banks to refinance their
lending to SMEs, an amount of up to 40 percent of funds was tentatively targeted to the
CF to be used by SIDBI for direct financing of commercially viable SMEs.
Component 2: Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) (Cost: up to US$20 million): The RSF was
designed to demonstrate a good practice guarantee product which included leverage and
measures to protect against moral hazard and adverse selection risks.2 The RSF was
intended to be created by SIDBI as an off-balance sheet, Limited Liability Company (the
Risk Sharing Guarantee Company, or RSGC).
Component 3: Policy and Institutional Development Technical Assistance (TA)
Component (Cost: US$38.4 million): The TA (funded by DflD) covered the following:
*  Strengthening the policy/legal/regulatory framework
*  Improving credit information (positive and negative information) on SMEs
*  Building institutional capacity within the participating banks to reduce banks'
transactions costs and reduce/manage risks related to SME lending
*  BDS for SMEs
*  Institutional support to SIDBI
2 Which were insufficiently addressed in the country's existent and much larger guarantee fund.
3


﻿1.6 Revised Components
The components were not revised.
1.7 Other significant changes
The project involved the following changes:
(i) Project Restructuring. The project was restructured thrice during implementation:
(a) The RSF component was restructured in FY2008 when the SECO was unable to
proceed with expected co-financing3, and the component was since then implemented
through an existing institution, the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small
Enterprises (CGTMSE).
(b) A Level II project restructuring was approved in June 2012 and had resulted in an
extension of the project by one year from June 20, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to allow for
time to implement the RSF component of the project. The restructuring also included a
reallocation of proceeds from the unallocated portion to the CF component. Another
Level II restructuring took place in June 2013 to reallocate partial proceeds from the RSF
to the CF as explained below.
(ii) Additional Financing (AF). Additional financing of US$400 million, which became
effective in July 2009, was introduced into the project to scale up the project and to
respond to the challenges faced by SMEs in India in the aftermath of the 2008-09 global
financial crisis in which period lending to SMEs had contracted sharply and SMEs faced
an acute shortage of working capital and term lending.
Under the two components of the parent project, the AF supported:
*  Scaling up the project by facilitating an increased flow of working capital and term
lending to the SME sector.
*  Scaling up the parent project and facilitating an: (i) increase in the geographical
coverage of the project; (ii) expansion of innovative SME loan products, including
possibly loans to smaller SMEs ('downscaling'), and receivables financing; (iii)
expansion of SME lending through other participating financial institutions (PFIs),
subject to demand; (iv) exploration of the possibility of providing loans to promote
investments in energy efficiency improvement technologies, subject to adequate
demand from SMEs at the SIDBI for such funding; and (v) expansion of the coverage
of the innovative RSF that was initiated under the parent project.
(iii) Funding allocations. (a) In July 2006, the unallocated loan amount of US$15.0
million was reallocated towards the CF, and this amount was channelized by SIDBI
through commercial banks for on-lending to SMEs. (b) In June 2012, the unallocated
portion was allocated to the CF. (c) In June 2013 the US$8.57 million was reallocated
from the RSF component to the CF component. The main reason for this reallocation was
that, further government budgeting would not materialize before the project's closing
date of June 30, 2013. Since CGTMSE was funded in a 4:1 ratio by Gol and SIDBI, with
On account of an unexpected change of its country policies and priorities.
4


﻿the requisite amount of Gol funding not coming through within the project period, it was
clear that a reallocation was needed.
(iv) Project Schedule
Parent project: (i) The closing date of the project was extended first by six months from
June 30, 2008 to December 31, 2008, in order to implement the RSF, enable SIDBI and
CGTSME to roll it out to commercial banks/financial institutions, and monitor and assess
its impact on the SMEs in an effective manner. (ii) In the aftermath of the global financial
crisis, the closing date was extended for another six months from December 31, 2008 to
June 30, 2009 to process the AF from the Bank to scale-up the project.
AF: The closing date of the project was extended by one year from June 30, 2012 to June
30, 2013 to allow time to implement the RSF component.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Quality at Entry. The project's quality at entry was satisfactory.
*  The project design was straight forward, realistic, and well structured. It involved
addressing the SME financing and development problem from both the supply and
demand sides. It aimed to tackle the short term challenge of demonstrating good
practice and kick starting term financing to SMEs. Additionally, the project
contributed to policy dialogue and to building the institutional framework and
capacity (through the TA component) for SME development. The approach was
comprehensive in its coverage.
*  Different elements of the multi-pronged approach of the project had been successfully
tested internationally in other projects to promote access to finance for SMEs. For
example, the CF addressed a specific constraint faced by the banking system in
improving term financing, drawing on experience from successful Bank projects.
*  The type of TA used in the project had been successfully provided by various projects
in other countries to address the supply and demand side issues facing SME finance.
*  The design of the pilot RSF was intended to demonstrate good practices to maximize
the leverage impact of the guarantee facility while mitigating moral hazard and
adverse selection risks, and supporting robust management and reporting.
On the other hand, even though some indicators indirectly contributed to measuring
competiveness, additional indicators, could have been considered. In addition, the
expectation that refinancing would take place, did not materialize in the initial project
(but did so in the AF), partly on account of market conditions, time needed to disseminate
safeguards requirements to other banks and also as SIDBI itself was able to use project
funds efficiently to attain project outcomes.
Soundness of background analysis. As part of project preparation, the sector background
was studied, main sector issues were analyzed in depth, and government strategies to deal
5


﻿with these issues were also considered. The project design took into account the sector
issues as well as government strategies.
Lessons Learned from previous Bank-assisted projects. Lessons learnt from previous
project were incorporated into the design of the project, notably the following ones:
*  SIDBI was     assigned  clear responsibility  and  accountability  for project
implementation and reporting.
*  Quantifiable financial indicators were identified upfront to monitor the performance/
progress achieved by SIDBI and the PFIs
*  A detailed firm-level base line survey had been designed to monitor the final
outcomes of the project.
*  Demand aspects were thoroughly examined and banks had confirmed a pipeline of
"bankable" SME sub-projects that would benefit from the project.
*  The project design had built in flexibility to allow for reallocation of the project funds
across the CF and RSF components.
Risk Assessment. The overall risk of the project was rated as Moderate in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). The ICR team agrees with this assessment. The PAD
identified several potential risks and mitigation measures were spelt out. The risks that
materialized during implementation were managed appropriately.
Adequacy of participatory processes: The project was prepared in a highly participatory
manner. A Project Review Committee (PRC), comprising all the partners in the project
including the Gol, was established to review and guide the project. In addition, a Policy
Advisory Group was set-up to deliberate the case for required policy changes in light of
the policy component of the TA.
Adequacy of government commitment. At the time of project preparation, the
government had taken several steps to support SME financing and development. First, in
2006 there was a significant and welcome shift in policy focus from "SSI" to "SME", in
part because of the project's influence. This was also demonstrated in the Gol's US$2.3
billion SME fund operated by the SIDBI. Second, to strengthen the framework for
tackling loan defaults and contract enforcement, India had enacted the Securitization and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI)
Act (June 2002), which empowered secured creditors to foreclose and enforce securities
in case of default, without intervention of a court or tribunal. Third, recognizing that
better credit information can directly increase the amount of financing for SMEs, by
reducing the risk and costs arising from information asymmetries, the Gol supported the
creation of the Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL) as a public-private
partnership. Fourth, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a directive requiring all
banks to introduce standardized credit appraisal systems and guidelines.
6


﻿2.2 Implementation
The Bank conducted a Mid-term Review (MTR) for the parent project in July 2006, and
the following action steps related to project implementation were agreed:
*  SIDBI's request for AF to scale-up the successful credit facility component pilot.
*  The unallocated loan amount of US$15.0 million would be allocated towards the CF.
*  Necessary documentation would be furnished to the Gol to enable the RSF product to
be introduced under the umbrella of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Small
Industry (CGFTSI).
As the context and focus of AF were different from that of the Parent Project, the Bank
conducted a second MTR for the AF in April 2011. The key agreed actions were the
following:
*  The design and initiation of the (re) launch of the RSF, would be targeted.
*  SIDBI would continue to actively follow up on exploring refinancing options and
explore provision of TA assistance to select participating financial intermediaries to
enhance the demonstration impact of the project.
*  SIDBI would follow up with CIBIL on the launch of the consumer-commercial
bureau interface product so that this is launched by July 31, 2011.
*  SIDBI would explore the feasibility of innovative debt products to SMEs, especially
those that provide significantly longer funding than traditional debt products.
The following factors had affected project implementation:
(i) Strong commitment and intensive implementation support from SIDBI was a major
factor which helped in the smooth implementation and achievement of the project
objective. SIDBI was a serious and proactive counterpart, open to new ideas. It had a
strong team in its Project Management Division (PMD) consisting of competent
professional staff. Some of the strategies adopted by PMD included: (a) forming a Cluster
Coordination Committee (CCC) from the inception of BDS intervention. CCC acted as
an advisory body, having around 10 to 12 members including Business Member
Organizations (BMOs), industry people, representatives from technical institutions, BDS
providers, representatives of academic institutions, and government representatives.
Need-based experts and consultants were also invited in the meetings of CCC; (b)
outsourcing experts in areas such as procurement and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E);
(c) developing local technical expertise including both individual and institutions; (d)
partnering with key players; (e) developing synergy with existing government schemes;
(f) adopting thematic approach for clusters such as Energy, Technology, Productivity
Enhancement, Lean Manufacturing, Market Access, Capacity Building of BMOs, Skill
Development, and use of Information Technology (IT); and (g) developing and
maintaining a strong team within PMD.
(ii) Good donor coordination mechanism and positive client relationship facilitated
effective project implementation.
(iii) Gol's recognition of Environmental and Social Risk Management Framework
(ESMF) as a good model to follow, and the buy-in from SIDBI for ESMF as well as
7


﻿linking up with other partners and international experts for knowledge dissemination
helped in the implementation of ESMF.
(iv) Initially the implementation of RSF component was delayed because SECO
withdrew its commitment to fund this component on account of an unforeseen change in
country policies. However, the component was implemented eventually, although the
scale was reduced - it nonetheless, helped demonstrate good practice design features in
the market.
(v) The TA component, which had a comprehensive package of reforms and initiatives,
had a slow start largely due to the time taken to reach agreement among the partners on
the detailed TA action plan. However, despite the delayed start, the component had a
significant impact as demonstrated in Section 3.2.
(vi) Under the AF, as mentioned above, while the RSF has been launched and guarantees
issued, US$8.57 million (out of the US$10 million) had to be allocated to the CF on
account of the lack of budgeting for the Government's contribution to CGTMSE which
was implementing the RSF. This impacted the scale of outreach, but still helped attain
progress towards the objective of a demonstration effect (see Section 3).
(vii) Introduction of the ESMF needed lot of convincing the PFIs on their benefits. Many
of the PFIs were slow in their response to ESMF. In addition, SIDBI had to take steps for
sensitizing credit officials about its features. There was also slow response on the part of
MSMEs to adopt ESMF. After the project decided to strengthen awareness efforts across
the credit value chain (right from credit officers to loan processing cells, internal and
external auditors, etc.) an enabling environment was created and officers started
facilitating the adoption during discussions, pre and post sanction stages and so on. This
ultimately evinced good receptivity.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. A long list of indicators were proposed in the PAD, and even though many
of them seemed relevant, for practical reasons a more pruned list of indicators were
selected to monitor the performance of the project. Some of the indicators included: (i)
increase in the participating banks' lending to SMEs; (ii) increase in the term-lending of
PFIs to SMEs; and (iii) PFIs reducing NPL ratios on their SME loan portfolios. SIDBI
had adequate methods for collecting these data.
M&E implementation. Data was collected regularly by an independent M&E agency
hired by SIDBI, according to the indicators developed during project preparation. These
data were closely monitored and the actual figures were compared with the target values.
M&E utilization. Appropriate data collected by SIDBI was evaluated and used for
decision-making on certain activities. For example, expectations of SMEs were picked up
and enlisted for actions plans in their clusters. Likewise, findings of M&E reports were
used for broadening the scope of the project to include besides term loan, receivable
finance products, working-capital terms loans, and bills discounting facilities in the
8


﻿aftermath of the global financial crisis. The approach towards disseminating the ESMF
was adapted based on the parent project's experience where the framework was initially
perceived as a possible burden by potential institutions and credit officers. Through an
intensive approach aimed at demystifying the ESMF, summarizing this in a concise and
easy to read note, conducting several workshops and other communication efforts that
emphasized not just the safeguards dimensions but also the link between safeguards risks
and potential credit risk, helped making this a success.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environmental and Social Safeguards. The project was categorized as "Financial
Intermediary (Fl)" triggering OP 4.01, relating to environmental safeguards. No social
safeguard policies were triggered. In line with the OP 4.01 requirements, a detailed
Environmental and Social Risk Management Framework (ESMF) was developed by the
client. The ESMF was effectively operationalized to screen sub-loans through a risk
based approach with relevant remedial measures to mitigate and minimize environmental
risks. Overall, there are no outstanding safeguards issues.
In terms of operationalizing and managing the safeguards risks, as discussed above
SIDBI had initial difficulties in implementing the ESMF due to lack of institutional
capacity as well as awareness, although there was strong management commitment. The
institutional capacity issues were addressed in the early stages of project through relevant
staffing to screen sub-loans under the project and through training efforts. Subsequently,
a more streamlined approach was adopted to integrate safeguards risks as part of the
credit risk management under the project line of credit. The safeguards risk management
process was supported by strong institutional mechanisms including: (a) Environmental
and Social (E&S) Risk screening by the loan officer at branch level along with loan
processing; (b) Safeguards compliance reviews at Central Loan Processing Cell; and (c)
internal audit review, including at various stages of loan disbursement. This process was
supported by: (a) a Management Information System (MIS) to track loan performance,
including any specific flags on safeguards; and (b) Periodic capacity building and training
workshops jointly organized by SIDBI and the Bank.
Given the foregoing proactive approach to safeguards management, and considering no
outstanding issues, the Safeguard Compliance is rated as Satisfactory.
Fiduciary Compliance. The project complied with fiduciary covenants during
implementation. Internal control arrangements were in place, and adequate financial
management system, procurement, and disbursements were maintained. Fiduciary
compliance is rated as Satisfactory.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(a) Transition arrangements. The transition arrangements for continuing future operations
appear to be adequate, as demonstrated by the following measures SIDBI adopted.
9


﻿*  Institutional: Project management capacity of SIDBI staff has been strengthened
because of the experience gained by them from project, especially on procurement,
financial management, project management and financial-technical aspects.
* Technical: ESMF developed under the project has been assimilated into SIDBI's
credit value chain (including credit officers, internal and external auditors, and central
loan processing cells) and it has also been implemented by the PFIs. SIDBI has identified
key pillars that support SME development including efforts to reduce information
asymmetry through virtual mentoring websites, providing credit advisory and loan
facilitation and supporting initiatives to support new delivery channels such as regional
rural banks, cooperative banks; and NBFCs.
* Budgeting and staffing: SIDBI has adequate budgeting and staffing to look after
SMEs' expected growth and future needs such as debt, risk capital, sustainable financing,
and service sector financing.
* Policies. Some of the initiatives taken up by the project, such as ESMF, cluster
program on soft infrastructure development, and advocacy challenge fund have been
recognized by the Ministry of Finance's (MoF) Working Group on MSMEs and key task
force on MSME domain. Also, based on the achievements of the project, the MoF has
issued advisory to public sector banks for adopting ESMF as a risk mitigating tool in
their lending mechanism.
(b) Follow-on project. SIDBI has expressed interest in a possible follow on project and
is discussing this internally. Follow on Bank for assistance is being considered for
further inclusive growth of the MSME sector and to facilitate transformative initiatives
including in underserved states. The follow-on project interest from SIDBI is focused on
niche areas such as sustainable financing, angel/risk capital and service sector financing,
social entrepreneurship, impact investment, innovation and startup support financing.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objective. The project's objective remains highly relevant to India's current
development priorities, as demonstrated by measures announced by the Gol to facilitate
SME access to finance. Equally, the project's objectives remain highly relevant to the
Bank's current country and sector assistance strategies, which highlight the critical role of
a vibrant SME sector in promoting and sustaining economic growth, job creation, and
poverty reduction, especially in low income states (LIS). For example, according to the
Bank's Country Partnership Strategy' (CPS) for 2013-2017 discusses improving the
investment climate to induce increased private sector investment (from domestic and
foreign sources) and improving access to credit will allow small and medium-size
enterprises-an important growth engine in India-to flourish.
Report No: 76176-IN; dated March 21, 2013
10


﻿Relevance of design and implementation: The core design of the project and
implementation arrangements remain highly relevant. Likewise, implementation process
of the project had also turned out to be effective and efficient for achieving the project
objective.
Rating: Considering these factors, the relevance of objectives, design, and
implementation is rated High.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Satisfactory. The project was successful in achieving its objective. All the PDO
indicators covering outreach, quality, geographical coverage and impact of project
initiatives were surpassed. Over 10,000 SMEs were supported in a wide variety of sectors
and regions, including in low income states. The AF under this project was also one of
the few examples of the Bank's response to global financial crisis that disbursed well
after its launch, thereby contributing to its objectives to support counter-cyclical funding
and playing an important role in the Bank's response in India to the global financial
crisis. This role was particularly important in terms of signaling that lending to viable
SMEs, even against the backdrop of the global crisis, could be undertaken profitably.
It is worth pointing out that, in addition to the Bank financing, the TA component funded
by DflD was a cornerstone of the project to address the medium term policy, regulatory
and institutional constraints that hamper the efficiency of the MSME credit markets in
India. Further, on account of the involvement of the Bank and the success of the project,
significant leveraging of resources and knowledge inputs was achieved. Additional
donors like Germany's GIZ (German Society for International Cooperation) and KfW
(German Government-owned Development Bank) have also become partners in the
project for providing TA to SMEs. GIZ funded Technical Cooperation aimed at enabling
MSMEs to have better access to qualitatively appropriate financial and non-financial
enterprise services. KfW funded TA was aimed at supporting SIDBI to build its retail
lending capacity through development of a Centralized Loan Processing System, an E-
learning platform for training of SIDBI officials, Sectoral Information Service &
benchmarks for facilitation of direct lending to SMEs and general training through
workshops/seminars for retail lending (including on risk management.
SIDBI has also been successful in availing assistance from other international agencies
such as AFD (Development Agency of France) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) for
the 'Missing Middle' segment wherein unorganised enterprises are being enabled to
move up the value chain towards organised domain of micro enterprises.
As the focus of AF was different from that of the Parent Project, the assessment of the
project has been done separately as shown below. The following achievements
demonstrate the direct correlation between the project's outputs and their resulting
outcomes.
The details of the project's major outcomes and achievements are as follows:
11


﻿L Improving SME access to finance:
(i) Parent project.
CF:
The allocation of US$115 million was fully disbursed to 927 SMEs spread across 10
Indian states, in 18 months (by June 2008) compared to the target of 36 months.
Performance on the PDO indicators-growth in the volumes of lending to SMEs, growth in
the volume of term loans to SMEs, and reduction in NPLs-was impressive:
*  From project start to March 2008, lending by PFIs to SMEs increased by 98 percent
against a target of 37 percent. During the same period, PFIs' term-lending (loans with
a maturity of 3 to 15 years) to SMEs increased by 98 percent against a target of 26
percent.
*  The NPL ratio of participating branches decreased from 12 percent in December 2004
to 1.9 percent in March 2008, against a target of <9 percent. This was a dramatic
improvement that resulted in part from improved lending practices supported through
the project's TA component. Another factor which influenced the improvement in the
rate of NPLs was the participating branches' increased focus and efforts to monitor
and improve asset quality.
*  Profitability and turnover of SMEs also exceeded project targets.
*  SIDBI introduced a long-tenor (5-15 years) credit facility for banks to on-lend to
SMEs.
RSF: See the discussion ofRSF under AF section.
(ii) Additional Financing.
Over 10,000 SME loans were supported by the project through SIDBI and two other PFIs,
namely, the Bank of Maharashtra (BoM) and AU Financiers. Their lending of term
finances to SMEs has increased over 120 percent compared to a target of a 30 percent
increase.

Source: Data from SIDBI, and data from AU Financers and BoM collated by SIDBI, updated June 2013.
*  With strong preparation and implementation efforts and planning, SIDBI financed
retroactively loans worth around US$78 million (19 percent of the total project
amount) covering the retroactive period (June 1, 2008 to June 5, 2009). This was
done in light of the 2008-09 global financial crisis.
*  The project provided much-needed liquidity support to SMEs as they coped with
longer inventory cycles and longer payment cycles from their customers, typically
large corporate firms. In addition, SIDBI diversified the SME loan products to,
working capital loans, working capital term loans, and receivables financing and
contributed to increased production capacity.
*   Geographical coverage has been enhanced by reaching to SMEs in low income states,
including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Jharkhand. An
AU Financiers's SME portfolio was almost nil until 2010, hence the baseline is very low.
6 Greater than original PFI portfolio + financing under project + any other SME specific financing.

13


﻿estimated 20% of the number of SMEs financed and 15% of AF loan amount was
disbursed in these states. This was achieved by focused planning and proactive follow
up by SIDBI with their branches in these states or by identifying partner PFIs with a
strong presence in such states.
*  Loans have been scaled down to smaller SMEs (85 percent of the loans are of an
amount less than US$55,000) and lending has been extended to clusters, (e.g.
Alleppey coir cluster)
*  Profitability of PFIs has exceeded expectations with a 1.39 percent Return on Assets
(ROA) against the targeted 1 percent.
*  Non-performing loans at SIDBI have remained excellent (0.53 percent)
Project Assessment: Parent Project and Additional Financing
Project results assessment used a baseline and follow up survey conducted for both the
parent project and additional financing showed the following achievements:
*  Percentage change in sales under additional financing of the beneficiaries was 31
percent above baseline and 85 percent change in sales under the parent project. This
shows that additional financing has benefitted various MSMEs and other stakeholders
in the project.
*  Beneficiary group under additional financing have increased profits by 73 percent
over baseline, and 42 percent under the parent project.
*  Number of employees in beneficiary MSMEs increased by 28 percent over baseline,
whereas among parent project beneficiary group there was no change over baseline.
*  The productivity per employee increased by 85 percent among the parent project
beneficiary group.

RSF: Implementation of RSF has created a demonstration effect and despite the
relatively small funding allocation, implementing RSF can yield returns. As intended, the
RSF enabled design and launch of a product that dealt with moral hazard (i.e. the risk that
providing the guarantee could result in deterioration in the quality of bank loans to
14


﻿SMEs) and adverse selection (the risk that banks pass on their worst loans for guarantee
coverage) risk, aspects that represented a significant improvement over the existing
guarantee fund in India. Thus, despite the RSF implementing slowly and with a
significantly lower amount, good practices in guarantee fund design was demonstrated in
the Indian financial market. Design elements impacted the larger guarantee program - for
instance, from a position of having virtually no filters to control adverse selection risks,
that guarantee program introduced a risk filter as part of its selection criteria and also
improved measures to diversify (and lower risk) of its portfolio after the initial launch of
the RSF. It is expected that the re-launch of the RSF under the AF, will feed into the
(further) re-design of the main guarantee program which is currently under consideration.
Under the Parent Project, an initial budget allocation of US$5 million was transferred to
the CGTSME, and loans between Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 100 lakh were covered for risk
sharing on a 50-50 basis. This pilot benefited 64 MSMEs through eight institutions
covering proposals of Rs. 47 crores. It was later institutionalized whereby CGTMSE
raised the guarantee cover from Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 100 lakh for its main product
itself. Under the AF, US$10 million had been earmarked for the RSF scaled-up version.
It aimed at taking care of adverse selection aspects and covered loans between Rs. 100
lakh to Rs. 200 lakh. Fifteen proposals involving Rs. 19.77 crores were covered. Two
Memoranda of Understanding were signed and more than 20 guarantees have been issued,
thereby leveraging the initial allocation of US$1.43 million to the RSF.
The achievement of RSF, however, could have been better with more funding from the
Gol and SIDBI.
(iii) DflD-funded TA:
Despite only part utilization of the total allocated amount - which in turn was partly on
account of a late start of this component on account of procedural delays in reaching
formal agreement on the TA - the achievements of the TA component were substantive
as captured in the following highlights.
* Credit Information Bureau of India Ltd. (CIBIL). CIBIL increased its coverage of
SMEs in its commercial (data on firms) database from 0.67 million firms in 2006 to
over 8.48 million firms in 2011 (a 400 percent increase in the size of the database
from the start of the project) considerably supported by the project. Usage of this
credit information, a public good, improved significantly. Average enquiries
increased from 232 per month in 2006 to 26,176 in 2012; and the total number of
credit reports generated increased from 2,783 to 235,676 over the same period.
The TA also enabled CIBIL to integrate the consumer and commercial bureaus which
has not only benefited the banks and financial institutions but also the consumers. The
TA also provided CIBIL with technology up-gradation and helped it grow faster, as
these activities were very technology intensive, required large investments in both
hardware and especially in awareness creation and reaching out to new market
segments (such as the cooperative banks).
15


﻿Support to CIBIL not only enhanced the trust level among lenders, it also emerged as
a credit supplementation pillar enhancing inclusive credit access. The feeling has
percolated well amongst users as also lenders that as reputational collateral, Credit
Information Reports (CIRs) provide inherent value for money. Membership base of
CIBIL has been expanded to over 700 banks. Therefore, the technical assistance has
led to significant development in the credit information system, which contributed in
enhancing access to finance for SMEs.
SME Rating Agency (SMERA). The critical initial development phase of a new
institution SMERA that was aimed to build credit information market infrastructure
and help address a key barrier in SME lending, namely information asymmetry, was
significantly supported under the project. SMERA has since completed more than
14,000 ratings across India of which 52 percent were for micro enterprises, 49 percent
for small enterprises, and three percent for medium enterprises with a diversified
geographic coverage across regions and has also achieved financial self-sustainability.
SMERA has diversified its offerings to the market by providing services such as:
Green Field & Brown Field Ratings, Micro Finance Institutions' Ratings, Maritime
Institution  Grading,  Educational  Institutes'  Grading   and   Risk   Model
Mapping/Validation. The project support also enabled SMERA to launch Green
Ratings (the first of its kind in the country), based on environmentally sustainable
parameters. The rating establishes compatibility of an industrial unit in adhering to
manufacturing process resulting in efficient use of resources with minimum
environmental damage.
SMERA, now an institution accredited as a recognized rating agency by India's
central bank (the Reserve Bank of India), was set up in September 2005. SMEs have
benefited by using its ratings as reputational collateral, accessing credit at competitive
rates, using this as a self-evaluation tool, benefiting from faster processing of credit
application, and building their credibility and negotiating better terms from customers
as well as domestic and foreign suppliers.
* Credit Appraisal and Rating Tool (CART). Capacity building support helped
develop CART, an online tool for pre-sanction documentation, appraisal and
disbursement. CART, an integrated software developed by SIDBI, has demonstrated
that it helps in: (a) increasing the number of loan approvals; (b) lowering non-
performing assets (NPA); and (c) reducing turnaround time. For example, turnaround
time at SIDBI has declined from 26 days (for loan size up to Rs50 Lakh) and 45 (for
loan size above Rs50 Lakh) days in 2007 to 3-4 days and 4-5 days as on March 31,
2011 respectively. The tool has been shared with 20 Public Sector Banks and 18 State
Financial Corporations based on MoUs signed with respective Banks/FIs.
SIDBI has also developed variants for credit appraisal for different lines of business
including for receivable financing, working capital loans and direct credit scheme.
The tool is applied for all of SIDBI's SME lending and has even been shared with
other banks and financial institutions.

﻿II. Improving Business Development Services (BDS):
BDS: The project facilitated access to customized and affordable BDS to MSMEs. The
turnover of individual BDS providers in the intervention clusters increased by 26 percent
during the period 2007-08 to 2010-11, while the profit increased by 37 percent during the
same period. Approximately 800 BDS providers have benefited from the project while
about 450 new BDS providers have been introduced.
The project helped contribute to a change in the focus of cluster development: from hard
infrastructure and supply-driven initiatives to a focus on soft infrastructure that involve a
public private partnership with close involvement of industry associations. Key
innovative tools for BDS delivery through 'Making Market Work for MSMEs' included
the following:
* Voucher Support - Subsidizing by the project towards initial payout by MSMEs to BDS
on tapering basis through a tripartite arrangement between BDS, MSME and
Facilitating Agencies (FAs) - where FAs' role has been to oversee successful
transaction completion.
* BDS Clinic - A one-point-solution and matchmaking platform bringing MSMEs/BDS
together for on-the-spot viable solutions.
* BDS on Wheels - A vehicle carrying BDS to cater to MSMEs service requirements at
the place of MSMEs.
* BDS Panel - Created a panel of more than 450 empanelled BDS who have successfully
rendered services to MSMEs thus giving the needed thrust (it includes a pool of FAs -
with more than 110 personnel in team), BDS Consortia (pooling BDS of different
specialization under one umbrella to offer advantages of collaboration), 19 virtual
BDS (each cluster has a website which has acted as knowledge repository), and
benchmarking of costs leading to reduction in fee.
* Value chain mapping - Every cluster underwent Diagnostic Study which mapped
critical pressure points which were attended throughout project intervention. The
emergent scenario post implementation was compared to pre-launch situation as
mapped by diagnostic study.
* Who-Does-Who-Pays (WDWP) Matrix - The tool has been adopted to map the
availability of BDS and their existing users including paying pattern in the clusters.
This was tracked for pre and post situation.
* Cluster Coordination Committee - This instilled ownership among key cluster actors
towards project initiatives right from inception (diagnostic) till exit (handing over to
exit vehicles). It vetted, validated, monitored and guided the initiatives.
* Skill Development Models (with MFI, BMO led, Corporate Houses, Academia-Industry
Partnership etc.) were tested and validated institutional BDS.
Policy Advocacy: The Advocacy Challenge Fund (ACF) extended capacity building
support to lead industry associations and development organizations. During the project
tenure five ideas were supported viz. (i) MSME Solutions Centre (a one point service
center from industry association targeting at using talent of retired experts), (ii) CSR
Framework for Indian MSMEs (enlisting CSR framework in China and Indian textile and
benchmarking), (iii) MSME Confidence Index (tapping expectations and aspirations of

﻿MSMEs on periodical basis), (iv) Green Dhaba Project (strengthening road side eateries
in religious circuit for adopting hygienic and healthy practices as also enhance reliance
on local natural resources) and (v) Leveraging ITfor E-Procurement.
Knowledge Management. The project undertook numerous innovative initiatives. More
than 60 websites were created and all clusters websites emerged as virtual BDS providers
and facilitators with a database of local BDS providers catering to the need of clusters for
a knowledge sharing platform. Over 100 case studies and policy notes were undertaken.
More than 20 surveys were conducted, including retail chain studies, domestic market
surveys, financial products in clusters, and productivity enhancement.
II. Leveraging Impact of the project. The project was successful in creating several
leveraging impacts as demonstrated below:
* Drawn by the information on the success of this project, the Egyptian apex SME
institution, Society for Development (SFD), through facilitation by the Bank teams in
both regions, expressed interest in a technical collaboration with SIDBI. An MoU was
signed in March 2013 to help support initiatives that can strengthen SME
development in Egypt. As per the MoU, SIDBI would extend technical assistance to
SFD   in the following indicative areas:  (i) Responsible microfinance; (ii)
Establishment  of   a   credit  guarantee  mechanism   for   MSMEs;     (iii)
Development of new     financial products including risk capital products; (iv)
Cluster  development   through  business  development   services;  and  (v)
Risk management and credit appraisal.
Subsequently, the SFD-SIDBI cooperation program was formally launched in May 2013
in Cairo. Based on the interactions and the visit, SIDBI has analyzed the information
collected and designed a comprehensive intervention plan that is now being finalized.
*  The project was also instrumental in creating or supporting the initial establishment
stage of two institutions, namely, CIBIL and SMERA. The fact that SMERA has been
accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is a major achievement of the project.
*  The project's frameworks such as the ESMF, has been adopted by other banks. This
is another example of the project's leveraging impact.
*  The project also resulted in cross-country knowledge sharing. For instance, the best
practices of Alleppey Coir Cluster have been replicated by the Bank's Integrated
Coastal Zone Project in India.
*  Several funding organizations followed the Bank project and supported SIDBI - these
include the French Development agency, the Asian Development Bank, KfW, JICA.
3.3 Efficiency
While detailed analysis with rates of return to investment was difficult given data
constraints, alterative measures of project performance like financial performance of
SIDBI and performances of beneficiary SMEs are assessed and presented in Annex 3 and
a summary of the results are presented in Table 3 below.

The above table shows that the financial performance of SIDBI has improved since the
implementation of the project. Analysis of project beneficiaries also shows that the
project facilitated higher profits, sales, asset position and generated high levels of
employment among the beneficiary SMEs. Further, it may be noted that the success of
the first phase of the project leveraged additional financing and support from other
development partners, which is an indirect indicator of project success. These indicators
suggest overall satisfactory performance of the project.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
Relevance: As explained in Section 3.1, the relevance of objectives, design, and
implementation is rated as High.
Achievement of PDOs: As explained in Section 3.2, the project has many satisfactory
achievements to its credit. Thus, based on the extent of outcome of the project, the
achievement of PDOs is rated as Satisfactory.
Efficiency: The summary of results presented in Section 3.3 and the Annex 3 have shown
that financial performance of the SIDBI has been improving since 2004. The analysis of
the impacts of the project on SME beneficiaries indicate that the establishment of the
credit facility and financing of SMEs improved substantially sales, profit, asset position
and employment. In addition the technical assistance component strengthened
institutional and technical capacity of SIDBI and its subsidiary, Risk Sharing Guarantee
Company.
19


﻿Based on the above factors and the discussion in sections 3.1-3.3, the overall outcome is
rated Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty Impacts. The project's main focus was on promoting SME development and
through this, enable trickle down effects. That being said, there were also some more
'direct' interventions. As part of the BDS initiative, the project undertook both systemic
(long term) and need based (immediate term) approaches in the adopted clusters. The
focus was on 'Employable Skills', 'Skill Up-gradation' and 'Efficient Production' skills.
The interventions led to increased employment opportunities for thousands of
unemployed youth from poor socio-economic background. The intervention also led to
'Better Skilling' of existing workers of MSMEs in the clusters. As a result of skill up-
gradation and training, workers got increased wages and unemployed youth got good jobs
with good starting salaries. In addition, the project results assessment showed that there
was an increase of 28 percent in the employment in the MSMEs financed under the
project. The beneficiary MSMEs have been able to generate high incremental
employment with rising shares of skilled employees. There is also a clear trend of
capacity expansion and technology up-gradation that occurred through support of the
project support. Further, capacity building programs and handholding support to poor
rural women workers have helped these socially excluded segments of the society to
increase their income levels.
Gender Aspects and Social Development: While the project did not have a specific focus
on gender, it had some positive impacts:
*  Project's results assessment shows that the proportion of women in the total number
of employees had increased from 6 percent in 2005-06 to 14 percent in 2010-11
among the beneficiary group MSMEs.
*  In Jaipur, in the state of Rajasthan, SIDBI's financial support to a NBFC has allowed
the latter to reach out to the poor rural women and has provided loans to them to
purchase commercial light motor vehicles (e.g. auto rickshaws, cargo carriers etc.)
which in turn are the sole source of income for these women. Through proactive
support and facilitation provided by the NBFC, most of such clients have gone for
second time loan to expand their enterprises, thus not only stabilizing their income
source but also facilitating them to become micro-entrepreneurs.
*  In Alleppey, in the state of Kerala, coir spinning/weaving cooperatives have invested
in the women Self Help Groups (SHGs) who are producing coir by-products for the
consumption of larger end product manufacturing units, ensuring much large and
sustained turnover and profit for the SHGs and their members. This particular best
practice has benefitted from the support and interventions by the BDS agencies.
*  The project took proactive measures and encouraged SMEs to be responsive towards
welfare of their employees (better working standards for women) and responsible
towards society at large. For example, because of SIDBI's compliance with ESMF, it
has prohibited SME clients from using child labor in their units.
20


﻿* Training was provided to jail inmates in Ludhiana which has facilitated them to
become industrial workers, thereby giving them livelihood options while also
facilitating supply of workers for the SMEs.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact as demonstrated
by the following:
*   Technology modernization and increased competitiveness. Because of the project, at
least seven clusters (out of 19) saw technological /production processes related
interventions. Technology initiatives were related to: (i) technology up-gradation; (ii)
cleaner /greener production technologies; (iii) advanced technologies for processing;
(iv) drudgery reduction technologies; (v) product and design diversifications; (vi)
Information and Communication Technology (ICT). These interventions contributed
to increased competitiveness in these clusters. For example, technological up-
gradation contributed to increased competitiveness as demonstrated in the following
cases: (i) improvisation of Tanning Drum in Chennai led to cost reduction; (ii) up-
gradation of Coupla in Coimbatore cluster to maximize the use of coal resulted in an
estimated saving of approximately Rs. 1.12 crore per annum; (iii) in Rourkela, three
technology demonstration on latest technologies in automated CNC and welding
machines were organized which led to adoption of the technology and cost savings.
*  Strengthening the capacity of SMEs: The project has enhanced the capacities of
beneficiary SMEs to access and deploy funds for technology up-gradation, capacity
expansion, working capital needs, etc. to become more competitive, profitable and
sustainable. The project has also supported SMEs in gaining wider market access
through a number of market sizing and mapping studies, establishing linkages with
retail marketing chains, and organizing networking events for buyers and sellers.
*   Capacity building of SIDBI and PFI officials. More than 2,100 staff from SIDBI,
commercial banks, and financial institutions received training on different areas of
lending such as environmental management, credit scoring, downscaling, and risk
capital financing. Likewise, more than 380 training programs were conducted for
sensitizing bankers on the use of credit bureaus. More than 250 officers were trained
on CART with 117 officers from SIDBI and 135 from other Banks/FIs.
*  ESMF. ESMF is a good practice model in global market and it has been integrated
into the lending mechanism of SIDBI and PFIs, and is helpful to ascertain their risk in
terms of environment and social issues. ESMF has been applied and adopted for more
than 10,000 SME loans financed under the project. ESMF addressed the requirements
of the law of the land such as abolition of child labor, environmental issues, labor
welfare, adequate sanitation facilities, etc in a systematic manner. It also aimed to
help SMEs to better understand the environmental and social aspects of business in
their day to day operations.
For details on CIBIL, SMERA, CART, and ACF, see Section 3.2
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
* After successful implementation of ESMF into its lending procedures, SIDBI officials
have started applying ESMF on other loans as well. Later SIDBI has identified
21


﻿sustainable/Green (i.e. a thrust on energy efficiency) financing as a niche area. SIDBI
has also been focusing on thematic areas such as risk capital, service sector financing,
and 'Missing Middle', where other institutions are not giving loans.
*  The ESMF implemented under the project was instrumental in changing the mindset
on the importance of safeguards aspects for the well-being of communities.
*  The project helped share relevant knowledge and experience to CIBIL to set up two
more repositories of information for the detection of fraud and mortgage checks.
* The emergence of the 'I am SME of India' campaign in Faridabad, a facilitator
agency, demonstrated that an association of SMEs, through collective bargaining,
could negotiate and receive huge discounts for goods and services for its individual
SME members. It has also shown that collective action leads to better solutions to
individual problems.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
See Annex 5
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low
The ICR team considers that the risk to development outcome would be negligible to low
because all the achievements of the project are sustainable. For example:
*  CF is sustainable as the facility has been expanded using SIDBI's and PFI's existing
systems.
*  RSF has been partially achieved and although implemented at a lower scale, it was
able to provide the demonstration effect that was targeted. Sustainability of RSF will
depend on continued funding from the Gol and SIDBI and how the lessons from the
RSF are incorporated into the main guarantee program in the future.
*  ESMF: With the increased focus on safeguards, SIDBI is well positioned to continue
to lead and disseminate the ESMF as an integral part of the loan delivery system for
SMEs. This would enhance the quality of loan portfolios of financial institutions.
*  BDS. The BDS interventions have become sustainable as they are recovering costs
from their clients. Some BDS providers have since gone beyond sub-sectors for
which they were capacitated and have ventured into other clusters/activity areas.
*  CIBIL has attained a sustainable level of operation: It has more than 7.6 million trade
records for commercial entities and about 700 members, and the average inquiries per
month have increased from 232 in 2006 to about 27,000 in 2012.
*  SMERA: By October 2011, SMERA had turned into a sustainable entity by rating
almost 14,000 plus MSMEs (out of which micro and small enterprises constituted 98
percent) and recording substantial net profit. As on September 30, 2013 (without
project support) it has continued its growth momentum by rating 23,000 MSMEs (96
percent MSEs), gained trust of the regulators, thus expanding its services to include
large corporations and recording 122 percent growth in net profit.

﻿5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project
was satisfactory. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the
adequacy of project design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial,
economic, and institutional, including procurement and financial management. A number
of alternatives were also considered for the project design.
Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided
the technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and a good project design.
The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and financial resources to
ensure quality preparation and appraisal work. The project was consistent with the CAS
and government priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank had a consistently good
working relationship with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory.
The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory.
Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately and
intensively supervised with missions focusing on interactions with SIDBI, visiting field
sites across the country and interfacing with other key stakeholders. The task team
prepared Aide-Memoires regularly and alerted the government and SIDBI to problems
with project execution and facilitated remedies in a timely manner. The Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of
achievement of PDO and project implementation. The task team also monitored
safeguard and fiduciary compliance.
Bank's procurement and financial management proficient staff worked with SIDBI's
PMD staff to explain the rules and procedures to be applied during project
implementation. The task team prepared AF in close collaboration with the Ministry of
Finance and SIDBI, after taking into account the lessons learned from the preparation of
the parent project.
The task team carried out two MTRs, first for the parent project in July 2006, and the
second for the AF in April 2011. Both MTRs assessed progress to date on all project
components, implementation issues and actions to be taken to ensure the successful
completion of the project.
One important aspect of the Bank's performance and contribution was the continuity of the
TTL and some key sector specialists who remained in the task team, from project inception
through completion. This continuity engendered consistency, depth and follow-up in the
dialogue with the government and SIDBI.
23


﻿(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
With a Satisfactory rating for quality at entry and a Satisfactory rating for quality of
supervision, overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory in accordance with
Independent Evaluation Group's (IEG's) harmonized rating criteria.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
As mentioned in Section 2.1, the government had shown its commitment to the objectives
of the project at the time of project preparation. The government consistently maintained
its commitment throughout the implementation. The government officials worked closely
with the Bank's project team on a continual basis, and cooperated fully with the task team.
Appropriate levels of review and approval were usually in place; financial accountability
and follow-up was observed, and expenditures were duly authorized before they were
incurred; and documentation was maintained properly for periodic review. Government
participated in the Project Review Committee and contributed by making useful
suggestions. On the other hand, implementation of the RSF was affected on account of
the lack of budgeting for the government's contribution to CGTMSE, which was the
implementing entity for the RSF, but budgeting was made eventually to allow the piloting
of this financial instrument. Overall government performance is rated as Satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
SIDBI was strongly committed to the project and had good management capacity, which
was supplemented with externally recruited experts. SIDBI demonstrated impressive
implementation preparedness and progress. Examples included: (i) quick disbursement of
the retroactive amount and disbursement of an additional amount; and (ii) conducting
regular meetings between the Bank team and SIDBI, and also with other partners.
SIDBI was very effective in carrying out all aspects of project management, such as
financial management (FM), procurement arrangements, and safeguards.
Financial Management. FM arrangements in the project were broadly those based on
SIDBI's mainstream FM system, including tracking end use of funds.
These arrangements were adequate and met the Bank's FM requirements. The external
audit reports were unqualified. However, there were occasionally some delays in the
submission of the interim unaudited financial reports and audit reports.
SIDBI provided working capital facilities to its SME clients and sub-loans to SMEs
under this product were eligible for financing under the project. During implementation,
24


﻿there was a difference of opinion between SIDBI and the Bank in respect of the
methodology followed by SIDBI for identification of the amount of sub-loan eligible for
financing by the Bank. In these cases, while SIDBI considered all withdrawals/pay-outs
from the account as eligible for reimbursement, the Bank was of the view that the
maximum amount eligible for reimbursement was limited to the sanctioned amount. This
matter was under discussion for some time. Finally SIDBI agreed to the Bank's
interpretation.
Overall project's FM performance was rated Satisfactory during implementation.
Procurement Arrangements. SIDBI put in place the mechanism to capture the details of
the contracts issued by its borrowers, which helped in effectively monitoring the
compliance of agreed procurement arrangements. SIDBI also regularly trained its branch
staff in procurement procedures. Nothing adverse was observed during procurement
audits or mission visits. Based on this, the performance of SIDBI in procurement is rated
as Satisfactory.
Safeguards. SIDBI management, over the past eight years, had: (a) streamlined
safeguards risk management into their corporate framework and disseminated the
approach to their sub-lenders and fellow bankers; (b) facilitated policy advocacy on
safeguards risk management through Department of Financial Services (DFS), Gol; and
(c) disseminated implemented case studies on application of ESMF and its benefits.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
With a Satisfactory rating for Government performance and a Satisfactory rating for
implementing agencies' performance, overall borrower performance is rated as
Satisfactory in accordance with IEG's harmonized rating criteria.
6. Lessons Learned
The lessons emerging from this SME Project (SMEP) are as follows:
Project Design:
*  A credit line accompanied by a technical assistance component can contribute to a
more comprehensive project design by addressing both supply side and demand side
issues, components complemented one another and led to effective synergy and
improved outcomes. Working with industry stakeholders, like industry associations,
is critical to implement effective BDS components that are demand led.
*  The establishment of an autonomous PMD right at the start of the project ensured
uninterrupted and seamless implementation of the project, and facilitated successful
project implementation. The PMD should have separate allocated manpower,
procurement guidelines and delegations of powers which are necessary for the project.
This facilitates looking beyond traditional approaches and piloting innovations.
25


﻿*  Countercyclical funding to viable businesses can be an effective post-crisis measure,
not just in terms of providing funding but also the 'signaling effect'. For this to
succeed strong client commitment to such actions is needed, together with a
particularly strong effort on implementation planning on disbursements that facilitates
prompt action/disbursements.
*  Expansion of project activities in low income states can be greatly facilitated by a
strategy that relies on identifying appropriate existing financial intermediaries with
local presence and providing them adequate support.
*  Upfront ownership and realism are critical particularly with regard to innovative
components such as the RSF and the TA and both could have been 'right-sized' in
retrospect. Also, precise definitions of eligible expenditures for each of the financing
products should be thoroughly discussed and agreed upfront.
Implementation:
*   Strong commitment and ownership, good technical and human resource capacity,
proactive approach for resolving implementation issues; advance planning for
disbursements and competent staff on the part of the client, and close coordination
with the donors, are important for the smooth implementation and achievement of the
project objectives. In addition, having continuity in the PMD is critical.
*  With a strong effort on training, sensitization and communication, the project
demonstrated that there is a scope for inculcating an appreciation amongst lenders and
SMEs on environmental and social issues.
*  During implementation it was realized that there is no incentive for SMEs to follow
the ICB procedure of the Bank, and that they prefer commercial practices as the
method of procurement. For future FILs this aspect needs to be addressed.

﻿Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1. Credit Facility
(a) Parent Project
*  The full allocation of US$115 million was fully disbursed to 927 SMEs spread
across 10 Indian states, in 18 months (by June 2008) compared to the target of 36
months.
*  SIDBI introduced a long-tenor (5-15 years) credit facility for banks to on-lend to
SMEs.
*  Environment and Social Risk Management Framework (ESMF). ESMF is a good
practice model in global market and it has been integrated into the lending
mechanism of SIDBI and PFIs, and is helpful to ascertain their risk in terms of
environment and social issues. ESMF has been adopted by more than 10000
SMEs financed under the project ESMF addressed the requirements of the law of
the land such as abolition of child labor, environmental issues, labor welfare,
adequate sanitation etc. It also aimed to help SMEs to better understand the
environmental and social aspects of business in their day to day operations.
(b) Additional Financing
* Under the AF, US$400 million was fully disbursed. Over 10,000 SME loans were
supported by the project through SIDBI, BOM and AU Financiers.
Achievement of this component was Satisfactory.
Component II. Risk Sharing Facility
(a) Original Project
* An initial budget allocation of US$5 million was transferred to the Credit
Guarantee Fund Trust for SMEs (CGTMSE), and loans between Rs. 50 lakh to
Rs. 100 lakh were covered for risk sharing on 50-50 basis. This pilot benefited 64
MSMEs through eight institutions covering proposals of Rs. 47 crore. It was later
institutionalized whereby CGTMSE raised the guarantee cover from Rs. 50 lakh
to Rs. 100 lakh for the main product itself.
(b) Additional Financing
*  Two MoUs were signed and more than 20 guarantees have been issued, thereby
leveraging the initial allocation of US$1.43 million to the RSF.
*  Under AF, $10 million had been earmarked for RSF scaled up version. It aimed at
taking care of adverse selection aspects and covered loans between Rs. 100 lakh
to Rs. 200 lakh. 15 proposals involving Rs. 19.77 crores were covered.
29


﻿Achievement of this component was Moderately Satisfactory.
Component III. Technical Assistance
*  CIBIL. Support under the project facilitated CIBIL in increasing its coverage of
SMEs in its commercial (data on firms) database from 0.67 million firms in 2006 to
over 8.48 million firms in 2011 (a 400 percent increase in the size of the database
from the start of the project). The TA also enabled CIBIL to integrate the consumer
and commercial bureaus which has not only benefited the banks and financial
institutions but also the consumers. The TA also provided CIBIL with technology up-
gradation and helped it grow faster, as these activities were very technology intensive,
required large investments in both hardware and especially in awareness creation and
reaching out to new market segments (such as the cooperative banks). The increase
in the size of the database has been accompanied by an increase in its use: average
enquiries increased from 232 per month in 2006 to 26,176 in 2012; and the total
number of credit reports generated increased from 2,783 to 235,676 over the same
period.
Support to CIBIL not only enhanced the trust level among lenders, it also emerged as
a credit supplementation pillar enhancing inclusive credit access. The feeling has
percolated down well among users as also lenders that as a reputational collateral CIR
( Credit Information Reports) provides inherent value for money. Membership base
of CIBIL has been expanded to over 700 banks. Therefore, the technical assistance
has led to significant development in the credit information system, which contributed
in enhancing access to finance for SMEs.
*  SME Rating Agency (SMERA). SMERA was set up in September 2005 as an
MSME dedicated third party rating agency to provide credible, comprehensive &
transparent credit ratings to MSMEs. With the project support SMERA has completed
more than 14,000 ratings, across India of which 52 percent were for micro
enterprises, 49 percent for small enterprises, and three percent for medium enterprises
with a diversified geographic coverage across regions and has also achieved financial
self-sustainability. SMERA has diversified its offerings to the market by providing
services such as: Green Field & Brown Field Ratings, Micro Finance Institutions'
Ratings, Maritime Institution Grading, Educational Institutes' Grading and Risk
Model Mapping / Validation. The project support also enabled SMERA to launch
Green Ratings (the first of its kind in the country), based on environmentally
sustainable parameters. The rating establishes compatibility of an industrial unit in
adhering to manufacturing process resulting in efficient use of resources with
minimum environmental damage.
SMEs have derived advantages of SMERA rating by using it as a reputational
collateral, access to credit at competitive rates, self-evaluation tool, faster processing
of credit application, building credibility and negotiating better terms from customers
as well as suppliers-domestic as well as overseas, enhanced visibility and improved
30


﻿access to finance from un-conventional sources.
* Credit Appraisal and Rating Tool (CART). Capacity building support helped
CART develop an online tool (its purview covers pre-sanction documentation and
disbursement). The tool has demonstrated that it helps in: (a) increasing the number
of loan approvals; (b) lowering non-performing assets (NPA); and (c) reducing
turnaround time. For example, turnaround time at SIDBI has declined from 26 days
(for loan size up to 50 Lakh) and 45 (for loan size above 50 Lakh) days in 2007 to 3-4
days and 4-5 days as on March 31, 2011 respectively. The tool has been shared with
20 Public Sector Banks and 18 State Financial Corporations based on MoUs signed
with respective Banks/FIs.
CART Cell has also developed variants for credit appraisal for different lines of
business including for receivable financing, working capital loans and direct credit
scheme. More than 4,000 SMEs benefitted from the initiative enjoying quicker and
faster credit availability.
BDS: The project facilitated access to customized and affordable BDS to MSMEs. The
turnover of individual BDS providers in the intervention clusters increased by 26%
during the period 2007-08 to 2010-11, while the profit increased by 37% during the same
period. Approximately 800 BDS providers have benefited from the project while about
450 new BDS providers have been introduced.
The project changed the focus of cluster development from hard infrastructure to soft
infrastructure. Key innovative tools for BDS delivery through 'Making Market Work for
MSMEs' included the following:.
* Voucher Support - Subsidizing by the project towards initial payout by MSMEs to BDS
on tapering basis through a tripartite arrangement between BDS, MSME and
Facilitating Agency (FAs) - where FAs role has been to oversee successful
transaction completion.
* BDS Clinic - A one point solution and matchmaking platform bringing MSMEs/BDS
together for on the spot viable solutions.
* BDS on Wheels - A vehicle carrying BDS to cater to MSMEs service requirements at
the place of MSMEs (with thrust on MEs)
* BDS Panel - Created Panel of > 450 empanelled BDS who have successfully rendered
services to MSMEs thus giving the needed trust (it includes a pool of FAs - with more
than 110 personnel in team), BDS Consortia (pooling BDS of different specialization
under one umbrella to offer advantages of collaboration), 19 virtual BDS (each
cluster has a website which have acted as knowledge repository), benchmarking of
costs leads to reduction in fee etc.
* Value chain mapping - Every cluster underwent Diagnostic Study which mapped
critical pressure points which were attended throughout project intervention. The
emergent scenario post implementation was compared to pre-launch situation as
mapped by diagnostic study.
* Who-Does-Who-Pays (WDWP) Matrix - The tool has been adopted to map the
31


﻿availability of BDS and their existing users including paying pattern in the clusters.
This was tracked for pre and post situation.
* Cluster Coordination Committee - This instilled ownership among key cluster actors
towards project initiatives right from inception (diagnostic) till exit (handing over to
exit vehicles). It vetted, validated, monitored and guided the initiatives.
* Cross Learning's & Exposure Visits - For learning's from successes and failures in
other clusters, Project organized cross learning workshops on regular basis (national /
regional level which has evolved as an institutionalized learning mechanism). More
than 16 such learnshops upgraded the capacity of FAs.
* Skill Development Models (with MFI, BMO led, Corporate Houses, Academia-Industry
Partnership etc.) were tested and validated institutional BDS.
Policy Advocacy: The Advocacy Challenge Fund (ACF) extended capacity building
support to lead industry associations and development organizations. During the project
tenure five ideas were supported viz. (i) MSME Solutions Centre (a one point service
center from industry association targeting at using talent of retired experts), (ii) CSR
Framework for Indian MSMEs (enlisting CSR framework in China and Indian textile and
benchmarking), (iii) MSME Confidence Index (tapping expectations and aspirations of
MSMEs on periodical basis), (iv) Green Dhaba Project (strengthening road side eateries
in religious circuit for adopting hygienic and healthy practices as also enhance reliance
on local natural resources) and (v) Leveraging ITfor E-Procurement.
Knowledge Management, The project undertook numerous innovative initiatives. More
than 60 websites were created and all clusters'websites emerged as virtual BDS providers
and facilitators with a database of local BDS providers catering to the need of clusters for
a knowledge sharing platform. Over 100 case studies and policy notes were completed.
More than 20 surveys were conducted, including retail chain studies, domestic market
surveys, financial products in clusters, and productivity enhancement.
* Capacity building of SIDBI and PFI officials. More than 2,100 staff from SIDBI,
commercial banks, and financial institutions have received training on different areas
of lending such as environment management, credit scoring, downscaling, and risk
capital financing. Likewise, more than 380 training programs were conducted for
about 900 CIBIL staff members on topics such as, access of credit information
reports; interpreting credit reports and the importance of making sound credit
decision; and data submission process. More than 250 officers were trained on CART
with 117 officers from SIDBI and 135 from other Banks/FIs.
Achievement of this component was Satisfactory.

﻿Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Project benefits
The project components generated significant economic benefits through improvement of
SME credit market efficiency, improvement of risk management of the SME loan
portfolios and strengthening banks' SME loan appraisal systems and practices. The
implementation of the three project components enabled profitable lending to SMEs and
reduced NPLs.
The economic benefits from the project components are outlined below:
Credit facility: The credit facility provided access to longer-term resources for the banks
for on-lending to SMEs. The SMEs in turn accessed term lending for three or more years
that facilitated capital formation and improvement in technology. Higher capital
formation and improved technologies in turn facilitated growth, productivity and
competitiveness of SMEs.
Risk Sharing Facility: The RSF demonstrated good practice design for partial risk sharing
facilities and influenced the design of a larger (less-well designed) guarantee fund.
Technical assistance: This component improved efficiency in loan appraisal through
improving the appraisal process, improved loan products of SME and increased
profitability of banks from lending to SMEs and created valuable market infrastructure.
The beneficiary SMEs also increased their productivity, management and thus
competitiveness. The TA on collection and processing of credit information on SMEs
improved the credit information on SMEs as this database further serves as a public good
which is critical to manage asset quality in lending to SMEs.
As the above project benefits could not be aggregated to conduct a conventional
economic analysis of the costs and benefits and the rate of return analysis, such an
analysis is not attempted here. Instead we have attempted an analysis looking at the
financial performance of SIDBI and also impact of the project on a sample of
beneficiaries.
Financial performance of SIDBI
Given the pivotal role of SIDBI in this project an improved and healthy financial
performance of SIDBI is an indicator of the project impacts and thus project benefits.
Table 1 shows the financial performance of SIDBI before and after the project.

The CRAR remains strong and well above regulatory levels. The asset quality, measured
as nonperforming assets (NPA) as percentage of net loans, improved since the project
implementation. The net profit and earning per share (EPS) and net interest income as
percentage of working funds has been increasing since project implementation, indicating
improving financial performance of the SIDBI.
Project impact on SMEs
The first line of credit of US$120 million earmarked to facilitate increased flow of loans
to SMEs was utilized in 18 months against the target of 36 months. Term loans were
extended to 927 MSMEs in 13 locations all over India through respective SIDBI
branches. Following the successful utilization of the first line of credit, the additional
credit of US$400 million was sanctioned in 2009.
In order to appraise the impact of the project, an assessment was conducted by JPS
Associates.8 The project impacts were then measured in key parameters like sales, profit,
total fixed assets, number of employees, women employees, term loan coverage and
interest on term loans. A baseline survey before project and a survey after the project
were done to analyze the project impacts. The findings show that the growth in profits -
the most critical indicator of SME performance - of beneficiary SMEs under the initial
project and under additional financing were substantive at 42 percent and 73 percent.
Similarly, the growth in total fixed assets of the beneficiaries was 116 percent. Sales
growth was strong at 85 percent in the parent project and 31 percent in the AF.
Productivity improvements were significant too. Details are presented in Table 2.
8 Although a control group was used, and performance of beneficiary SMEs against the control group is
overall better, this analysis is not presented as there were issues with the control group size/quality.

Conclusions
The analysis showed that financial performance of the SIDBI has been improving since
2004. The successful implementation of the first phase resulted in additional financing
and significant contribution by other donors. The analysis of the impacts of the project
on SME beneficiaries indicate that the establishment of the credit facility and financing
of SMEs improved in general the sales, profit, asset position and employment. In
addition the technical assistance component strengthened institutional and technical
capacity of SIDBI and its subsidiary, Risk Sharing Guarantee Company.

﻿Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Project background
SIDBI is the Implementing Agency for the "MSME Financing and Development Project
(MSME - FDP)" involving the World Bank, DFID, UK and KFW & GIZ, Germany as
partners. The Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance, Government of India is
the Nodal Agency for the Project. The Project attends to demand and supply side needs of
MSMEs through judicious provision of financial and non-financial services. Project has
adopted an innovative approach (caters to target population which spans across stakeholders
of MSME domain) to attend to poverty alleviation through enterprise development in MSME
domain. The grounding of enterprises and instilling competiveness in them contributes to
national development as also the Millennium Development Goals.
Context
SMEs in India contribute to 45 percent of manufacturing output and 40 percent of exports,
and are, outside of the agriculture sector, the largest source of employment. The Project's
interventions to support scaled up funding to SMEs while maintaining good quality of assets,
was therefore important. In India, technology upgradation was envisaged to be a major
challenge for MSMEs in competing with their global counter parts. World Bank line of credit
I was majorly used for the technology upgradation for the MSME sector, whereas the line of
credit II was majorly used for the funding MSMEs during recessionary times through various
products including Term Loan , working capital (TL and limits), Bills. The project has
developed a model "good practice" Environmental and Social Risk Management Framework
(ESMF) for lending to SMEs. It meets country and Bank requirements while being simple
and pragmatic - having been developed in close consultation with operational credit officers
of SIDBI and other financial institutions. Funding under the CF has helped provide access to
longer term finance which helps SMEs to expand and/or invest in capital expenditure, expand
innovative receivable financing, and reverse factoring products

﻿Project Restructurin2 / revision in World Bank part
The project has majorly two components viz. credit facility and risk sharing facility. The RSF
implementation had been delayed primarily on account of lack of budgeting, a factor outside
of SIDBI's control, as SIDBI can fund the RSF implementing agency, the Credit Guarantee
Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE), only after a Government
contribution is received by CGTMSE and only in an amount equal to one fifth of the
Government contribution. While an initial budget allocation from the Government was made
in 2013, and following that Project funds via SIDBI were disbursed and the RSF launched,
the budget allocation was only sufficient to allow utilization of US$1.43 million of Project
proceeds. While this is lower than what was expected, it has allowed the piloting of the RSF
and the Project's objective of catalyzing a demonstration effect of good risk sharing facility
design has been achieved. However, it was unlikely at that time that in the remaining project
period, further budget allocation would be made by the Government to CGTMSE. The
Project was also extended by a year in 2012 (till June 2013) to allow for time to implement
the RSF (allocation of US$10 million).
So, SIDBI had requested for a reallocation of Project proceeds from the RSF to the CF, in the
amount of US$8.57 million, which was considered by World Bank favorably and in June
2013, an amount of US$ 8.57 million was reallocated to credit facility. Additional credit
facility facilitated by this reallocation expanded coverage of SMEs under the Project through
a participating financial institution. The achievement of PDOs pursuant to the changes made
in allocation of project proceeds was not affected. Performance on PDO indicators as
discussed above was remained strong.
Key factors affectin2 implementation and outcomes
The critical factor in implementing the credit facility has been the ESMF framework as also
Risk Sharing Facility. Both needed good measure of convincing the participating Financial
Institutions. While on Credit Facility initially support was sanctioned to few PFIs however
their slow response to ESMF and pricing aspect made SIDBI to take steps ahead as a
demonstrative effect. Here also sensitizing credit officials about its features was strongly
required. To start with credit officers emphasized on MSMEs to adopt this but this had slow
response. Then the project decided to strengthen the credit value chain (right from credit
officers to loan processing cells, internal and external auditors and so on. This created an
enabling environment where in officers started facilitating the adoption during discussions,
pre and post sanction stages and so on. This evinced good receptivity. Similarly when SIDBI
was able to channelize it on this framework, it was in a position to convince other
participating institutions about benefits emanating from the ESMF framework. This evinced
good response and NBFCs/ Banks evinced interest to join. This required few sensitization
programs. SIDBI has since revisited the ESMF framework and this needs to be validated at
operating level.
In Risk Sharing Facility it required convincing CGTMSE to look at its beneficial impacts
which included eliminating aspects of moral hazard and adverse selection. Also this required
convincing the participating institutions to join in. In the first part, the band was Rs. 50 lakh
to Rs. 1 crore (when general CGTMSE scheme covered up to Rs. 50 lakh). Later the same
was institutionalized by Gol partly due to appetite being available in the segment. In the IInd
phase, besides convincing CGTMSE, the band was raised to Rs. 2 crore (whereas the limit of
general guarantee product is Rs. 1 crore).

﻿Achievements of Objectives and Outputs
Access to finance is a critical input for the promotion of the entire MSME sector. To address
this issue, long term financing, supporting capital formation and technological upgradation
are a critical requirement for a MSE to maintain its growth trajectory. Under the MSME-FDP,
SIDBI looked beyond traditional approaches and facilitated MSME growth for survival and
sustainability by providing Credit Facility. There were many fold benefits to the MSME
sector by the credit facility and some major reasons behind this components are as below:
The credit facility primarily addresses the financing needs of the MSMEs, as
defined by the Government of India under the MSMED Act, 2006, and enables them
to access longer-term funds for their sustainable growth.
/      The facility was being implemented by SIDBI and had been utilized for
extending credit to existing and new MSMEs.
/      SIDBI associated with various participating FIs (including bank, NBFCs) and
extended the credit facility through them for wider spread.
V/     The Project has been designed in such a way as to encourage MSMEs to adopt
best international practices by following environmental and social standards. For
instance, industries falling under the negative list of the World Bank are excluded
from the purview of the Project.
/      Cases supported under the Project are filtered through a comprehensive E&S
framework which is an adoption of global best practices. Documenting commercial
practices of MSMEs has also been an attempt aligned to International Best Practice.
/      This LoC-I had benefitted 927 MSMEs in 13 locations. The LoC contracted were
fully utilized in 18 months compared to target of 36 months.
/      The Project's strong performance results are captured in the findings of a
baseline survey and evaluation report (prepared by SIDBI) which shows that more
than 300 MSMEs that were surveyed have reported 18% growth in sales and 17%
growth in profits after availing long term finance from SIDBI.
/      Two thirds of the MSMEs financed allocated their resources to technology up
gradation, resulting in increase in productivity.
The additional financing became effective on July 28, 2009. The project successfully
disbursed under the CF component the amount of US$398.57 million, including close to a
third of this amount in the months following project effectiveness - a period when SMEs
faced a situation of tight liquidity in the backdrop of the 2008 global financial crisis.
Disbursements since 2009 on the CF have been strong and over 10,000 SMEs have been
supported by the project through SIDBI and two other participating financial institutions
(PFIs). Successful application of the project Environment and Social Safeguards Framework
(ESMF) has been one of the highlights of the implementation.
Through the funding the project has provided:
1. vitally needed, post-global financial crisis counter-cyclical funding in 2009 onwards;
2. enhanced the project's geographical coverage by reaching SMEs in underserved
states;
3. scaled down loans to smaller SMEs (85% of the loans are of amount less than Rs2.5
million);
4. broadened the menu of existing products such as term-loans, working capital loans
and receivables financing and contributed to increased production capacity;
5. extended lending to clusters, although to a relatively limited extent, where TA/cluster
development activities was underway (eg. Kochi coir cluster); and
6. supported training of branch staff of SIDBI and AU Financiers to apply the
Environmental and Social Safeguards framework while undertaking SME lending.

﻿Achievement by Development Objectives
An external M&E agency was hired to measure the impact of the project. The line of credit
extended by World Bank has created impact on the ground and the same has been measured
by an independent agency during its impact assessment survey. As per the survey report,
overall, the MSMEs covered in the impact assessment survey have registered increase in
sales turnover, exports and profitability, as compared to the performance in 2005-06 (baseline
year).
Sales: The average sales turnover of the Beneficiary Group MSMEs has increase to about
85%.
Exports: Overall increase in average exports per exporting MSME (Beneficiary Group) in
2010-11 was 131% higher than the baseline year. On the other hand, the exports of Control
Group MSMEs have increased by 93%.
Profits: The profitability of the WBLoC-1 beneficiary units grew by 42% during 2005-06 to
2010-11. A lower growth in profits, as compared to sales, indicates increasing competition
and therefore pressure on the bottom line. The control group MSMEs reported a lower
increase in profits by 4% over baseline.
Fixed Assets: The value of total fixed assets held by the MSMEs, increased by about 116%
over the five-year period since 2005-06., while there has been a 40% increase in the
investment in fixed assets by the Control Group MSMEs in the same period. The higher
investment in Beneficiary Group has been leveraged by the credit indicates availability of
timely credit enhances the appetite of MSMEs growth offered to the beneficiary MSMEs
under the WBLOC-1.
Employment: Overall, the WBLoC-1 units covered under the survey had an average of 65
employees in the baseline year 2005-06, comprising of 9 managerial, 31 skilled workers and
25 unskilled workers. In 2010-11, the overall average employment has remained the same,
although in the intervening years till 2007-08 when the number of employees rose to 75 per
MSME. The subsequent decline in the employment could be attributed to factors like the
economic slowdown resulting in retrenchment of contract workers, and increase in
productivity due to technology upgradation and induction of modem equipment. The average
productivity per employee (ratio of sales turnover to total number of employees) in the
baseline year was Rs. 6.3 Lakh, which has increased by about 86% to Rs.11.7 Lakh per
employee in 2010-11, which implies that the focus has been more on skill development rather
than increase in numbers.
The proportion of women employees in the total number of employees has increased from
6 % in 2005-06 to 14% in 2010-11 among the Beneficiary Group MSMEs. The Control
Group reported the increase in the proportion of women employees from 7% in 2005-06 to
11% in 2010-11.
Audit
A system of annual audit by the statutory auditor of SIDBI was introduced in the project. The
annual reports from the auditors were regularly conducted and shared with the World Bank.
The audit is a best practice that reviews the overall health of a project with respect to
compliance to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement signed.
42


﻿Monitorin2 and evaluation (M&E) desi2n, implementation and utilization of World bank
line of credit
The MSME-FDP adopted a three tier mechanism for the monitoring and evaluation of the
project:
1. Project management Division
This division was setup in SIDBI as an autonomous body for effective monitoring of the
project on day to day basis. In SIDBI around 45 branches were given the responsibility of
channelizing this line of credit under the overall guidance of PMD.
2. M&E agency
The project appointed an M&E agency for monitoring of the project and to carry out the
M&E exercise by various modes which majorly included primary survey. The agency
was submitted its reports to all project partners including SIDBI.
3. Project Review Committee (PRC)
A committee comprising of heads of all project partners was setup to review the progress
of the project on periodic basis. The committee used to advise on policy matters and was
chaired by CMD, SIDBI.
Safe2uard and fiduciary compliance
Environment and social risk management framework (E&S framework) which was
considered to be the good practice in global market was integrated in the lending mechanism
of the recipient and in the partner financial institutions. The E&S framework was helpful for
the PFIs to ascertain their risk in terms of environment and social issues. A brief on
Environment and social risk management system is appended at Annexure I.
This time line of credit also included the procurement process in the system. All the MSME
units which were funded had to follow the procurement process prescribed by the World
Bank to bring more transparency and value for money or MSMEs in the usage of funds. A
brief on procurement guidelines prescribed by World Bank is appended at Annexure II.
Independent Project Management Units
In order to ensure smooth implementation of the Project, SIDBI had set up a dedicated
Project Management Division at New Delhi. The PMD team comprised of officials from
SIDBI and also has some specialists / experts on need basis on long term and short term
contracts. The unit was reports to the Chief General Manager (Country Head) of SIDBI.
PMD was responsible for overall implementation of the MSME- Financing & Development
Project. Project management has largely improved with an independent department in SIDBI.
Administrative functions were simple, direct and easier to follow. Decisions were taken
promptly and quicker than in the earlier system. There was a complete transparency and
accountability in the project management.
BER: Annexure I
Environment and Social Risk management Framework(ESMF) - A brief
The adoption of environmental and social risk management techniques and procedures are
becoming important for financial institutions across the world, driven on one hand by increasing
awareness of environmental issues among customers and shareholders, and on the other hand by
strict liability as a result of pressure from society and governments. In India, banks and financial
institutions are currently not liable for their borrower's environmental performance (i.e where an
industry that has borrowed funds and as part of their operations has failed in meeting its
environmental obligations. However they are exposed to credit risk that may arise from either a
43


﻿borrower's inability to repay loans due to restrictions or penalties arising from environmental
issues or reduced value of collateral property (e.g. site contamination). Global awareness and
tightening environmental laws & enforcement, increased public pressures and litigation indicate
that environmental risks have already started assuming significance.
Environmental and social risk can be defined as the potential for reputational or financial
damage as the result of transactions, products, services or investments that involve a party
associated with environmentally or socially sensitive activities, or potential exposure to risks
relating to environmental liabilities, human rights infringements, or changes in regulations.
This does not mean that we do not fund such activities but that we adopt a proactive and
conscious management framework which is a risk-based approach to environmental and social
aspects. We have to regularly analyze our portfolio of products and services to assess their
respective environmental and social risk potential.
We have to put an internal institutional framework for the identification, assessment and
management of environmental and social risks. These have to be integrated in the decision
process such that environmental and social risks are identified, assessed and managed in a timely
manner.
ESMF framework - The World Bank group, in its operational directives under MSME Financing
and Development project- a multi partnership project implemented by SIDBI, has stipulated that
all lending extended should be environmentally sustainable. Accordingly SIDBI has adopted the
ESMF framework to assist the credit officers in assessing E&S risks at early stages of project life
cycle and the risk management provisions that can be incorporated. The framework has been
designed in such a way as to reflect the concerns of and best practices followed by international
agencies on the environmental and social issues. Of course, the ground realities under which
SMEs in India have to operate are also taken into consideration. The whole effort is towards
educating the SMEs in this direction which would also make material difference in their ability to
enter and compete in the world market.
E&S Management Plan, describes the detailed procedures to be followed for respective
category of the project. These procedures are divided into four stages and integrated to
institutions project cycle, which are;
-   Project Screening: at this phase E&S risk categorisation of the project is carried out.
Credit Officer (CO) is required to check the category of project
-   Project Appraisal: CO should during appraisal of any project and preparation of the
Loan appraisal report follow the flow chart. CO is also advised to refer sectoral
guidebook created under the project while appraising loan proposals, to understand
environmental issues and legal obligations associated arising from the same.
-   Loan Sanction and Disbursement: Credit committees to ensure, implementation of
pre- disbursement condition prior to finalisation of loan agreement
-   Project Monitoring: E&S monitoring report are to be filled up during site visits
during monitoring stage.

﻿Environmental and Social Risk classification
The target sectors of MSMEs financed by any institution are diverse in nature having
correspondingly varied environment and social risks associated with them. The environmental
and social risk based classification is developed to facilitate early categorisation of the projects (at
the screening stage), into pre-defined E&S risk levels. The objective of this classification is to
identify those projects, which have significant environment, and social issues associated with
them and might pose credit risk to the financing institution, if financed without necessary risk
mitigating factors/safeguards.
The risk classification is carried out at the screening stage by the credit officers and forms the
basis for determining E&S risk management measures required to be followed in subsequent
stages of the project life cycle. Also, the classification helps the decision makers at all levels to
identify appropriate loan conditions and monitoring requirements. Identification of the risk
classification at an early stage of the project life cycle reduces the processing time for loan
applications from Non- polluting industries.
Also framework recognises that social issues are a priority and need to be addressed equally for
all sectors. So social issues related to child labour, forced labour, common resources for
workforce etc. need to be considered while appraising all direct financing projects. The credit
officer (CO) has to ensure that the borrower has developed programs for safe working practices
for the workers.
Three environmental risk categories have been developed for classification of projects, namely,
E-I- Industries with high pollution potential.
E-II- Industries associated with significant pollution, but to a lesser extent than E-I industries.
E-III - Industries that do not contaminate environment or have an acceptable levels of discharge.
BER-Annexure II
Procurement Arrangements for World Bank financed project components
1. Background
Funds are sourced by the MSMEs for working capital and for capital investments in equipment
and machinery for expansion, modernization or technology upgrading. Based on the earlier Bank
project, the values of such loans is expected to average around US$100,000 approx. (based on an
average reported loan size of Rs. 50 lakh). Based on data from a sample of large loans under the
previous project, contract sizes varied between US$150,000- US$330,000. Under the Additional
Financing, both loan and contract sizes are expected to grow.
2. Types of Procurement under the project:
Procurement under the project will be as per the World Bank Procurement Guidelines May 2004
and revised October 2006.
Component 1: Credit Facility (CF) component
Under the CF component, the Bank loan will provide funds to SIDBI, to be re-lent to MSMEs for
the partial financing of subprojects. As per section 3.12 of Bank Procurement guidelines, the
procurement will be undertaken by the respective beneficiaries in accordance with established
commercial practices which have been reviewed by the World Bank. Such commercial practices
of the beneficiary shall be compatible with the Procurement Principles enumerated below, in
order to be deemed acceptable by the World Bank. Procurement under this component will
45


﻿comprise of capital investments in equipment and machinery for expansion or technology
upgrading. No works or services are envisaged to be procured.
Under this component, Bank funds can also be used by SIDBI for refinancing other participating
financial institutions (PFIs). In such case, SIDBI's agreement with the PFI will contain provisions
of procurement as mentioned in World Bank procurement guidelines section 3.16 (due attention
to economy and efficiency and in accordance with procedures which meet requirements of Para
1.5).
3. Procurement Principles applicable:
(a)    In order to be acceptable under World Bank-financed operations, commercial
practices in procurement should require that all procurement actions be based on
economy and efficiency, i.e., value for money, with due consideration towards the
promotion of sustainable and competitive markets.
(b)    Transparency to the maximum extent possible and consistent with achieving sound
procurement results should be a key component of the applied procedures.
(c)    Procurement procedures should be effective and provide for a wide range of
modalities, including competitive bidding, pre-qualification for critical processes,
single-sourcing, unsolicited offers from suppliers, etc.
(d)    Competitive bidding should be based on bidding documents that explicitly identify
all bidding requirements, bid evaluation criteria and contract award criteria.
(e)    The contract documents should define the rights and obligations of the contracting
parties, as well as the remedies available to them in case of disputes and non-
performance.
(f)    Bidding documents should require potential contractors, suppliers or service
providers to disclose sanctions or temporary suspensions imposed on them by the
Bank.
4. Procurement of Goods (Commercial Practices):
Goods procured under this project will include procurement of plant machinery and equipment.
MSMEs follow strategic procurement for goods with consideration to value for money. As per
the current practices, this can either be done by inviting competitive quotations or selecting a
strategic supplier, generally on a sole source basis.
5. Competitive Quotations
In case the MSME obtains competitive quotations, quotations are obtained by the promoters from
various suppliers to establish the value for money on the principles of economy. These are
examined by the SIDBI credit officer and the most cost effective option is selected after
negotiations. In such case, all bids shall not be rejected and new bids invited on the same bidding
and contract documents solely for the purpose of obtaining lower prices. If the lowest evaluated
responsive bid exceeds the Borrower's pre-bid cost estimates by a substantial margin, the
Borrower shall investigate causes for the excessive cost and consider requesting new bids.
Alternatively, the Borrower may negotiate with the lowest evaluated bidder to try to obtain a
satisfactory contract through a reduction in the scope and/or a reallocation of risk and
responsibility which can be reflected in a reduction of the contract price. However, substantial
reduction in the scope or modification to the contract documents may require rebidding.
6. Sole Source
There may be certain circumstances where competitive quotations are either not available or the
promoters may not obtain competitive quotations. Such circumstances where direct contracting
46


﻿(sole source selection) is followed are illustrated below. These are discussed by SIDBI with the
promoters and agreed at the time of sub loan appraisal:
1.  The MSME is using the equipment from a supplier since long and is satisfied with the
performance of its equipment and services or the MSME knows (and SIDBI concurs) from
the long track record and experience of other MSMEs in the same cluster/industry that the
best supplier in terms of price, quality and servicing is a particular reputed supplier. Repeat
order for same equipment.
2.  Requirement of a customized or propriety equipment/machinery for a specific need/
fabricated machinery or highly technical equipment for which there is only one supplier.
3.  Equipment/machinery has been procured under joint venture/franchise/collaboration with a
domestic/overseas company, where the collaborating companies agree to buy the end
product only if MSME installs the specified equipment/machinery as per collaborating
partner's preference.
In above cases, SIDBI seeks sole source justification from the MSMEs, does its supplier due
diligence and uses its market intelligence to ascertain that the price is in line with market norms.
Equipment can be procured under buy back/exchange of old equipment by the supplier wherein
existing old equipment is bartered/exchanged for new equipment, on a sole-source basis only in
the three situations mentioned above
In cases where direct contracting (single- sourcing) is used (irrespective of value of contract),
section 3.6 of the World Bank Procurement guidelines apply. This states thus-
"Direct contracting is contracting without competition (single source) and may be an
appropriate method under the following circumstances:
(a)    An existing contract for goods or works, awarded in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the World Bank, may be extended for additional goods or works of a
similar nature. The World Bank shall be satisfied in such cases that no advantage could
be obtained by further competition and that the prices on the extended contract are
reasonable. Provisions for such an extension, if considered likely in advance, shall be
included in the original contract.
(b)    Standardization of equipment or spare parts, to be compatible with existing equipment,
may justify additional purchases from the original Supplier. For such purchases to be
justified, the original equipment shall be suitable, the number of new items shall
generally be less than the existing number, the price shall be reasonable, and the
advantages of another make or source of equipment shall have been considered and
rejected on grounds acceptable to the World Bank.
(c)    The required equipment is proprietary and obtainable only from one source.
(d)    The Contractor responsible for a process design requires the purchase of critical items
from a particular Supplier as a condition of a performance guarantee.
(e)   In exceptional cases, such as in response to natural disasters."
7. SIDBI's supervision arrangement
SIDBI's oversight arrangements include: post-disbursement checks on the assets purchased,
which reviews if there was any kind of misappropriation/diversion of funds by the end-user from
its intended use. While disbursing to suppliers, SIDBI also examines the sales agreement,
warranties, rights and obligations of contracting parties as well as remedies in case of disputes
47


﻿and non performance as defined in clause 5.3 of SIDBI's credit manual. SIDBI officials
periodically visit MSMEs before and during the implementation of the project and subsequently,
on its operations are undertaken which include visit to the office/ factory of the assisted unit,
physical verification of equipment, discussion with promoters, informal discussions with the main
purchasers of and suppliers to the assisted units. This is further detailed in chapter-6 of SIDBI's
credit manual.
8. Procurement under the Bank financed project
Procurement will be done as per commercial practices described above subject to their being
compatible with the Procurement Principles enumerated in point 3. However, for contracts
estimated greater than US$ 1,000,000, procurement will be done using ICB method (as described
World Bank Procurement Guidelines and using World Bank ICB documents).
In cases where direct contracting (sole-sourcing) is used (irrespective of value of contract),
section 3.6 of the World Bank Procurement guidelines will apply, and will apply only for reasons
specified under 5 above. These transactions will be reviewed by SIDBI at the time of sanction of
the loan.
Retroactive financing under the project will be as per the provisions of Bank procurement
guidelines.
SIDBI will ensure that the procurement transactions comply to the above requirements. As part of
their appraisal processes , SIDBI would require MSMEs to include a procurement plan
information which provides (i) the list of proposed procurement and estimated value (ii) the
proposed procurement methods (competitive or sole source) and (iii) the agreed thresholds for
contracts subject to prior versus post review. The final procurement plan for each as agreed with
SIDBI should be maintained in SIDBI records for review by the World Bank or auditors. As part
of SIDBI oversight arrangements, they will obtain all data related to awarded contracts under
loans extended including the actual contract dates, names of contractors, contract amounts,
progress and disbursements to date and confirm that the procurement is as per the agreed
arrangements as defined in the OPM-R.

﻿Annex 9: Case Studies: Good Practice Examples
Jaipur, Rajasthan: In Jaipur, SIDBI's financial support to a NBFC has allowed the
latter to reach out to the poor rural women and has provided loans to them to purchase
commercial light motor vehicles (auto rickshaws, cargo carriers) which in turn are the
sole source of income for them. Through pro-active support and facilitation provided by
the NBFC, most of such clients have gone for second time loan to expand their enterprise
thus not only stabilizing their income source but now are set to become micro-
entrepreneurs. The NBFC as part of its own corporate social responsibility supports the
activities of two non-government organizations (NGOs), namely, the Pratham Siksha
Charitable Trust and the Akshaya Patra.
Alleppey, Kerala: In Alleppey, the coir spinning/weaving cooperatives have invested in
the women SHGs who are producing coir by-products for the consumption of larger end
product manufacturing units - ensuring much large and sustained turnover and profit for
the SHGs and its members. This particular best practice has benefitted from the support
and facilitative interventions by the BDS development agency.
Training by International BDS: Kolkata is known for industrial gloves. A formal
network (M/s United Creations Pvt. Ltd.) of six industrial gloves manufacturers decided
to make a move from industrial to fashion gloves. This was a new product meant for
exports and there was a need for an international expert who understands the product as
well as the market. The Project partially supported hiring the services of German trainer.
He trained 27 workers. Later another 20 persons have been trained by some of the
trainees. The typical leather required was being sourced overseas and is now being
sourced from two local producers. After over six months of trial and error (with the
support of the expert), two tanneries have reached the quality levels needed and the raw
material is now being sourced from them. The initial German buyer of the product was
also linked by the BDS provider. Later the network found a buyer each in Holland and
Spain. They are presently completing the last part of orders worth ' 30 lakh and are sure
to cross sales of over ' 1 crore this year and ' 1.5 to ' 2 crore by the year 2011-12.
Skill Development through a Local Intermediary Institution: In Kanpur Cluster, Uttar
Pradesh Leather Industries Association (UPLIA) already had trust with the firms;
thereafter a professional course through a reputed institution and with the involvement of
the industry was worked out. The course ensured that placement takes place post training.
UPLIA provided training venue, raw material and machinery. Experts from Indian
Institute of Leather Products (IILP) Chennai prepared the one-month training module for
stitching operators. It was oriented to provide specialized modules for stitching, skiving,
and fitting and folding modules with inputs from UPLIA. The cost per trainee is around '
17,500. Industry funded around 24% and the Project funded around 11% and rest was
given by Ministry of Rural Development. 2,500 persons have been trained and employed
leading to an estimated income rise by ' 10,000 to ' 15,000 annually. Interestingly,
starting with UPLIA training centre, the Project has increased to 3, with more centers
being started without project support.
51


﻿BDSPs led Model of Skill Development: A model of training for skill development of
unemployed youth, which helped fetch higher wages and increase their efficiency was
tried out in the Mohali/Panchkula Chandigarh Cluster. This involved BDSPs, Sams
Technical School and industry partnership, Ludhiana and other clusters also facilitated
the involvement of BDSPs for skill development. Thus skill development is one of the
best ways of cluster Development which focuses on 'bottom up' approaches and directly
benefited the poor. Enterprise and skill development initiatives among various clusters
across the country have, in a way, paved remarkable avenues for cluster development and
help in solving the problem of talent acquisition for MSME units. It has also helped in
increasing the productivity and improving the quality of the products developed by
MSME units.
An example of unintended outcomes of the SMEP: Monarch Innovative Technologies
Pvt. Ltd (Monarch) is a 27 year old company selling, inter alia, equipment called
'Twister' and 'Twister Pro' (upgraded version of twister). These equipment are used
mainly by videographers ( pan India basis) for live coverage, online and offline editing,
mixing, adding 3D effects etc., to the shooting done by them. The cost of equipment is
between INR 0.3 million to 0.5 million. Most of these were falling in micro entrepreneur
category and hence were not able to raise that kind of money on their own. Nor were they
able to access bank finance (not being income tax payers/having no collaterals). Monarch
itself was financing them and collecting payments. As it was not a niche area of Monarch,
it was looking for programmatic support from an institution.
On the lines of learning under an initiative taken up under MSMEFDP (implemented by
SIDBI wherein an NBFC was extended Capacity building support to finance investments
of its vendors) SIDBI structured an arrangement with Monarch to finance these
videographers backed by Monarch's corporate guarantee. It commenced with a limit of
INR 50 million to Monarch which took on itself the guarantee and preliminary due
diligence aspect of these beneficiaries. Monarch's recommendations were filtered
through a credit screen developed by SIDBI and eligible borrowers were financed. The
key features of intervention were:
(i) SIDBI could structure an innovative product leveraging on the strength of relationship
between vendor and vendee. (ii) The customers of Monarch could access credit and that
also at low cost. Prior to this they were being charged an interest rate of 18% to 21% p.a.,
whereas SIDBI's funding came at 12% to 13.25% p.a. (iii) The initiative helped Monarch
to focus on its core activity thus enhancing its market outreach further. (iv) Within a
span of 15 months around 180 videographers were extended credit access aggregating
INR 48.8 million. (v) Sample inspections and feedback from ultimate beneficiaries
revealed that there was high degree of satisfaction among videographers.
When the support was extended to Electronika Finance Ltd. under MSMEFDP led by
World Bank, it was not thought that the initiative would inspire creation of a new
structured product for the smallest of the small borrowers falling under Missing Middle
segment and looking for credit of INR 0.2 million to INR 0.3 million. This also enabled
SIDBI to widen its bouquet of offerings, deepen its outreach as also hone up its strength
52


﻿in extending customized product for MSEs especially through new delivery channel
partners. This can be enlisted as an unexpected outcome of the MSMEFDP led by Bank.
Success story of Au Financiers: Mr. Sanjay Agarwal, Chartered Accountant &
1st generation entrepreneur established Au Finance (India) Limited as a small office
endeavor in year 1996, AUFIL has slowly but steadily climbed up and today it has
developed niche in enterprise financing towards financial inclusion in rural and semi
urban masses. Today its network spreads across 9 states in Rajasthan, Maharashtra,
Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Chhattisgarh, Delhi & Haryana with 229
branches and partnering with all top 40 public and private sector banks coupled with 2
mutual funds, 1 insurance company, 2 FIls & 5 financial institution and international
institutions such as IFC, SIDBI, Warburg Pincus, Motilal Oswal Private Equity Advisors,
HDFC Bank. Moreover, the world renowned magazine Forbes has honoured the Au
Financiers and its Promoter, Mr. Sanjay Agarwal as one of the "Hidden Gems" in
India. The profile was published in September 6, 2013 issue of Forbes India under the
content "14 Hidden Gems".
Recently, in Mar- 2013, the new pioneer investor "Chrys Capital" has bought the equity

﻿their valued clients, the firms are often confronted with critical liquidity crunch and face
the result of losing out on sure business. In such emergent situations, financing is
required within 15-20 days. However, the stipulated time required for a bank to provide
loan typically varies from 2 to 3 months involving lengthy procedures and arrangement
of collateral.
To address this gap, need for a scheme that would make loan available within 15-20
days' was realized by FSIA. FSIA shared its concern with several banks and associations
of banks at various public forums, but was struggling with solution. However, SIDBI
came forward to address this problem through a unique model of making the association
significantly responsible in this loaning process. SIDBI structured a MOU arrangement
wherein while SIDBI made available the loan, FSIA took the responsibility of identifying
responsible borrowers from among its members, doing a part of the initial due
diligence/processing and also agreeing to do necessary follow-up for repayment. SIDBI
also invested through capacity building grant support by building internal expertise of
FSIA to handle such role as also outsource financial BDS for doing necessary
handholding of enterprises.
SIDBI introduced a special scheme of Collateral-free Equipment Finance up to Rs. 5
million exclusively for FSIA members at an interest rate of PLR less 0.5 per cent. The
loan product is handled by an FSIA promoted Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - 'Integral
Association of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises of India' (1-am-SME-of-India) as a
Section 25 Company in January 2009.
The organization has created a Credit Counseling Cell (CCC), wherein the members are
explained as to why the proposal has been rejected and counseling on corrective
measures is also provided. To monitor the expenses under grant, a Project Advisory
Committee has been constituted, wherein 3 members are from SIDBI and 3 are from
FSIA.
Today besides other banks entering into MOU with FSIA for such financial linkages,
FSIA itself is geared up to extend its model and expertise to other BMOs. SIDBI has
facilitated replication in Ahemdabad and few of its adopted clusters like Panipat and
Coimbatore have also evinced interest in replication
