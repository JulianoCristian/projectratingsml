The\n            closing date of the project will be extended from June 30,\n            2012 to June 30, 2013.The main reason for seeking an\n            extension of the closing date is to allow for time to\n            implement the risk sharing facility of the project, which\n            had been delayed on primarily on account of lack of\n            budgeting, a factor outside of Small Industries Development\n            Bank of India's (SIDBI's) control. Extension would\n            allow the Bank team to continue to oversee and provide\n            technical inputs on what is a particularly innovative\n            component of the project, the Risk Sharing Facility (RSF).\n            Extension will also allow SIDBI to channel the originally\n            unallocated amount of US$ 9 million through further\n            refinancing under the Credit Facility (CF), hence expanding\n            the project's demonstration effect. In addition, a side\n            benefit is that an extended project time period would allow\n            for supporting greater dissemination of the project's\n            Environment and Social Safeguards Framework (ESMF) to the\n            banking system, a process that has been gained momentum\n            recently, with strong initial results."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
