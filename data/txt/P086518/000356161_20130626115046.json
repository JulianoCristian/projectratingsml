The\n            main reason for seeking this reallocation is that further\n            Government budgeting will not materialize before the\n            project's extended closing date-a prerequisite for\n            further utilization of the Risk Sharing Facility (RSF). The\n            reallocation to the Credit Facility (CF) will expand the\n            coverage of SMEs under the project. A reallocation of\n            project proceeds from the RSF to the CF, in the amount of\n            8.57 million US dollar. This will allow the full project\n            proceeds to be utilized. The achievement of Project\n            Development Objectives (PDOs) pursuant to the proposed\n            change in allocation of project proceeds will not be affected."}, "docdt": "2013-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
