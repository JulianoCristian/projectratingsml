7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of this project is to improve SME access to finance (particularly longer term financing) and
business development services, thereby fostering SME growth, competitiveness and employment creation,
which are key to achieving GoI's overall objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. The
project is designed to achieve its objective through a multi-pronged approach that will that will address key
bottlenecks to SME financing and development in India, by focusing on: (a) creating a more enabling
policy, regulatory and institutional framework for SME financing by banks (the primary target group for
this project); (b) helping banks gain better access to longer term financing for lending to the SME sector,
thereby facilitating capital formation and technology up-grading; (c) mitigating banks' risks related to SME
lending and reducing transactions costs of such lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks
enhance the quality of their SME loan portfolios; and (d) strengthening business development services and
market linkage programs for SMEs (the secondary target group), thereby helping SMEs to improve
profitability and competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.
