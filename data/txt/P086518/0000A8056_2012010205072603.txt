                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this project is to improve SME access to finance (particularly longer term financing) and business development services, thereby fostering SME
                         growth, competitiveness and employment creation, which are key to achieving GoI's overall objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. The project
                         is designed to achieve its objective through a multi-pronged approach that will that will address key bottlenecks to SME financing and development in India, by
                         focusing on: (a) creating a more enabling policy, regulatory and institutional framework for SME financing by banks (the primary target group for this project);
                         (b) helping banks gain better access to longer term financing for lending to the SME sector, thereby facilitating capital formation and technology up-grading; (c)
                         mitigating banks' risks related to SME lending and reducing transactions costs of such lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks enhance the quality
                         of their SME loan portfolios; and (d) strengthening business development services and market linkage programs for SMEs (the secondary target group), thereby
                         helping SMEs to improve profitability and competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the initial project by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) had been excellent and the objectives of expanding access to long term finance to
                         SMEs and improving the quality of lending to SMEs were achieved under the original parent project.

                         Overall progress on the Additional Financing Project implementation outcome indicators remains satisfactory. Disbursement is also on track and adherence to project implementation
                         arrangements, notably the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework for lending to SMEs, has been good. On the Credit Facility, refinancing is the focus going forward
                         building on the refinancing activities that have been undertaken in recent months. SIDBI will explore provision of technical assistance, as needed, to the institutions accessing
                         refinancing. While progress on the Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) has been slow, clearance has now been received to (re)launch the RSF. Work is now underway to finalize the design
                         and promote the product to potential participating financial institutions. The progress on this will be closely tracked including during the upcoming implementation support mission
                         slated to take place in January 2012. At that time, the team will pay particular attention to the next steps leading to the closing of the project, and share these with the counterparts.
                         On the Technical Assistance (TA) donor funded component, which has closed recently, significant achievements have been accomplished, iincluding improving market infrastructure
                         (e.g. supporting the credit bureau to expand its SME database and establish an interface between its consumer and commercial databases, supporting the establishment of the first
                         SME focused rating agency, etc) and supporting cluster development (across 18 clusters where business development services for market linkages, technology enhancement, better
                         environmental practices and support to industry associations have been supported).

                         Overall, particularly following recent developments on the refinancing, approval of the RSF and completion of the activities under the TA component, the project design to leverage
                         and link market infrastructure development, cluster development, capacity building, and TA activities (including improving responsible lending practices) with funding (direct financing
                         and refinancing) activities, has started to come fully together, in a few clusters. This means that that the project can provide a framework not just for SME financing but also for further
                         market infrastructure and cluster development activities that could be replicated and scaled up if additional funding were available.
