sector in the development of the country. The\n            project would finance the estimated foreign exchange\n            component of subloans and equity investments for the\n            acquisition of fixed assets and permanent working capital by\n            productive private and public sector enterprises in the\n            manufacturing, service and tourism sectors. COFINA would be\n            permitted to related to the Government up to US$1 million to\n            support a small-scale industry lending program after the\n            Bank has reviewed and satisfied itself on the scope of the\n            program and the nature of the on-lending arrangements. In\n            addition, the project would provide financing for a training\n            program for COFINA's staff."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
