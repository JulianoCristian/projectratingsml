                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To mitigate the impact of the continued socio-economic crisis on a subset of the poorest and most vulnerable households. An additional objective would be to
                         strengthen the institutional capacity of MOSA to manage cash transfer programs. The primary objective would be achieved by implementing a pilot incentive-
                         based cash transfer mechanism with improved targeting modalities that would contribute to improving the living conditions of the beneficiaries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation remains satisfactory. The Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA) considers this to be a transition year (through June 30, 2011) and has committed to complete
                         most of the key reform elements of its cash transfer program by June 2011. The Bank commends MOSA for having taken key steps to make these reforms a reality on the ground.
                         However, there is one key pending challenge which is the inclusion into the program of all poor households. The Bank and other donors stand ready to support MOSA as it takes
                         difficult steps to remove non poor households from the program during this transition year.

                         The tripartite partnership with the MOSA, the EU, and the Bank continues to enables this program to take big strides to move the reform process forward.
