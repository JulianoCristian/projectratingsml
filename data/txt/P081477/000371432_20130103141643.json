   were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. There were ten\n            lessons learned: 1) Conditional cash transfers are not the\n            best approach in all cases. 2) It is important to take\n            advantage of existing projects' experience when\n            designing the implementation arrangements of new projects.\n            3) Social safety net (SSN) instruments, such as cash\n            transfer schemes, need to be in place and tested before a\n            crisis so that they will be ready for quick scale up during\n            a crisis. 4) Non-politicized, means-tested targeting\n            modalities are useful in reassuring donors that the\n            necessary safeguards are in place to ensure that the poorest\n            and most vulnerable households receive assistance. 5)\n            Structural reform of the SSN may be necessary and important.\n            6) The Bank can be effective in providing emergency\n            assistance when the appropriate structures are in place,\n            even in an environment of weak governance. 7) Additional\n            effort and resources may be required to ensure that\n            individuals in the lowest income tiers receive priority\n            assistance. 8) Governments should carefully consider the\n            costs associated with maintaining cash assistance programs\n            in the long-term, as donor assistance may not be provided\n            for extended periods of time. 9) Close supervision and\n            flexibility in responding to changing situations are\n            important to ensure that the Project is successfully\n            implemented. 10) Ensuring in-house development of the MIS\n            and expertise related to its management and operation is\n            useful in promoting flexibility and adaptability when facing\n            any modifications in the program design and/or targeting mechanism."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
