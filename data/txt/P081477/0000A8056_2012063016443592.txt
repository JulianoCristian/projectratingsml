                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To mitigate the impact of the continued socio-economic crisis on a subset of the poorest and most vulnerable households. An additional objective would be to
                         strengthen the institutional capacity of MOSA to manage cash transfer programs. The primary objective would be achieved by implementing a pilot incentive-based cash
                         transfer mechanism with improved targeting modalities that would contribute to improving the living conditions of the beneficiaries.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the ongoing SSNRP continues to be satisfactory and it has played an important role in providing support to the poor households in West Bank and Gaza and
                         reforming the Palestinian Authority's (PA) cash assistance strategy and system in WBG through capacity-building within the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA). The project closing
                         date June 30, 2012 and the implementation completion report (ICR) process began during the recent mission which took place from May 21 to May 31, 2012.

                         The SSNRP is considered the flagship project in enhancing reforms of the social safety net which includes the Cash Transfer Program. Largely considered one of the most advanced
                         cash assistance programs in the region, it has been built on a high-degree of collaboration among the Bank, EU and the PA as well as other interested partners. In 2009, the two
                         largest cash transfer programs, the SSNRP and the EU Special Hardship Case (SHC) program merged to become one unified Cash Transfer Program providing its first unified
                         payment in June 2010 to approximately 64,000 households. The Program has one targeting system which relies on a unified poverty-targeting database with households from West

                         Bank and Gaza which has web-based on-line access. This targeting mechanism is effective in identifying the poorest of the poor and has a highly transparent application and
                         selection process. It currently provides timely quarterly cash payments using one payment modality (i.e., the banking system) to around 95,000 households in WBG.

                         These achievements have been critical in harmonizing efforts among partners working in this sector and has provided a platform in which the PA can continue to leverage donor
                         resources. These efforts are consistent with the objectives and approaches outlined in the social protection strategy put forth by MoSA in the context of the SSNRP and CTP which
                         emphasizes the importance of a cohesive social protection system that can provide adequate and effective assistance to households in need. The SSNRP has provided the PA with
                         the opportunity to demonstrate its capacity in leading the difficult reform process and in effectively managing a large-scale and state-of-the-art cash assistance program. Together,
                         these achievements have highlighted the PA's commitment to assisting the Palestinian population and have improved its overall credibility amongst donors.

                         To build on the achievements made in the context of the SSNRP, the Bank's Board of Director's approved The Cash Transfer Project (CTP) in the amount of US$10 million which
                         became effective on May 23, 2011. Specifically, the CTP aims to (1) mitigate the impact of the continued socio-economic crisis on a subset of the extremely poor and most
                         vulnerable households; and to 2) support the PA's efforts to continue reforms of the CTP, its largest program for providing cash assistance. The project finances quarterly cash
                         benefits to extremely poor households in accordance with the proxy means test (PMT) formula. It also funds technical assistance (TA) to support the MoSA in its efforts to adhere to
                         its reform agenda Project beneficiaries are those poor households living below the extreme poverty line as defined by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)/Palestinian
                         Household Expenditure and Consumption Survey (PECS) for 2007 and which are eligible for benefits from the CTP as determined using the Proxy Means Test (PMT) formula.

                         A Targeting Assessment of the Cash Transfer Program was launched recently in order to: evaluate the targeting efficiency of the PMT Formula which is used to identify households
                         eligible for the CTP; assess the functionality of the CTP; and to gain insight into potential modifications to the PECS. The household study is being implemented by two local firms
                         and is currently underway. Data has been collected from selected households and reports based on initial findings have been provided to the Bank. The study and findings will be
                         completed as planned this FY and will be useful in improving the CTP targeting mechanism. There has also been a high level of interest and collaboration between interested
                         partners/donors (e.g., European Union (EU), WFP (World Food Programme), UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Near East Refugees)).

                         MoSA has increased the number of households receiving cash assistance from the Cash Transfer Program to almost 95,000 and continues to pay households on a quarterly basis.
                         The Bank provides cash transfers to around 5,000 of these households. Cash transfers to Program beneficiaries are funded by the Bank, EU and PA. Significant progress has been
                         made in recent months in Gaza in terms of recertifying households, identifying beneficiary households and providing these data to MoSA in order to have a consolidated database of
                         all poor households throughout WBG.
