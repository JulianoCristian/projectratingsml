public administration. It will reinforce\n            progress made under the First Economic and Financial\n            Management Project (GEF) and will help to: 1) rebuild the\n            administration around a civil service of modest size with a\n            clear focus on core public sector functions and in which\n            transparent and criteria-based recruitment, career planning,\n            training and career management will be targeted; 2) restore\n            the government's capacity to provide essential public\n            goods and services, improve its public finance management;\n            3) improve the quality and efficiency of public\n            expenditures; and 4) implement the government's\n            divestiture program. The components of the project are the\n            following: 1) consultancy services; 2) studies; 3) technical\n            assistance (including local expertise); 4) equipment,\n            vehicles, and supplies; 5) training; and 6) office rehabilitation."}, "docdt": "1996-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
