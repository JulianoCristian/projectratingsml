building and technical assistance are essential to\n            the implementation of a reform program in a country such as\n            Chad, which has been devastated by years of civil strife. In\n            turn, the reform program, by putting emphasis on revenue\n            mobilization and improved budgetary procedures, was\n            essential to the rebuilding of public administration. The\n            project was specifically designed to help Chad implement its\n            reform program, supported by three adjustment credits. The\n            reform program was implemented successfully, and Chad has\n            been able to make critical progress in the management of its\n            public resources. This would not have been possible without\n            assistance provided under the project. Capacity building is\n            a long-term endeavor, which requires sustained government\n            commitment. The project developed local capacity, but much\n            remains to be done, particularly as Chad is gearing up to\n            vastly increased resources from petroleum exploitation in\n            coming years. During the review process, Bank management\n            insisted that operating expenditures to be financed under\n            the credit be kept at a minimum, so as to ensure\n            sustainability. The allocation in the credit agreement was\n            small and experience has showed that it was far from\n            adequate in view of Chad's constrained fiscal\n            situation. During project implementation, the allocation was\n            increased, which was critical for moving the reform program ahead."}, "docdt": "2001-01-09T00:00:00Z"}
