Dear Sirs: 
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement, dated May 7, 1990, as amended,

Project.
I would like to inform 'you that the Association agrees to amend the Project 
Agreement to increase the subloan limits and period of repayment of marketing 
subloans, as follows:

"Amount: Each subloan for Agricultural Investment shall not exceed: (a) 
the amount of US$250,000 equivalent; and (b) 90% of the cost of the 
Agricultural Investment for Beneficiaries holding a farm of less than 500 ha; 
and 80% of the cost of the Agricultural Investment for Beneficiaries holding a 
farm of 500 ha or more; provided, however, that: (i) each subloan for storage 
shall cover the storage cost of up to 5,000 ton capacity and shall not exceed 
70% of the amount of the Agricultural Investment for storage; and (ii) in the
