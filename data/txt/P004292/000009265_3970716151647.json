It would also\n            provide consultancy services for: (i) studies to strengthen\n            forestry research and development; (ii) transportation\n            studies to establish economic limits to siting of\n            plantations with respect to market outlets; (iii) marketing\n            studies to assess the likely supply and demand for the\n            forest products being contemplated; (iv) studies of timber\n            utilization and required processing facilities; and (v) an\n            analysis of alternative fiscal incentives to encourage\n            private sector participation in reforestation. Fellowships,\n            totalling about 12 man-months for forestry staff would be\n            provided to expose them to overseas operations of special\n            relevance to the project."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
