                         The main objective of the proposed EnvTAL is to support the Government on advancing the pace of reforms on the sustainability agenda program defined in the
                         Policy Letter presented by the government on July 7, 2004, focusing on the targets set forth for the second EnvPRL operation. The Letter is referred to in the
                         First Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental Sustainability project document (Bank Report no. 28650-BR).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made significant progress towards achieving its development objective. The studies and events already concluded are of high quality and have been used as inputs

                         for policy development and decision making processes. They also served as technical input to several prior actions recognized in the Sustainable Environmental Management
                         Development Policy Loan. In summary, the project has financed 32 technical studies, 23 contracts for provision of services (printing, catering, etc), 70 workshops, seminars and
                         other capacity building events, 6 publications including book, manuals and technical reports. The project has also developed a comprehensive Monitoring System that can be used
                         for other projects.

                         A project closing seminar was held on March 24 attended by several project's focal points and representatives of the ministries involved. During the event, the main achievements
                         and challenges faced during the project implementation were discussed. The conclusion reached is that the project has significantly contributed to mainstreaming the environment
                         concerns in the Brazilian government agenda, but its implementation has not been efficient and only 60% of the resources planned to be invested in 3 years was actually disbursed in
                         5 years. Several bottlenecks and institutional constraints have been identified and will be better detailed in the final report.
