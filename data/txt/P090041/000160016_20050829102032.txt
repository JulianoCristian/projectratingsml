A. STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

        Brazil has one third o f all the tropical rain forest o f the world, the largest reservoir o f
fresh water (11 percent), the second longest coastal line with over 8,500 km, and the savanna
with the highest biodiversity in the world, among other important national environmental
aspects. These natural assets are especially important for the poor for whom they constitute a
significant share o f their wealth. The Amazon's regional and global influence i s legendary.
Clouds formed in the Amazon are responsible for the precipitation on the central part o f the
continent, all the way to SBo Paulo. Moreover, just the annual burning in the region currently
contributes with about two percent o f the world annual C 0 2 emissions. It i s for these local,
national, regional and global considerations that an environmentally sustainable Brazil i s o f great
concern.

        Brazil has historically based its economy on exploiting the immense wealth of its natural
resources. A significant part of its economy still relies on the use o f natural resources, whether
they are used as production inputs or as sinks for production waste. The forest sector alone i s
responsible for four percent o f the GDP. Despite the importance o f its natural resource base,
Brazil faces major challenges to reverse a trend o funsustainable use o f its natural resources.

        As detailed inthe CAS (Report no27043-BRYlast discussed on December 9, 2003) and
other recent Bank documents, Brazil's government i s effectively addressing the double challenge
o fmacroeconomic vulnerability and fiscal constraints as well as social deficits. Additionally, the
Government o f Brazil (GOB) i s making a strong effort to balance economic growth with socio
development and the maintenance and improvement o f environmental quality. As a result, the
Bank has recently approved the First Programmatic Reform Loan For Environmental
Sustainability (EnvPRL, Loan 7256-BR) to support the GOB's environmental sustainability
program and to mainstream environmental objectives more firmly in its broader development
agenda.

        The program involves key policy reforms in seven different ministries, which formally
subscribe the Policy Letter included inthe EnvPRL (Bank report no28650-BR). The strategy for
the first operation o f the EnvPRL was to focus on the GOB's short-term policies and programs
that can lay the foundation for supporting the achievement o f its long-term objectives for
environmentally sustainable economic development and poverty reduction. It i s divided into two
main components: (a) the first focuses on issues under the more direct influence and control o f
the Ministry o f Environment - institutional strengthening, better coordination o f the National
Environment Management System (SISNAMA), and flexible instruments and social control; and
(b) the second focuses on issues the resolution o f which depends on a high degree o f
involvement and collaboration across different economic sectors, i.e., on mainstreaming.

2. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

        The principal objective o f the EnvPRL is to support Brazil's goal ofbalancingeconomic
growthwith socio development and the maintenance and improvement o f environmental quality.
Inlinewith the CAS, the program is goingto contribute to the pillar o f amore sustainable Brazil,



                                                  1

to reduce poverty and achieve a higher quality o f life for all Brazilians inboth rural and urban
areas. A healthy natural and physical environment provides basic services in both urban and
rural areas in a sustainable and efficient way (MDG 7).           It will build on the country's
comparative advantage in natural resources while also conserving them. A sustainable Brazil
will also be a source of competitiveness and provide wealth for the future generation.

         The choice for a programmatic policy-based operation follows the CAS, which indicates
that development policy lending aims to galvanize and support policy reforms. The First
Programmatic Reform Loan For Environmental Sustainability (EnvPRL) is the first operation on
a series o fup to three loans.

         Duringthe preparation o f the EnvPRL it was identified that (a) technical assistance loan
would be instrumental in reducing some o f the implementation risks identified for the
programmatic loan series, and (b) the need to support the GOB with the development o f
participatory monitoring and evaluation instruments that would allow the Government to assess
the pace and progress o f the reforming agenda agreed in the EnvPRL.             During the Board
discussion o f the EnvPRL, Executive Directors showed strong interest inthe pace o f preparation
o f the technical assistance loan, which was considered, by the Board, as an integral component o f
the programmatic loan series. Thus support o f the Bank, in the form o f technical assistance, is
required to successfully implement the proposed reforms including the triggers for the
subsequent loans o f the EnvPRL.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

         The proposed Environmental Sustainability Agenda Technical Assistance Project
(EnvTAL) along with the EnvPRL are going to support a more effective and responsive
environmental management system, which will improve the business environment inthe country
and signal to society as a whole GOB'Sserious commitment to the long- term environmental
sustainability o f its development path.    They will also contribute to the establishment o f a
framework for dialogue and improved collaboration on environmental sustainability among key
sectors inthe Government as well as with the private sector and civil society.

         Most o f all, the proposed Technical Assistance Loan will, in conjunction with the
EnvPRL, contribute to the objectives o f a sub-set o f the govemment's environmental
sustainability agenda. This will directly support the management the natural assets for better
quality o f life and poverty reduction, by improving the environmental institutional framework
and supporting key cross-sectorial policies that promote the good o f natural resources, from
water to forests, including tourism and small-scale agriculture.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

         The Borrower chose a Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) inU S Dollars, with a commitment-based
amortization consistingof level repayments o f principal, five years o f grace period and seventeen
years o f total loan term. The Borrower also opted for the possibility o f currency and interest rate
conversions and establishment o f interest rate caps and collars, automatic conversion o f the Loan


                                                 2

variable interest rate into a fixed interest rate, and the capitalization o f the front-end fee under the
Loan. The selection reflects the Borrower's preference for contracting loans which permit the
matching o f its asset and liabilitymanagement objectives.

2. Project development objective and key indicators

        The main objective o f the proposed EnvTAL i s to support the Government on advancing
the pace o f reforms on the sustainability agenda program defined in the Policy Letter presented
by the government on July 7,2004 (Bank Report no28650-BR), focusing on the targets set forth
for the second EnvPRL operation'. This will be achieved through the provision o f technical
assistance and financial resources for:
    0   development o f priority studies, methodologies and procedures, that would have a direct
        impact on the implementation o f the agreed reform agenda;
    0   facilitating the development o f institutional models              and capacity to improve
        environmental mainstream and collaboration o f key sectorial ministries that have an
        impact on the sustainability agenda;
     0  improving the social communication mechanisms to ensure adequate transparency and
        public participation; and
     0  improving monitoring and evaluation capacity o f all beneficiary ministries, that will
        allow the GOB to assess the pace o f progress and the impact o f the implementationo f the
        reform agenda agreed between the GOB andthe Bank.

        The proposed EnvTAL will also support the establishment o f (i)high-level committee,
                                                                                 a
comprised o f all seven vice-ministers direct beneficiaries o f the loan and the vice-minister o f
Planning, Budgeting and Management, as well as, a representative o f the organized civil society,
to oversee the implementation o f the EnvPRL and the EnvTAL; (ii)         a Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) system andtechnical committee for the supervisiono fthe EnvPRL and the EnvTAL; and
to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency o f the reform policies; (iii)      a communication strategy
for the EnvPRL and the EnvTAL and its implementation, to give the necessary public access to
all information allowing public accountability.

        While the total amount o f this project, US$ 8.60 million, may be considered relatively
small to achieve these objectives, the EnvTAL should be seen as part o f much larger technical
assistance envelop o f the Bank towards environmental sustainability policy reforms. The Bank
has several projects, in preparation or on-going, that support Technical Assistance to the GOB'S
environmental sustainability agenda for a total o f US$104.47 million (see table at item 4). The
EnvTALserves as catalyst to ensure the synergy among these different projects as well as to fill
inexistinggaps for a comprehensive Technical assistanceenvelop more compatible with the size
o f scope o f the challenges regarding environmental sustainability inBrazil.

        The TAL for Environmental Sustainability, a US$ 8.6 million for up to three-year period,
has a set o f targets that fully match the policy reforms agreed between the GOB and the Bank for
the second EnvPRL operation. These targets o f the TAL are expressed interms o f the technical
input necessary for high quality and feasible policy reforms. The actual implementation o f the
reforms are within the scope o f the second EnvPRL operation.

        The project will support the implementationo f activities to achieve the stated objectives.
The activities are being selected in coordination with Bank staff responsible for projects that
include support for technical assistance or capacity buildingto those areas also covered by this
loan. This ensures full complementarity between the Bank portfolio and allows for the most
efficient and effective use o f the resources o fthis loan towards its objectives.

        Project budget will be allocated to the five major components, summarized below,
allowing for the necessary flexibility to achieve the objectives o f the EnvTAL. The funds will be
used to provide technical support to the government inthe preparation and implementation o f the
second EnvPRL operation. The project will support studies, technical assistance and capacity
building, workshops, strategically selected to provide a solid technical and institutional basis
and input for the proposed policy reforms incoordination with other Bank-supportedefforts. The
activities agreed upon and identified initially are presented in Annex 4, which represents about
60% o f the project's total value. The amount o f resources allocated for each component derived
from the amount needed for the implementation o f the initial activities identified and projection
o fthe further work needed.

        To enable the GOB to carry out the technical work and provide the capacity building
necessary to achieve the agreed targets for the initiation o f the second phase o f the EnvPRL, the
project will focus on key areas and objectives, such as:

           Mainstreaming of environmental sustainability involving seven ministries: Studies,
            technical assistance and public consultation processes for issues such as: (a) detailing
            o f ZEE within the area o f influence o f BR-163 federal highway; @) subsidize the
           preparation o f the final version o f PAS (Sustainable Development Program for the
            Amazon);     (c) improving the PRODES (Water Basins Restoration Program)
            certification process; (d) developing a methodology to prepare Municipal Master
            Plans considering environmental criteria; (e) 5`50 Francisco river basin revitalization
           program;       @,I   identifylng financial and fiscal instruments for promoting
            environmental sustainability;     (g)     development and validation o f an SEA
           methodology for the hydropower sector; (h) defining simplified procedures for the
            environmental licensing of agrarian settlements; and (i) designing a Monitoring and
            Evaluation (M&E) system for the National Tourism Plan, with emphasis on the
            environmental sustainability. The ministries involved are: Environment, Finance,
            Cities, Tourism, Agrarian Development, National Integration and Miningand Energy.


       The EnvPRL and the EnvTALhave raised strategic and important issues which has lead
to other international organizations to look forward to join the IBRD in supporting the GOB'S
sustainability agenda. KfW has expressed its interest in co-financing the second operation of the
EnvPRL. GTZ intends to provide technical assistance o f up to  500,000 for the EnvTAL. In
close coordination with Bank's team during preparation, it was defined that GTZ possible
support would be directed to: (i)capacity building of MMA and IBAMA; and (ii)              capacity
building o f the PCU team, including the design and implementation of the Monitoring and
Evaluation Plan and the Communication Plan.


                          Component




*GTZ intends to provide support in a total amount of up to  500,000 (aprox. US$ 600,000) the actual
components would be defined later indiscussions with the GOB.

       The project design allows for having additional objectives in support to new policy
reforms that emerge during the project's implementation, whether derived from the
government's policy letter or through new joint actions developed with other ministries. The
main condition i s that these eventual new activities would directly contribute to achieving a new
important policy reform conducive to the Environmental Sustainability Agenda and be included
inthe following EnvPRL operations. Each proposed new objective, including the ensuing TA,
will be considered case by case, as needed, during the project's implementation and upon the


                                                 5

Approval o f the Management Committee composed by the Executive Secretaries (Vice-
Ministers) of all seven ministries involvedinthe EnvPRL and inthe EnvTAL, among others.

        The allocation of the remaining amount, which represents around 35% o f the total loan
amount, will be defined annually during implementation by the Management Committee, either
for new activities to support reaching existent objectives or agreed new ones, and with input
from the project monitoring and evaluation system.

4. Lessons learned and reflectedinthe project design

        High-level buv-in: Experience indicates that in the case o f technical assistance loans in
support to programmatic reform loans,         such TALs can be implemented without reflecting
directly in an advancement o f the reforms. This happens because the results o f the studies
supported by the TAL may not reach the decision-makers intime and therefore are not included
in the new policies. This project is designed to ensure the buy-in o f high-level government
decision-makers. The proposed management structure includes, as its highest body, a
Management Committee composed by the Executive Secretaries (Vice-Ministers) o f all seven
ministries involved inthe EnvPRL and inthe EnvTAL, as well as the Executive Secretary o f the
Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management and a representative o f the civil society. The
Management Committee (i)          serves as the forum for the political analysis and negotiations
necessary to advance the policy reforms agreed on the EnvPRL, (ii)       monitors the implementation
of the EnvPRL and EnvTAL (iii) the series o f specific actions that will be supported by
                                      defines
the   EnvTAL in supports o f the targets o f ensuing EnvPRL operations. This Management
Committee will also contribute to the coordination among the different projects o f the overall
Bank technical assistance envelop in support o f the environmental sustainability agenda, as such
envelop includes projects with the Ministries o f Cites, Tourism and Mining & Energy, besides
the Ministry o f Environment. All these ministries are represented inthe Management Committee.

        In addition, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) is under direct supervision o f the
Executive Secretary o f the Ministry o f Environment. These features o f the project should ensure
that the results o f technical assistance be translated into the policies under the responsibility o f
the different ministries.

        Flexibilitv of design: Considering the range and scope o f the programmatic reform
loans, it is extremely difficult to define at outset all studies, capacity building and other technical
assistance necessary to advance the reform o f the agreed policies. Thus, TALs associated to
programmatic reform loans should have a flexible design which would enable to address the
client's needs as the project evolves. In order to ensure flexibility without losing focus, the
project establishes the overall envelop o f resources to be made available and clearly defines the
end results that should be achieved in direct relation with the EnvPRL targets while defining
criteria for the selection o f activities. These arrangements will ensure flexibility on the timing
and definition o f the specific actions, while keeping the focus on the expected results, which
would directly contribute to the policy reform agenda. Therefore, the current activities detailed in
Annex 4, represent about 60% o f the total budget, allowing for the final allocation within and
between components as the result of the implementation o f the first set o f activities.




                                                   6

         Participatory process: Over the past 20 years, Brazil has seen the establishment o f a
 number o f different types of            Civil Society Organizations. These CSOs have improved
 tremendously and have become more organized and professional. Thus, the government has
 increasingly listened and interacted with such organizations. Environmental sustainability policy
 reforms to become effective must balance the views o f the different stakeholders. The project
 design enables the participation o f the CSOs by providing a seat in the high-level Management
 Committee and in the Technical Committee, as well as, participation in the Monitoring and
 Evaluation o f this loan and its associated EnvPRL. Additionally, the loan supports the increase
 o f public access to environmental information and the improvement o f information systems
 which allow public accountability o f the environmental processes.

         Simple financial management arrangements: The project will support about 3 to 6
 activities for each one o f the six ministries, which will be involved in mainstreaming o f the
 environmental policy, and about 20 to 30 activities to be executed by the Minister o f
 Environment. The project design centralizes all financial and procurement management at the
 MMA. The project's financial and procurement management will rely on an existing Project
 Support Group (GAP) within the MMA, which has proven capacity and positive track record
 with the implementation o f Bank financed project. The GAP will report directly to the Project
 Coordinator o f the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) at the Executive Secretariat o f the MMA.

         In order to ensure a multi-sectorial approach o f the proposed actions, each one of the
 ministries involved would appoint a "Focal Point" for this project, which will interact closely
 with the Project Coordinator. Each Focal Point would be responsible for providing the TORSo f
 hisher respective area to the PCU, participate in the selection process and in review and
 approval o f the product. This arrangement ensures the direct involvement o f all ministers
 regarding technical issues while the MMA centralizes just the financial management and
 procurement aspects of the project.

         Complementaritv with on-going proiects: In order to maximize the impact o f this
 project and ensure the synergy among the different Banks-supported projects, this project was
 designed taking into consideration the support that other on-going projects are giving to the
 GOB'S environmental sustainability agenda, e.g. NEP 11, PROAGUA, and Energy Sector TAL
 (see Table below). Both the GOB'S and the Bank's teams involved in the implementation o f
 those projects were consulted with and/or were part o f the EnvTAL's preparation team to ensure
 the complementarity o fthe proposed EnvTAL's activities with those projects and that the agreed
 reforms for the environmental sustainability would be accomplished.

 5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

          Involving a smaller number of ministries. Experience shows that involving various
 ministries under a single project tends to make project implementationmore difficult. However,
 considering that the EnvPRL includes key activities to be performed by seven ministries, a
 selection o f a small subset o f ministries to be supported by this project would certainly affect the
 overall progress o f the policies targeted inthe EnvPRL.

          Decentralized management. One way to decrease the risk o f low project
 implementation in multisectorial projects i s to decentralize its management, isolating the
 problem. However, two characteristics o f this project advise against such approach. First, very
 often the nature o f the activities requires collaborationbetween, at least, two ministries. Hence, a
 decentralized management may work against the integration between the ministries. Second, the
 project will have a relatively small number o f activities to be lead by each ministry. A
 decentralized management would increase the transaction costs by requiring a mobilization of a
 group to carry out technical, financial and procurement issues in every ministry. Additionally,
 Bank's supervision work would increase since all ministries would have their own supervision
 process, including financial and procurement aspects.

           Preparing an Adaptable Proiect Loan (APL). The first loan of the EnvPRL sets up the
 foundation for the implementation o f more ambitious reforms that could be supported by two
 possible future loans. The follow-up operations would provide an incentive for the GOB to stay
 on the path o f environmental policy reform. Approval o f the second loan would depend on the
 progress achieved during the respective preceding loan in accordance with a pre-defined small
 set o f triggers. The program i s flexible so that, depending on the evaluation o f previous stages o f
 the EnvPRL, it can respond to emerging needs and problems, including possible work with other
 sectors such as oil or agriculture. Likewise, this EnvTAL matches this design with a loan to
 mainly support the achievement o f the targets set for a second EnvPRL. As the targets for the
 third EnvPRL could be adjusted during that project preparation and considering that the GOB
 may have different technical assistance needs by then, it would have been very difficult to define
 a clear enough envelop o f activities to be supported by the proposed loan to assist the entire
 program. Furthermore, it would have been more difficult to obtain the current commitment o f the


                                                           8

GOB to consider the current finds for this loan above and beyond its annual budget allocation
for the Ministry o f Environment as it would show up as a relatively large amount.

        Proiect period. It was initially proposed a 18 month-period for the EnvTAL aligned
with the similar timefiame proposed for the second EnvPRL operation. However, two major
issues were brought up during preparation: (i) project should become effective during the
                                                 the
second semester of the GOB'S FY; and (ii)the upcoming election period during 2006-2007
which can affect the project's implementation due to legal administrative constraints to sign and
pay contracts. Thus, the Project Team was advised to extend the project's time-period to three
years, which would permit the GOB not only to implement the initial activities in a more
efficient manner, but also would allow to take best advantage o f the flexibility designed in the
projector support other TA needs identified during this period.

Executive Secretariat o f the Management Committee.

        A Technical Committee will also be created, composed of: (i)representative appointed
                                                                        a

when requested by the Management Committee or the Coordinator of the PCU; and (v) to
analyze and approve the outputs and results o f the work developed with the corresponding Terms
o f Reference (TORS).

        SECEWMMA will be the project's Implementing Agency, with the technical support o f
the participating bodies or co-implementers. The project will be implemented through a PCU,
under the Executive Secretariat o f the Ministry of Environment, and established through an
Administrative Order issued by the Ministry o f Environment. The PCU will be responsible for
the coordination and administrative aspects o f the project's implementation (planning,
procurement and financial management, supervision, project monitoring and evaluation and
communication and reporting).

        The PCU will be composed of five technical experts o f MMA with experience inprojects
financed by the World Bank. Two o f these experts are staff o f the Project Support Group (GAP)
and will be allocated there. They are going to be responsible, respectively, for the Project's
financial and procurement aspects and will respond directly to the PCU Coordinator.                The
rationale for using MMA permanent staff for the PCU are: (i)        to avoid increasing the Ministry's
existing structure; (ii) build capacity within MMA to coordinate and execute externally funded
                        to
projects; (iii)and to facilitate mainstreaming the activities and results of the project within
MMA.

        Whenever required by the Coordinator o f the PCU, specialists may be sought to address
specific thematic issues, to provide inputs for the Technical Committee's decisions, and to
develop work related to the areas o f specialization o f the Committee's members. The specialists
may be appointed by the representative focal points inthe Technical Committee.

        An initial list o f activities to be financed with the loan's resources was agreed upon with
each beneficiary ministry and will be further detailed in the first procurement plan. Additional
activities will be defined during the project's implementation, depending on the project's
monitoring and evaluation vis-&vis the achievement o f the targets agreed upon for the second
phase o f the EnvPRL, and the relevance o f the activities proposed for the achievement o f
environmental sustainability in Brazil. The project's implementation, financial management and
procurement arrangements are presented in detail in Annexes 6, 7 and 8 o f this report,
respectively.

        The procurement of goods and selections/contracts o f consultancy services will be carried
out by UNDP, with some procurement/selection processes conducted by two members of the
PCU allocated at the Project Support Group (GAP) o f SECEWMMA directly responding to the
PCU Coordinator. The criteria for defining which processes that each body will execute will be
established betweenthe Borrower and UNDP upon review by the Bank.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomes/results

        This technical assistance project, and the associated programmatic reform loan
(EnvPRL), will contribute to Brazil's goal o f balancing economic growth with social
development and the maintenance and improvement o f environmental quality, i.e. ensuring the
environmental sustainability through policy reforms. It was agreed with the government that the
results of the EnvPRL will also be monitored and evaluated through this technical assistance
loan. This will enable compliance with the new OP/BP 8.60. Annex 1presents the list o f targets
agreed inthe EnvPRL and the key intermediate results o f the EnvTAL that directly contribute to
each one o f them, along with a list o f the initial activities identified.

        The result indicators for each one o f the intermediate results (Annex 3) will be the
number o f satisfactory completed key activities (e.g. training, studies, seminars, pilot tested) in
support to the beneficiary's preparation or implementation of the plans and actions, with related
products forwarded to the respective decision-making authorities. The outcome indicator will be
the constitution o f a critical mass o f key approved plans and institutional capacity to implement
them.

        The Management Committee, upon a report prepared by the PCU, will evaluate the
performance o f the EnvPRL and the EnvTAL each year during the life o f the project. Based on
the registered progress and identified challenges, the Management Committee will decide on the
activities, and respective budgets, to be implemented in the following year, always considering
also the targets set forth inthe EnvPRL operations.

        Parallel to this, the GOB will design a separate mechanism, to be developed during the
first year o f project's implementation, that will ensure a participatory M&E process o f the
content; the quality o f results produced for each activity; and the efficiency and effectiveness o f
the reform policies o f the EnvPRL. As consequence, the proposed policy reforms to be submitted
to the decision-makers will have a general buy-inby the different affected GOB'Sagencies and
stakeholders. The annual report o f this M&E, which will be prepared by the PCU, will be
submitted to the Management Committee which will also consider it while deciding the activities
and budgets, to be implemented inthe following year.

         These two systems would not only ensure that the proposed technical assistance loan i s
being properly implemented, but, most importantly, that it i s directly contributing to the
advancement o f the policy reforms agreed by the GOB and the Bank in the EnvPRL and to the
achievement of the results desired from those reforms.

4. Sustainability

         Sustainability o f the project benefits i s assured as the GOB has shown strong
commitment to the reforms agreed in EnvPRL as evidenced by the Letter o f Policy signed by all
seven ministers involved inthose reforms. This implies that the GOB has the political will to use
this project outputs to promote the environmental sustainability policy reforms. Furthermore, the
activities supported by this project will allow the triggering of negotiations for a follow-up
programmatic loan envisioned inthe EnvPRL.

        Uneven implementation of the project by different ministries. As recognized in the
EnvPRL, the involvement o f several sector ministries i s an opportunity and a necessary condition
for the successful implementation o f a reform agenda that focuses on mainstreaming the
Environmental Sustainability Agenda. At the same time, this represents one o f the potential risks
for implementation. To mitigate this risk the project would establish a high-level committee,
Management Committee, composed o f all Executive Secretaries, enabling them to work more
closely and creating some "peer pressure" amongst them. Furthermore, the proposed
participatory M&E process and the implementation o f the communication plan will ensure
transparency andpublic accountability.

        Complex proiect management system due to the involvement of several ministries.
Inorder to mitigate this risk, it is proposed a simple project management unit, based inside the
MMA reporting directly to the Executive Secretary, that would carry out all administrative and
procurement tasks. The adoption o f an existing unit (GAP) with successful track record and a
PCU composed o f experienced MMA staff should mitigate this risk and facilitate the
implementation o f the project.

        L o w level of implementation due to low disbursement of the matching funds. It i s
proposed, accordantly with the country financial parameters, that the GOB not be required to
provide a direct counterpart funds to this project specially considering that: (a) the GOB has had
a positive fiscal performance; (b) the Ministryo f Finance has allocated additional budget (on top
of MMA's proposed annual budget) for the implementation o f the TAL; (c) most o f the EnvPRL
objectives that will be supported by the TAL will require significant GOB's efforts to achieve
the agreed reforms; and (d) the GOB will have a high contribution through staff and logistic
support o f seven different ministries for the development o f the EnvTAL.

        L o w level of implementation during election period (2006-2007). At the end o f 2006,
the presidential, state's govemment and federal and state's deputies elections may result in low
project implementation, because o f procurement and financial disbursement constraints due to
Election rules. The rules estate that, inmany cases, no new contract or new disbursement should
be executed during election period, unless it's been signed before this period. The project's
time-period was extended to allow the PCU to plan the activities to avoid constraints during
election. Additionally, the project has been designed to involve most o f GOB's staff, which
would probably not change after election period.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic andfinancial analyses

         Quantitative economic and financial analyses are not appropriate for technical assistance
loans. However, this project supports the Brazil's environmental sustainability agenda, which
will promote the sustainable use o f its vast natural resources and a decrease o f the enormous cost
o f environmental degradation, thus benefiting the country's economy. The fiscal impact o f this
loan i s evaluated as minimal due to its small size, US$8.0 million2. Furthermore, this project will
enable an increased fiscal stability at the federal level as it will enable the negotiation o f a second
loan o f the EnvPRL.

2. Technical

         Several Bank specialists have worked with corresponding GOB'S specialists on each
specific project component or sub-component to ensure the quality o f the proposed activities
under this project. Bank specialists are responsible for ensuring the adequacy o f the proposed
Terms o f Reference or technical specifications and o f supervising the implementation o f the
activities (see Annex 6).

         The Bank specialists involved inthe project preparation also made sure that the proposed
activities are complementary to those already on-going or plannedunder the different projects o f
the Bank's technical assistance envelop in support o f the environmental sustainability agenda.
This should ensure that the EnvTAL will serve as a catalyst to promote the synergy among the
different projects as well as fill eventual existing gaps.

3. Fiduciary

         The risk assessments carried out during project preparation have rated the risk that
fiduciary responsibility would not be satisfactorily assumed as moderate with respect to financial
management and high with respect to procurement (see Annexes 7 and 8). An action plan to
strengthen the PCU capacity and mitigate the identified risks has been agreed with the project
team and i s expected to be concludedby project effectiveness.




  The total cost of the project i s US$8.6 million which includes about US$ 0.60 million of direct technical
assistance to be possibly provided by GTZ.

4. Social

        It was accessed that this project will not trigger the Bank's Social Safeguard Policies                -
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) and Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). Furthermore, the
participatory M&E system will ensure that proposed new policies and plans have the buy-ino f
the civil society. It's important to consider that during the preparation o f the EnvPRL and
EnvTAL, the civil society was consulted with. Additionally, regarding this proposed project, the
participation o f the civil society in both Management and Technical Committees will enhance
public accountability on the results o f the EnvPRL and EnvTAL.

5. Environment

        For the purposes o f OP 4.01 the project received a Category "C" classification, since it is
intendedto be entirely positive from an environmental standpoint, ifimplemented as planned.

                                     ASSISTANCE PROJECT


1. Projectbackground

        The Federal Government has been working hard on implementing structural reforms by
mainstreaming environmental issues into public development policy planning in an effort to
improve the population's quality o f life, and maintain these conditions inthe long term. This new
model requires actions that help define new policies, while strengthening and empowering
entities responsible for the planning, regulation, management and execution o f public policies.
Environmental issues must also be dealt with at the local level, where their impacts are felt and
original and appropriate solutions are both generated and implemented.

        The partnership between government and society i s therefore a strategic one for
designing and implementing public policies in the face o f such a challenge. Government bodies
must coordinate their actions. They also must have the appropriate instruments, a consolidated
legislation and the political will to "socio-environmentalize Brazilian awareness", in order to
establish more sustainable andjust standards.

        The Ministry o f Environment and its affiliated bodies have taken on the challenge o f
addressing environmental issues inpublic policies effectively and efficiently, especially through:
        0   integrated territorial management fiom the sustainable development perspective,
            taking into account regional diversities, improving planning, management and
            conflict-resolution instruments;
        0   improvement o f internal institutions and/or those affiliated with the National
            Environment System (SISNAMA), the National Water Resources Management
            System (SINGREH) and the National System o f ConservationUnits (SNUC);
        0   increasing and strengthening the concerted efforts between the MMA and other
            Federal Government bodies, the states, municipalities and civil society, through the
            mainstreaming o f environmental issues into discussions on policy implementation,
            international treaties and regional integration processes; and
        0   the participatory promotion, social inclusion and sharing o f benefits, the appreciation,
            conservation and sustainable use o f biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge.

        The sustainability policy i s dependent upon the amount and intensity o f the government's
actions towards mainstreaming. It must ensure that environmental aspects are considered in all
the major areas in order to harmonize the new ecological-economic-social                  sustainable
development model. The Ministryof Environment has prioritized its bilateral agendas with other
ministries. This i s especially the case with initiatives aimed at land use planning, landreform and
forest exploitation with the Ministry of Agrarian Development, as well as standards for access to
credit in the Amazon, which has been linked to environmental responsibility, with the Ministry
for National Integration.




                                                   16

        Moreover, the government has decided to discuss a suitable approach towards
infrastructure development (i)    with the Ministry o f Mines and Energy, regarding the energy
model, addressing aspects ranging from the definition o f areas for petroleum exploitation in
sensitive regions  - such as the Abrolhos Archipelago - to the development o f renewable energy
and the redefinition o f hydroelectric plants in the Amazon; and (ii)with the Ministry o f
Transport, discussions are under way regarding guidelines for the mainstreaming o f
environmental criteria in the definition o f the national transportation matrix and incorporating it
into the sector's expansion plans. The Brazilian Airport Infrastructure Authority (INFRAERO),
inaddition to its general responsibilities, hasbeen supporting the fight against the traffic ofwild
animals. EMBRAPA has established a partnership with IBAMA regarding the licensing for
GMO research, the exploitation o f mahogany, the remittance o f genetic material for research
purposes, and the fight against deforestation.

        Brazil already has a complex and advanced legal framework. The government has been
trying to improve it, as stated in the Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental
Sustainability (Bank Report no28650-BR). That will imply that MMA must be pro-active with
regard to its own structure and organization, as the Government's administrative structure will
act as a strategic nucleus for the implementation o f environmental legislation and public policies,
and ensuring compliance. The MMA i s therefore the locus for strategic decision-making and for
policy planning and design. It must also provide managerial capacity for the drafting and
supervision o f management contracts with executive agencies such as IBAMA and ANA,
federative agreements for decentralized management with State Environmental Bodies
(OEMAs), and contracts with social organizations responsible for non-exclusive state-level
services, to be done inpartnership with the local population.

        Although a reasonable number o f goals and objectives have been achieved regarding
environmental policy, institutional development and the management o fphysical and chemical
environmental conditions, there i s still a longway to go, and technical assistance i s neededto get
there.
Strengthenof the EnvironmentalManagementSystem

        Environmental Management i s based on the Environmental Management System
(SISNAMA). The System has been designed according to Law no. 6938 o f August 31, 1981, and
contains provisions about the National Environmental Policy. The Law establishes concepts,
principles, objectives, application and formulation mechanisms, and instruments and penalties. It
also sets up the National Environmental Council (CONAMA).

        SISNAMA was created to establish a group o f agencies, entities, rules and practices for
the protection and improvement o f environmental quality at the following political-
administrative levels: a) high level bodies, made up o f the Government Council, whose
membership consists o f the President's Office (Casu Civil) and all the ministers - its function is
to advise the President on the design o f the National Policy and national guidelines for the
environment and natural resources; b) affiliated agencies: National Environment Council -
CONAMA; National Council on the Legal Amazon CONAMAZ; National Council on Water
                                                       -
Resources - CNRH; Deliberative Council o f the National Environment Fund; and the Genetic
Assets Management Council, with the participation o f several different segments o f civil society,
helping to direct and/or guide environmental policy management instruments; c) the central


                                                 17

body, the MMA; d) affiliated semi-govemmental bodies, such as executing and research bodies:
ANA; IBAMA; and the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden Research Institute - JBRJ; e) sectoral
agencies, which correspond to state-level environmental bodies and f) local bodies, which
correspond to the municipal or local bodies.

        The 1988 Constitution established that, with regard to the environment, the State's
capacity to act i s based upon a concept o f shared responsibilitybetween the Union, the states, the
Federal District and the municipalities, and between the latter and the different segments of
society.

        The National Tripartite Commission (MMA, ABEMA, ANAMMA) was established as a
forum for dialogue and institutional support. It has been discussing the roles and responsibilities
of the federal, state and municipal governments inshared environmental management inan effort
to strengthen the structure o f SISNAMA and define its functions, while identifying joint
solutions for the System's consolidation.

        The most relevant aspects o f those issues identified as top priority for Brazilian
environmental management are being addressed within this framework, such as the Regulation
of Art. 23 o f the Federal Constitution, which addresses the responsibilities o f federal agencies in
charge o f environmental management. Consequently, a specific Working Group has been
established with the following responsibilities: (1) follow-up o f efforts aimed at the regulation o f
the aforementioned article's Sole Paragraph; (2) development and implementation o f the National
Environment Information System (SINIMA), for which a Management Committee has already
been established; (3) improvement o f Environmental Licensing Procedures, for which an
Environmental Licensing Portal i s being created, aiming at the integration of information on
environmental licensing at the three levels o f government by collecting, streamlining, organizing
and disseminating such information; and (4) implementation o f the National Capacity Building
Program for Municipal Environment Managers and Advisors, for which a specific Working
Group has been established. It i s important to note that all these issues are also being discussed in
depth by the State Tripartite Expert Commissions.

        A strategy focusing on combining the efforts o f the federal agencies should be instituted
within the scope o f the National Environment System, aiming at the implementation of
appropriate forest policy management. Priority should be given to the division o f tasks and the
integrated action of the different bodies and entities that make up SISNAMA.

        SINIMA helps process how information is dealt with and made accessible to both the
public and to SISNAMA member institutions. The proposal currently being analyzed aims at
integrating this system with other international systems, national sub-systems, cooperative
networks and databases. A set o f indicators must be established inorder to allow for the required
standardization to take place, and to complement the follow-up o f the results o f environmental
policies.

        Different instruments have been created based on such a principle. At the governmental
level, many instruments focus mainly on command and control actions. Others, more modem
ones, anticipate the prevention and ex-ante evaluation o f environmental impacts. An example of
this is environmental licensing, which obligatorily conducts studies and publishes reports about


                                                  18

business operations that are potentially harmful to the environment or institutionalizes the federal
technical registry for impact-generating activities. Certifications and territorial ecological-
economic zoning have been created and are starting to be implemented. Nevertheless, the
instruments inplace mustbe strengthened. Inmany cases, their legal basis needs to be reinforced
or modified to increase their efficiency and efficacy. The Government has already established
tripartite committees in all states, with the aim o f dividingresponsibilities among the three levels
o f government, dependingupon local conditions.

         To strengthen the system and, consequently, environmental management, the following
aspects should be discussed in further depth: a) increase in the social support base o f
environmental policies; b) decentralization o f environmental management; c) availability of
objective and systemic information and d) its mainstreaming within the different areas o f
economic activity.

         Furthermore, the agencies inthe system, especially at the federal level, require a physical
infrastructure and human resources in order to improve their efficiency and efficacy.            The
Ministry o f Environment has started a process o f internal restructuring and hiring o f about 900
employees for the MMA and its affiliated bodies. The challenge i s now to train these new
employees and integrate them into the administration as quickly and efficiently as possible.

        The National Licensing System (SLA) sets guidelines for the standardization o f
procedures; for the improvement o f specific legislations; and for information systems and their
availability. The system was reviewed in 1997, when three aspects were identified as
requirements for the system's greater efficiency and efficacy: (i)     strengthening the state-level
environmental licensing system and the development o f strategies and mechanisms that may
allow for increased de-concentration or de-centralization to municipalities; (ii)  strengthening the
environmental licensingprocess at the federal level, calling for a broad review o f procedures and
rules adopted by IBAMA, as a result o f established aptitudes and specific and priority demands
deriving from the economic development model adopted for the country; and (iii)         streamlining
and modernizing the Environmental Licensing System's procedures at the three levels o f
government, The Project for the Strengthening o f the Federal Environmental Licensing System,
the object o f Loan Agreement 1013 SF/BR (IDB), signed in 1999 and currently being
implemented, was designed to respond to these priorities.

        Nevertheless, within the scope o f federal licensing, IBAMAstill needs to be strengthened
further to enable it to effectively handle its functions regarding environmental licenses as well as
the follow-up and monitoring o f activities that have already been licensed.

         MMA and IBAMA propose to develop permanent and continuous capacity-building
actions, based on strategic planning mechanisms. The current administration has declared it a
priority to overcome the staffs qualitative and quantitative shortcomings in order to ensure
institutional strengthening.

         IBAMA units continue to suffer from a lack o f human resources for fulfilling its
institutional role, even after the completion o f the first public competition held in2002. Most of
the recently hired analysts are experienced and knowledgeable in different private sector fields
and practices, but lack experience in the federal public area. There i s thus a need for promoting


                                                  19

capacity-building actions that may provide them with the required knowledge within the context
o f the current government.

        The MMA understands that the training o f Environmental Analysts i s not fully covered
by this course. The objective is to provide analysts with subsidiesto develop their activities with
the quality and competence required by MMA and its affiliated agencies' institutional proposals.
Thus, the implementation o f courses on Planning and Strategic Management, Environmental
Licensing and Training for new public servants will improve the qualifications o f those already
inoffice.


Improve the Green Agenda (Biodiversity conservation and sustainable use)

         All Brazilian biomes show signs o fbiodiversity loss. The most severe case is that of the

began over 500 years ago - has accelerated duringthe first half o f the 20th century. Meanwhile,
Atlantic Rain Forest, which currently has less then 7% o f its original area. Deforestation - which

the Cerrado (Brazilian savannas) has already lost about 60% o f its original cover. This began
mostly inthe mid-20th century, especially with the expansion o f agribusinesses. The definition
of conservation and sustainable management programs for these important Brazilian biomes is
therefore o f the utmost importance and should take the existing economic activities into account.

         Forests represent 64.3% of the Brazilian territory, or 550 millionhectares, most o f which
are indigenous forests. Inaddition to the role they play interms o fbiodiversity and climate, they
are the basis for timber, paper and cellulose, furniture, firewood and coal production for
domestic consumption, not to mention the non-timber products, such as essential oils, rubber,
nuts,non-elastic paste, fibers and manyothers. The timber sector is responsible for about 4% of
the GDP and general employment. The entire network o f forest products and services must
therefore be strengthened through research, value added, sustainable management, and
ascertaining the final destination o f these resources.

         The Brazilian context requires a forest resources management system that focuses on the
promotion of operations, including the multipleuses o f forests. The importance of implementing
a specific approach towards environmental management and for sustainable productionprograms
on indigenous land, quilombola and traditional communities has been emphasized. The
protection o f the rights o f indigenous people and o f local communities by attributing due value to
Brazilian environmental, socio-economic and cultural diversity, and by observing legality,
transparency and social control, should also be emphasized. Moreover, the supply o f sustainably
extracted raw forest materials should be increased to meet both the national and international
demand and in order to eliminate fiscal evasion and competition among sustainable and illegal
products.

         Brazil still has many public areas without a formal designation - especially in the
Amazon, where public areas represent 45% of the territory. However, the country has no policy
for promoting the sustainable use o f forest resources on this kind of public land, which could
generate employment and income and reduce the pressure from the predatory exploitation o f
such resources.      To that end, the Government o f Brazil has submitted the Public Forest
Management Bill, Bill no. 4776/2005 to the National Congress for urgent action. The
aforementioned bill affects all Brazilian biomes, especially the Amazon, proposing the regulation


                                                  20

o f three forms o f public forest management: (a) the establishment and direct management o f
national forests, according to Law no. 9985 o f July 18'h, 2000; (b) their purpose for local
communities, according to the terms specified under the Bill; and (c) forest concessions, to be
applied to either natural or plantation forests and to National Forest management units.

        About two thirds o f all timber consumed in Brazil comes from planted forests. The
country has established a reforestation fee (TRF) for some time now, which i s paid by companies
that consume several different forest products. Nevertheless, Brazil is currently facing an annual
deficit o f about 200,000 ha o f newly planted areas, just to maintain the present level o f
consumption. The TRF needs to be reviewed, so that its application may effectively contribute
to the sustainable productiono f forest resources.


Improve the Brown Agenda (Management of environmental risks due to hazardous
chemicals)

        Reference data from the Brazilian chemical industry highlight that 17.1 million tons o f
hazardous chemicals were imported in 2002, while 5.7 million tons were exported. In2000, the
chemical sector represented 2.9% o f the national GDP. These data are indicators of the sector's
relevance and-show the volume o f hazardous chemicals in transit in the country, not to mention
the residues generated through their production and use by other industry sectors or by the
chemical industry itself. Hence, the industry ranks first place as the country's largest hazardous
waste generator.

        In addition to the growing risk to the environment from the increase in the production,
processing and circulation o f hazardous chemicals, the urban expansion process increases the
human population's chances o f exposure, thus intensifymg the consequences o f an accident. At
the same time, the aforementioned highlevel o f urbanization and the aggressive industrialization
process have generated several environmental liabilities, such as the contamination and
degradation o furban areas, placing Brazilian cities at risk and reducing environmental quality. In
addition, given that the different agents involved directly or indirectly are not prepared to deal
with potential environmental emergencies caused by such products further increases the risk
posed by the life cycle o f such substances.

        It is therefore essential to implement an efficient national policy that focuses on
prevention, control and quick response to emergency situations involving hazardous chemicals
within the scope o f the SISNAMA. The MMA has been working towards this in an integrated
and thorough manner, seeking the best solutions for preventing accidents and environmental
emergencies involving hazardous chemicals, and providing an immediate response to such
situations, once they occur.

        The National Plan for Prevention, Preparedness and Quick Response to Environmental
Accidents involving Hazardous Products (P2R2) represents an attempt to address the growing
concern regarding the potential risk posed by such contaminants to human health and the
environment.




                                                  21

       Thus, knowing early on about companies and activities involved with hazardous
chemicals, about areas where such accidents could potentially occur, as well as about
contaminated areas, Le., environmental liabilities that already have been generated, are among
the main inputs to the planningo f measures to be implemented within the scope o f P2R2. Such
information i s essential for the preparation of Emergency Action Plans (PAEs), which are
essential for ensuring a Quick Response to accidents involving hazardous chemicals.

       The implementation o f the National Registry o f Contaminant Emissions and Transfers
(PRTR), as well as the improvement o f the Federal Technical Registry (CTF) for activities that
either cause pollution or are major users o f environmental resources, will help provide,
systematize and evaluate information regarding emissions, pollution sources, transfers o f
substances and products that either cause or have potential to cause damage to or place at risk
human health and the environment. The databank o f such systems usually includes information
about releases into the air, water and soil, either routinely or accidentally, as well as data about
residues that are transferred to other sites for treatment or final disposal. Once it i s operational,
the national registry will contribute to the revision and re-orientation o f attitudes in several
social, economic and political sectors. That should provide for the safe management o f
substances and chemicals, the assessment o f quality o f life and natural ecosystems, the
formulation and/or revision o f public policies for the sector, strategic planning and the
establishment o f targets to ensure the socially and environmentally responsible conduct o f
corporations, non-commercial organizations, social organizations and citizens.

       Applying such instruments will allow for the establishment o f an efficient public policy,
consolidating P2R2 as an effective instrument for the environmental management o f hazardous
chemicals and contaminated areas. The plan's guiding philosophy i s in line with the need for
establishing an integrated effort between the different levels of government, the private sector,
civil society representatives and other parties seeking a development model focused on the
sustainability o fhumanactivities.

BlueAgenda (WaterResourcesManagement)

        Even though Brazil has 11% o f all surface water worldwide and maintains a privileged
position interms o f water availability, 70% o f the countries' fresh water i s located inthe Amazon
region, which i s inhabitedby less then 5% o f the national population. Stock levels are becoming
increasingly critical, not only due to the inverse relationship between population concentration
and the regional distribution of water resources, but also due to the degradation of the bodies o f
water as a result o f agricultural, urban and industrial pollution. The condition o f some o f the
most critical regions must be highlighted as well: due to natural hydrological events, the
Northeast's semi-arid region i s exposed to long dry spells, aggravating the local environmental
conditions, with negative consequences for the region's economic and social development.

        Brazil has had a Water Code since the 1930s      -  as per Decree no. 24643, of July loth,
 1934. Nevertheless, due to the increase in demand and institutional changes, such a legal
framework has not helped in the fight against water imbalance, nor has it promoted the
appropriate means for achieving decentralized and participatory management - both of which are
necessary today.



                                                  22

        Law no. 9433 was ratified on January 8th, 1997, aiming at overcoming such a gap. It
instituted the National Water Resources Policy and established the National System for Water
Resources Management. The aforementioned law i s based on the principles o f decentralization
and participation, and incorporated social values into the management o f such a precious asset.
Furthermore, the legislation in force breaks with the command-and-control policy by proposing a
management model based on negotiation and the involvement o f different group players.

        By taking into account the bases and guidelines for action set forth by the law, the
country's Water Resources Management System shall provide for the construction o f a federate
pact that integrates water resources and environmental management and soil use, and promotes
concerted actions. The strengths o f each o f the federation's entities shall be taken into account, as
will the country's diversity and the improvement o f design and decision-making structures,
ensuring participation and effective social control. The purpose i s to assure the sustainable
multiple use o f water in general, as well as a balanced, rational and fair use o f our water
resources. The Government's challenge, to be dealt with through its sectoral bodies, i s currently
the implementation o f an innovative model for Water Resources Management in the country.
The unit for such a model i s each hydrographic basin.

        The basis for the implementation o f the National Policy on Water Resources i s the
consolidation o f management and regulatory instruments. To achieve this, the national capacity
for structuring the foundations for such a policy must be strengthened. Among aforementioned
instruments to be consolidated, there are: (a) the National Water Resources Plan (PNRH), which
shall consolidate the guidelines for the Basin Master Plans and (b) the consolidation o f criteria
and procedures for the integration o f regulatory instruments. It shall include, in particular, the
granting o f rights for the use o f water resources and the collection o f fees for the use o f water
resources at the basin level.

        Inthis regard, the SRH/MMA,with support from ANA, is preparing the National Water
Resources Plan - PNRH, which pays an important role in the process, as it i s a strategic
instrument for implementing the National Policy on Water Resources. The plan i s divided into
eight stages, ranging from awareness-raising and social mobilization to the final approval o f
PNRH by the National Council on Water Resources - CNRH. With regard to the PNRH
preparation process, initial estimates are that the entire process may be concluded by the first
semester o f 2006.      Several studies have already been designed, but additional studies and
mobilization and consultationwith the involved agents and sectors are still necessary.

        The Granting o f Rights for the Use o f Water Resources i s one o f the main regulatory
instruments o f the National Policy on Water Resources. It plays an essential role in the water
resources management process, as it allows for the legal establishment o f a scheme for the
qualitative and quantitative allocation o f water for several different users. It applies discipline
regarding its use and matches water demand with availability, thereby contributing to the
sustainable use o f water resources. The water-charging instrument, which i s also defined in the
WRM Policy, is the next step after correctly addressing the water rights issue.

        The states and the Federal District have their own agencies and legal expertise for the
granting o f rights for the use o f water resources within their domain. At the union level, Law no.



                                                  23

9984/2000, which established the National Water Agency (ANA), has given the agency authority
regarding the grantingo f rights for the use o f water resources under the union's domain.

        One of the challenges being faced inthis regard i s the streamlining o f a great number o f
criteria that the states and the union have been adopting thus far, subjecting river basins to grant
regimes that are often very different or even conflicting. Dealing with water rights issue, will
lead to the preparation o f water charge studies, which will subsidize water basin committees in
starting the water chargingprocess.

MainstreamEnvironmental Sustainability inselected Government Sectors

        The project's      fifth  component     supports    environmental sustainability and      its
mainstreaminginto selected government sectors. It addressesthe following main issues:

Control o f Deforestation inthe Amazon

        The rate o f deforestation in the Amazon has been maintained at around 23.000 lun2per
year. In response, the government has established a Permanent Interministerial Working Group
for the Reductiono f Deforestation Rates inthe Legal Amazon, which i s made up o f 12ministers.
The WG has prepared an Action Plan for the Prevention and Control o f Deforestation in the
Legal Amazon (Plan0 de AqEo para a Prevenq6o e o Controle do Desmatamento nu Amazhnia
Legal -PPCD). One o f the plan's features i s the implementation o f an integrated territorial
environmental management action plan, improving the inspection o f illegal predatory action.
This would include the adoption o f instruments that may redirect the occupation and use o f
natural resources as a basis for promoting sustainable activities throughout the region.

        Brazil has several agencies that are responsible for the inspection o f different economic
activities. INCRA i s incharge o f issuing title deeds; IBAMA i s in charge o f issuing deforestation
permits and other environmental licenses, and the application o f labor laws is the responsibility
o f the Ministry o f Labor. Federal crimes, including those that occur in and with indigenous areas
and populations, are the responsibility o f the Ministryo f Justice. The PPCD i s therefore planning
a joint effort between the many different agencies to improve efficiency in inspection and the
rational use o f federal funds. One o f the first steps to be taken towards the implementation of the
aforementioned joint efforts will be the dissemination o f information among the employees of
the different agencies involved, thus enabling them to truly work ina team.

         With regard to providing guidance for the use of natural resources, the public authority
has several instruments for command and control, and for proposing alternatives and incentives
for productive activities that are compatible with the conservation o f the environment and with
economic and social development. Such instruments shall consolidate plans, programs and
regional projects that coincide with the fight against irregular deforestation, thus increasing the
potential for the sustainable use o f natural resources. These instruments include the preparation
and implementation o f local Agendas 21, o f the ecological-economic zoning, o f municipal
steering plans, o f federal, state and municipal conservation units, and o f regional development
plans.




                                                   24

        Public authority actions for fighting deforestation focus mainly on the area known as the
Deforestation Arch, where those who are increasingly occupying the Legal Amazon are
concentrated. Priority i s being givento the areas indicated as being critical for this process.

        The Federal Government has decided to pave BR-163, which connects Cuiabd to
Santarkm. Work i s scheduled to begin in 2005. This undertaking i s important for regional
development and i s a request that the local society first made long ago. However, its impacts
upon the environment, residents and indigenous people are o f particular concern. This concern
has been the basis for the design o f a Sustainable Development Plan for the Area o f Influence o f
BR-163 by the Federal Government. This will become an important experience for the region's
integratedterritorial management.

Development o f the Amazon with Environmental Sustainability

        There has been tremendous polarization inthe economic development o f the states o f Rio
de Janeiro and SEo Paul0 over the past two hundred years in Brazil. Inthe 1970s, the two states,
with only 3.5% o f the country's territory, were responsible for 55% o f the GDP and 30% o f its
population. This has resulted in an unequal distribution o f both wealth and degradation within
the Federation and even within these two states.

        The level o f regional and social inequalities is certainly a problem that requires prompt
action at several levels, with a view to achieving the sustainable development o f the most
marginalized regions. The Brazilian Legal Amazon i s home to half o f the world's known tropical
plant species, to a greater variety o f fish than that o f the Atlantic Ocean and to the world's
greatest hydrographic basin, with approximately 80,000 km o f navigable rivers. The Amazon
ecosystem i s a major reservoir of the planet's biodiversity, with great, still unexploited potential.
It also contains huge quantities ofminerals, cultivable land and many other resources. Hence, the
situation in the country further emphasizes the importance o f an economy based on a forest
resources management system with a focus on good management practices, including the
multipurpose use o f forests. There i s a need for a special approach, specifically for programs
based on the forest's sustainable use and for strengthening sustainable agricultural practices,
including management and production, on land held by indigenous people, quilombolas and
traditional communities. The consumption o f agroforestry products from managed and cultivated
natural areas must be promoted at bothnational and local levels.

        In response to this situation and based on the information gathered and the pilot-
experiments carried out duringits eight years o f activities inthe Amazon through the Ministry o f
Environment, the Brazilian Government i s preparing a Sustainable Development Plan for the
Amazon (Plano para o Desenvolvimento Sustentdvel da Amaz6nia - PAS). PAS i s another
crosscutting activity that involves four ministries and seven state governments.

        PAS aims at establishing an agreement with Brazilian society for a conceptual framework
for the regional sustainable development o f the Amazon. Based on the study o f both the
historical and social processes o f the region's use and occupation, PAS suggests a revision o f the
traditional approach used for the territory, to include a perspective for social, economic and
ecological sustainability with integrated regional planning. Such an agreement with state and
municipal governments and with the main local players will add a political sustainability



                                                  25

component to the process. Considering the perspective o f implementing integrated public
policies in the Amazon region, it i s essential that these policies take the region's particulars into
account, especially its traditional populations, to promote the sustainable development o f these
communities.

        The Presidential Decree issued on December 27, 2004 established the National
Commission for the Sustainable Development o f Traditional Communities. The Commission's
main purpose is to establish a national policy for the sustainable development o f such
communities. That could be the beginning o f the state's redemption o f its huge historical debt to
these communities.

        In an effort to ensure the quality and practicality of the plan being prepared, the
government is carrying out a series o f consultations and meetings with the region's different
social and economic players, collecting comments and suggestions to be incorporated into the
final version o f PAS.

        During the discussion process, special attention will be paid to traditional communities,
so that the accumulation o f information collected through discussions held inthe Amazon region
may provide elements for the preparation o f PAS and, consequently, for the drafting o f a national
policy for the sustainable development o f traditional communities.

        There are many challenges to be faced when designing such a policy proposal. Among
them, there is the adoption o f measures for the optimization o f administrative processes and the
adaptation o f credit, fiscal and financial instruments, aiming at strengthening environmental
management among traditional communities and their social and economic inclusion.

        Activities related to the Sustainable BR-163 Plan are an example o f how the PAS
framework may contribute to the sustainability o f regional development. Thus, the establishment
o f a pact with local society through public consultations will enable the problems that may
eventually be faced by the proposed model to be tested and anticipated.


Mainstreamina environmental concerns inthe Sanitation Sector

        Basic sanitation i s essential to public health and the environment. InBrazil, these services
are not yet available to the entire population, although they have increased over the past few
decades. According to data for the year 2000, only 47.2% o f all households are connected to a
sewage system. Ifseptic tanks are to be included, the figure increases to 62.2%.

        One o f the main challenges faced by water resources management in Brazil i s to reduce
the levels of water pollution caused mainly by the release o f sewage inwatercourses without any
preliminary treatment. Hence, it becomes essential to treat the sewage in order to minimize the
shortage o f water resources that is already affecting several Brazilian cities. Sewage Treatment
Plants require major investments. Considering the current financial condition o f most states and
municipalities, that expense often renders their construction unfeasible.

        The PRODES - DepollutiodRemoval o f Waste Water Loads on Hydrographic Basins
project is one o f the efforts to implement actions aimed at the reconstruction and management o f


                                                   26

hydrographic basins. PRODES was designed based on an innovative implementation strategy,
which consists o f stimulating the realization and operation o f sewage treatment systems by
offering payment based on results achieved. Also known as the "Treated Sewage Program", the
project does not provide funds for investments, but reimburses the service provider with up to
50% o f the amount invested, provided the goals established for treatment efficiency, assessed
accordingto the reduction inthe amount o f pollution, havebeen achieved.

        The project is being implemented through a partnership with the Caixa EconGmica
Federal - CEF (a Federal Bank). During the three years that it has been implemented, R$ 88
million were investedthrough the ANA budget, which has enabled contracts to be signed with 38
enterprises. That has provided for indirect investments o f about R$ 300 million, serving 3.3
million people.

        There i s a perspective that the concept implemented through PRODES may be
incorporated into Governmental Sanitation Programs, thus reaching the scale required for
changing the current picture. As a "result-oriented'         program, which in this case means
effectively treated sewage, the evaluation and further development o f studies and methodologies
for the improvement o f the certification model presently being used by PRODES becomes a
purely structural matter.

        The 1988 Federal Constitution, in its Urban Policy Chapter (articles 182 and 183),
declared Master Plans mandatory for municipalities with over 20,000 inhabitants.

        From that point on, the municipalities become the federative entity responsible for
promoting urban policies that aim at establishing the order for the full development o f the city's
social functions, and that o f urban areas. The Master Plan was defined by the Constitution as a
mandatory instrument for urban policies for that purpose. It i s an instrument used for the
regulation and control o f the urban development process that is capable o f establishing the best
use o fthe municipal territory.

        The City Statute (Law 10.257/2001) is the law that regulates the articles related to the
Federal Constitution's Urban Policy Chapter. It also establishes the instruments required for the
development o furban policies and their application.

        That law, in its definition  o f the mandatory characteristic o f the Master Plan, increases
the number o f municipalities included in this mandatory arrangement. In addition to those with
populations over 20,000 inhabitants, it includes municipalities integrating Metropolitan areas and
greater urban areas, those that are located in areas of special interest for tourism and those
located within the area o f influence o f enterprises or activities with major environmental impact,
either at the regional or national level.

        The result o f such an expansion means that out o f the 5563 Brazilian municipalities,
about 2500 will have to redevelop or revise their Master Plans over the next few years inorder to
comply with the City Statute. Out o f this group, about 1700 municipalities must meet an October
2006 deadline for complying with the City Statute. If this i s not done, the Mayor o f the
Municipality will be subject to administrative charges.




                                                  27

        The Master Plan is essential for orienting the definition o f sectoral public policies, such
as in the case o f sanitation, housing, access, transportation and the environment. Due to the
municipalities' reduced institutional capacity, the Federal Government has been implementing a
policy o f technical and financial support and capacity building for municipalities in order to
assist in the preparation o f their Participatory Master Plans through the Ministry o f Cities since
2003. This policy seeks to establish onerous and non-onerous funding sources, increasing
possibilities for municipalities that must comply with the mandatory aspects o f Master Plans in
order to obtain funds for their preparation.

        The Ministry o f Cities has already been supporting municipalities financially in the
preparation or revision o f their Master Plans with funds from the Union's General Budget,
through the Urban Management Strengthening Program. A methodology for designing Master
Plans must be prepared that i s appropriate for the many different types o f municipalities (in
terms o f size, location, economic activity, etc.). Such a methodology will then be applied through
a network o f strategic partners and multipliers for disseminating the City Statute and the
Participatory Master Plans, with the aim o fbuilding includent, democratic and sustainable cities.

        The late 1980s witnessed the first initiatives at the National Congress for the definition o f
guidelines for waste management. Since then, over 70 bills have been presented. The Ministryo f
Environment, through the National Environment Council, has promoted the preparation o f a bill
that was discussed with several agencies, with contributions from society and from the
Interministerial Working Group on Environmental Sanitation. This WG, in addition to other
efforts, has been preparing the proposal for the Basic Sanitation Policy Bill.

        Based on contributions provided by CONAMA, and in an effort to remain in tune with
the aforementioned Basic Sanitation Bill, a new text i s being prepared for another round o f
discussions with federal government bodies. The intra-governmental agenda will include
discussions within the scope o f the PPA, the Urban Solid Waste Program, which i s coordinated
by MMA. The co-executors are the Ministries o f Cities, Social Development and Hunger
Combat, Labor and Employment and the Funasa Foundation. The proposal also includes
ministries involved with complementary actions with the Ministries o f Development, Industry
and International Trade, and Science and Technology, which shall support the development o f
scientific and technological research focusing on solutions and the prevention o f waste
generation, based on product life cycle and cleaner production, as well as the quantitative
reduction o f waste generated and its risk factor. Benefits, administrative, fiscal, financial and
economic incentives, customized taxation and the establishment o f criteria for stimulating the
sustainability o f the recycling industry are to be defined together with the finance and planning
ministries.

Integration o f the Environmental Economic Zoning (ZEE) within Regional Development
Planning

        The occupational dynamics o f the Brazilian territory has favored the concentration o f
investments in certain areas, based on market-oriented criteria and historically inherited
competitive advantages. These factors contribute greatly to the maintenance o f severe
inequalities, which have become a characteristic o f the Brazilian territory, indicating a need for




                                                   28

establishing a new model o f national territorial occupation that i s capable o f promoting a
sustainable development process.

        Thus, Brazilian society needs a territorial order policy that may signal to future
generations that territorial occupation priorities and strategies must help ensure the creation o f a
more just, prosperous and sovereign nation. Such a policy must implement different steps, and
must establish itself as an instrument for encouraging commitments and partnerships among a
broad range o fplayers.

        As one o f many instruments used for territorial planning, ZEE has a privileged position
due to its importance and potential. The ZEE raises the discussion about the cohesiveness o f the
national territory and its diversityinother terms:
        0   ZEE i s an essential instrument for achieving efficiency and competitiveness in this
            globalized world, where potential and constraints are connected to social
            contingencies and promise inthe country's organization;
        0   ZEE is the state's instrument for establishing anoverall vision ofthe nation, as well as
            for providing subsidies for autonomous policies for the strategic use o f the territory;
        0   ZEE is an instrumentthat establishes a new institutional arrangement for the planning
            system, and serves as an information system while also evaluating alternatives and
            developing public and private actions to facilitate the territory's restructuring,
            depending on the needs for protection, recuperation, development and conservation;
        0   ZEE is a public policy instrument, whose aim is to reduce social inequality and
            respect pluralism, contributing to an active and participatory citizenship, as it i s based
            on the opening up o f institutional channels towards society for consultation,
            information and co-management, using different approaches, each one with specific
            players and themes.

        It is therefore necessary to establish legal and institutional instruments that may integrate
ZEE into regional, state and municipal planning, allowing for negotiations and development
among different sectors: from the public authorities to civil society, and for providing for the
capacity building o f territorial management agents and for the use o f information systems for
decision making.

        Ecological-economic zoning will include a system o f activities at several different stages
for the Legal Amazon, taking into consideration already existing ongoing projects, as well as the
plans for occupation designed by government institutions, enabling the regional, environmental,
social and economic implications for critical areas to be understood.


Mainstreaming environmental sustainability inFinancial and Fiscal policies

        Lately, emphasis has been placed on command and control policies for the environment.
Nevertheless, the joint construction o f sustainable development may benefit tremendously from
the implementationo f a set o f economic instruments and incentives.

        The Brazilian constitution has recently been altered, moving the environmental
sustainability principle to the chapter on economic order, That principle has facilitated the
establishment o f distinct rules for goods and services, according to its environmental impacts.


                                                  29

Thus, the Ministries o f Finance and Environment have established a Technical Committee (TC)
for analyzing the inclusion of the environmental sustainability criteria in fiscal instruments. At
the same time, the MF and the MMA established a Working Group for improving credit
mechanisms, the "Green Protocol", which deals with conditions for the concession of credit
based on environmental criteria. The theme's complexity and novelty calls for specific studies
that may help assess the TC and WG efforts.


Improvement o f the environmental sustainability ofthe Energy Sector

         The development o f the country's energy infrastructurehas been historically based on the
sector's technical criteria per se, and on the pressure of the demand for energy, sometimes to the
detriment o f the region's integrated and systemic planning. Hydropower plants, which were the
key to the country's growth over the past 50 years, have occupied over 34,000 square kilometers
o f land, most o f which was cultivable. These plants had a direct effect on about 200,000 families,
as they had to be resettled in areas far from their native territory. It i s well known that the
formation o f reservoirs causes environmental impacts, such as the suppression o f environments
that are ecologically important for biodiversity, changes in the water regime, interruption o f
migratory routes for fish and the resettlement of populations that occupy the affected areas.
Many of these impacts may be either mitigated or compensated for, allowing for the enterprises'
environmental sustainability. With regard to hydraulic utilization policies, good practices suggest
that projects must be designed in accordance with each biome, taking into account the territory's
potentials and weaknesses, so as to avoid or mitigate social and environmental impacts.

         Although the Brazilian Hydraulic Potential Inventory Manual, prepared by Eletrobris,
established guidelines for the environmental assessment o f hydraulic uses in several
hydrographic basins, the methodology does not offer instruments that may allow for such an
assessment, such as a Strategic Environmental Assessment or Integrated Environmental
Assessment for hydroelectric uses. Such instruments allow for an integrated approach to the set
of hydroelectric uses located within a hydrographic basin and may be important planning tools
for the Brazilian electric sector, as they could be incorporated into the energy inventory studies
o f the hydrographic basins. Such a new approach i s necessary due to the challenge o f ensuring
the increase inthe electrical energy supply, since the current environmental licensing procedures
are subject to their realization.

         The Energy Research Company (Empresa de Pesquisa Energktica - EPE), a public
company affiliated with the MME, has recently been established by Law 10847/2004 o f March
15th, 2004. EPE integrates the new institutional arrangement designed for the Brazilian electric
sector, and shall carry out technical studies to help provide subsidies for the design and execution
o f the country's energy planning. EPE shall carry out environmental studies for obtaining the
Previous License (Licenqa PrCvia - LP), which must take place before the bidding for energy
uses occurs. EPE will also be incharge o f environmental assessment studies, which shall provide
subsidies for hydroelectric usage planning inhydrographic basins. Considering that a new team
will be established for national energy planning, and the innovative character o f these
methodologies, the capacity building o f this team and the dissemination o f the new concepts and
methodologies associated with the environmental sustainability o f hydroelectric uses i s very
important.



                                                  30

        In addition to its renewable electric power generation program through the use of
hydropower plants, Brazil has been advancing towards increasing the share o f other renewable
energy sources in its energy matrix, considering the sustainable development perspective.
Decentralized renewable energy projects, solar, wind, biomass and small hydropower plants,
may bring energy and social inclusion to populations without previous access to this asset,
despite their high cost. Nevertheless, the specific environmental legislation for these sources
mustbeupdated at the same speed as that of investments and technological capacity building, so
as to guarantee the maintenance o f appropriate benchmarks for the licensing process at all o f its
stages (previous license, installation and operations license), in addition to the environmental
control o f these enterprises once they are working. The development o f specific procedures for
such control shall improve and a new licensing system will be developed for these projects, as
the current one is quite precarious and, insome places, practically non-existent. The insertion of
renewable alternative sources is also an opportunity for making use o f the energetic
complementation o f these sources and the hydroelectricity-basedgeneration system, allowing for
greater efficiency in the energy supply. Furthermore, it represents a reduction in transmission
and distribution losses, through energy conservation, the promotion o f its rational use and greater
supply stability.

        On the other hand, the conservation and rational use o f energy are among the most
efficient instruments for reducing the energy demand ina cost-efficient way, while making major
environmental gains. Even though Brazil has two very comprehensive energy-saving programs,
PROCEL and CONPET, an appropriate methodology for measuring the results achieved has yet
to be consolidated. Energy efficiency projects are still facing several feasibility constraints.
Fiscal incentives and the inclusion o f energy efficiency actions into Clean Development
Mechanisms (CDMs) could potentially engender energy efficiency projects as well as renewable
energyprojects. These possibilities have not been sufficiently explored inBrazilthus far. Hence,
it is clear that there is an urgent need to develop a methodology appropriate for the Brazilian
situation, Such a methodology should measure the gains achieved by energy efficiency projects
that have already been implemented, in addition to identifying bottlenecks, opportunities and
mechanisms for the appropriation o f energy efficiency results through CDM. In addition, the
mapping, identification and drafting o f fiscal instruments and mechanisms to be included in an
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy policy are essential.

        Substantial environmental and energy efficiency benefits may also be achieved through
the repotentiation and recapacitationof hydroelectric plants. Increasing the plant's life span, and
safety inthe control and supply to final consumers, in addition to increased energy generation are
some o f the principal benefits. Nevertheless, Brazil still lacks precise data about how many and
which would be the plantdmachines to be repotentiated, how much investment i s required or
which would be the positive and negative results deriving from repotentiatiodrecapacitation. In
addition, there are several institutional and legal constraints that slow down and even hamper
investments inrepotentiation. These need to be immediately identified and mitigated, so that real
benefits may be realized. Obtaining the missing data i s an essential step for making a national
diagnosis on the possibilities for the repotentiation o f hydroelectric plants and for preparing a
proposal for a legal instrument that may attract investments inthis area.

        Finally, the Brazilian energy sector has a comprehensive legislation and a rather complex
organization. The country's energy system i s basically composed of: the Ministry o f Mines and



                                                 31

Energy, the National Council for Energy Policy (CNPE), the National Petroleum Authority
(ANP) and the National Electric Energy Authority (ANEEL), in addition to public and private
operators o f production, transmission and distribution systems. The Energy Research Company
(EPE) was established in 2004. The company's aim i s to carry out studies and research that will
help provide subsidies for energy sector planning, covering topics such as electrical energy,
petroleum, natural gas and its derivatives, mineral coal, renewable energy sources and energy
efficiency, among others. The system interfaces with the environment sector, as the SISNAMA
bodies are responsible for the licensing and control o f all energy-related installations. The MMA
and MME have therefore recently signed a cooperation agreement, establishing a joint work
agenda inwhich the environmental issues have been mainstreamed into the sector's planning.

        For the aforementioned agreement to become effective and for crosscutting actions
among the different agents involved in the country's energy planningto be developed, there i s a
need for additional capacity building on issues related to environmental sustainability in the
energy sector, for the EPE, MME, MMA expert teams and their affiliated agencies, as well as for
the MME management team. The latter will be in charge o f evaluating and following up on the
execution o f the works carried out by EPE. Professionals involved also need to share information
and technical updating, to complete the country's energy planning process and to cover the
variables related to the different stages o fthe process.



Improvement o f the environmental sustainability o f the Agrarian Reform

        Over the past few decades, programs aimed at improving access to land, housing,
drinking water and electricity were based on "assistentialism" or on compensation for losses.
Land meant for family farming was either insufficient, low quality, located in marginal
production areas, lacking infrastructure or distributed along agricultural frontiers. It often spread
across areas with natural vegetation, destroying biodiversity and the natural environment. In an
attempt to solve social tensions in other regions, farmers were settled inmarginal areas, bringing
with them inappropriate production systems and predatory practices. They ended up copying the
predominant and traditional model, removing indigenous vegetation, usually by burning, and
substituting it for annual crops and livestock. The low sustainability o f these actions was
compoundedby the destruction o f legal reserves and permanent protection areas, such as riparian
forests, with serious impacts upon biodiversity and water availability.

        Brazil has approximately four million rural family farms. About 10% o f them (414
million families) have participated in land reform projects. They are distributed across over
5,000 settlements located inapproximately 2,000 Brazilian municipalities.

        The new National Land Reform Plan took environmental aspects into consideration inits
basic design structure. Out o f the 4,528 land reform settlement projects promoted by INCRA,
very few have environmental licensing, but actions are already being taken to correct this, The
MMA and the MDA (Ministry of Agrarian Development) are both seeking ways to regularize
this situation as soon as possible, intune with the state environment bodies, the OEMAs.

        The land reform settlements vs. the environment issue involves two main aspects:



                                                   32

        0   existing liabilities, i.e., settlements that have already been implemented without due
            environmental licensing and an environmental management plan; and
            settlement projects to be implemented on an environmentally sustainable basis.

        These two problems have caused the National Environment Council, CONAMA, to issue
Resolution 289/2001. This was preceded by long and intense discussions among the interested
bodies. The Resolution has set down rules for existing liabilities, as well as for the
implementation o f new projects.

        The aforementioned norm established a one-year term for its revision, if necessary. That
term was extended one more year, starting in December 2004. At the same time, a Conduct
Adjustment Agreement (TAC) was signed between the Public Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry
o f Environment, the Ministry of Agrarian Development, IBAMA and INCRA, aiming at
regularizing existing liabilities, i.e., those settlement projects that have been implemented
without previous environmentallicensing.

        A working group has been established for meeting TAC requirements and its terms for
compliance. It i s made up o f the participating agencies and social movements, and has been
holding regular meetings since its establishment.

        Inaddition to the WG/TAC meetings, the Ministry of Environment, IBAMA,MDA and
INCRA have been holding a series of gatherings in an attempt to identify challenges and
obstacles to its compliance, and to ensure the effective implementation o f CONAMA Resolution
289/2001.

        The WG reached the conclusion that existing settlements were established without taking
environmental aspects into account. It i s estimated that most o f the settlements are responsible
for having caused major environmental damage, and that a substantial investment will be
required to counteract this, since the settlers cannot possibly assume these costs.

        Thus, the first step towards regularization will be the implementation o f environmental
licensing, to be followed by the implementation o f case-by-case mitigating measures. Ifnot, the
regularization process will be totally ineffective.

        Several problems that hinder the implementation o f TACs have been identified. Hence, it
has become clear that the problem was not restricted to the actual licensing itself, but that the
implementation o f a new concept for exploitation inland reform settlements i s also required.

        This problem needs to be solved without further delay. The WG has therefore set up
strategies and defined stages to be complied with in order to adhere to the terms o f the Conduct
Adjustment Accord, and for contributing to or even starting the implementation o f a new policy.

        Other M D N I N C R A actions have also been taken: (i)Environmental Enforcement
Agents for each Superintendence, who will be in charge o f implementingT A C in their area o f
responsibility, have been nominated; (ii)      a survey o f settlements whose environmental licenses
are pending has been conducted; (iii)        a questionnaire has been prepared by M D N I N C R A and
MMNIBAMA experts, covering the basic information required for a baseline study on the


                                                     33

environmental liability status; (iv) 20 Environmental Workshops held within the scope o f
INCRA Superintendences, with the participation of those involved with land reform settlements
at the state level.

        The harmonization and simplification of environmental licensing procedures for land
reform settlements i s the common goal o f the environmental sector whenever possible, and o f
MDA and INCRA as well. Consequently, the following must be considered: the settlements'
particulars and purposes; the land reform policy, which foresees the integration of environmental
aspects into all land reform plans, programs and projects; and the major environmental damage
that has taken place at land reform settlements, which have been established without taking into
account environmental aspects or the country's relevant legislations currently inforce.

        The MMA is conducting studies through its Secretariat for Environmental Quality in
Human Settlements, with IDB funding, to identify the reasons why environmental licensing is
unfeasible inland reform settlements.

        The studies under way aim at simplifjmg and harmonizing licensing procedures for land
reform settlements throughout the three levels o f government; and recommend (i)consultative
                                                                                     a
phase for state environment bodies, inquiring about their procedures, difficulties, legislation and
adjustments, which i s already under way; (ii)  a phase for consolidating and systematizing data;
and (iii) the organization o f a technical seminar, to be held with participants from OEMAs, the
MMA, MDA, INCRA and IBAMA, to exchange information and discuss the preparation of a
joint proposal for simplifjmg and harmonizing procedures, taking into account each state's
environmental particulars. Item iiiwill be implemented through the EnvTAL and the reaming
items will be supported by the IDBproject.

        The study being conducted complies with art. 15 o f Resolution 289/2001, which allows
for an eventual revision o f that Resolution by CONAMA if necessary. The results will be
presented at the CONAMA Plenary, to discuss the revision o f the aforementioned Resolution.


Improvemento f Environmental Sustainability inthe Tourism Sector

        The increase in income generated by tourism is quite substantial compared to other
Brazilian export products. Over the past few years, it increased 41 in terms o f foreign currency
volume, it i s second only to soybeans.

        InBrazil, the Ministry o f Tourism is responsible for implementing the National Tourism
Policy jointly with the Brazilian Institute for Tourism (EMBRATUR). The purpose o f the
National Tourism Policy is the development o f tourism as a national source o f income. It
complies with the following basic guidelines: the practice o f tourism as a way o f promoting the
recognition and conservation o f the country's natural and cultural heritage and the
acknowledgment that people are the final purpose for the development o f tourism.

        InBrazil, boththe local population and visitors usually enjoy spendingtheir leisuretime
at the beach, at lakes or at spa resorts. Regions that have any o f these usually start a process o f
expansion o f their economic activities, especially those with the third item and with



                                                34

entertainment facilities for urban populations. Rivers, waterfalls and lakes are the most popular
destinations. This reinforces the need to establish local policies for the protection o f water
quality and the site's general characteristics.

        Environmental damages caused by the non-sustainable development o f tourism lead to
pollution, landscape degradation and the destruction o f fauna and flora, among other side effects.
Pollution, which causes a decrease in the availability o f water resources and the overall
degradation o f the environment, spoils leisure and recreation activities, resulting inthe departure
of the tourists who were the reason it all started, thus initiating a vicious circle and the rapid
depreciation o fpublic and private investments.

        Planning tourism activities by taking into account the environment's support capacity and
the value o f the country's natural and cultural resources i s essential for preventing and
minimizing their social and environmental impacts.

        A Term o f Cooperation has recently been signed between the Ministry o f Tourism and
the MMA, aiming at defining joint actions for the development o f sustainable tourism. The
project will support activities that may contribute to the development o f this joint plan, as well as
some priority and innovative activities that need to be improved and tested.


2. Project design

        This project involves seven different ministries and has a set o f specific objectives that
directly contribute to the achievement o f the targets o f the second EnvPRL operations. The entire
sequence o f steps necessary to achieve the objectives cannot be determined in advance, as they
involve the definition o f technical basis for new public policies as well as capacity building. To
face these challenges, the main characteristics o f the project's design are:


        0   A relatively wide-ranging development goal, namely the promotion of environmental
            sustainability in various government sectors. The design process o f the project's
            management includes the participation o f decision makers, who are represented by
            the executive secretaries o f the ministries involved.


        0   A list o f intermediate results (specific objectives) to be achieved by the project,
            directly linked to the EnvPRL targets, allowing some flexibility in the specific
            activities necessary to achieve such results.


        0   The possibility o f support to other intermediate results that may emerge during the
            project's implementation, whether derived from the government's policy letter or
            through newjoint actions developed with other ministries which would be reflected in
            the following EnvPRL operations. The adoption o f such additional intermediate
            results will be considered case by case. Thus, the detailed project (Annex 4) presents
            activities that represent about 60% o f the value o f the project, allowing the remaining
            amount to be defined during implementation.




                                                  35

       e  A participatory and annual monitoring and evaluation process, focusing on ensuring
          the quality o f the project's outputs and the efficiency and effectiveness o f the reform
          policies, as well as ;recommending adjustment of its next steps.

       e  A coordination process that decentralizes the definition of the activities to be carried
          out to each ministry, while centralizing all the administrative and financial
          management, resulting inlower transaction costs.

       e  A High-level Management Committee and Monitoring and Evaluation process that
           guarantee the direct link between this technical assistance loan and the programmatic
          reform loan.

       e   A communication strategy for the EnvPRL and the EnvTAL and its implementation,
           to give the necessary public access to all information allowing public accountability.

3. Project scope

       The goal o f the Environmental Sustainability Agenda Technical Assistance Project is to
assist the MMA, its affiliated bodies, and beneficiary ministries, to achieve the targets
established in the reform agenda for the second EnvPRL operation. The set o f three EnvPRL
should produced the outcomes summarized below:

        e  reduce time required for issuingdecisions;
        0  civil society's control and monitoring o f the proposals for reducing the impacts o f
           licensed enterprises, as well as all environmental decisions and licensing;
        e  increase efficiency o f governmental actions;
        e  reduce accidents and people affectedbyhazardous chemicals;
        e  significant reduction o f deforestation;
        0  increase o f areas under sustainable management;
        e  increase volume o f water used that i s licensed at Federal level;
        0  water basin agencies operational;
        e  reduce illegal land occupation;
        e  reduce degraded areas;
        e  reduce water pollution discharge into water bodies;
        e  increase occupation efficiency o f areas inthe municipalities;
        e  use o f the Environmental-Economic Zoning as a regional planning instrument;
        0  increase the volume o f lending based on environmental sustainable Financial and
           Fiscal policies;
        e  decrease in the social and environmental negative impact o f major energy projects;
           and
        e  improve environmental sustainability o f tourism sector.

        The project combines a wide range o f technical assistance activities, consultancies,
studies and events, all linked to the fulfillment o f an ambitious environmental agenda o f
structural reforms that will cover the entire national territory.

       BeneJiciaries

       Technical assistance activities generally have an impact on the whole o f society. Given
that the intention o f the planned activities and actions i s to remove obstacles to long-term
sustained economic growth, and to ensure social inclusion and environmental sustainability, in
due course they will benefit the whole population, whether by sustainable social inclusion,
reduction o f inequity, or the general improvement o f the country's environmental conditions.

        Just as development and institutional strengthening activities benefit the whole o f society,
the same applies to technical assistance activities, and even more so when they are directed
towards the environmental sector, whose crosscutting nature requires broader multidisciplinary
actions. Specifically, the MMA, its secretariats, ANA and IBAMA, and all other six ministries
above mentioned will benefit from increased effectiveness in the achievement o f the goals o f
each institution.

       Finally, due to their characteristics, some studies and consultancy services are inherent to
particular regions or physical spaces in the country, such as:          (i)ecological and economic
zonings linked to specific regions and physical spaces;           (ii)specific programs such as the
Sustainable Amazon Plan (PAS), program for the Cerrado (Brazilian savannas) and Atlantic
Forest, (iii)municipal master plans with an environmental focus; (iv) mapping o f degraded areas;
(v) Si0 Francisco river basin revitalization program;         (vi) licensing of settlements under the
Agrarian Reform and Family Farming programs; (vii) certification o f PRODES (Water Basins
Restoration Program) projects;       (viii) rehabilitation of old hydropower energy plants; and (ix)
others.

4. Project cost and components

        The TAL for Environmental Sustainability, a US$ 8.6 million for up to three-year period,
has a set o f targets that fully match the policy reforms agreed between the GOB and the Bank for
the second EnvPRL operation. These targets o f the TAL are expressed in terms o f the technical
input necessary for high quality and feasible policy reforms. The actual implementation o f the
reforms are within the scope o fthe second EnvPRL operation.

       The project will support the implementation o f activities to achieve the stated objectives.
The activities are being selected in coordination with Bank staff responsible for projects that
include support for technical assistance or capacity building to those areas also covered by this
loan, This ensures full complementarity between the Bank portfolio and allows for the most
efficient and effective use o f the resources o f this loan towards its objectives. The EnvTAL
objectives and their direct relation to the targets o f the second EnvPRL operation are presented
inthe table below:

          Project budget will be allocated to the five major components (table below), allowing for
the necessary flexibility to achieve the objectives o f the EnvTAL. The funds will be used to
provide technical support to the government inthe preparation and implementation o f the second
EnvPRL operation. The project will support studies, technical assistance and capacity building,
workshops, strategically selected to provide a solid technical and institutional basis and input for
the proposed policy reforms in coordination with other Bank-supported efforts. The activities
agreed upon and identified initially are presented inAnnex 4, which represents about 60% o f the
project's total value. The amount of resources allocated for each component derived from the
amount needed for the implementation o f the initial activities identified and projection o f the
further work needed.

        The EnvPRL and the EnvTALhave raised strategic and important issues which has lead
to other international organizations to look forward to join the IBRD in supporting the GOB's
sustainability agenda. KfW has expressed its interest inco-financing the second operation o f the
EnvPRL. GTZ intends to provide technical assistance o f up to  500,000 for the EnvTAL. In
close coordination with Bank's team during preparation, it was defined that GTZ possible
support would be directed to: (i)capacity building of MMA and IBAMA; and (ii)             capacity
building of the PCU team, including the design and implementation of the Monitoring and
EvaluationPlan and the Communication Plan.




*GTZ intends to provide support in a total amount of up to  500,000 (aprox. US$ 600,000) the actual
components would be defined later indiscussions with the GOB.

        The project design allows for having additional objectives in support to new policy
reforms that emerge during the project's implementation, whether derived from the
government's policy letter or through new joint actions developed with other ministries. The
main condition i s that these eventual new activities would directly contribute to achieving a new
important policy reform conducive to the Environmental Sustainability Agenda and be included
inthe following EnvPRL operations. Each proposed new objective, including the ensuing TA,
will be considered case by case, as needed, during the project's implementation and upon the
Approval o f the Management Committee composed by the Executive Secretaries (Vice-
Ministers) o f all seven ministries involved inthe EnvPRL and inthe EnvTAL, among others.

        The allocation of the remaining amount, which represents around 35% of the total loan
amount, will be defined annually during implementation by the Management Committee, either
for new activities to support reaching existent objectives or agreed new ones, and with input
from the project monitoring and evaluation system.

5. Related projects

        The EnvTAL was designed taking into consideration the support that other Bank projects
are giving to the GOB's environmental sustainability agenda. Both the GOB'S and the Bank's
teams involved in the implementation o f those projects were consulted with and/or were part o f
the EnvTAL's preparation team to ensure the complementarity o f the proposed EnvTAL's
activities with those projects and that the agreed reforms for the environmental sustainability
would be accomplished. The Table below lists Bank projects that might have some relation with


                                                 41

the specific EnvTAL objectives, but that, on consultation with the team, were assured that
EnvTAL's initial activities are complementing those projects.

        Several projects are still under preparation, which leave the complementarity issue to be
identified when the projects follows their preparation. At this point, the projects' teams would
consult with the team involved in the EnvTAL to make sure that there are no overlaps between
activities. Besides, most o f those projects are already considering the EnvTAL's initial activities
for complementing their proposed activities (eg. GEF Cerrado and Persistent Organic
Pollutants).

        As the EnvTAL has some implementing flexibility, new activities proposed during
project's implementation will follow the same process as project preparation: all GOB'S and
Bank's teams will be consulted with to ensure the relevance and complementarity o f the new
activities with on-going projects.

        This will enable a much larger technical assistance envelop towards policy reforms more
compatible with the size o f scope o f the challenges regarding environmental sustainable in
Brazil.

6. Evaluation of implementation performance

        The Borrower will evaluate, with the Bank and the Management Committee, at least,
once a year during project's implementation, the progress in the carrying out o f the Project's
activities during the preceding period, and the need to add or eliminate activities under the
Project in order to achieve the objective o f the Project. The Bank may agree to finance new
Project activities under the Loan if: (a) there i s an express support to the carrying o f such
activities by the Management Committee; (b) there i s availability o f Loan funds to finance the
additional activities; (c) such additional activities do not trigger any of the Bank's safeguard
policies; and (d) the Bank i s satisfied with the arrangements for the implementation o f such new
activities.

        The Management Committee, responsible for general and macro-policy decisions related
to the Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental Sustainability (EnvPRL) and to the
Environmental Sustainability Agenda Technical Assistance Project (EnvTAL) at inter-ministerial
level, will prepare, facilitate and evaluate actions for fulfilling the commitments relating to the
EnvPRL andthe EnvTALand approve the project's Annual Operative Plans (POA).

         The Management Committee will be composed of the Executive-Secretaries and/or
respective substitutes o f the following Ministries: (i)    Environment; (ii)   Cities; (iii) Agrarian
Development; (iv) Finance; (v) National Integration; (vi) Mines and Energy; (vii) Tourism;
(viii) Planning, Budget and Management; as well as (ix) an organizedcivil society representative
to be selected according to criteria to be defined by the project's coordination. The Executive
Secretary o f the MMA will be the Coordinator of the Management Committee. The Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) will play the role o f Executive Secretariat of the Management
Committee.

         Itwas agreedwith the government that theresults o fthe EnvPRL will also bemonitored
and evaluated through this technical assistance loan. Item 4 o f this Annex presents the list o f
targets agreed upon inthe EnvPRL and the key intermediate results that directly contribute to
each one o f them.

         The result indicators for each one the intermediate results (Annex 3) will be the number
o f satisfactory completed key activities (e.g. training, studies, seminars, pilot tested) in support to
the beneficiary's preparation or implementation o f the plans and actions, with related products
forwarded to the respective decision-making authorities. The outcome indicator will be the
constitution o f a critical mass o f key approved plans and institutional capacity to implement
them.

         The "Management Committee" upon a report prepared by the PCU will evaluate the
indicators each year o f the life o f the project. Based on the registered progress and identified
challenges the "Management Committee" will decide on the list o f activities, and respective
budgets, to be implemented inthe following year.

         Parallel to this, the GOB will design a separate mechanism, to be developed during the
first year o f project's implementation, that will ensure a participatory M&E process of the


                                                   45

content; the quality of results produced for each activity; and the efficiency and effectiveness o f
the reform policies o f the EnvPRL. As consequence, the proposed policy reforms to be submitted
to the decision-makers will have a general buy-inby the different affected GOB'Sagencies and
stakeholders. The annual report o f this M&E, which will be prepared by the PCU, will be
submitted to the       Management Committee which will also consider it while deciding the
activities, and budgets, to be implemented inthe following year.

        These two systems would not only ensure that the proposed technical assistance loan i s
being properly implemented, but, most importantly ,that it i s directly contributing to the
advancement o f the policy reforms agreed by the GOB and the Bank in the second EnvPRL
operation.

        The GOB will also design a communication strategy, to be developed during the first
year o f project implementation, to ensure that the progress and results o f this project and the
EnvPRL will be disseminate to a wide audience. This will further contribute to the participation
o f the civil society inmonitoring the performance o fthe proposed activities and policy reforms.

        The Bank has recently approved the First Programmatic Reform Loan For
Environmental Sustainability (EnvPRL) to support the GOB'S environmental sustainability
program and to mainstream environmental objectives more firmly in its broader development
agenda. Duringthe preparation of the EnvPRL it was identified that (a) technical assistance loan
would be instrumental in reducing some of the implementation risks identified for the
programmatic loan series, and (b) the need to support the GOB with the development o f
participatory monitoring and evaluation instruments that would allow the Government to assess
the pace and progress o f the reforming agenda agreed in the EnvPRL. Thus support o f the Bank,
inthe form of technical assistance, is required to successfully implement the proposed reforms
including the triggers for the subsequent loans o f the EnvPRL.

        The project has a set o f targets that fully match the policy reforms agreed between the
GOB and the Bank for the second EnvPRL operation. These targets of the TAL are expressed in
terms o f the technical input necessary for high quality and feasible policy reforms. The actual
implementation o f the reforms are within the scope o fthe EnvPRL.

        The necessary     number and scope o f the targets o f this TAL poses a challenge
considering the total amount to this loan ( US$ 8.0 million). Thus, duringproject preparation the
team worked closely with other Bank and GOB staff responsible for projects that include support
for technical assistance or capacity buildingto those areas also covered by this loan. This ensures
full complementarity between this TAL and the rest o f the Bank portfolio. As a result, the
activities to be supported by this loan are the key strategic interventions to ensure that the targets
set forth inthe EnvTAL will be successfully achieved. The interface with the other Bank loans
i s summarized on item 5, Annex 1.

        Technical assistance activities have been split into components that focus on the targets
to be achieved through the individual efforts o f the Ministryo f Environment, and on those to be
reached through joint efforts with participating ministries: Mines and Energy, National
Integration, Agrarian Development, Cities, Tourism and Finance.

        Activities considered to be technical assistance within the scope o f the present project
include studies, analyses, development and testing o f systems and pilot projects and staff
capacity building. Several o f those activities will be coupled with key consultations and meetings
with several different civil society groups to ensure a participatory process and "ground-thurting"
o f the proposed policy changes. The table at the end o f this annex summarizes the EnvPRL,
targets and the direct relation to the objectives o f this EnvTAL and the initial set o f activities
already identified.

PartA -Assessment of the FinancialManagementSystem

Purpose o f the Assessment

        An assessment o f the Project's financial management capacity was carried out according
to ,the OP/BP 10.02 rules and the guidelines for the assessment o f financial management
procedures in projects financed by the World Bank, issued by the Sectoral Financial
Management Board on October 15,2003.

        The purpose o f this assessment was to verify whether the Borrower and the Implementing
Agency have or will have, by the date o f effectiveness, appropriate and acceptable procedures in
place and in force to ensure the project's efficient financial management, monitoring and
disbursement. Such procedures include, but are not limited to: a) appropriate accounting and
management o f all project revenues, payments, expenditures and transactions; b) regular
issuance o f financial statements inthe FMR format and SIAFI reports for disbursement purposes,
within agreed deadlines; c) recording and control o f goods and assets procured with loan
resources; d) contract the project's independent audit within agreed deadlines; and e) efficient
disbursement o f the loan resources in compliance with the guidelines and procedures established
by the World Bank.

        The assessment was carried out in the offices o f SECEWMMA" and included work
meetings and sessions with the Project Coordinator, representatives from SECEX and GAP2'
who will provide support to the project, technicians who will provide support to the SGP and
SIGMA systems, and other individuals involved in the preparation o f the project, whenever
required. The work also included: a) customization o f the computerized systems to beused inthe
project's financial management system (SIGMA); b) the necessary staff; c) revision of the flow
o f resources; d) revision of the internal control mechanisms and administrative procedures; e)
disbursement methodology to be used using SIAFI reports; f) financial reports to be issued,
including format, frequency and content; and g) external audit.

Conclusion of the Assessment

         Once the global financial management system and other related procedures described in
this report are fully implemented and operational, they will meet the minimum requirements
established by the World Bank. This will enable the project to be effectively controlled and
monitored, andwill facilitate the provision o f reasonably secure, accurate and timely information
on the project's implementation.

Financial Management RiskAnalysis

       The financial management risk associated with this project is considered moderate, as
demonstrated inthe Risk Framework below:

                                                          (SGP/SIGMA)


       The main risks associated with the Project's Financial Management are related to the
decentralized implementation ineight ministries, and the existence o f two systems - SIGMA and
SGP, which will require the transfer o f data from one to the other to update the respective
databases and to generate the financial reports.

        Among the strong points are the MMA's considerable experience in implementing
projects financed by the World Bank, the administrative support that will be provided by the
GAP and the appointment of an exclusive Financial Coordinator.

Part B- Financial management and disbursement arrangements

Proiect Coordination Unit

        The project will be implementedby a PCU21established within the scope o f SECEX. The
responsibilities o f the PCU will include supervision, coordination with the implementing
ministries, planning, procurement, financial management, monitoring and reporting. The PCU
team will consist of a Coordinator, a Deputy Coordinator, a Financial Administration Manager, a
Procurement Manager and a Technical Manager.

Flow o fresources and disbursement

         The flow o f financial resources i s outlined inAnnexes 7.A and 7.B. In compliance with
procedures established by the                  all the resources required for the development o f the
project, including the part to be executed through UNDP will be advanced by the National
Treasury as soon as the budget i s approved and available at the project's own Managing Unit in
the SIAF123. As stated in the project design, resources for the project to be advanced by STN to
UNDP will flow first to MMA and than to UNDP. Duringthe project's implementation and as
the procurement/contracts are done, the SPOA24/MMA will take care o f commitments and
settlements through the SIAFI. UNDP will report directly to the PCU on the expenses incurred
from the advances received.

         The project will use the report-based disbursement methodology using reports to be
extracted from SIAFI.          The SIAFI report would have a list o f all Banking Orders (Ordem
Bancciria) issued sorted by category o f expenditure and by source o f funds and it will beused for
disbursement purposes. The UNDP expenditures will only be submittedfor reimbursement after
the actual expending has been incurred and reported back by UNDP.. The SIAFI report will be
issued monthly by the PCU and will be forwarded to STN, which will then forward them to the
World Bank for disbursement o f the Bank's resources and for deposit directly from the Loan
Account to the National Treasury's Single Account (see Annex 7.B).

         It's relevant to mention that the Bank will finance 100%o f all categories.

Computerized Systems for the Proiect's Financial Management

         The budgetary and financial implementation will be done through the SIAFI. Once the
General Federal Budget i s approved by the National Congress, the SPOA will enter the resources
made available in the project's own Managing Unit in the SIAFI. As explained above,
disbursements will be made on basis o f reports extracted from SIAFI. The MMA also uses two
other systems for monitoring, accounting, control and reporting: SGP25and SIGMA.

         The SIGMA i s a system developed by the MMA for the management of all the projects
developed within the scope o f the Ministry. In addition to accounting, the SIGMA includes
planning, preparation o f the POA26,budget, physical execution, procurement and reporting in
FMR27format. For this project, SIGMA will be used to register all the project data:        planning
andbudget, preparation o f the POA and preparation o f the FMRs.

       The SGP is a system originally developed for the administration of technical cooperation
contracts (PRODOC) with international technical cooperation agencies - UNDP: UNESCO,
FAO, etc. For this project, the system will be used to control the part that will be implemented
through the UNDP.       It is therefore capable o f monitoring all the financial transactions that are
the responsibility o f this agency.

Financial Reports -FMR
       The following Financial Reports inFMR format will be issued:
           0   FMR 1- Source and Application ofResources by expenditure category according
               to the Loan Agreement,
           0   FMR2 -Statement ofProject Investments by Components andActivities,
           0   FMR 3 -Reconciliation o fProjectAccounts with SIAFI,
           0   FMR4 -Reconciliation o fProject Accounts with the Bank's "Client Connection"
               website,

       The FMRs, for reporting and monitoring purposes, will be issued in the SIGMA'S
format, with customization to the Project, on quarterly basis or at intervals to be defined together
with the Bank and the STN. FMRswill be issued only inR$, except for FMR4, which will be in
R$ and US$.

       The FMRs will contain the expenses incurred and recordedinSIAFI, duringeachperiod
reported, for which a corresponding           has been issued for payment to the beneficiaries, as
well as the expenses incurred and documented by the UNDP.

       The year-end FMRs will also be used for auditing purposes, as a basis for auditors to
issue opinions on the Project Accounts.

External Audit and Supervision    .

        The independent external audit o f the project will be done by the SFC - Federal
Secretariat for Internal Control o f the Federal Office o f the Comptroller General.

        The Bank will carry out at least one mission a year for financial management supervision.

        BRAZIL: ENVIRONMENTALSUSTAINABILITYAGENDA TECHNICAL
                                      ASSISTANCE PROJECT


A. General

         Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the
Loadcredit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time fi-ame are agreed between
the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at
least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements
ininstitutional capacity.

Procurementof Works:None

Procurementof Goods: Goods procuredunderthisproject would include: off-the-shelf IT
equipment. The procurement will be done usingthe Bank's SBD for all ICB and National SBD
agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank. According to the procurement plan, goods contracts are
of small value and will be procured usingshoppingprocedures.

Procurementof non-consultingservices: The project will requirethe procurement o flogistics
for workshops and printingo f materials for workshops and of advertisement material. The
procurement plan indicates a large number o f workshops, but they are scattered indifferent
places and intime. Shopping may be used, and the procurement plan will indicate another
method, whenever more appropriate. The same would apply to printingservices.

Selectionof Consultants: Consultant contracts underthis project would be signed for legal
studies, preparation o f conservation programs, public consultations and capacity building. Short
lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than $500,000 equivalent per contract may
be composed entirely o f national consultants inaccordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7
ofthe Consultant Guidelines.The procurementplan includes a variety o f consulting services to
behiredunder QCBS, but it also includes several smaller and simpler services for which SOF,
LCS, or Consultant's Qualifications i s more appropriate.

OperatingCosts: Theproject may finance office maintenance and supplies, air tickets, and
printingservices required for project management. The Bank would accept the Borrower's
proposal to use their own administrative procedures, iffound acceptable when reviewed. For air
tickets, even ifthe amount exceeds ICB thresholds, experience has shown N C B would still be
the best procurement method.




                                                   89

B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

        At the time o f the assessment, most procurement activities will be carried out by MMA's
GAP,and some would betransferred to UNDP.

        The assessment of the capacity of the ImplementingAgency to implement procurement
actions for the project has been carried out by Lucian0 Wuerzius on February 21, 2005 and
approved by Lea Braslavsky, on behalf o f the WM, on February 23, 2005. The assessment
reviewed the organizational structure for implementingthe project and the interaction between
the project's staff responsible for procurement Officer and the Ministry's relevant central unit for
administration and finance.

        The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation o f the project have
been identified and include: (i)GAP's staff experience i s limited to very small purchases
financed by international agencies; (ii)    GAP will need support from a seasoned procurement
staff; (iii)
           except for external audit by SFC, there are no other control instances on procurement;
(iv) GAP's record keeping does not provide the safety necessary to maintain the documentation
entailed by the project. The corrective measures which have been agreed are presented in the
table below:


     Action                                                   By Whom        Timeframe

  1 To preparea ProcurementPlanfor the initial 18 months of   Client         Before appraisal
     project implementation.
  2 To customize the SGP for the TAL.                         Client         Before effectiveness
  3  To hire a procurement "manager" and a "hands-on"         Client          Before effectiveness
     procurementspecialist, under TORSacceptable to the
     Bank.
  4 To train all of the project's procurement staff.          Bank            Before effectiveness
  5  To arrange for adequatesafe space to keep proposals      Client          Before appraisal

        However, during appraisal, the client decided to shift all procurement to UNDP. MMA's
GAP would be responsible for marginal procurement below a limit established by the
international agency. Notwithstanding, the actions above remain valid, except for #5, since the
processing will be handledby UNDP.

        The overall project risk for procurement i s high.


C. ProcurementPlan

        The Borrower, at appraisal,          developed a draft procurement plan for project
implementation which provides the basis for the           procurement methods. After several
discussions, the plan received the no objection o f the Bank on June 29, 2005 and i s available at
MMA's GAP. It will also be available in the project's database and in the Bank's external
website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or


                                                    90

as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional
capacity.

D. Frequency of Procurement Supervision

        In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the
capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended bi-annual supervision
missions to visit the field to carry out post review of procurement actions.

E. Details of the ProcurementArrangements Involving InternationalCompetition

1. Goods, Works, and Non ConsultingServices

        (a) List o f contract packages to be procured following ICB and direct contracting: There
will be no ICB under this project. The current procurement plan does not include any direct
