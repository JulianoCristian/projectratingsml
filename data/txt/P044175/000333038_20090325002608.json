Some lessons learned included:\n            project design, objectives, and indicators need to be\n            realistic, especially where the project aims to introduce\n            new management practices requiring considerable change in\n            institutional and legal frameworks. Some of the expected\n            project outcomes were beyond the ultimate control of the\n            Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) alone e.g.\n            approval of new legislation, and this impacted on other\n            project outputs and full achievement of the project\n            development objectives. In terms of the Turkey portfolio,\n            this was a small project. As a result, while the Project\n            Management Team (PMT) was highly effective, it was somewhat\n            marginalized within the ministry. Other Bank projects have\n            benefited from higher-levels of coordination, and by\n            Ministry management which is able to make key decisions and\n            to mainstream project activities better. Projects also need\n            to be of a significant enough size relative to the country\n            and its other ongoing activities to have the visibility\n            needed to serve as a country model for future investments.\n            The project laid a solid foundation for new Protected Area\n            (PA) management practices consistent with international good\n            practice and EU guidelines. It will be important that future\n            Bank, GEF and other donor projects related to PAs and\n            Natural Resource Management (NRM) use and build on these\n            good practices. The National Meeting on Biodiversity and\n            Protected Area Management held in May 2006 provided an\n            excellent mechanism for engaging stakeholders, establishing\n            a learning network, and disseminating good practice.\n            Partnerships and collaboration established through the\n            conference have been sustained to support conservation\n            activities at new sites. Convening such a conference could\n            be a useful outreach and dissemination mechanism for other projects."}, "docdt": "2009-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
