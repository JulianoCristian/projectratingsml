It\n            will further build capacity at the national level, to\n            facilitate institutional capacities at priority conservation\n            sites in Turkey. The components thus include: 1)\n            strengthening of the national framework for bio-diversity\n            conservation, through a participatory review, and strategic\n            rationalization of the legal framework for bio-diversity\n            conservation, including removal of overlapping sectoral\n            legislation, and policy, or adjustments to legislation\n            adversely impacting bio-diversity. Financing mechanisms will\n            be assessed to support conservation initiatives, and monitor\n            these activities, and, relevant public awareness will be\n            conducted; 2) developing prototypes for effective protected\n            area management, through innovative conservation management\n            systems. The institutional capacity of the Protected Area\n            Management Authority will be strengthened, building staff\n            skills, developing management planning systems, in a\n            participatory manner. Funding will be provided to support\n            conservation development, and reduce unsustainable use of\n            resources, such as forest, and wetland products, and\n            grazing; and, 3) project management, and monitoring\n            expenses, to support implementation activities."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
