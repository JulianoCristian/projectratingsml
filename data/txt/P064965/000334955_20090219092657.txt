Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The PDO of Phase I is to assist farmers, other target private sector operator groups, and the
relevant government institutions to acquire the basic institutional and technical capacities that are
needed for: (i) the development of more effective service delivery and infrastructure maintenance
systems; and (ii) the efficient management of export crop and marshland/hill-side area farming.

              1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. The 1994 genocide and the preceding civil conflicts left Rwanda among the poorest countries in
the world, with a per capita income of US$220 in 2001--far lower than its 1990 per capita income of
US$370. The poverty headcount (households living below the poverty line of US$1/day) had increased
from 40 percent in 1985, to 51.2 percent in 1993 and to 60.3 percent in 2001. Rwanda's population of 8.5
million in 2000 was growing at between 2.5 to 2.9 percent per year, and its population density of 337 per
km2 was in the top ten in the world.1 Ninety two percent of Rwandans lived in rural areas, where about
90 percent were engaged in subsistence agriculture.2 The rural poverty headcount stood at 65.7 percent in
1999-2000.3

2. Rapid population growth and the scarcity of new arable land presented problems for the rural
sector and threatened its revival. Rwanda faced increasing labor intensity and declining labor
productivity in agriculture, declining average farm size, worsening land degradation, pressure on off-farm
employment and wages, and fragile food security. The index of growth in agricultural production had
fallen from 0.8 percent over 1975-84, to -2.2 percent over 1985-1989, and further to -6.7 percent between
1990 and 1996. Poor performance of agriculture was costly for the overall economy--the sector
contributed 41 percent of GDP in 2000, down from 44 percent of GDP in 1990.

3. Research confirmed that higher growth rates would require better integration of Rwanda's
smallholder farmers into market transactions. In 1998, a Bank report on agricultural intensification in
Rwanda identified several factors that constrained farmers' participation in markets. The analysis
suggested three entry points to foster broad-based rural growth over a 10-15 year period: (a) expansion of
existing industrial crops (coffee and tea); (b) promotion of alternative high-value smallholder crops; and
(c) intensification of existing food crop systems.4

4. The Government confirmed its intent to intensify and commercialize agriculture and diversify
economic activities in the rural areas.5 The Ministry of Agriculture completed its agriculture strategy
that reflected a clear shift from the past approach of food security towards greater market orientation.
Accordingly, the Bank assisted GoR to design a 14-year three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to
help implement this strategy. Phase I of the resulting Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP) (2001-05)
emphasized building the institutional and technical capacities that were needed to support the generation
and adoption of efficient cropping and post-harvest technologies and to launch the intensification process.
RSSP1 was approved on March 29, 2001 and became effective on October 24, 2001.

females and 86 percent of males--not by choice but by the absence of choice (CAS, 2002, p. 3).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators6

5. The PDO of Phase I is to assist farmers, other target private sector operator groups, and the relevant
government institutions to acquire the basic institutional and technical capacities that are needed for: (i)
the development of more effective service delivery and infrastructure maintenance systems; and (ii) the
efficient management of export crop and marshland/hill-side area farming.

6. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): (i) the marshland/hill-side and export crop farmers have adopted
new and improved cropping technologies, including integrated pest management; (ii) the quantities of
fertilizers used per capita and per hectare among beneficiary farmers are 50 percent higher than the
baseline; and (iii) the quantities and shares of marketed crop output per household among beneficiary
farmers are 50 percent higher than the baseline.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification.

7. The PDO and the KPIs were not revised. Following the MTR in 2005, one KPI was added to the
project results framework by the supervision team to better capture the underlying PDO; i.e. equipping
beneficiaries with basic institutional and technical capacity. As this was a clarification and not a major
revision, Board approval was not sought. The added KPI was: farmers' associations and rural commercial
enterprises are effectively managing their finances, production, infrastructure maintenance and production
infrastructure maintenance and marketing.

8. Justification for the new KPI: RSSP experienced poor performance in the early stages of
implementation (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2). The MTR found that: (i) the original three KPIs did not
capture an important aspect of what Phase I was trying to achieve, and, more importantly, (ii) due to
design issues, project implementation was dominated by the Project Support and Coordination Unit
(PSCU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI), rather than led at the
community level as envisaged in RSSP's design. The MTR's six-month Action Plan included steps to
enhance decentralized implementation by establishing greater field presence (i.e., through creation of
project implementation offices at the community level) and by training farmer communities to manage the
project's activities. To capture this intended empowerment and local capacity building, the team added
the fourth indicator.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9. The main beneficiaries (and the avenues through which they were to be assisted) included: (i)
farmers in the project areas (through better cropping and post-harvest activities, higher productivity and
ultimately higher incomes for further productivity investments); (ii) private entrepreneurs (directly
through technical and financial support and indirectly through induced demand due to higher incomes in
the agricultural sector); (iii) consumers (through lower food prices); (iv) local communities (through
improvements in local infrastructure and indirectly, through the diversification of the local economy and
employment); and (v) targeted institutions, including lead research and extension institutions, private



6The wording of the PDO differs as it is stated in the DCA (Schedule 2), the text of the PAD (p. 4) and Annex 1 of
the PAD (Project Design Summary, p. 54). The PDO in the DCA, "to assist the Borrower in revitalizing its rural
economy", refers to the higher-order sector-related CAS goal stated in the Design Summary of the PAD (pg. 52 of
RSSP 1 PAD) rather than to the Project's Phase I goal. This DCA PDO is not used in any other document as the
Phase I PDO during implementation. Most documents (including the Final Impact Assessment and the RSSP 2
PAD) use the PDO in the Design Summary of the PAD to evaluate project implementation. This ICR, therefore,
evaluates RSSP 1 against the PDO in the Annex of the PAD, i.e. the Design Summary.

R&D institutions, central, prefecture and district-level administrations (through technical support and
capacity building activities).

1.5 Original Components

10. Component 1: Rehabilitation of Farmed Marshland and Hillside Areas (US$13.97m) aimed to
establish effective mechanisms to: (a) facilitate the adoption by beneficiary farmers of efficient and
sustainable technologies and practices to profitably manage marshland and hill-side crops; and (b)
encourage and develop the skills of private operators to undertake construction and maintenance of
infrastructure for land and water. Activities included: (i) financing of small-scale drainage and irrigation
infrastructure on farmed marshlands; (ii) financing of R&D and infrastructure for soil and natural
resources conservation on marshlands and hill-sides; (iii) advisory services on cropping and water
management technologies; (iv) training of farmer groups and other private operators in construction,
management, and maintenance of land and water infrastructure; (v) institutional support to producer
organizations and community groups; and (vi) soil fertility restoration measures.

11. Component 2: Integrated Management of Critical Ecosystems (IMCE) (US$5.00m) sought to
introduce better land husbandry, including appropriate land use, crop-livestock practices, and improved
integrated plant nutrient techniques, and make required inputs more accessible to stakeholders. Activities
included: (i) developing an enabling environment for sustainable resource use: policy framework,
regulations, institutional support; (ii) developing and implementing community-based integrated
management plans for critical ecosystems (wetlands, drylands, and mountain areas); (iii) creating an
Environmental Information System (EIS); and (iv) capacity building and institutional strengthening to
support decentralized integrated management of natural resources.

12. Component 3: Promotion of Commercial and Export Agriculture (US$10.53m) sought to
empower traditional export crop farmers to take over the management of commercial and technical
activities that were formerly the responsibility of the two parastatals in the tea and coffee sectors. Efforts
were to be made also to develop new export crops, primarily in the horticulture sector. Support was to be
provided to farmers who were willing to invest in the production of these new crops. Planned activities
included: (i) providing advisory services on production and post-harvest technologies to farmers and other
private sector operators; (ii) financing of post-harvest R&D and infrastructure; (iii) financing of technical
assistance and grants to strengthen the capacities of farmer organizations; (iv) facilitating access to
financing of productive technologies; and (v) financing of technical assistance and capital investment to
establish farmer-owned Commercial Enterprises and Technical Support Entities (CETSE).

13. Component 4: Support to Agricultural Services Delivery Systems (US$9.59m) focused on
strengthening the capacities of agricultural research and extension systems to generate and extend
improved technologies to farmers and enhance the delivery of services. Given the very weak capacities in
the research systems, the first phase would include : (i) rebuilding of ISAR's research and analytical
capacities; (ii) training of scientists; and (iii) building the capacities of lead research and extension
services to involve farmers and private operators in the generation and dissemination of cropping and
post-harvest technologies.

14. Component 5: Small-scale Infrastructure Development (US$9.81m) emphasized two objectives--
upgrade and expand small-scale transport infrastructure in the rural areas; and facilitate the access to
adapted post-harvest infrastructure and appropriate means of rural transport (AMT). The component
included actions to strengthen the capacities of: (i) local communities to prepare and supervise small-scale
infrastructure sub-projects; (ii) private sector operators to construct and maintain such infrastructure; (iii)
farmers and other private sector operators to acquire transport equipment and post-harvest infrastructure;
and (iv) water management infrastructure to improve agricultural productivity.

15. Component 6: Promotion of Off-farm Productive Activities in Rural Areas (US$0.34m) aimed
to: (a) create additional employment and incomes and contribute to the poverty reduction objective; (b)
expand the effective demand for food and other agricultural goods and, hence, the stimulation of
production; and (c) increase responsiveness of the supply of locally produced off-farm goods. In Phase I,
the objective was to develop strategies and implement pilot activities, which could then be scaled up in
subsequent phases. Activities included: (i) preparation and piloting of local off-farm development
strategies; (ii) financing of R&D for selected off-farm production activities; (iii) training in enterprise
development and management; and (iv) provision of seed-funding and facilitation of access to rural
investment credit.

16. Component 7: Program Support and Coordination (US$3.77m) was intended to ensure: (i)
effective M&E of program activities throughout implementation; and (ii) effective coordination between,
and support to, the various implementing agencies and beneficiary groups given the decentralized and
participatory mode of implementation that is proposed for the Program. Component activities were to: (i)
establishment of a Project Support and Coordination Unit, including an M&E Division; (ii) design and
implementation of a mechanism to effectively coordinate the program activities; (iii) design and
implementation of a mechanism to effectively monitor and evaluate the program activities; (iv) carrying
out of a Baseline Rural Sector Survey (BSSR) in the first year to be updated by the end of year 4 of Phase
I; and (v) carrying out impact studies at local and beneficiary levels.

1.6 Revised Components

17. The Project components were simplified in two stages between the time of the MTR in February
2005, and December 2005. Implementation progress had been rated unsatisfactory in 2002 and 2004-05,
and RSSP was not on track to achieve its PDO (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2). The MTR strongly
recommended simplifying project design by reducing the number of components to four, so as to
rationalize the project's results framework and enhance implementation, to improve RSSP's alignment
with and contributions to the PRSP, and to make the achievement of the PDO more manageable (Aide
Memoire, July-August 2005 Mission). In July 2005, following a review, which determined that
performance had improved, the project was further simplified. Activities were merged into two
components as shown in Table 1, with the objective of making the Phase I operation more easily
implementable within a proposed first extension period (discussed in Section 1.7). The two components
were: (i) Marshland/Hillsides Development and Export Diversification, including the complementary
value-adding activities and strengthening the support to decentralized community empowerment that was
already underway; and (ii) Implementation Coordination and M&E Support. The DCA was amended on
December 20, 2005. Board approval was not sought, and the changes were cleared by AFRVP, LEGAF,
LOAG2 and AFTOS.7

18. The RSSP PAD indicates that Component 2 would be a GEF-funded activity to be prepared and
implemented by Ministry of Lands, Environment, Forestry, Water and Mines (MINITERE). This activity
was later classified as "partially blended" with RSSP. Integrated Management of Critical Ecosystems
(IMCE) was approved by the Board on June 30, 2005, but it did not become effective until February 9,
2006, by which time the RSSP work program was already far advanced. This made coordination between
the two projects difficult, as they were at such different stages of implementation. The fact that
implementation responsibility for IMCE was assigned to MINITERE, rather than MINAGRI further
increased the lack of synchronization of the two projects. When RSSP closed, IMCE still had two years


7The four components were: (i) Marshlands/Hillsides; (ii) Promotion of Commercial and Export Agriculture
(which would integrate the original Components 3, 5 and 6); (iii) Advisory Services (original Component 4, but
modified); and (iv) Project Management, M&E (original Component 7).

to run, which meant that the "partially blended" status could not continue. The two projects were
therefore de-linked in SAP, allowing IMCE to remain under implementation after RSSP closed. GoR
confirmed its commitment to fund the complementary activities needed by IMCE to achieve its
development objectives.

19. Component 1: Marshland /Hillsides Development and Export Diversification (US$47.89m)
aimed to build institutional, technical and infrastructural capacities that are needed to support the
generation and adoption of efficient cropping and post-harvest technologies. It consisted of three
subcomponents:

20. Sub-Component 1: Studies/Design and Rehabilitation/Construction of Irrigation Infrastructure
(US$28.76m) included: rehabilitation and development of infrastructure on farmed marshlands;
construction of small-scale drainage and irrigation infrastructure on farmed marshlands; and soil and
water resources conservation infrastructure on marshlands and hillsides. This subcomponent aimed to
complete marshlands/hillsides rehabilitation and have design studies ready for Phase II.




                                                       5

21. Subcomponent 2: Capacity Building and TA support to Community and Partner Organizations
(US$6.2m) sought to develop and empower community organizations for marshlands and hillsides
development and to enhance both quality and capacity in private sector delivery of the necessary public
services.

22. Subcomponent 3: Support to Value-Adding Rural Micro Enterprise Activities (US$12.93m) aimed to
create improved conditions for beneficiaries to obtain higher value-added on marshlands by supporting
infrastructure to attract the private sector and increase income-generating activities around marshland
/hillsides and export diversification.

23. Component 2: Implementation Coordination and Monitoring and Evaluation Support
(US$6.53m) sought to: (i) ensure effective management of the Component 1; (ii) develop and ensure
technical capacity and quality to support implementation of activities; (iii) establish effective M&E of
program activities throughout implementation; (iv) ensure the financial management of the project funds;
and (v) ascertain effective coordination between and support to the various implementing agencies and
beneficiary groups, given the decentralized and participatory mode of implementation.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

24. Changes in project design and restructuring. In addition to the changes embodied in the
simplified components, other significant changes included: (i) two extensions to the Closing Date; (ii)
three amendments to the DCA; (iii) a reallocation of Credit proceeds; and (iv) minor changes in
implementation arrangements. These changes did not require Board approval, and were approved by
Regional Management.

25. The first Closing Date extension (from December 30, 2005 to June 30, 2007) was requested following
the MTR to permit the Borrower to fully implement the agreed actions to achieve the PDOs for Phase I
and the triggers for Phase II of the APL. The second extension (June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2008) was
justified for three main reasons: (i) weather-related delays in completion of the proposed activities for
marshland development and protection of hillsides; (ii) the October 2006 implementation mission had
identified the need to undertake impact assessment studies and to develop environmental management
plans for developed marshlands, and preparing these studies and implementing these plans would take
additional time; and (iii) additional time was needed to complete the capacity building at the local level
needed to ensure sustainable management of marshlands developed under RSSP1.

26. Amendments to the DCA. The DCA was amended three times: on June 2, 2004, on December 20,
2005, and on January 22, 2007. The first amendment allowed for revisions including withdrawals from
Special Accounts and deposits into/payments out of Decentralized Advanced Accounts, to assist
Provinces to pay for subprojects under RSSP1. The second amendment was to: (a) extend the closing
date from December 31, 2005 to June 30, 2007 (as approved by the Acting Country Director and Acting
Regional Vice President, AFRVP); (b) reallocate the Credit proceeds among different expenditure
Categories in the table of Part A.1 of Schedule 1 to the DCA; and (c) make further specific amendments
to the DCA and Project Agreement. As part of this amendment, the description of the Project (Schedule
2) was replaced in its entirety incorporating the two revised components listed in Section 1.6. The third
amendment was undertaken for two reasons: (i) to allow for the second project extension; and (ii) to
correct an error made in the target area for hillside rehabilitation from 22,000 hectares to 7,500 hectares.8

27. Reallocation of funds to carry out the revised project activities during the extended Credit period is
given in Annex 1. The proposed reallocation was SDR3.95 million out of the total Proceeds of the Credit
of SDR37.2 million, which was 10.6 percent.

28. Changes in implementation arrangements. Membership of the Project Advisory Committee
performing oversight functions was increased to reflect the multi-sectoral nature of the project.


             2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

29. As recorded in the RSSP PAD, the project was informed by stakeholder consultations
undertaken several years before, during preparation of the Agriculture and Rural Market
Development Project (ARMDP). The participatory process included an Identification Workshop in
February 2000 organized by GoR and attended by all major ministries, local administrations and
organizations, beneficiaries, and private sector representatives. Discussions were held with many donors
including USAID and the EU--the main donors involved in the agricultural sector.

30. The Government was very committed and demonstrated ownership. GoR initiated project
preparation through several studies funded by a PHRD grant and provided budgetary resources for
training MINAGRI's preparation team. The Bank and MINAGRI teams worked closely with CEPEX--
the unit at the Ministry of Finance charged with coordinating preparation and implementation--and
CEPEX staff joined the identification, pre-appraisal, and appraisal missions. The Credit's effectiveness
was slightly delayed from July to October 2001, and one unfulfilled condition (appointment of a Project
Auditor) was waived and subsequently fulfilled.

31. The RSSP PAD and PID cite the lessons learned from several IDA operations in Rwanda,
ongoing or recently completed, at the time of project preparation. These include: (i) the need for
participatory input into project design and implementation of income-generating activities (Second
Integrated Forestry Project, CR 1811-RW); (ii) the need to keep project design simple in post-conflict
situations (Second Water Supply Project, CR 1783-RW); (iii) emphasis on demand-driven research and
extension service and the use of international research organizations and their output (Lake Kivu Coffee
Improvement and Foodcrop Project (Cr. 1126-RW) and the Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 1546-RW);
(iv) the need for institutional capacity building (MINAGRI Institutional Development Project (Cr. 1669-
RW); (v) that communities, with proper support, can effectively design and implement community-based
subprojects, including infrastructure (Community Reintegration and Development Project (Cr. 3138-
RW); and (vi) the importance of encouraging commercial banks to invest in the sector (ARMDP, CR
3270-RW).

32. The original Component 4 design reflects the importance of demand driven extension and farmer
advisory services. Similarly, Components 5 and 6 allow for the development and implementation of
community-based subprojects, whereby communities could formulate projects/investments and gain
access to finance for implementation through what came to be known as the Local Investment Facility
(LIF), the Rural Technology Facility, and the Rural Investment Facility (RIF). The latter was also
designed to stimulate participation of commercial banks in the sector, although this incitement proved not
to outlive the RIF itself (See Annex 2, Appendix 2).

33. The project design appeared to have taken on board most of the lessons articulated in the PAD,
but it disregarded the critical lesson of project simplicity. The project's design was too complex for


                                                      7

the limited local implementation capacity and was exacerbated by a poorly and inconsistently defined set
of indicators and triggers. The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) did not clearly specify how to
implement the project at a decentralized level. This was true for the RIF, as well as the main project
activities. The RIF design was technically sound but required an information system and capacity at the
level of financial institutions that did not exist (See Annex 2, Appendix 2). This design combined with
other problems, discussed below, contributed to poor execution and low disbursement during the first
three to four years, which almost caused RSSP to be closed. As described in Section 2.2, these problems
led to a re-organization and simplification of the project components in December 2005.

34. The inconsistent Results Framework made it difficult to measure progress against the PDO. As
mentioned in Section 1.2, there were inconsistencies in the wording of the PDO as stated in the DCA and
different sections of the PAD9. As shown in Annex 2 of this ICR, there were also inconsistencies in the
Phase I performance indicators/targets as stated in the various documents. The three PDO indicators (and
associated output indicators) rely on quantitative measurements, while the PDO relates explicitly to
capacity building and its correlates that are difficult to quantify, such as technical knowledge, managerial
competence, group mobilization and governance. The lack of clear correspondence between objectives
and indicators made it difficult for the project teams to decide how to measure progress.10 During project
preparation, reviewers had found the project indicators to be "clear and measurable" (Minutes of the
Decision Meeting, October 18, 2000), but they were difficult to use in practice. Although reviewers had
recommended a Quality at Entry (QAE) review, it was not undertaken.

35. RSSP underestimated the risks posed by actual capacity constraints on the ground. Given the
project's emphasis on capacity-building, the preparation process should have included an assessment of
capacity of stakeholders and implementing partners, including local NGOs charged with building this
capacity. During internal Bank reviews, the issue of understating the overall project risks had been
brought up on several occasions, as stated in the Minutes of the Decision Meeting on October 18, 2000:
"...the most important factors that would affect the success of Phase One have been identified as related
to technical capacities of MINAGRI to adequately oversee the implementation of the marshland
components, and the institutional capacities of local communities and other beneficiary groups to
effectively implement sub-projects".

36. The PIM did not specify how to implement the decentralized, community-driven approach
envisioned in the design. For example, under the marshland component, the PAD and PIM do not
elaborate on the structures needed at the central and local levels to implement `participatory rehabilitation
of marshlands'. When faced with capacity constraints to move ahead at the local level, the PSCU
reverted to a top-down approach based on technical studies for rehabilitation of already farmed marshes
and turnkey construction. This approach by-passed attempts to involve beneficiaries in sub-project
designs, and did little to strengthen their own decision-making processes and managerial capacities.11
Difficulties in engaging with actors needed for implementation at the local level contributed to RSSP's
poor performance and limited progress towards the PDO up until the MTR. The shift in approach was
explained by the lack of local capacities at ministerial and district levels to supervise and assist local
communities in implementing works in marshes and the lack of technical partners in the field (NGOs and
SLOs) capable of carrying out the initially planned process of working with the beneficiaries (MTR Aide
Memoire, December 21, 2006).


9 The PAD should have been revised by the TTL following negotiations of the Project to reflect the PDO as stated in
the DCA.
10 The objectives were not clear and differed across the PAD and the PIM. This proved to be equally true for the
RIF activity.

37. RSSP priorities in the selection of irrigation sites and technologies were not clearly identified,
stakeholder involvement approaches were not clearly articulated, and opportunities were missed to
develop irrigation in a cost-effective and sustainable way. To at least some degree, the operation was
constrained by the absence of a coherent strategic framework for marshland development in Rwanda.
Nevertheless, the prioritization of investment opportunities under RSSP was not always driven primarily
by cost effectiveness, and dam construction in smaller marshlands has involved high investment costs that
were not always justifiable on the basis of the value of additional agricultural production. The project
experience therefore highlights the importance of having clearly defined criteria to guide the selection of
marshlands to be rehabilitated or developed by the project.

2.2 Implementation

38. Project implementation and performance can be divided into two periods: (i) from project start up
until the MTR in February 2005, characterized by slow takeoff and poor performance; and (ii) from MTR
until project closure, when implementation accelerated and performance improved significantly. This
latter period includes the project restructuring (and the turnaround) phase that spanned almost all of 2005.

Factors that contributed to poor implementation from effectiveness to MTR

39. The poor implementation from effectiveness to the MTR can be traced to three main factors: (i)
project complexity (including the weak Results Framework and PIM); (ii) lack of Borrower capacity to
implement, and; (iii) uneven Bank supervision. This section focuses on issues related to capacity (as
Section 2.1 discussed how project complexity affected implementation).

40. For several years following effectiveness, RSSP was plagued by ineffective leadership and poor
management. The Project design assumed that PSCU would have the capacity to coordinate
implementation. PSCU was entrusted with day-to-day implementation and coordination of RSSP-funded
activities in all 11 Provinces, under the supervision of MINAGRI. Staff turnover reduced the unit's
performance. RSSP lost the first Project Coordinator in June 2002 and the second in December 2002.
The head of technical department and the M&E Officer resigned in January and May 2003 respectively.
The chief of administration and finance also resigned in May 2004, and the M&E Officer was not
replaced until February 2004. Long delays in recruitment of replacements further delayed the real start of
implementation. At the time of the MTR, actual implementation was just beginning. Turnover of staff
was due in part to the absence of a clear vision of the project's goals. Moreover, although salaries were
comparable to those earned by other project staff in Rwanda, RSSP staff had contracts of only one year
duration subject to extension.

41. RSSP had limited field presence. The PSCU, with its limited staff, reviewed and approved all
subproject proposals submitted by local administrations and/or community groups. Given the huge
volume of submitted subprojects, the PSCU had difficulty reviewing them adequately and promptly. In
addition, given the limited capacity for subproject preparation, especially at the field level, staff devoted
time to explaining to Beneficiary/Partner Agencies (BPA) how to prepare subprojects according to the
required format. Sometimes staff did the actual preparation in lieu of BPAs. Moreover, in some cases
staff needed to go to the specific sites to ensure that the subproject description coincided with realities in
the field. Efforts to compensate for weakness at the local level distracted from the coordinating function
needed at the central level. The workload of the Project Coordinator increased to encompass supervision
of the technical and administrative functions of the PSCU.




                                                        9

42. The Program Advisory Committee (PAC) was weak and ineffective in the early period.
The PAC, headed by the Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources was intended to be a multi-
sectoral advisory group providing strategic guidance and technical oversight to the supervising ministry
and the project team. The PAC was not active until a few months before the MTR, however, and its roles
and functions appear to have been misunderstood, even by its membership. Thus, the project team did not
benefit from the strategic direction and oversight that an active advisory organ should have provided.

43. The Ministry's involvement (through the PAC) in sub-project evaluation and approval led to
delays. Due to past experiences with procurement problems involving other projects, the Ministry
insisted on reviewing and signing contracts to ensure transparency. The deliberations on review of
contracts did not take place as frequently as needed, and many subprojects experienced long delays in
approval. For example, in 2003 approvals of contracts were delayed by a year when the Committee held
no meeting. Some members of the PAC were of the opinion that PAC would have been more effective if
it was chaired either by the Secretary General of MINAGRI or the Secretary General of MINALOC.12
Furthermore, local structures such as the Community Development Committees (CDCs), which were
intended to review and approve sub-projects, did not do so. Opportunities for partnership with third
parties to carry out the actual implementation function at the local level were acted upon only several
years into the project. Thus, the observed capacity deficits at all levels of the Government remained a
serious implementation challenge.

44. Several procurement issues hampered smooth operation of the procurement unit at PSCU
during the early period: (i) failure to submit annual procurement plans to the Bank; (ii)
unresponsiveness to and failure to follow-up on the recommendations of the procurement specialist; (iii)
lateness in involving the World Bank Kigali Procurement Office in the processing of the requests; (iv)
lack of proper work programming and planning of demand-driven subprojects, which made it difficult to
monitor and keep plans of the approved subprojects on track; and (v) delays in implementation of the
studies, which in turn threw procurement plans off track. A procurement consultant was recruited to
review RSSP procurement operations and management system. His draft report, which would have
enabled the implementation of planned activities, was not reviewed by the PSCU management team for
over four months.

45. M&E suffered from the PSCU staffing difficulties. Until the MTR, the PSCU was not organized
adequately to undertake the needed M&E function The Project took nine months to replace the head of
the M&E unit. While M&E functions were outlined reasonably clearly in the project design, lack of
action during the first stage of implementation impeded performance.

46. Bank supervision was uneven during this period. Proper Bank supervision of the RIF would have
permitted an early detection of problems. World Bank turnaround times for no objections were lengthy,
and the project did not receive sufficient guidance from the World Bank to carry out M&E activities in an
effective manner.

Project restructuring

47. Following the MTR the project was simplified in two stages (Section 1.6). The restructuring left the
PDO unchanged, but simplified the project design to enhance its link to the PRSP and to improve
performance. This resulted in a results framework and design better linked to the PDO and more relevant
to measure enhancements in institutional and technical capacity, especially in the sustainable

development of marshland and hillsides. The final design consisted of one technical component plus the
project management component, and it included an additional PDO indicator to better align the results
framework with the development objective.

Positive factors in project implementation following the MTR

48. The simpler design sharpened the Project focus on activities tied directly to the PDO and made
it easier for the Government and Bank teams to understand the Project's goals. Reducing the
number of components created adequate conditions for satisfactory implementation and allowed the
project to focus on a core set of activities that could be performed well.

49. Positive changes in project leadership. GoR appointed two skilled and dynamic project
coordinators. There was also a change in the working relationship between the Project management and
the Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources, enhancing effective collaboration.

50. The project shifted successfully to emphasize the community driven approach, as initially
envisaged. RSSP increased field presence and removed capacity constraints at PSCU through
improvements in the number and quality of staff of the PSCU, better training, and the establishment of
core teams charged with performing the implementation and coordination function in all the participating
provinces. Following the MTR, the project recruited one rural engineer for the central level and six
others for provinces with high marshland potential development. Project capacity was strengthened, and
management and M&E teams were put in place in all 12 provinces (11 plus Kigali) to improve the impact
on implementation.

51. Provision of more and better training to private sector service providers, and strengthening of
capacity for marshland development. NGOs increased their capacity to help in beneficiary
sensitization, and in training on organization and management skills, and technical support in
rehabilitating marshlands. This was sufficient to train communities to rehabilitate surrounding
marshlands. Also, consulting firms gained the capacity to prepare technical designs which were
consistent with agreed guidelines. The increased involvement of third parties in project implementation
helped to reorient the project towards a decentralized implementation approach.

52. Strengthening of the procurement function to allow more efficient and faster contracting of
goods and services, and a strengthening of the financial management function to allow more efficient
and faster disbursement (see Section 2.4).

53. The Bank strengthened supervision teams and increased the level of implementation support
provided to Project management (Section 5.1).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

54. The Project's M&E function was weak throughout much of implementation. The poor Results
Framework (RF) reduced the effectiveness of the M&E system. The RF was overly ambitious and
included an unusually large number of performance indicators, some of which were not clearly defined.
The absence of baselines made assessment of progress difficult. The link between the PDO and some of
the indicators was weak, as it did not relate explicitly to RSSP's key objective: to enhance institutional
and technical capacities of farmers, other private sector operator groups and the relevant government
institutions. In addition, the mechanism set up at the beginning of RSSP to monitor and evaluate activities
was too weak for a complex operation with many components. Effective M&E required data from the
local level, and the system was adversely affected by the late emphasis on decentralization.



                                                       11

55. The M&E effort also suffered from a high turnover of TTLs within the World Bank during the life of
the project (four TTLs). This turnover mirrored that within the PSCU, and the combination reduced the
continuity in monitoring progress. The M&E officer position stayed vacant for almost a year in 2003-
2004. Furthermore, from 2001- 2005, RSSP did not receive sufficient guidance from the Bank or GoR to
support the PSCU in acquiring necessary tools and guides to carry out M&E. As a result, the project's
M&E system became operational only in 2004. The lack of an effective M&E system until late in RSSP's
life was particularly an issue for an APL, where monitoring the achievement of triggers is important. The
deficiencies of the M&E system had a significant impact on the Rural Investment Fund as well.

56. Over time, the M&E Unit developed a workable process for collecting data and was able to track and
report on output and outcome indicators. However, data were not collected regularly on all performance
indicators, particularly higher-level outcome indicators. The M&E system was overly dependent on the
M&E Unit Head to ensure the collection, processing, and timely dissemination of data, and had
insufficient back-up capacity. The reports generated by the M&E Unit were not structured in a way that
facilitated management in decision-making, and emphasis was instead put on producing reports for other
actors such as MINAGRI, MINECOFIN, and CEPEX, all of whom required their own type of reporting.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
57. The project correctly identified and prepared the two environmental safeguard policies triggered at
the time of project preparation: OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) and OP/BP 4.09 (Pest
Management). This led to the appropriate preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) instrument.
The EA contained an environmental and social screening tool for investments that was integrated into the
review of the funding requests emanating from communities and other project beneficiaries. During
project implementation, the Environmental Specialist on the team recommended that OP 4.04 (Natural
Habitats) be triggered as well, although no additional response measures were needed, because the
response measures called for under OP 4.04 were effectively covered under the existing EA.

58. To mitigate the potential environmental impact of increased pesticide use, and in compliance with the
triggered pest management policy, RSSP1 prepared an extensive Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan
that called for training of some 2,000 to 2,500 farmers using the "farmer-based extension" approach. The
ICR mission found that RSSP1 had a competent Environmental Officer and had developed excellent
relations with the Rwanda Environmental Management Authority.

59. The Bank's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) was introduced in 2003. In 2006, it became
evident that in some of the marshlands being developed by RSSP1, a small number of people were being
negatively affected, mainly through displacement from agricultural land or loss of access to watering
points for livestock. A specially commissioned study determined that these people were adequately
compensated according to Rwandan law and customary procedures--mainly through payments in cash or
in kind, and/or through allocation of plots in irrigated areas. To ensure that resource access issues would
be handled more systematically and that Bank safeguards standards would be satisfied, OP 4.12 was
triggered. Accordingly, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared and disclosed in January
2008. The RPF sets the guidelines for the resettlement plans that would have to be prepared for any sub-
project that triggers OP 4.12. In hindsight, the Bank team was slow to act, and should have informed the
Government of the policy earlier. The policy has now been fully integrated in the current phase.

Financial Management
60. The Project Financial Management Unit (FMU) performed poorly at the beginning of the project. In
the absence of a well-designed operational manual, financial management posed a bottleneck, as reflected
in low levels of disbursements. The project FMU was inadequately staffed, leading to lack of preparation


                                                      12

of timely financial reports. With the restructuring in 2006 this situation was remedied, and thereafter, the
PSCU FMU performed well. The FMU was adequately staffed with the recruitment of a Chief Financial
Officer and an accountant and has continued to submit regular Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), prepared
in a format that complied with Bank guidelines. The IFRs were submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis
and reviewed. Annual audit reports conducted in accordance with international standards in auditing were
submitted to the Bank within six months following the end of each financial year. Although the project
suffered from poor quality audit attributed to a weak audit environment prevailing in the country, these
shortcomings were addressed with the intervention of the Bank's review of the same. Project
disbursement has been satisfactory, with 95.4 percent of IDA funds disbursed as of the closing date. GoR
has demonstrated its support by providing twice as much counterpart funding as planned.

Procurement
61. Limited familiarity with procurement procedures initially slowed implementation. Procurement
suffered from the lack of trained staff and their poor familiarity with procurement rules and procedures.
Following restructuring, the procurement unit was strengthened at the PSCU level and in the provinces
with the recruitment of additional staff trained in the Bank's procurement procedures. A record
management system was established and implemented, the annual action plan and procurement plan were
shared among the implementing agencies, and simplified procurement documents were disseminated to
beneficiaries in several workshops. These measures enhanced implementation and contributed to its
satisfactory conclusion.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

62. As foreseen in the PAD, a follow-on APL2 operation was prepared to continue the program of
activities initiated under Phase I. The Second Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP2) was approved by the
Board on June 24, 2008 and became effective on October 21, 2008. During the transition period between
the two phases of the APL, marshlands and hillsides development work and associated capacity
strengthening activities were scaled back, and the PSCU concentrated on updating project implementation
systems, developing work plans, initiating procurement activities, and making staffing changes as called
for in the RSSP2 implementation plan. These activities served to preserve the institutional capacity of the
PSCU and position it for a rapid start to RSSP2, and were financed partly with the help of the RSSP2
Project Preparation Fund and partly with funds provided by the Government of Rwanda.


                                    3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

63. The project's objectives are relevant to the Government's priorities under the second PRSP (the
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy, EDPRS, 2008-12), which include increasing
areas of reclaimed marshland and those under irrigation, agricultural intensification, empowering farmer
cooperatives, and improving post-harvest infrastructure. The revised result framework is well aligned to
the PDO and relevant to measuring improvements in institutional and technical capacity, especially in the
sustained development of marshlands and hillsides. GoR had to start from a very low base after the
conflict in the mid 1990s to rebuild the institutional and technical capacity needed to support productive
activities in the rural areas; much remains to be done, and RSSP is assisting. RSSP's operational
mechanism is consistent with GoR's decentralized rural development strategy, with implementation
functions of PSCU now being performed at the Provincial and District level as envisioned in the original
design. RSSP1 makes a vital contribution and remains very relevant to achieving country and Bank
objectives as expressed in the Africa Action Plan, the Rural Sector Strategy (Strategic Plan for the
Transformation of Agriculture (SPAT), 2008), and the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Rwanda.


                                                      13

64. The program is a three-phase APL, with flexibility to support a long-term development strategy, that
transitions from one phase to the next after meeting performance benchmarks, or triggers. The
incremental approach reduces risk and raises the likelihood of successful outcome, as later projects can be
designed based on lessons learned and results achieved from the earlier ones.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

65. The project has largely achieved its development objective. An impact assessment completed in 2008
evaluates RSSP1's achievements at two levels: (i) at the level of all the indicators specified under Phase I,
i.e. the four PDO outcome indicators, eight intermediate level indicators, and trigger indicators to be
reached by end of Phase I; and (ii) at a level beyond the PDO outcome indicators, for example, at a
higher-order program impact level.13

66. At the PDO level, RSSP met the four PDO indicators and exceeded target values for the eight
intermediate indicators (see Annex 2). The project has increased the capacity to deliver research and
extension services, and enhanced the capacity of farmers' associations, cooperatives, and government
institutions. The impact assessment examines the process of capacity enhancement of participating
farmers (farmers' associations and cooperatives collectively called "Amashyirahamwe"). The
associations were RSSP's main entry point for building a strong interface with beneficiary communities
and for creating ownership and sustainability of interventions. Most RSSP subprojects have been
implemented through demand-driven farmer associations working closely with local administrations.

67. At the Program level, a quantitative household survey shows a number of achievements and
positive impacts in areas such as agricultural production, food security, innovations in processing and
marketing, infrastructure and the socio-economic status of households, listed below:

Program-level outcomes

· Direct beneficiaries earn more from off-farm work and save more than do the comparators. While 7.8
     percent of direct beneficiaries work exclusively on their farm holdings, this figure rises to 27.3
     percent for indirect and 46.5 percent for non beneficiaries. Off-farm employment is very important in
     Rwanda, where land is very constrained. These results suggest that RSSP has succeeded in its
     objective to introduce more efficient farming methods and to enable farmers to augment earnings off
     the farm. Forty percent of direct as compared to 24 percent of indirect and 23.5 percent of non
     beneficiaries have been able to save;

· The value of their hillside and marshland farms has increased considerably since the inception of
     RSSP in 2001. Direct beneficiaries make more income from sales of crops and incur lower production
     costs. The market value of the crops they consume themselves (auto-consumption) and the number of
     months they can live from their own production surpass the values of indirect and non beneficiaries
     significantly. Direct beneficiaries thus need to spend less on purchased food and therefore have
     higher food security at the household level;

· Direct beneficiaries live in better houses and own more assets than nonbeneficiaries. More direct
     beneficiaries reported having a home with external walls, roof, and constructed floor;



13Performance Indicator Update and Impact Assessment, Final Report, Vol. 2, June, 2008. The assessment uses
two-stage random sampling procedures, and also looks at the findings to the RSSP Baseline Study (BRSS, 2002) to
compare the project's impact on direct, indirect and non-beneficiaries (control groups).


                                                         14

· Direct beneficiaries are very satisfied with infrastructure provided under RSSP (marshland
    rehabilitation, markets, drying & storage facilities, roads), and RSSP's impact on their livelihoods.
    Beneficiaries report awareness of and appreciation for environmental protection (improvement of the
    land, soil and water management, erosion control on hillsides, sanitary drainage of marshlands), and
    the better knowledge of innovative technologies for crop production, processing and marketing; and

· Beneficiaries indicate higher capacity to pay for school fees, to cover health costs and to employ local
    labour than do comparators.

Project Key Performance Indicators

68. The revised results framework lists four PDO outcome indicators, and all have been largely met. For
output achievements by component, and intermediate indicators, see Appendix 4 of Annex 2.

PDO indicator #1: The marshland/hill-side and export crop farmers have been trained in new and
improved cropping technologies, including integrated pest management.14

69. The project enhanced capacity to deliver research and extension services, and effectively enhanced
capacity of farmers' associations and cooperatives and government institutions. RSSP strengthened the
capacity of FASDOs in hillside protection and management with 5,365 FASDOs trained. The impact
assessment field survey (2008) underlined that 75 percent of FASDOs were trained in agro-forestry
measures, 16.2 percent in terracing and 11.7 percent in soil protection. A total of 6,832 FASDOs lead
farmers were trained in better management of their crops, input use and IPM practices (4,166 men, 2,666
women)--almost 10 times more than the agreed target. The farmers' training covered 14 topics (indicated
in Annex 2), which were prepared by the MINAGRI. More outputs in terms of training and the setting up
of CETSEs are detailed in Annex 2. Overall, achievements were considerably higher than the baselines
and well above the set targets.

70. Impact of training was found mostly in the area of marshland rehabilitation and to a lesser degree in
extension activities. A lesser impact was seen in the processing or commercialisation of crops15.
Recipients of RSSP training (58.4 percent of direct beneficiaries (FASDO members) as compared to 18.5
percent of indirect beneficiaries and 6.7 percent of non beneficiaries) adopted improved production
techniques, including irrigation, new cropping patterns, and agro forestry practices.

71. The positive effects of RSSP training can best be seen in the adoption of improved techniques, such
as for rice cultivation in newly developed irrigated marshland schemes. As the survey found, 121,366
direct RSSP beneficiary farmers (73.8 percent of the total of 164,453 FASDO members at time of
inception), reported an increase of over 50 percent of their rice production during last 2 seasons. Some of
the previously created coops reported rice yields between 2.5 and 3.5 t/ha. The newly created
Kanyonyomba irrigated rice scheme in Gatsibo district (460 ha, since 03/2007) reported initial yields of 4
t/ha at the time of the study in February, 2008.


PDO indicator #2: The quantities of fertilizers used per capita and per hectare among beneficiary
farmers are 50 percent higher than the baseline.



14At MTR, the original indicator, "farmers have adopted" was changed to "farmers have been trained in".
15Fertilizer use ranked first with 47.6 percent, followed by seed production with 42 percent; IPM was the next one
with 35 percent, followed by post harvest techniques with 13 percent. Agricultural mechanization and
commercialisation/ marketing played virtually no role with 0.3 percent and 5.7 percent.


                                                          15

72. The proportion of farmers reporting use of fertilizer has risen to 53.3 percent among direct
beneficiaries, 21.5 percent of indirect and 10.8 percent of non beneficiaries. Fertilizer use has increased
from 2.8 kg/hh to 3.3 kg per household (17.8 percent), and from 2.6 kg/ha to 4.95 kg/ha (90 percent)16.
44.7 percent of direct beneficiaries reported an increase in fertilizer use of between 30 and 50 percent.
Indirect beneficiaries also appeared to have increased fertilizer use, with 55 percent reporting increases of
less than 30 percent.17 Marshland farm plots are in most cases 0.05 ha in size (by average) as they are
distributed as additional new plots to existing hillside farms of beneficiaries. For this reason, fertilizer use
calculated per ha reaches a larger amount as it is based on fertilizer use applied on a relatively small plot.
On the larger hillside plots (0.81 ha) where fertilizer is used, it is not necessarily on all the area but only
on selected parcels for certain value crops. For more detailed results, the survey indicates that in-depth
farming systems research would be needed, and the authors report simply a calculation of averages.

73. Over three-quarters of direct beneficiaries reported that they changed their cropping patterns,
compared to 30.3 percent for indirect and 17.8 percent for non beneficiaries.

PDO indicator #3: Quantities and shares of marketed crop output per household among beneficiary
farmers are 50 percent higher than the baseline.

74. Direct beneficiaries reported increased sales to markets of 50.4 percent, compared to 8.8 percent
increase by indirect beneficiaries and 14.8 percent increase by non beneficiaries. Marketed crop output
for direct beneficiaries per household (kg/per capita) was assessed as being well above the baseline in
2001.

75. The value of harvest for hillside farmers was reported to be FRW 277,986 for direct beneficiaries,
followed by non beneficiaries (FRW 242,966) and indirect beneficiaries (FRW 211,402). Farmers
recalled the estimated value of their harvest before RSSP as being FRW 42,718. Marshland farmers
reported harvest value of 58,597 FRW for direct beneficiaries (34 percent), FRW 38,677 for indirect, and
FRW 2,114 for non-beneficiaries.

76. In addition, with the construction of markets, farmers now have access to better selling places; more
people are attending the markets, which now offer better produce in quality and quantity, and more
tempting prices.

PDO Indicator #4: Farmers' associations and rural commercial enterprises are effectively
managing their finances, production, infrastructure maintenance, and marketing.


16Increases are from baseline data collected in 2001, to data collected in 2008.
17Per capita usage could be calculated using Rwanda's average rural family size of five. The Survey, however,
states that it makes more sense to calculate fertilizer use on a per household/ farm level per ha than per capita.


                                                            16

77. This indicator was added to the revised results framework of October 31, 2006.18 Progress as of June
30, 2008 is as follows: 28 CETSEs were managing their businesses efficiently; 44 private sector
operators from 22 CETSEs have been trained in construction and maintenance of post-harvest
infrastructure and equipment; 23 markets management committees are in place and trained in
management and maintenance of marshland infrastructures; and 3 road maintenance committees, 55 post
harvest management committees, and 47 committees have been trained in the management and
maintenance of their facilities.

78. The sub-projects financed under RSSP1 were identified through a demand-driven process, and were
extremely diverse. Producer associations, local community groups, and district governments submitted
proposals for a wide range of sub-projects, most of which included financing of productive assets
(agricultural machinery, processing equipment, packaging equipment) or small-scale rural infrastructure
(production facilities, commodity drying and storage facilities, rural markets, feeder roads, bridges), along
with capacity strengthening activities. No sub-project proposal financed by RSSP1 was approved unless it
included a detailed management plan specifying the measures that would be taken to ensure proper
maintenance of assets funded. Typically, these measures included the formation of a management
committee empowered to take decisions concerning the use of the asset and to levy user fees for operation
and maintenance. Project staff, service providers contracted by the PSCU, and/or District officials
provided support to these management committees. Due to the diverse nature of the sub-projects, no
comprehensive attempt was made to assess the performance of the management arrangements. However,
throughout implementation, a representative sample of Project-supported sub-projects was visited during
the course of every supervision mission, and the management committees were generally found to be
performing well. In the relatively few cases where the management arrangements were found to be
unsatisfactory, the supervision team worked with project management to find a solution to the problem.

3.3 Efficiency

79. The Net Present Value (NPV) and Economic Rate of Return (ERR) at completion are lower than
those calculated at appraisal, although the NPV remains positive and the ERR remains well above the
social cost of capital (Annex 3). Four factors explain the lower NPV at completion: (i) the higher unit
cost of irrigation investments; (ii) a significant reduction in irrigated land area under the project compared
to that assumed at appraisal; (iii) higher actual O&M expenses; and (iv) a major change in the expected
crop patterns under the project. From the farmer perspective, fluctuations in rice prices and yields
determine the future financial NPV. A reduction of either price or yield by 17 percent reverses the NPV.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

80. All outcome indicators in the PAD are met or exceeded, and thus the PDO is considered to be
achieved. The Project contributed to developing institutional and technical capacity of the rural
communities, and to production and maintenance of productive assets. RSSP contributed to
implementation of the decentralized strategy for rural development and agricultural growth. The Project
therefore remains very relevant to achieving the country objectives.

81. GoR's strong commitment to the RSSP series has been amply demonstrated. GoR persevered with
RSSP 1 even though project performance was poor in the first few years. The Government supported the
mid-term restructuring and appointed a strong new management team that proved instrumental in turning
the project around. GoR has also contributed over US$2 million, when the DCA for RSSP called for a
counterpart contribution of US$1 million equivalent.

                                                       17

82. GoR is also determined to see the RSSP activities continued in Phase II. During RSSP2 preparation,
GoR emphasized its desire to ensure that the capacity developed within the PSCU to plan and implement
irrigation schemes be preserved and absorbed into MINAGRI. This commitment is likely to ensure
further realization of the project's development outcome. The satisfactory rating reflects the relevance of
the project, achievement of the main project outcomes, and the expected continuation of support.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development
83. The project contributed to reducing poverty through increased incomes, improved food security at the
household level, and empowerment of FASDOs, CETSEs, and local governments. The quantitative
household survey conducted showed improved living conditions for beneficiaries, as seen in income
increases, capacity to pay for school fees, and health costs.

84. Women significantly benefited from the project activities, particularly training. Among the 6,832 lead
farmers trained in improved management of their crops, inputs use and IPM practices, 39 percent were
women. The project also trained 200,134 members of FASDOs to participate in service delivery, among
which almost 47 percent were women.

(b) Institutional change/strengthening
85. During the course of project implementation, and especially following the mid-term restructuring,
considerable capacity was developed within the PSCU. Today the unit is particularly strong in the areas
of: (i) marshlands development; (ii) hillsides development; (iii) agricultural intensification; and (iv)
strengthening capacity among producer organizations and cooperatives. GoR views the PSCU as a model
PIU, and has made it clear that it would like the PSCU to lead the way in adopting the new procedures
that GoR would like to put in place for all donor-funded projects.

(c) Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative) ­
86. The enormous popularity of the RIF highlighted the problem of lack of access to rural finance and
increased interest within Government in strengthening rural financial institutions.

87. There were a number of unintended positive impacts on community members who were not direct
RSSP project beneficiaries, but who reported on positive externalities due to RSSP1. In May 2008, the
Rwanda-based ICR team and project staff performed a series of participatory rural appraisal (PRA)
activities with non-direct beneficiaries of the project. In particular, a community mapping exercise was
completed, after which the ICR team took them through an exercise of identifying those mapped items
that appeared or were modified after the RSSP activity took place in their community. In the discussion
that ensued, many ancillary benefits became apparent at all four sites where the PRA activity was
conducted (see Annex 5) of positive impacts attributed to RSSP. Even though the RSSP activity in their
community did not take place directly with them, they attributed the following unintended impacts to
RSSP:

· Promote local business development. In addition to the (direct) benefits of RSSP covered market
    place construction (such as better prices, more comfortable market days, greater clientele to market,
    etc.), the community noted the rise of restaurants, small shops and other businesses around the
    marketplace itself, which has provided diversification in employment in the wider community.

· Rural finance. Greater returns to market vendors (an intended direct impact) led to the opening of a
    greater number of bank accounts, which has prompted at least one bank (Banque Populaire du



                                                      18

     Rwanda) to open new branches, thereby better serving the community. The marketplace provided a
     growing clientele, leading to the voluntary formation of informal savings schemes.

· Livelihoods and welfare. The development of marshlands has improved opportunities for agricultural
     labor for non-direct beneficiaries and community members reported a greater variety in their diet as
     rice was now locally available.

· Community organization. At one site in Burera District, the formation of a market committee for
     RSSP constructed market places led directly to the (unintended) formation of other community
     associations (girisuku). These, in turn, led to the demand and construction of a community health
     center, secondary school, potato warehouse, seed multiplication activities and the formation of a
     Local Business Association.

3.6 Summary of findings of beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops
88. There are two sources of beneficiary impact information: an Impact Assessment covering five
provinces and 30 districts (footnote 17); and a Participatory Rural Appraisal conducted with four RSSP
beneficiary communities. Annex 5 summarizes these quantitative and qualitative surveys.


                     4. ASSESSMENT OF RIST AND DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
Rating: Low

89. Risks to development outcome and sustainability of project achievements are assessed against
institutional, economic/financial, environmental, and social criteria.

90. Overall, risk to the development outcome is evaluated as low, given: (i) the high ownership of RSSP1
at all institutional levels (by GoR and by beneficiaries through their organizations); (ii) the low financial
risks linked to sustainability of the different investments; (iii) the modest environmental impacts
associated with Project-supported marshlands/hillsides development activities (that could interact with
environmental impacts of other projects and programs to generate more significant environmental impacts
at the global level); and (iv) the high social significance of Project-supported activities.

91. The institutional risk to development outcome is low. During Phase I, RSSP1 was able to build
institutional capacity to support the GoR's decentralized rural development program in general and
MINAGRI's marshlands development program in particular. Project activities are entirely consistent
with the priorities identified in the Government's PSTA, and the project's main performance indicators
are completely aligned with the Government's performance indicators for the sector. Furthermore,
Project-supported activities have been incorporated into the District Development Plans, which further
minimizes institutional risk to the development outcome.

92. The economic and financial risk to development outcome is low. At appraisal, eight major risks were
identified that could jeopardize achievement of outcomes. Of these, three were identified as significant:
(i) lack of security of land tenure leading to unwillingness of farmers to invest in marshlands production
activities; (ii) lack of trust between farmers and local officials relating to use of marshlands; and (iii)
unwillingness of farmers and entrepreneurs to take up new technologies. None of these threats
materialized during implementation. Although security of land tenure remains a controversial issue in
Rwanda, generally, farmers have shown no reluctance to work in the marshlands and hillsides sites
developed under RSSP. Similarly, they have shown no reluctance to adopt the improved production
technologies being introduced under the project, although lack of access to improved inputs such as seed
and fertilizer continues to be a problem.



                                                       19

93. Sub-projects financed under the Project were demand driven, well-targeted, and inexpensive. Cost-
Benefit analysis shows that Project-supported investments in productive assets have generated high
positive returns, and investments in small-scale rural infrastructure (whose economic benefits are more
difficult to quantify) have been highly appreciated.

94. The environmental risk to development outcome is moderate. According to the environmental and
social assessment, RSSP1 was rated as a category `B' project. Two environmental safeguard policies
were triggered. Although individual project activities and selected sub-projects have only negligible
environmental effects, it is possible that the cumulative impact of Project-supported activities in
combination with activities being financed through other projects and programs could have a combined
adverse effect on the environment. Currently there appears to be no process for monitoring at the national
level the environmental impacts of marshlands and hillsides development activities.

95. The social risk to development outcome is low. RSSP has played a key role in creating social capital
in its intervention areas, and due to the strong participation of women in Project-financed activities, it has
been instrumental in mainstreaming gender and social equity in the local development agenda.


                  5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory
96. The Bank team worked closely with the client to develop a relevant project to build capacity to
revitalize Rwanda's rural economy. The Bank should have performed significantly better in terms of
designing a less complex project, in recognizing the Borrower's limited implementation capacity, in
formulating a clear Results Framework, and in defining relevant and measurable performance indicators.
These shortcomings and the lack of an appropriate mechanism to implement a community-driven
decentralized project were significant weaknesses that hindered implementation success.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
97. The Bank's supervision performance was mixed. On the one hand, the Bank was very proactive in
calling the project `unsatisfactory' within the first year and in bringing the poor performance to the
attention of high officials. The team gave good input into the resulting six-month Action Plan to improve
performance. The Bank's Sectoral management joined the mission and encouraged the TTLs to rate the
project candidly, which they did. However, these efforts seemed to have little impact on speeding up
implementation during the first 2-3 years when RSSP was not moving at all. The MTR Assessment
completed in August 2004 points to a lack of progress in almost all sub-components. The MTR was
concluded on February 12, 2005, however, it took some time to agree on and implement the 6-month
Action Plan. Hence, the DCA was submitted for amendment only on December 20, 2005. In addition,
there were delays in the issuance of Bank no objections.

98. Supervision improved significantly following the MTR and the subsequent simplification of project
design. Bank supervision teams were strengthened, and the level of implementation support provided to
Project management increased. Technical specialists from FAO were brought in to support the irrigation
development and capacity strengthening activities of Component 1. A Bank Environmental Specialist
was recruited into the supervision team to provide guidance on the implementation of environmental and
social safeguards policies. A Bank M&E Specialist was brought in from Johannesburg to review the


                                                       20

results framework and organize informal training workshops for the Project M&E team. A Bank
Procurement Specialist in Washington was enlisted to support the Bank Procurement Specialist in the
Rwanda Country Office, and a Bank Financial Management Specialist who had just been posted to the
Rwanda country office joined the team and was able to provide much more immediate support to the
Project accounting unit. The time for no objection turn around significantly decreased, and the project
began to disburse rapidly. Annex 4 shows that the annual supervision costs picked up in 2005. The
strengthened supervision allowed the Bank team to spend more time supporting implementation, as
opposed to simply supervising. These proactive steps significantly increased the implementation support
provided to Project management, and were a major factor in contributing to the turnaround of the Project
following the MTR.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
99. Overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. This rating reflects poor quality at
entry, and initially weak but later exceptionally strong quality of supervision. Despite clear weaknesses
in the project design and an inability to address early implementation bottlenecks, the Bank should be
credited for having recognized the problem and taken proactive measures to remedy the situation.
Following interventions by Sectoral Management, a strengthened supervision team was appointed and
empowered to take the necessary actions to overcome the problems that up until then had been slowing
implementation. In the wake of the MTR, the Bank provided strong and continuous implementation
support that unquestionably contributed to the impressive record of achievement during the final years of
the project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
100. Government performance was mixed. During the early years following implementation, when the
Project was not moving, Government did little to address the root causes of the problem. Competing
factions within Government jockeyed for control of donor-funded projects, including RSSP, resulting in a
state of paralysis as no single faction was able to prevail. The situation changed following the MTR,
when changes in the Cabinet and at the top of the Ministry of Agriculture put in place a team that was
strongly committed to the marshlands development agenda and determined to see the Project turn around.
From that time on, the Project received strong support from Government, as evidenced by the
appointment of a series of capable and dynamic Project Coordinators, provision of additional counterpart
funds and supporting services to sustain project activities, and repeated public declarations of support
made by the Minister of Agriculture and other senior officials.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
101. The rating of satisfactory for the implementing agency results from an unsatisfactory rating in the
early part of the operation's life, and a highly satisfactory performance in the latter part. Before the MTR,
frequent staff turnover, procurement issues, and poor leadership resulting in extended vacancies in key
posts made for poor PSCU performance. With the appointment of stronger leadership in the PSCU
coordinator, the performance of the implementing agency improved dramatically, to the extent that the
RSSP 1 implementing agency was considered the `model PIU' for the Ministry. For example, when the
MoF wished to pilot new project software, RSSP PSCU was nominated as one of the first candidates
given its strong performance across government projects. The highly satisfactory performance of the
PSCU after MTR can further be seen in the change of relationship between Project management and the
Minister of Agriculture from adversarial to collaborative; in the hiring of necessary additional PSCU
staff, many of whom were deployed to the Provincial and District level in recognition of early PSCU
failings; and in the use of unconventional contracting arrangements to secure the services of a small


                                                       21

number of key technical staff whose skills were in unusually short supply. There was an improvement in
the skills of PSCU technical staff; the provision of training to service providers, and the enhancement of
the procurement function to allow more efficient and faster contracting of goods and services.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
102. Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory. This rating reflects generally weak
performance by Government and the PSCU during the early years of Project implementation, followed by
exceptionally strong performance during the period after the MTR. The impressive turnaround
experienced by the Project, while certainly helped by the increased level of implementation support
provided by the Bank, would not have been possible without strong political and economic support from
Government, as well as a greatly improved technical performance by the PSCU. Thanks to timely
interventions by the Borrower, RSSP went from being a struggling Project on the verge of being
terminated because of poor performance to one that by the Project closing date was well known
throughout Rwanda and frequently cited by Government and beneficiaries as a model project.


                                         6. LESSONS LEARNED

103. Given the `turn-around' nature of the RSSP story, it is not surprising that the project yields a wealth
of lessons learned:

104. The importance of maintaining a tight focus on an agenda that is manageable given the
capacity constraints under which the Project operates. As initially designed and approved by the
Board, RSSP1 included seven components spanning a wide range of activities. Early implementation
experience revealed that the scope of the design was overly ambitious, and that the Government lacked
the technical and institutional capacity needed to implement such a broad array of activities. The
December 2005 restructuring successfully focused the Project on a core set of activities. Following the
restructuring, Project performance improved dramatically. The same sharp focus is being maintained
under RSSP2.

105. The need to build capacity in the PSCU to ensure effective implementation of the four
safeguards policies triggered by RSSP2, and the need for the Bank to assist the Borrower effectively
on safeguards. RSSP was in early compliance with the environmental and social safeguards triggered at
appraisal and was found to have strong environmental capacity in the PSCU, but general safeguards
capacity was found to be low. In hindsight, the Bank team was slow to act, and should have informed
GoR of the policy earlier. The policy has now been fully integrated in the current phase.

106. The importance of a consistent, coherent and straightforward M&E system clearly
articulated in the PAD, with indicators clearly connected to the PDO. Over time, the streamlining of
the results framework allowed the borrower to develop a workable process for collecting data and
reporting on output and outcome indicators, which saved the situation.

107. RIF--Much greater attention needs to be paid to accompanying development of sustainable
access to rural finance, including capacity building for PFIs and innovative product development to
replace the grants when depleted. While RIF has had a positive intended impact on promoting
productive rural investments with important employment and income externalities, the design of the RIF
did not respond to its access to finance objectives, and did not therefore result in the sustainability of rural
investments. In brief, the RIF did not require any change in the behavior, products or risk assessment
techniques of participating financial institutions (PFIs).

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
108. In their letter dated December 18, 2008, the Government commented as follows: "The report
represents a fair and balanced picture of the implementation of the first phase of the project. As
acknowledged in the report, there were undoubtedly difficulties at the outset mainly due to the complex
nature of the project that caused a three years delay in implementation. However, following the mid-term
review, we are pleased that the report recognizes that the Government, the Bank and the Project team all
worked hard and genuinely turned the project around. As a result, the project's targets were not only met
but exceeded. In addition, the wealth of lessons learnt has been incorporated in the second phase of the
project and are being built into other government project plans to improve their implementation. I
particular, we recognize that much greater attention needs to be paid to the delivery of the rural finance
facility to ensure sustainability in the long term. This is already underway and we will continue to focus
on this."

                                       ANNEX 2: OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT

The RSSP1 result framework indicators and triggers (for Phase 2) were revised at restructuring to be
consistent with the new project design. Hence, the achievements under the two new components are
measured against the revised indicators and triggers.

The RSSP team restructured the project triggers due to several inconsistencies (see Annex 2 Appendix 2).
There were inconsistencies in the PAD between the description of the triggers, the numeric values of the
triggers in the text, and the numeric values in the triggers table. Besides, numeric values for some triggers
were not defined and baseline values for some triggers were never established, which might have resulted
in some triggers not being monitored consistently during implementation.

The RSSP team rationalized the project M&E indicators (see Annex 2 Appendix 3). Several performance
indicators were not clearly defined, making them difficult to measure, and the absence of baselines made
assessment of progress difficult in some cases. Following restructuring, indicators had also to be updated
to be in line with the rationalized components.

RSSP1 Triggers

The project achieved all triggers for which baselines were established, with the exception of two triggers
on coffee and tea export promotion activities that were de-emphasized following focus these areas by
other donor-funded projects. Progress cannot be reported against two triggers (numbers of people
employed off-farm, and income generated by off-farm activities) because no baselines were established.

RSSP1 Outputs by Component and Output Indicators

Component 1: Marshland /Hillsides Development and Export Diversification
(US$47.89m) (See Appendix 3)

Achievements under this component are rated highly satisfactory.

This component aimed to build institutional and technical capacities that were needed to support
generation and adoption of efficient cropping and post-harvest technologies. The component had three
sub-components: (i) Studies/Design and Rehabilitation/Construction of Irrigation Infrastructure; (ii)
Capacity Building and TA support to Community and partner (NGOs/SLOs) organization; and (iii)
Support to Value-Adding Rural Micro enterprise activities.

Sub component 1: Studies/Design and Rehabilitation/Construction of Irrigation Infrastructure
(US$28.76m)

Achievements under this sub- component are rated highly satisfactory, because all indicator targets have
been met or exceeded.

This is a key sub-component with about 60 percent of total financing of the restructured project. It
involved marshlands development, hillside protection and marshland studies for Phase II. It financed: (i)
engineering studies for marshland development on an additional 2000 hectares for Phase II operation; (ii)
ongoing marshland engineering works; (iii) construction and rehabilitation of hillside NRM conservation
infrastructure to support and protect neighboring marshlands; and (iv) contracted services for regular
professional maintenance and operations of the installed irrigation infrastructure in Provinces with
marshland activities.

Three key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
(i) engineering studies completed for development of 2,000 ha of marshland during RSSP2;
(ii) rehabilitation/development of 2,500 ha of farmed marshlands; and
(iii) protection (through tree planting) of at least 7,500 ha of hillsides surrounding the marshlands under
rehabilitation.

All three indicators have been met and exceeded.
Indicator (i): The project succeeded to complete 1,804 ha of marshland studies with 1,845 ha ongoing
studies. These studies consisted of technical and environmental assessments. This indicator will exceed its
expectations during the implementation of RSSP2, reaching 3,529 ha of marshland studies completed.
Indicator (ii): The project was successful in rehabilitating marshlands with 3,018 ha of marshlands
rehabilitation/development completed and 95 ha marshland rehabilitation/development ongoing. The
rehabilitated marshlands are being used by farmers for rice production.
Indicator (iii): The protection of 14,485 ha hillsides surrounding the marshlands under rehabilitation were
completed (almost twice the target). The protection of hillsides was achieved through planting of live
hedges, napier grass, mulching, tied ridges in order to get progressive grasses. Moreover, an innovative
agro-forestry scheme was implemented on hillside with the introduction of mango, citrus and fodder trees.

The project has also had other positive impacts beyond the success of the rehabilitation of marshlands.
These include the employment of between 7,000 and 10,000 casual laborers for construction and
maintenance, access of poor farmers without plots on hillsides to newly created marshland plots and
increased cultivation areas, and increased productivity. For example in the marshlands rehabilitated
before 2007, the yield rice have increased from 3.8t/ha in 2006 to 6.1t/ha due to better water availability

and management, increased sensitization in use of modern inputs, technical backstopping, and training by
agronomists.

Subcomponent 2: Capacity Building and TA support to Community and partner (NGOs/SLOs)
organization (US$ 6.20m)

Achievements under this sub- component are rated satisfactory.

The main goal subcomponent 2 was to develop and empower community organizations for marshlands
and hillsides development and to enhance both quality and capacity in private sector delivery of the
necessary public services. These services include facilitation/intermediation services and other demand-
driven advisory services to the farmer/community organizations for marshland/hillsides development.

Eight key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
(i) at least 100 marshlands and hillsides Farmer Agriculture Service Delivery Organizations (FASDO)
have been trained in the maintenance and management of local infrastructure and hillsides investments;
(ii) men and women lead farmers from at least 700 FASDOs have been trained in the improved
management of their crops, including IPM practices;
(iii) at least 80 percent of FASDO member adopt improved practices;
(iv) at least 12 farmer owned Commercial Enterprises and Technical Support Entities (CETSE) have been
set up and overall 20 have been effectively trained in: (a) improved farming practices; (b) crop and post
harvest technologies; (c) enterprise management and marketing; and (d) operating profitably;
(v) At least 80 percent of CETSE members farmers adopt improved farming and crop and post harvest
practices received from lead farmers;
(vi) the lead research and extension institutions have been restructured and strengthened;
(vii) at least 700 FASDOs have been trained to participate in services delivery; and
(viii) at least 20 Private Agricultural Services Delivery (PASDO) have been trained to participate in
services delivery.

The project achieved substantial results in terms of enhancing capacity for the delivery of research
and extension services and met 7 out of the 8 indicators. It effectively enhanced capacity of farmers
associations and cooperatives and government institutions.
Indicator (i): The project was successful in strengthening the capacity of FASDOs in hillside protection
and management with 5,365 FASDOs trained. The impact assessment field survey (2008) underlined that
75 percent of FASDOs were trained in agro-forestry measures, 16.2 percent in terracing and 11.7 percent
in soil protection.
Indicator (ii): A total of 6,832 FASDOs lead farmers were trained in improved management of their
crops, inputs use and IPM practices (4,166 men, 2,666 women). This is almost 10 times more than the
agreed target. The farmers' training covered 14 topics19, which were prepared by the MINAGRI.
Indicator (iii): This indicator was not met, as only 58.4 percent FASDO members adopted improved
practices.
Indicators (iv) and (v): These were both successfully met as 28 farmers' owned CETSEs were set up and
trained in improved farming practices and post-harvest technologies, and they are all managing their
business effectively. There is considerable progress compared to the baseline, where 4 CETSEs existed


19Techniques of mass mobilization and sensitization, basic principles of farm management, principles of modern
farming practices, organization, functioning and management of farmer associations, management of an
association's finances and investments, preparation of small income generating projects, management and
repayment of credits, use and management of agricultural inputs, protection of soil erosion and soil management,
agro-forestry, rehabilitation and management of marshlands, modern livestock husbandry, multiplication and
distribution of improved seed, post harvest management and produce, and chemical pest control and IPM for maize.

with 544 persons having been trained in CTSEs (Baseline Survey, 2002). The impact evaluation assessed
that CETSEs had been trained effectively in crop and post harvest technologies and enterprise
management. The number of lead farmers and famers trained respectively reached 3,594 (2,181 men and
1,413 women) 83,214 farmers.
Indicator (vi): Studies to restructure the Rwandan Institute of Agronomy (ISAR) were completed and 15
ISAR scientists were trained: 2PhDs and 13 MScs. Furthermore, 8 ISAR senior scientists were hired by
RSSP, which helped the institution increase its capacity in modern research activities. It helped the
institution start new research programs such as seed selection and multiplication, pest and disease
identification and control. Research on rice and banana are in advance stages. It also helped mobilize
additional funds from other collaborative institutions and donors, thus improving ISAR's visibility at the
regional international level. The Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ISAE) was strengthened
as 120 rural engineers were trained. A total of 553 rural engineers have completed their studies.
Communities are now benefiting from the services of these engineers.
Indicator (vii): This was successfully met, with 5,365 FASDOs trained to participate in service delivery.
It covers a total of 200,134 members (106,742 men and 93,392 women).
Indicator (viii): This indicator was met with 21 PASDOs and 48 consultants trained in services delivery.

Subcomponent 3: Support to Value-Adding Rural Micro enterprise activities (US$ 12.93m)

Achievements under this sub-component are rated highly satisfactory

This is a key sub-component with about 27 percent of total financing of the restructured project. It aims
increase value-added from marshland production activities by removing infrastructure constraints on
private sector involvement in marshland development, lowering transaction costs and increasing farm
incomes by diversifying income-generating activities around marshland/hillsides and diversifying exports.
In addition, it supports the development of non-traditional exports such as macadamia nuts, passion fruits,
vanilla, castor oils and moringa. The project includes a Rural Investment Facilities (RIF), which provide
financial incentives through investment cost subsidy to qualified private sector operators (including
farmers groups) willing to invest in activities with substantial economic or environmental externalities.

Six key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
(i) at least 12 marketing facilities have been constructed and groups trained in their management;
(ii) supporting investments in small-scale rural infrastructure and transport linkages, to include at least:
(a) 10 bridges; (b) 15 stores; (c) 5 milk collection centers; (d) 10 drying areas; (e) 3 farmer training
centers and (f) 75km rural feeder roads;
(iii) alternative Means of Transport (AMT) have been pilot tested;
(iv) at least 2 private sector operators per CETSE trained in the construction and maintenance of post
harvest infrastructure and equipment by end of Phase;
(v) off-farm sector strategies and development plans have been prepared and tested in several provinces;
and
(vi) RIF 100 percent disbursed at the end of Phase 1.

RSSP1 met and/or exceeded all six indicator targets.
Indicator (i): 23 marketing facilities were completed including a slaughterhouse, with 23 management
committees for markets in place and trained. In addition the study for Kigali city market was completed.
With the construction of markets, farmers now have access to better selling places; more people are
attending market-days, which now offer better produce (in quality and quantity) and more alluring prices.
Sanitation conditions have improved thanks to toilet and water tank facilities built in all the markets. In
addition, because of the high visibility of market infrastructures and sellers it is now easy for local
governments to collect taxes.



                                                      28

Indicator (ii): Investments in small-scale rural infrastructure and transport linkages exceeded agreed
targets. The project completed 24 bridges (with 18 bridges studies completed) and 40 km of feeder roads
(with 8 km ongoing and 37km of studies completed). With regard to post-harvest infrastructures, the
project supported the realization of 60 storage structures with 10 under construction, 10 milk collection
centers and 108 drying areas (with 17 on-going). The project completed 2 farmer training centers, 1
agriculture show ground, 1 study for national agriculture show training center and 3 greenhouses. The
construction of drying areas exceeded the target ten fold, as rice growers always need drying grounds as
most farmers harvest around the same time and demand for drying is at peak at the same time.
Indicator (iii): This was successfully achieved. Alternative means of transport were pilot tested by 2
cooperatives and are functional. It included the purchase and training of 15 donkeys in Ruhengeri, where
machines to prepare carts were also installed. In Twuzuzanye, 20 oxen were purchased with 10 pull carts.
Indicator (iv): The fourth indicator exceeded agreed targets as 44 private sector operators from 22
CETSEs have been trained in construction and maintenance of post-harvest infrastructure and equipment.
Indicator (v): The project supported 14 off-farm sub-projects (6,509 people) with 2 rocket stove projects,
6 hand craft projects, 1 envelop making project, 1 candle and soap making project, 1 food processing
project, 1 food drying project and sericulture project.
Indicator (vi): IDA funds allocated to RIF were completely disbursed.

The RIF is described in Annex 2 Appendix 1. As for the experience of the rest of the RIF operation, the
RIF had different impacts prior and post mid-term restructuring. As Tables 2-5 below indicate, it can be
seen that over the full life of the RIF, subsidies for loans were provided to 10 Participating Financial
Institutions (PFIs): 7 Banks20, 1 financial institution21 and 2 microfinance cooperatives22. The commercial
and development banks (5 percent of beneficiaries) disbursed close to 50 percent of the RIF subsidized
loans and RIF subsidies. What cannot be seen from the tables is that the microfinance cooperatives only
really became active after mid-term restructuring and indeed, at that time, dominated the RIF. This is
because the mid-term restructuring of the RIF made the RIF more pro-poor and extended its outreach.
The commercial banks, who had distributed a large chunk of the total RIF prior to the restructuring,
became much less active afterwards. The consequence is the skewed result of 5 percent of the
beneficiaries receiving almost 50 percent of the RIF from large commercial banks prior to restructuring.

Under the RIF, a total number of 4,296 loans received subsidies for a total amount of 10.4 million USD.
The volume of these `RIF loans' totals 31.3 million USD.

The average figures such as those in Table 5 somewhat obscure the turnaround that occurred in the latter
half of the RIF disbursement. As livestock operations (more so at the time, than at the present) were
largely the domain of better off farmers and/or urban dwellers with incomes that could support status-
symbol cattle, it underlines the fact that the clients who benefited from the RIF subsidy scheme, early on,

belonged to the better off people in Rwanda.23 Processing loans in volume were relatively large, but very
few investments took place in the commercialization of inputs or of produce. While distribution became
more pro-poor only after the restructuring, these early RIF loans did allow the acquisition of new land and
improved breeds of cows,24 which carried some benefits to the rural sector. For example, with improved
breeds, the value of cows has doubled and the production of milk is ten times higher. These early loans,
mostly targeted towards big investors (Kigali based) able to invest in the cattle and milk production,
processing industries (like coffee washing, maize mills, tea processors and growers, etc) and industries
damaged during the war, meant that the early RIF supported almost exclusively large projects. These
projects, however, were found to have created an average of 26 permanent jobs per project, which is a
substantial contribution to the development of rural based employment.

Table 5 and the paragraph above reflect the RIF story pre mid-term restructuring. The size of the loans,
therefore, dominates average calculations and makes it difficult to see the changes of the later part of the
RIF. The table below disaggregates the experience of RIF over time (2005 restructuring highlighted).
Following the midterm review, loans for improved dairy cows were limited to US$7,500, which
reoriented the RIF toward rural borrowers with smaller credit needs. As a result of restructuring, the
average loan size changed from US$78,647 in 2002 to US$9,975 in 2007 (see table below). The
beneficiaries of smaller loans were found by the independent assessment to have increased their income,
family well being, and productive assets thanks to the RIF subsidy. Although loan size shrank and
microfinance involvement grew after restructuring, it must be noted that the `entrepreneur' RIF recipients
were still overwhelmingly of a higher education and socio-economic strata than the Rwandan average,
even after the partial restructuring of the RIF in 2005. This is undoubtedly partly linked to the fact that
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) applied standard (urban-biased) collateral and stringent
financing prerequisites. That is, there was no learning in terms of lending to rural and primarily
agricultural populations.

While the RIF, fully disbursed, did indeed fulfill the indicator selected for RIF performance (and indeed,
fulfilled it earlier than expected), it is difficult to assess whether the RIF met its objectives. Partly this is
because, as noted in the body of the ICR (in Section 2.2 on Implementation), it was never clear what those
objectives were. If one is to take the objective statements from different parts of the RSSP project
documents, the following story emerges:




23Their levels of education, access to other sources of revenue, possession of assets that can serve as a guarantee and
already existing links with the financial institutions are factors that have facilitated their appetite to take risk.
24Some farmers developed farms with imported cows from South Africa.


                                                            31

The objective that can be inferred from the PAD deals with the promotion of off farm productive
activities in rural areas. Other objectives for the RIF are articulated in the project implementation manual
and deal with access to finance objectives. These include, for participating financial institutions (PFIs),
(i) risk reduction by covering a part of the loan; (ii) relieving liquidity constraints by giving them access
to additional resources and (iii) ensuring repayment of part of its loan principal. For the recipients, the
access to finance objectives is facilitating access to bank financing, in addition to the productive objective
of subsidizing their investment costs in the amount of the RIF portion of the loan.

In terms of its access to finance objectives, the independent assessment shows that the RIF achieved
mixed results in terms of its access objectives. It did not directly reduce risk for the PFIs as the RIF
subsidy cannot stay with the PFI, although the fact that a beneficiary cannot receive the full RIF grant
unless they repay, does mitigate the risk of default for the PFI. Due to variations in how the RIF were
implemented, it may or may not have relieved liquidity constraints (if these exist at all for some of the
participating commercial banks). Finally, for the recipient, the RIF assessment finds that almost 100
percent of the recipients already had a bank account with a PFI before the RIF. The independent
assessment notes that after the RIF ended, beneficiaries did not then re-gain further access to credit from
the same PFIs. The vast majority had already accessed credit in the two years preceding the RIF.
Therefore, the RIF did not promote access to finance for previously unbanked, although it may have
increased access to credit for those previously banked if the PFI was reluctant to otherwise invest in rural
projects, a not-implausible assumption.

On the other hand, with respect to its productive activity objective, as already indicated above, the RIF
enjoyed a somewhat clearer success. The great majority of respondents indicate improved incomes,
improved crop and livestock productivity and positive externalities in the generation of increased
employment as a result of RIF financed investments. In terms of attribution, between 56 and 78 percent of
respondents in the assessment survey indicate that they would not have undertaken the investment
without the RIF.

Component 2: Implementation Coordination and Monitoring and Evaluation Support (US$6.53
million) (See Appendix 3)

Achievements under this component are rated moderately unsatisfactory.

The baselines were completed and updated by the Impact Assessment Study and the PIU. Nevertheless,
the absence of some baselines for some indicators proved difficult to overcome late in the project.

By the end of Phase I, the M&E system based on a database of output and outcome indicators was
operational. The Project M&E Unit was able to collect and report data based on a key defined and
transparent system in place to ensure the collection, processing, and timely performance indicators as
required by Bank operational policies. However, data collection and reporting procedures remain informal
and ad hoc, and there was no dissemination of M&E data. This limits the usefulness of the data for
managing the Project and also makes it difficult for the Government and the Bank to communicate the
achievements of the Project to larger audiences.

A diagnostic study conducted in August 2007 in preparation of the Phase II identified several factors
responsible for the M&E ineffectiveness: (i) weakness of the mechanism set up for M&E activities at the
beginning of RSSP1; (ii) confusion and weak understanding of the Monitoring and Evaluation Division's
duties and tasks within the PSCU; (iii) lack of assessment of stakeholders' needs; (iv) inappropriate
mechanism for data collection; (v) lack of robust databases and data processing software; (vi) weak
functional link between M&E, financial and Procurement systems; (vii) high turnover and lack of staff;
and (ix) weak capacity building.

The Project Implementation Manual and the M&E guide were revised and applied and the project
implementation arrangements for RSSP1 became satisfactory. Responsibility for day-to-day management
of the Project has been held by the PSCU. Through the PSCU, it has been possible to ensure continuing
effective oversight of key technical and administrative functions requiring high levels of specialization
that are best performed centrally. At the same time, PSCU staff has been deployed to the Districts where
Project activities have been carried out, making possible regular and meaningful engagement with
partners and stakeholders.

Quality and timeliness of financial reporting, which was weak in the early part of the project, vastly
improved in the second half of the project. The Interim Financial Reports have been submitted to the
Bank on a quarterly basis and reviewed to ensure that they provide quality and timely information to
Project management, implementing agencies, and various stakeholders monitoring the Project's
performance. Annual audit reports conducted in accordance with International Standards in Auditing have
been submitted to the World Bank within six months following the end of each financial year.

The staffing and structure of RSSP1 at the end of project reveals a total of 1 staff at the PSCU at national
level and 21 at the provincial level. Vacant posts at the national level included: Monitoring and
Evaluation Coordinator, Senior Agronomist, Senior Economist, Rural Sociologist and Environment
Officer. At the Provincial Team level, there is a total of 21 staff: 9 Coordinators; 2 Engineers; 5 M&E
assistants; and 5 Community Development and Gender Officers. In addition, the PAC was restructured.

Rural Investment Facility (RIF)

The Rural Investment Facility (RIF) was designed to provide financial incentives through investment cost
subsidy to qualified private sector operators, including farmer groups, willing to invest in activities with
substantial economic or environmental externalities. That is, the RIF was a grant attached to a commercial
loan--beneficiaries had to be approved for a loan in order to qualify for a grant. The eligible sectors
included: (i) operation of farmer-owned CETSE; (ii) processing, conservation, and trading of crop,
livestock and forestry products; (iii) transport infrastructure construction and maintenance activities; (iv)
acquisition of AMTs by crop, livestock and forestry farmers to be tested under pilot activities; (v)
investment by private operators in the construction/maintenance of AMTs and transport infrastructure;
(vi) investment by private operators in agricultural services delivery activities; and (vii) selected off-farm
productive pilot activities. In addition, the RIF was designed to reduce the risks of rural lending by
covering part of the loan, to give additional resources to financial institutions for on-lending and to ensure
repayment of part of the loan principal.

Loans for 24 rural productive activities were not originally included, but after RSSP1 took off, an
agreement was made between the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) and Participating Financial
Institutions (PFIs) to include productive activities. The reformulation of eligible activities included: (i) all
investment activities in production, processing, conservation, marketing, distribution and exportation of
agricultural products, livestock, fishing and activities relating to reforestation, wood processing and
exports; (ii) inputs and veterinary products production and distribution; (iii) all activities relating to
technical services in the agriculture sector; and seeds and planting materials distribution.

Until the project restructuring, the disbursement rate of the RIF was relatively low (29.4 percent in June
2004) due to: (i) the complexity of the project design, which prevented local bank managers in
determining what was permissible under the facility; (ii) the lack of training in preparation of bankable
subprojects; and (iii) the lack of collateral, which the participating commercial banks had established as
key eligibility criteria, which is a serious constraint for smallholder-farmers and other private investors.
Following the MTR, modifications were introduced within the RIF in order to improve its effectiveness
and ensure that it would better support borrowers in rural areas with limited credit access, as well as other
productive investors in rural activities.

Revision of the Rural Investment Facility following Mid-term Review
The mid term review conducted in 2005 concluded that RIF:
· Lacked a uniform understanding of the delivery mechanism for the PFIs and oversight from MINAGRI;
· Lacked communication as famers, non-commercial banks and MFIs were not aware of the RIF;
· Should focus more on pro-poor activities with positive externalities in order to have an impact on poverty;
· Had given a disproportionate advantage to rather affluent people in urban area (see Annex 2 on RIF);
· Did not do any environmental screening and that the linkages with other project components was weak; and
· Should widen the projects to be financed in the off farm category to include activities other than agricultural.

As the Project was restructured in December 2005, modifications were made in the functioning of RIF:
· The total amount allocated to the RIF increased from 5,620,000 SDRs to 7,500,000 SDRs (approximately
US$10.4m);
· Linkages with the capacity building subcomponent of the RSSP were established;
· A ceiling for dairy cow projects (maximum 7,500 USD) was introduced; and
· Encourage non commercial banks to use the RIF facility: the `Union de Banques Populaires du Rwanda' (UBPR),
Zigama CSS and Jyambere were supported to become more involved in RIF implementation (training, promotion
campaigns, training of consultants to prepare credit worthy project plans).

The RIF was created as a grant mechanism for beneficiaries, to be administered by a line of credit of the
BNR and private financial institutions. It was never intended to be a permanent feature of the BNR.
During RSSP implementation, the BNR partially allocated the grant to PFIs and kept the rest to create a
revolving fund. As the RIF purpose was not to become a sustainable revolving fund, the BNR was asked
by the Bank team at mid-term restructuring to reallocate the funds to its intended purpose as loan subsidy,
which the BNR did.

The implementation by the PFIs has not always been according to the guidelines laid down in the
agreements between the National Bank of Rwanda and the financial institutions. This is at least partly due
to capacity constraints on the part of the PFI. As a result, the transfer of the RIF subsidy was not done as
originally envisioned. Again, while the original design of the RIF was technically sound, the capacity of
implementing institutions was overestimated, so that the financial institutions did not understand the
system and also because they do not have the information systems that enabled them to transfer grants as
originally designed. Although NBR has tried to make the institutions apply the proper systems, they have
not succeeded in doing so. The lack of ownership at the BNR and human resources to enforce the rules
might be one of the reasons underlying the limited application of systems and reporting by the financial
institutions. It should be noted that PFIs requested software to help them with RIF disbursement, but the
request was denied by the project and the Bank.

While the operational part of the RIF subsidy scheme has been well managed by BNR, the lack of an
effective M&E system was particularly an issue for the RIF. Due to weak reporting, the PSCU and the
Bank were not able to know how the loan portfolio was performing (portfolio of risk, loan amounts
outstanding, sectors financed, etc.), and how much of the RIF subsidies had been transferred to clients,
and how much was still on the PFI's account. According to the RIF evaluation, the reporting was at a
minimum due to the lack of demand for it from the PSCU and the Bank. The monitoring of and reporting
on the RIF consisted of a monthly update on the portfolio of RIF-financed activities (an Excel sheet
specifying client, project, loan and subsidy amount and disbursement date). Although BNR requested of
financial institutions on several occasions more detailed and specific reports on the performance of the
RIF-financed portfolio, this has almost never been fully analyzed. As for the financial viability of the RIF,
no information has been collected on the management costs of BNR so it is impossible to evaluate
whether the management fee--which was reported in different places as 1 percent or 4 percent was either
adequate to prevent losses at BNR or exorbitant to the RIF program. In addition, the absence of a clear
task division between BNR and RSSP has caused a lack of strategic guidance and difficulties in enforcing
the RIF implementation system.

While the RIF has had a positive intended impact on promoting productive rural investments with
important employment and income externalities, the design of the RIF did not respond to its access to
finance objectives and did not therefore result in the sustainability of rural investments. The objectives of
the RIF are difficult to clearly discern from the project's documentation, but can be inferred from the
PAD and the PIM to (a) deal with the promotion of off farm productive activities in rural areas; and (b)
deal with access to finance objectives. The RIF can be judged a success on the former: RIF-financed
investments generated important employment externalities and boosted incomes in more than 4,000 rural
households. These impressive benefits ended, however, when the grants ran out. This is because the
second objective, concerning access to finance was not met. The independent evaluation conducted for
the RIF indicated that almost 100 percent of the recipients already had a bank account with a PFI before
the RIF and the vast majority had already accessed credit in the two years preceding the RIF, although
admittedly, not necessarily for agricultural sector investments. In brief, the RIF did not require any
change in the behavior, products or risk assessment techniques of participating financial institutions
(PFIs). The key example is that the same security (i.e. collateral) requirements were asked by banks prior
and during the RIF. The key lesson to emerge therefore is: Much greater attention needs to be paid to

                         ANNEX 3: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Methodology and Assumptions

The economic rate of return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) at completion have been recalculated
using data from the project M&E system. The methodology used is very similar to that adopted at
appraisal to maximize comparability, as are the majority of assumptions (see Table A3.1 for a summary
of differing assumptions). Data from January and February 2008 on output/input prices, wages, water
prices, yields and other data at completion were used. The ERR and NPV were calculated across two
major irrigation models:25 (i) gravity irrigation with dam and (ii) gravity irrigation without dam. These
two models represent 96.3 percent of total project irrigated area at completion. The overall project NPV
(ERR) was obtained as the weighted average of these two NPVs (ERRs), weighted by area irrigated under
each technology. The other two irrigation models used in the Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA)
undertaken at appraisal, i.e. hillside and sprinkler irrigation systems, represented only 3.7 percent of total
project irrigated area at completion, and thus were not recalculated.

Actual investment costs are reported at US$6,770 per ha for the gravity irrigation with dam technology
and US$2,680 per ha for gravity irrigation without dams.26 At appraisal, the EFA was only conducted for
the first component on marshland irrigation development, reasoning that it consumes fully one third of
total project resources and that the other components are demand-driven, and therefore impossible to
predict a priori. The reasoning holds at completion, where the investment in marshland irrigation
development accounted for 33 percent of total project investments. To maximize comparability with the
analysis undertaken at appraisal, the ICR EFA at completion is also conducted uniquely for RSSP
investment in marshland rehabilitation.

Points of departure from the EFA at appraisal deal primarily with assumptions concerning output. Almost
all of RSSP irrigated marshlands (98 percent) was used to produce rice during two seasons, compared
with sweet potato during one season in the "without project" scenario. On the remaining 2 percent of
marshland, farmers also produced maize, beans, and sweet potato. The gravity irrigation with dam
technology covered 57 percent of the total irrigated marshland area, while the remaining 43 percent used
gravity irrigation systems without dams. Rice yields used for the ICR EFA are assumed to be 5,000 kg
per ha; sweet potato at 6,000 kg per ha; beans at 1,200 kg per ha; and maize at 1,000 kg per ha. The
average O&M expenses for the gravity and dam system is reported at US$55 per ha per year. The O&M
for systems without dams are averaged at US$35 per ha per year and assumed to be fully financed by
farmers. O&M assumptions therefore differ from those used at appraisal (see Table A3.1). The financial
price of labor was RWF500 per man-day, while the economic price was assumed to be RWF300 (60
percent of the wage used in the financial analysis), accounting for few job alternatives for farm family
labor outside of the own farm. The economic prices of tradable outputs and inputs at ICR were assumed
to equal the observable financial prices. This is because the current state of trade liberalization in Rwanda
does not suggest significant price distortions. Import tariffs with the major trading partners (Uganda,
Kenya, Burundi, and Tanzania) are close to zero due to the membership in East Africa Community
customs union. The exchange rate for the EFA is therefore assumed not to deviate from the prevailing
exchange rate. All prices and costs are measured at farm-gate level.


25At appraisal, the EFA presented six "farm models". At completion, only two "farm models" (gravity systems with
and without dams) were mainly implemented. To allow the comparison, the "gravity system with dam" at ICR is
assumed to be equivalent to Model V ("Two-season rice farm with dyke allowing for irrigation by gravitation") at
PAD, and the "gravity system without dam" at ICR is the equivalent to Model III ("Rice farm without reservoir and
with costs similar to Model II").
26For comparison, the unit costs of the sprinkler irrigation investment were US$4,000 per ha. Again, its minimal
usage in the project (only 15 ha of irrigated land) did not warrant its inclusion in the exercise.

Net Present Value and Economic Rate of Return.

The NPV and ERR at completion are significantly lower than those calculated at appraisal, although
the NPV remains positive and the ERR remain well above the social return to capital. The project
financial NPV at completion was estimated at RWF 6.71 billion and the economic NPV was estimated at
RWF 2.82 billion. With the ERR at 24.8 percent, the project's overall rate of return is twice as high as
the assumed social rate of return of 12 percent (Table A3.2). The economic NPV and the ERR are the
largest for the project's gravity irrigation without dam model, due to the lower unit investment and O&M
costs, as compared to the gravity irrigation with dam. The project economic NPV estimates at completion
are much lower than the ones estimated at appraisal. This is because of changes in the project's irrigation
scale, as well as for a number of economic reasons, as explained below.

The divergence between the higher NPV at appraisal and that at completion in the ICR can be explained
by four key factors: (i) the unit cost of irrigation investments was in actual fact much higher than that
assumed at appraisal; (ii) there was a significant reduction in irrigated land area under the project as
compared to that assumed at appraisal; (iii) the actual O&M expenses at completion were higher than
those assumed at appraisal; and (iv) there was a major change in crop patterns under RSSP, compared to
what was assumed for the project at appraisal (see above). The first three factors explain 87.4 percent of
the difference between the NPV at ICR and NPV at appraisal (RFW 8.6 billion from the total of RWF 9.8
billion). The different crop patterns and other factors account for the remaining 12.6 percent.

                                                                               %
    Project total                                               12,633       84.6%       3,023     24.8%
* Social discount rate is 12 percent.

Of the four key factors, the higher unit cost of irrigation investments at completion compared to that
assumed at appraisal is the single most important reason for the lower project benefits reported in Table
A3.2, explaining 44.5 percent of the total NPV difference. A 50 percent reduction in the irrigated area is
the second most important reason for the lower NPV at completion, explaining 39 percent of the total
difference between the NPVs. The tremendous difference in the cropping pattern at completion,
compared to the assumptions made at appraisal, is the third most important reason. At appraisal, it was
assumed that farmers would produce mostly high value crops, in particular horticultural products. At
completion, however, almost all irrigated marshlands were used to produce rice, due to food security
concerns. Although the farmers benefited from rising rice (and other grain) prices, large potential income
from more diversified production structures was foregone. Finally, the higher than predicted O&M
expenses are responsible for a 4 percent reduction in NPV at completion. The actual water fee and O&M
expenses for gravity irrigation with dam (without dam) was US$55 (US$35) per ha at completion
compared to the assumed US$25 at appraisal.

Sensitivity Analysis

From the farmer perspective, the future financial NPV is determined by fluctuations in rice prices and
yields. The reduction of either price or yield by 17 percent would nullify the NPV. Price decreases of
this magnitude are considered very unlikely, however, taking into account projected strong growth in
demand for food staples (fueled by population growth and rising incomes), as well as strengthening
global commodity prices.

The fact that NPV declines significantly when rice prices and yields decline, underscores the critical
importance of sustainable irrigation systems, efficient farming, and developing marketing infrastructure,
all of which were correctly identified in the project's design. It further highlights the importance of
extension services in effectively transferring new knowledge to farmers on modern technologies for other
crops and on prevention/mitigation measures against crop pests. More generally, similar to this project,
future projects should include serious capacity building and institutional improvements for extension
services, to help farmers diversify and prevent them from falling back into subsistence farming and
poverty. This is a key lesson for RSSP Phase 2.

1. Impact Assessment

The quantitative household survey was conducted among 2,400 households all over Rwanda (February to
March 2008) covering all 5 provinces and 30 districts. Heads of households from direct RSSP
beneficiaries (1,200) as well as from indirect and non beneficiaries (600 each) have been interviewed by
using a formal household questionnaire.

The Study used two-staged random sampling procedures and variables analyzed underwent adequate
testing (Chi2Pearson's test, linear-by-linear association Chi2 test, likelihood-ratio test, both within and
across categories (direct, indirect, non beneficiaries) for discrete variables and Anova and T-test for
continuous variables. Weighted values are provided at district level for all variables. Both the baseline
study (BRSS) conducted at the beginning of RSSP127 and the 7 districts with minimal RSSP interventions
(non beneficiaries) served as a control group for measuring the hypothetically more intensive RSSP
effects in the RSSP direct intervention zones. Moreover, within RSSP core intervention zones, the effects
will be differentiated between RSSP direct and indirect beneficiaries, the hypothesis being that RSSP
impact is most visible among the direct beneficiaries and decreasing from indirect to non beneficiaries.

The Study followed the TOR as discussed regularly with the Client during the preparation and
implementation process. Relevant data have been collected at the level of households regarding the main
focal areas defined such as on household status and assets, off-farm labour, farming and marketing
outputs, satisfaction with infrastructure and environmental protection. Valuable data have been generated
regarding achievement of trigger indicators reached for end of phase 1 (see Vol. 2 of this Study) and as a
baseline for Phase 2.28

The study also includes qualitative studies, to demonstrate the progress achieved towards attainment of
the four PDO indicators and eight Intermediate Indicators defined in the TOR for this Study. Vol. 3
contains data tables by module relating also to district/ province levels.

RSSP1 overall impact

The findings of the quantitative Household Survey show a magnitude of encouraging achievements and
positive impacts of RSSP1 on such issues as agricultural production, food security, innovations in
processing and marketing, infrastructure and the socio-economic status of households in terms of
enhanced position as a farmer and also regarding general improvement of living conditions, and
satisfaction expressed with the impact of RSSP1.

RSSP direct beneficiaries have higher off-farm earnings and make more savings than their neighbours,
being indirect beneficiaries and particularly than non beneficiaries. The value of their hillside and
marshland farms has increased considerably since the inception of RSSP1 in 2001. They make more
income from sales of crops and can economise on their production costs. The market value of the crops

27This was described as being of limited quality due to loss of data base and limited statistical relevance.
28It is to be noted, however that this study is not a farming systems research, which could be expected to produce
exact data on production and consumption at farm hh level, nor is it a poverty study producing exact data on hh
income and expenditures to be used for calculating poverty measurements.




                                                           54

they consume themselves (auto-consumption) and the number of months they can live from their own
production surpass the values of indirect and non beneficiaries significantly, thus releasing their hh
expenditure for food stuffs considerably while enhancing their food security.

Their market sales have risen three to five times, and their processed crop sales are well above those of
indirect and non-beneficiaries. Marketed crop output per hh surpassed projected end of phase 1 values in
most areas. Harvest values have risen as has use of fertilizer.

Direct beneficiaries also lead in terms of housing conditions and assets acquired. Proxy indicators used
for poverty status and enhanced economic status usually applied comprise material used for house's
external walls, roof, floor. Al these indicators show progress among RSSP direct beneficiaries.

Data was also on water supply and sanitation standard, on source of lighting and energy source for
cooking which were not included in the Baseline for RSSP1, but which could be used for future
monitoring of economic improvement among RSSP-2 beneficiaries. Data was collected on household
assets that were not included in the Baseline, but which could be used for a baseline for RSSP-2 as
additional proxy indicators of poverty and economic progress.

Direct beneficiaries are very satisfied with infrastructure provided under RSSP-1 (marshland
rehabilitation, markets, drying & storage facilities, roads).

They record considerable income increases and are generally highly satisfied with the RSSP impact on
their livelihood. Also, their capacity to pay for school fees, to cover health costs and to employ local
labour is clearly higher than among the other two groups.

Additional benefits relate to environmental protection (improvement of the land, soil and water
management, erosion control on hillsides, sanitary drainage of marshlands), and the acquisition of
essential know-how to build up precious human capital in regard to innovative technologies for crop
production, processing and marketing.

Overarching impact, conclusions and recommendations

The results of the Impact Assessment have shown that RSSP1 has contributed in different ways to
enhancing farmers' position in terms of agricultural output, food security and enhanced socio-economic
well-being among considerable shares of Rwanda's rural population. This positive impact has to be seen
in the larger context of overall poverty alleviation in Rwanda29.

Through a series of variables collected30, essential data have been generated regarding housing status,
assets, and farm related expenditure that show the relatively enhanced position of direct beneficiaries as
compared to the other two comparison groups (indirect and non beneficiaries).




29It is to be noted in this context also that the indicators of household income and crop yields were dropped by recent WB
planning for RSSP-1 and 2 as their measurement is a rather demanding task which could better be linked with overall national
statistical endeavours (also in connection with Rwanda's EDPRS monitoring).
30It is to be noted that the PIU&IA was not meant (neither by the TOR) to effect a poverty measurement among Rwanda's rural
population beneficiary of the RSSP1 interventions. Such a study also (in line with international standards) would have required
different TOR using specific methodologies. As discussed with WB team, however the data base provided by this Study to RSSP
could be further used in future for regular updating of baseline data and for additional studies such as on poverty among RSSP-2
beneficiaries, linking it to the data forthcoming by NISR on EICV-2 as re-analysed under Rwanda's new administrative
boundaries.



                                                                   55

RSSP has contributed to improving the food security situation of large shares of Rwanda's rural
population, such as through increased harvests, crop yields, auto-consumption, processing and marketing
of produce, and increased household incomes. Also, it has contributed to a diversification of crops
cultivated, enriching households' nutritional supply both quantitatively and qualitatively as pointed out in
the Study. While it was not mandated by the Study, some of the data collected could be used in future for
studies relating more specifically to the improved food security situation among RSSP direct
beneficiaries. For this purpose, data could be analysed also on province/ district level looking into the
factors that determine food security.

While RSSP1 is not focused on the dimension of animal resources as part of its support to improved rural
development for farmers, it has, however had some activities in supporting infrastructure regarding milk
collection centres.

Recommendations:

As RSSP plays an important role in contributing to the food security and nutritional needs of large parts
of Rwanda's population, a balanced approach including crop and animal resource components could be
followed in the next phase by strengthening components that are already included in the programme and
could easily be extended:
    one area to be developed further under RSSP2 could be fodder;
    exploiting further the potential of agro forestry approaches used in hillside development;
    the scaling-up of using organic manure for enhanced crop production; and
    a new area to be introduced could be also aquaculture (fish ponds), which could become an additional
    resource for much needed protein supplements to improve the nutritional situation.

Regarding RIF-2, the following elements could be built in:
         making available funding for small-scale agricultural investments including seasonal credit for
         farmers; and
         grants/loans could also include micro credits for income-generating activities (IGAs) for women
         and other groups (i.e. in poultry).


Most RSSP investments during phase 1 have been concentrated geographically in the provinces of the
South and East due to the large numbers of marshlands to be rehabilitated there.
Under RSSP2, this investment pattern reportedly will still be followed by and large.

Lessons learned from other large-scale countrywide programmes show that a flat rate of investments
equally distributed over all areas is less efficient. Often, more investments are made in a selected number
of provinces for different reasons such as more difficult terrain, higher magnitude of problems to be
solved, higher population or beneficiary numbers). Another strategy would be to concentrate
investments on those areas where progress is faster, promoting a "two or more speed development"
approach.

It would be worthwhile to look at RSSP1 total investment figures by district/ province and components It
is recommended that RSSP2, being an APL programme with built-in flexibility to adapt its component-
wise investment levels per geographical area of intervention, studies these broad options (fostering more
advanced districts while not neglecting less advanced ones).

2. Participatory Rural Appraisal

Over the period from May 27 to June 5, 2008, the Rwanda- based ICR team and project staff designed
and implemented three participatory rural appraisal (PRA) activities: (i) 8 Community Mapping
(disaggregated per gender); (ii) 3 Timeline Exercises and (iii) 3 Semi-structured Interviews. The sample
was non-random and geographically dispersed. The intention of the exercise was indicative rather than
definitive.

(i) The Community Mapping exercise targeted non beneficiaries of project community investment (in
groups of 20 to 30 people, men and women). The objective was to assess the positive and negative
(including unintended) impacts of the Project, as perceived by the community. The results of the
community mapping exercise were summarized in Section 3.5 of the ICR, and therefore this section
discussed the beneficiary survey results.

(ii) The Timeline Exercise targeted hillside and/or marshland farmers (in groups of 6-12 people, men and
women). The objective was to assess the level of stakeholder consultation with farmers throughout the
life of the project.

(iii) The Semi-structured interview targeted lead farmers as direct beneficiaries of PASDO trainings and
capacity building (in groups of 6-12 people, men and women). The objective was to assess the progress of
the Project in human resource development and capacity building.

They presented their training needs to the district authorities before the project arrived and they felt the trainings responded to
their needs.
·    As a result of the training, farmers report that they have changed cultivation methods--now monoculture, row crop, and
     yields have tripled as a result.
·    In terms of empowerment and self-esteem, they are considered by the population as amateur agronomists now--they feel a
     change in their status; one older man indicated that he was a role model now because he had a demonstration plot on his
     land.
·    They report that they have improved their time management.
The trainings perceived as the less interesting were: (i) crop disease control as they didn't feel they mastered it--too technical
and not enough time spent on this; (ii) financial management (valued, but too technical for the time allocated--no session on
planning); and (iii) soil protection (on hillside protection, when they were really interested in marshland i.e. flooding protection).

Introduction and Project Development Objective

At the time of RSSP1 preparation phase, the issues in rural development in Rwanda had been already
described in great detail in the 1998 Bank report on Agricultural Intensification in Rwanda. According to
the report, the combination of rapid population growth with limited availability of agricultural land had
resulted in the following set of problems in Rwanda's rural sector: (a) increasing labor intensity and
declining labor productivity in the agricultural sector; (b) strong subsistence orientation of agricultural
production, reinforced by weak commodity and labor markets; (c) the resulting pressure on local off-farm
employment and wages; and (d) declining incomes and a fragile food security situation. These problems
reinforced each other as limited market orientation reduces the incentives for technology innovation,
which was necessary to raise labor productivity and incomes. Using the results from two major
household-level studies carried out in the late eighties by the International Food Policy Research Institute
(IFPRI) and Michigan State University (MSU), the report showed that the relative lack of market
orientation among Rwandese farmers was due as much to production constraints as it was linked to
constraints on the demand side. These constraints emanated from: (i) production conditions which
encouraged household consumption over market transaction, given the low opportunity cost of labor and
the fact that most food crops could be grown in many parts of the country; (ii) a production structure
which included very few cash crops that were grown over wide areas and, therefore, failed to stimulate a
broad supply of marketing services or foster the integration of smallholders into the market process; (iii) a
low rate of urbanization, which meant that there were few significant deficit areas to generate the excess
demand to stimulate supplies from potential surplus areas; and (iv) insecure access to markets, which
undermined trading as a reliable measure to cope with food insecurity and encourages a tendency to
autarchy as a rationale response.

The analysis of the rural development problem in Rwanda suggested that the entry points of the strategy
to foster broad-based growth in Rwanda's rural sector over the next 10-15 years should be: (a) expansion
of existing industrial crops (coffee and tea); (b) promotion of alternative high-value small-holder crops;
and (c) intensification of existing food crop systems.

Accordingly, the Government of Rwanda (GoR) supported by the World Bank designed a 14 year
Adaptable Program Loan (APL), to be implemented nationally over three phases, under the oversight of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI). In that context, in 2000 the GoR received
a Credit from the International Development Association (IDA) to implement the first phase of a Rural
Sector Support Program (RSSP). RSSP was to contribute to implement the three first programs of the
Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation in Rwanda with a special focus on (i) marshland
development, (ii) promotion of farmer organizations and strengthening of producer capacities, (iii) rural
financial systems and agriculture credit development, and (iv) construction of rural infrastructures to
support producers. RSSP aims at revitalizing the rural economy and improving the quality of life of the
rural poor through increased transfer of technical and financial resources for sustainable rural
development.

The project development objective of RSSP1 was to build institutional and technical capacities that are
needed to support the generation and adoption of efficient cropping and post-harvest technologies and
hence launch the intensification process. This original objective was recognized as pertinent throughout
implementation of RSSP1. This report provides the Government of Rwanda (GoR) assessment of the
first phase of the RSSP and has been prepared using project appraisal document, supervision Aide
Memoirs, Quarterly and Annual Reports, and the beneficiary assessment reports.

2.       Original Components

Phase 1 of the RSSP1 was officially launched in October 24th 2001. Originally RSSP1 had seven
components:

Rehabilitation of farmed Marshland and Hill-side Areas (US$13,970, 000): The objective under this
component was to empower: (i) beneficiary farmers to efficiently manage marshland/hill-side cropping
and livestock activities and promote the adoption of improved soil, water and fertility conservation
techniques; and (ii) private operators to intervene in land and water infrastructure construction and
maintenance;

Integrated Management of Critical Ecosystems (US$5): RSSP1's objective under this component was
to strengthen the capacity of local communities to effectively manage critical ecosystems;

Promotion of Export Agriculture (US$10, 530, 000): This components sought to develop export crop
agriculture through facilitation of access to investment capital and strengthening of capacities of farmers
and exporters in order to raise the productivity and competitiveness of Rwanda's export sectors;

Support to Agricultural Services Delivery Systems (US$9,590,000): RSSP1's objective under this
component was to strengthen the capacities of agricultural research and extension systems in order to
generate and extend improved technologies to farmers and enhance the delivery of services; given the
very weak capacities in the research systems;

Small-scale Infrastructure Development (US$9,810,000): This component's objective was to
strengthen the capacities of: (i) local communities to prepare and supervise small-scale infrastructure sub-
projects; (ii) private sector operators to construct and maintain such infrastructure; and (iii) farmers and
other private sector operators to acquire transport equipment and post-harvest infrastructure;

Promotion of Off-farm Productive Activities in Rural Areas (US$340,000): The activities under this
component were to lead to higher levels of off-farm employment and incomes in the project areas, in
particular, and in rural areas, in general. For the first phase, the objective was to develop strategies and
implement pilot activities, which could be scaled up in subsequent phases to generate higher levels of off-
farm employment and incomes in the program areas in particular, and in rural areas in general.

Program Support and Coordination (US$3,770,000): Given the decentralized and participatory mode
of implementation proposed for RSSP, the main objective under this component was to (i) ensure
effective monitoring and evaluation of program activities throughout the implementation of the program;
and (ii) ensure effective coordination between and support to the various implementing agencies and
beneficiary groups given the decentralized and participatory mode of implementation that is proposed for
the Program.

3.       Revised Components

After a slow start, the Mid-Term Review of January 31 to February12, 2005 undertook a "light"
restructuring of the project, which was carried out in December 2005. The restructuring left the original
Project Development Objectives (PDOs) unchanged but resulted in the streamlining and simplifying of
the project design, which went from 7 components to two components. It is worth mentioning that during
the early stages of RSSP1 implementation, the original component 2 became an independent GEF-funded
project on `Integrated Management of Critical Ecosystems' and was moved to MINITERE. The two
components finally implemented by RSSP1 were:



                                                        64

Component 1: Marshland/Hillside Development and Export Agriculture (US$42,014,225) : This
component aimed at building institutional and technical capacities that were needed to support generation
and adoption of efficient cropping and post-harvest technologies and it subdivided into three
subcomponents:
    (a) Studies/Design and Rehabilitation/Construction of Irrigation and Hillside Infrastructures involved
         in marshland development, hillsides protection, and marshland studies for phase 2 developments;
    (b) Capacity Building and TA support to Community and Partners looking at development and
         empowerment of community organizations for marshlands and hillsides development and
         enhancement of both quality and capacity in public and private sector delivery of the necessary
         public services; and
    (c) Support to Value Adding Rural Micro Enterprise Activities aiming at creating optimal conditions
         for the beneficiaries to obtain higher value-added from production activities by supporting
         interventions that remove the infrastructure constrains on private sector involvement in
         agricultural and livestock production.

Component 2: Implementation, Coordination and Monitoring & Evaluation (US$5,995,775): The
objective of this component was to achieve effective implementation and coordination of all RSSP1
activities.

4.       Achievement of Objective and Outputs

Outcome/Achievement of Objective

The development objective of the RSSP1 that was to equip farmers, other target private sector operator
groups, and the other relevant government institutions with basic institutional and technical capacities that
should lay the groundwork for subsequent productivity-raising interventions has been fully met. The
RSSP1 has rehabilitated marshlands as well as other rural infrastructures that are being used for crop
production and marketing. In addition to infrastructures construction, the first phase of RSSP has
strengthened capacity of public institutions involved in agriculture and extension, local NGOs, and
farmers.

Outcome/Output by Component

Component 1: Marshland / Hillside Development and Export Agriculture (US$42,014,225)
Sub-component 1: Studies/Design and Rehabilitation/Construction of Irrigation infrastructures.

The subcomponent on Studies/Design and Rehabilitation/Construction of Irrigation infrastructures was
highly successful since the project achieved more than originally planned:

A. Studies for Marshland. RSSP1 was to conduct studies for 2,000 ha of marshlands to be
rehabilitated/developed under RSSP2. During implementation phase, Studies for 3,529 ha were carried
out and consisted of technical and environmental assessments. Studies of 150 ha in Nyarububa and
Kajevuba marshlands were also conducted and the related marshlands were developed under the first
phase of the project.

B. Marshland rehabilitation. RSSP1 was successful in rehabilitating marshlands and organizing farmers
using them for crop production. As the end of the project, 3,093 ha have been rehabilitated while the
target for RSSP1 was 2,500 ha. The rehabilitated marshlands are being used by farmers for rice
production. Success in marshlands rehabilitation can be demonstrated through the following points:




                                                      65

    · Rehabilitation of marshlands created employment for local communities i.e. marshland
        rehabilitation activities employed between 7,000 and 10,000 casual laborers earning a total of
        about RWF20,000,000 per month in some marshlands(i.e.: Kanyonyomba, Kiruhura
        rwabikwano).

    · After rehabilitation, area under cultivation increased, with farmers getting access to new fields­
        i.e. in Kanyonyomba marshland, the area under cultivation increased from 55 ha before 2004 to
        600 ha in 2006; Bugarama East from 108 ha in 2006to 240ha in 2007; Bugarama North from 170
        ha in 2006 to 205 ha in 2007; Agasasa from 55 ha in 2006 to 180 ha in 2007.

    · Water availability and distribution increased thanks to the construction of storage dams, irrigation
        canals, and better organization. This combined with better water management and sensitization
        for improved agricultural techniques led the productivity of marshlands to increase from 2t/ha in
        to 6t/ha in 2007B.

    · Thanks to a better organization, farmers increased their capacity to get input loans collectively
        through cooperatives, to market their produce collectively through cooperatives and to have a
        stronger bargaining power.

    · Membership of associations was open to all farmers within communities, including poor farmers
        and women. This allowed poor farmers to get access to land based on a system enabling farmers
        without plots on hillsides to have priority during plot allocation in the marshlands.

    · The project contributed to build local contractor's technical and financial capacity in marshland
        rehabilitation. A total of 7 local companies worked with the project with on job training of their
        staffs (8 engineers, 8 technicians, and 4 topographers)

    · Phase one of RSSP built capacity of 7 local engineers received from the project training courses
        through the project technical assistance in rural engineering. Marshland studies and rehabilitation
        activities amounted to RWF9, 542,634m equivalent to US$17,256,119.

C. Hillside protection. Support to hillside protection was mainly done around marshlands that the
project rehabilitated. RSSP1 spent a total RWF1,059,557m and protected 15,000 ha of hillsides, twice the
target of 7500 ha set for the first phase.

Subcomponent 2: Capacity Building and Technical Assistance Support to Community - and
Partner (NGOs/SLOs) Organizations

A. Support to farmer associations and cooperatives. RSSP1 invested RwF 4,293,981,915 in capacity
building related activities. RSSP was successful in mobilizing farmers in associations and later on in
cooperatives. Trainings were provided for organizational skills as well as for crop husbandry, using
farmers based extension systems. RSSP1 built capacity for more than 5,000 farmer associations
consisting of more than 200 134 members and over 6,832 lead farmers that were used to train the other
members in crop management. In 2007, lead farmers created their own network for information sharing.

Cropping systems including planting on rows, use of fertilizers and improved seed, planting on time, pest
management, post harvest handling, value addition and marketing improved in cooperatives supported by
the project such as COAMV in the northern region and IMPAKOMU in the southern region.




                                                     66

The project gave farmers the opportunity to gauge the importance of input use versus no inputs and this
led to the adoption of modern crop husbandry. With improvement in agriculture practices, yields
increased tremendously in the project intervention areas: yields for supported cooperatives went from
1.5t/ha to 4 t/ha for maize, 8t/ha to 24t/ha for Irish potatoes and 12t/ha to 24t/ ha for tomatoes.

Six supported farmers cooperatives (COAMV, Sooprocoki, Sopromaru, Ingabo, Moringa) successfully
embarked in the processing of maize, sun flower, soybean, cassava, moringa, while others such as
COIMU, Twuzuzanye and Rice cooperatives specialized in the marketing of potatoes, tomatoes, and rice,
thus increasing their incomes. In November 2007 the net benefit of COAMV was one million of Rwandan
franc per month. More than 132 Jobs have been created within cooperatives which are using full time
agronomists, accountants, coordinators and several other casual workers.

Involvement of farmers in the banking system improved as a result of several factors including (i) the
intensification of crop production, (ii) the increase in farmers' needs for investment funds, and (iii)
training sessions and sensitization.

RSSP1 trained 20 local NGOs in participatory technology transfer processes and trained 628 individual
consultants that helped communities in preparing proposals.

RSSP1 introduced in Rwanda, new high export potential crops such as Macadamia, Vanilla, and Moringa.

B. Support to Government institutions.

B.1. Institut des Science Agronomique du Rwanda (ISAR)

RSSP1 supported ISAR in order to strengthen capacities in agricultural research and extension. In that
framework 13 ISAR's scientists were supported in completing Masters Degrees while two scientists were
supported in completing PhD programs.

Eight senior scientists were recruited to assist ISAR while key staff was away attending training
programs.

For ISAR'S management RSSP1 was very helpful for the institution by particularly helping it to start new
research programs such as seed selection and multiplication, pest and disease identification and control.
The recruited senior scientists helped mobilize additional funds from other collaborative institutions and
donors, thus improving ISAR's visibility at regional and international levels. The project also supported
ISAR in developing rice varieties in order to broaden the national rice seed availability

B.2. Institut Supérieure d'Agriculture et d'Elevage (ISAE):

One of the areas supported by RSSP1 was the rehabilitation of marshlands. To ensure the availability of
Rural Engineers who could support beneficiaries of the rehabilitated marshlands, 120 students from ISAE
were trained and completed their studies in 2005. Communities are now benefiting from the services of
these Rural Engineers given that some of them are used as public servants and others as individual
consultants.

Subcomponent 3: Support to Value-Adding Rural Micro Enterprise Activities

Rural Infrastructure development was a demand driven supported activity. In most cases such demand
was initiated by either a community through the local authorities or by farmers associations. The



                                                       67

infrastructures financed mainly included rural markets, drying grounds, stores, bridges, feeder roads, and
farmer service centres worth about US$7,773,790.

Under RSSP1, 23 market infrastructures were constructed compared to 12 planned. With the construction
of markets, farmers now have access to better selling places; more people are attending market-days,
which now offer better produce (in quality and quantity) and more alluring prices. Sanitation conditions
have improved thanks to toilet and water tank facilities built in all the markets. In addition, because of the
high visibility of market infrastructures and sellers it is now easy for local governments to collect taxes.

Construction of drying grounds and storage facilities. Rice growers always need drying grounds
because most farmers harvest around the same time and demand for drying is at peak at the same time.
Construction of more than 100 drying grounds compared to 10 planned and 60 storages compared to 15
planned improved the quality of produce, reduced farmers loads associated with drying and storing
charges, and post harvest losses.

To facilitate access to markets, RSSP1 supported the rehabilitation of 40 km of feeder roads and 24
bridges.

In support to rural microenterprise activities, the Rural Investment Facility (RIF) was established. The
RIF was a 10,659,895. 42 US$ investment facility, managed by the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR).
RIF supported 4 330 subprojects provided by participating financial institutions. The goal of the RIF was
to increase the involvement of the commercial and formal banking sector in the rural sector and vice versa
to increase access of the rural sector to the financial sector.

RIF supported investments in the rural sector, which includes investments aagricultural production
(21.32%) processing (30.82%); cattle breeding (35.10%); commercialisation of agricultural produce,
(3.97%); commercialisation of agricultural inputs (1.24%); and small animal husbandry (7.55%). With
RIF, participating financial institutions issued loans totalling US$31,780,646. The total investments by
private entrepreneurs stimulated by RIF reached US$77,127,770 and this considerable impact on
employment and improvement of quality of lives.

In promoting the interest of banks and financial institutions to enter into the rural sector the RIF has been
very successful as interviews, particularly with Microfinance institutions (MFIs) show that they were now
willing to lend to agriculture whereas before this sector was seen as too risky. It was however noted by
some of the MFIs that they were late to be introduced to the facility and that the procedures were not
always fitting to their needs.

The assessment of the banks was reflected by the beneficiaries who were overall very satisfied with the
loans which were RIF supported. The loans were provided at a lower interest rate than usual 12-13% as
opposed to 14-18% and were therefore seen as `fair' by their beneficiaries.

Although many banks have indeed lowered their risk perception o f the agricultural sector, they stated that
there was a real need for an agricultural guarantee facility or some kind of agricultural insurance, to really
mitigate the risk that is still very high in the sector and prevents many from accessing financing.

Component 2: Monitoring and evaluation and coordination (US$5,995,775)

RSSP1 monitoring and evaluation function was very weak, due to several factors identified under a
diagnostic study conducted in August 2007 in preparation of RSSP2: (i) weakness of the mechanism set
up for M&E activities at the beginning of RSSP1, (ii) confusion and weak understanding of the
Monitoring and Evaluation Division's duties and tasks within the PSCU, (iii) lack of assessment of


                                                        68

stakeholders' needs, (iv) inappropriate mechanism for data collection, (v) lack of robust databases and
data processing software, (vi) weak functional link between M&E, financial and Procurement systems,
(vii) high turnover and lack of staff, (ix) weak Capacity building.
Financial and procurement functions were relatively weak, as well, during the first years of project
implementation. However, they have improved significantly in last three years.

5.       Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

At the beginning of the project, both Government of Rwanda (GoR) and the World Bank (WB)
underrated the required capacity to implement project activities and this led to delays in implementing
project activities.

Hillside implementation encountered implementation problems at the beginning due to lack of
supervision which was expected from the local leaders. While the nurseries were well planted through
private contracted companies, transplanting was not done well due to lack of sensitization and
mobilization which was left to only one or two agronomists. In addition, farmers did not plant all the
seedlings and did not follow up on the planted seedlings to ensure that they grew. Moreover, most farmers
did not at first like the idea of planting a lot of agro forestry trees in their fields but the policy of zero
grazing boosted the interest of farmers in growing those plants. In 2005, the project changed
methodologies and involved cooperatives using the marshlands in adjacent hillside protection.

Access to quality seeds and fertilizers both in quality and quantity was a big challenge for farmer's
cooperatives since with sensitization the demand for improved seed bypassed the national seed production
capacity.

Using NGOs for capacity building of the communities was not effective due to poor commitment and
weak capacities of selected NGOs, thus leading to poor performance of some farmers'
associations/cooperatives. To remediate to this situation, the project was obliged to shift to individual
consultants.
Activities implemented conjointly with the districts (travaux en régie) were often delayed due to slow
procurement and payment of contractors in districts.

6.       Sustainability of RSSP1 Activities

RSSP1 involved direct users/ beneficiaries in its activities in order to create ownership and sustainability.
In marshlands, farmers were sensitized to maintain irrigation through community works "umuganda"
which is organized once a week. For hard investments, farmers using the marshlands were trained in
maintenance of infrastructures and were sensitized to pay maintenance fees after each harvest.

For markets, the project established and trained market management committees that are collaborating
with the districts to ensure sustainability and maintenance of constructed markets.
For other demand-driven infrastructures, beneficiary farmers and cooperatives are responsible for their
maintenance.

Overall, the sustainability of RSSP1 activities is very likely not only because most investments made are
directly integrated within farmer associations, cooperatives and local governments' structures, but also
because the design of RSSP, which is an APL to be implemented over 14 years and in three phases, is
such that during implementation of phase two most activities initiated during phase one are going to be
scaled-up, improved and supported again using the latest techniques and methods while building on
lessons learnt from phase one.



                                                        69

7.      World Bank's performance

During RSSP1 implementation, the World Bank was of great help. Its regular six months supervision
missions that consisted of monitoring project progress, discussing with national authorities were very
helpful for the success of the project. In addition, the WB considerably assisted procurement and finance
departments by speeding up no objections and processing the request of funds which were the foundation
for RSSP1 successes.

However, the supervision for environmental and monitoring and evaluation related activities could have
been better taken care of. Event though the project hired an environmental specialist who made sure that
mitigations needed are put in place, the only time a supervision mission included an environmentalist was
in October 2006. As a result, the project was obligated to restart to implement environmental and social
safeguards in marshlands. Furthermore in the important area of M&E, Until May 2007, there was no
M&E specialist supporting the project.

8.      Government of Rwanda's performance

The Government of Rwanda followed the project activities closely. Annual audits of the project activities
were very useful to keep the project on track. The government of Rwanda honoured and went even
beyond its commitments in terms of providing the project with counterpart funds. Overall, it disbursed
US$ 2,000,000 compared to US $1,000,000 originally planned. However, the national policy of zero fleet
that took back project's vehicles hampered somehow the monitoring of project activities. As RSSP is a
decentralized project, having its operations countrywide, car renting has been expensive and difficult
since sometime rented cars were reluctant to go to difficult terrain.

9.      Lesson learned

There have been many lessons learnt from the RSSP project, and their follow up will be crucial for the
success of the subsequent phases.

From an organisational perspective the complexity of the first project structure has taught the GoR how
important it is to formulate projects in a simplified manner so that an assessment is also done on the
actual capacity of stakeholders and implementing partners. The success of the simplified structure
formulated midway through the project and its renewed focus are in that sense a real story of a successful

such as a guarantee facility and agricultural insurance so that the risk in lending in agriculture can be
reduced since according to the banks, RIF does not reduce the risk. For each of these, it should be
attempted to increase the participation of the private sector financial institutions so as to improve the
sustainability of the facility and reduce the dependency on outside donors. In that respect it should be
noted that the participating financial institutions were surprised when the RIF was closed, leaving them
with a large number of eligible projects that could not be financed, enhancing private participation should
help mitigate such incidents.
