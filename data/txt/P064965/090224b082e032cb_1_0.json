between 2006 and 2010 it accounted for 35\n            percent of gross domestic product (GDP); 45 percent of\n            export earnings, and according to the latest household\n            survey of 2010-11, for 73 percent of employment. Constraints\n            caused by population density, hilly terrain, and erosion\n            make it a critical determinant of rural poverty. Since 2001\n            Rwanda has worked closely with International Development\n            Association (IDA) to achieve food security and increase\n            agricultural productivity - food security was attained in\n            2010 and between 2000-01 and 2010-11 poverty was reduced by\n            about 14 percent. The Bank will continue to support the\n            sector to address some of the key impediments to increased\n            agricultural productivity including: a poor feeder roads\n            network; lack of information on investment potential;\n            prohibitive air freight costs; inadequately developed\n            frameworks for quality certification; and a lack of\n            post-harvest handling and storage facilities."}, "docdt": "2012-07-19T09:57:04Z"}
