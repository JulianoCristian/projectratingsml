which\n            rehabilitates marshland and hillside areas, supports\n            agricultural services delivery systems and rural transport ,\n            and promotes off-farm productive activities. Following are\n            measures that mitigate anticipated adverse environmental\n            impacts: Supplying guidelines for contractors and an\n            environmental code of conduct and adopting good site\n            practices will minimize disruption of hydrology and water\n            quality. Watershed management, using green and organic\n            manure, and increasing the efficiency of irrigation methods\n            will reduce organic matter and shrinkage and soil\n            acidification. Creating buffer zones, diversifying crops,\n            and establishing a biodiversity conservation and\n            agro-forestry program will diminish biodiversity loss.\n            Regular monitoring of nitrogen and phosphorus contents of\n            drainage water will alleviate changes in surface water\n            quality. Strict supervision during construction, limiting\n            the use of fire, and replanting will restore destroyed\n            vegetation. Establishing buffer zones with vegetation to\n            filter sediments and planting trees and grasses on hillsides\n            will counter siltation. Using biological control agents such\n            as fish will reduce mosquito larvae and snails and\n            consequently reduce health risks and incidences of\n            water-borne diseases. Monitoring the water table and\n            controlling water speed will moderate changes in ground\n            water level and quantity."}, "docdt": "2000-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
