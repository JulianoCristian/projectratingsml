as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the importance\n            of maintaining a tight focus on an agenda that is manageable\n            given the capacity constraints under which the project\n            operates. As initially designed and approved by the Board,\n            RSSP1 included seven components spanning a wide range of\n            activities. Early implementation experience revealed that\n            the scope of the design was overly ambitious, and that the\n            Government lacked the technical and institutional capacity\n            needed to implement such a broad array of activities. The\n            December 2005 restructuring successfully focused the Project\n            on a core set of activities. The need to build capacity in\n            the Project Support and Coordination Unit (PSCU) to ensure\n            effective implementation of the four safeguards policies\n            triggered by RSSP2, and the need for the Bank to assist the\n            Borrower effectively on safeguards. RSSP was in early\n            compliance with the environmental and social safeguards\n            triggered at appraisal and was found to have strong\n            environmental capacity in the PSCU, but general safeguards\n            capacity was found to be low. In hindsight, the Bank team\n            was slow to act, and should have informed GoR of the policy\n            earlier. The policy has now been fully integrated in the\n            current phase. The importance of a consistent, coherent and\n            straightforward M&E system clearly articulated in the\n            Project Appraisal Document (PAD), with indicators clearly\n            connected to the Project Development Objectives (PDO). Over\n            time, the streamlining of the results framework allowed the\n            borrower to develop a workable process for collecting data\n            and reporting on output and outcome indicators, which saved\n            the situation."}, "docdt": "2008-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
