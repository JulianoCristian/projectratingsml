adoption of efficient cropping and post-harvest technologies\n            and hence launch the intensification process. Phase I\n            includes seven components: The first component will empower\n            beneficiary farmers to efficiently manage\n            marshland/hill-side cropping and livestock activities and\n            promote the adoption of improved soil, water and, fertility\n            conservation techniques; and private operators to intervene\n            in land and water infrastructure construction and\n            maintenance. The integrated management of critical\n            ecosystems component will strengthen the capacity of local\n            communities to effectively manage critical ecosystems. The\n            promotion of commercial and export agriculture component\n            will develop export crop agriculture through facilitation of\n            access to investment capital and strengthening of capacities\n            of farmers and exporters. The fourth component will\n            strengthen the capacities of agricultural research and\n            extension systems. The fifth component will strengthen the\n            capacities of local communities, private sector operators,\n            farmers and other private sector operators, and water\n            management infrastructure to develop small-scale\n            infrastructure. The sixth component will lead to higher\n            levels of off-farm employment and incomes. The last\n            component will support project coordination."}, "docdt": "2001-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
