 to: (i) expand and strengthen the Bangladesh Power\n            Development Board's (BPDB) distribution systems in 16\n            towns; (ii) stabilize system voltage, reduce power losses in\n            the transmission and distribution system; and (iii)\n            strengthen BPDB's organizational and institutional\n            performance. Specifically, the project comprises erection of\n            about 92 km of 33 kV lines, extension of low-voltage\n            distribution networks in 16 towns, and procurement of spare\n            parts for power stations and substations. The project also\n            provides for the installation of capacitors and reactive\n            compensation equipment and of meters and metering equipment.\n            Finally, technical assistance and desk-top computers will be\n            provided to BPDB."}, "docdt": "1989-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
