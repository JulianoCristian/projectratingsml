MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENPASION OF TEN PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
-   -  TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRBCTORS
:ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THM PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC Or BNGLADESH
FOR A POWER DISTRIBUTION (16 TOWNS) PROJECT
1*       The  following  mmorandum  and - recoumeadation   on  a proposed
development credit  to  the People's  Republic  of  Bagladesh  for SDB 64.7
million (US$87.0 million  equivalent)  on  standard  IDA  terms with 40 years
maturity is submitted for approval.   the proposed credit would help f.nance
the expansion and renovation of the power distribution systems in 16 towns
and the procurement of metering equipment  and spare parts required to reduce
power system losses, and improve the  efficiency of both power plants and the
transmission system.
2.       Background. The efficient development and operation of Bangladesh's
energy sector has been impeded by institutional deficiencies, inadequate
investment planning and prices which have iAcluded economic distortions and
contributed too little to public resource mobilization. The Board approved
an Energy Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC) on April 11, 1989 to support the
Government of Bangladesh's. (GOB) energy sector reform program. The ESAC
established the overall policy framework for livestment projects, and
consequently individual projects will need relatively few, mainly project
specific conditiocs to ensure their efficient implementation. The proposed
credit would help finance the first such Investment project in the-power sub-
sector.
3.       The operational and  financial performance  of the Bangladesh Power
Development Board  (BPDB), which  is  responsible  for power generation,
transmission  and  distribution,  except   in  areas  served by  the  Rural
Electrification Board (REB), has been consistently weak with high power
system losses  and  accounts  receivable.    However,  in  February 1988 8PDB
agreed, with IDA, ADD and ODA, to a short term action program to reduce non-
technical  losses.      The program  included  implementation  of  stringent
administrative measures and replacing the meters of high voltage and low
voltage industrial consumers, which account for about SOX of energy sales,
with its own calibrated meters. Replacement of these meters has already been
completed substantially.  Implementation of  the program has reduced BPDB's
losses, calculated on a three months average basis, from 43.42 in January
1988 to 34.4? in January 1989.   Further, by intensifying its cash collection
efforts and making some adjustments  based  on a partial aging analysis, BPDB
has also succeeded in reducing its accounts receivable from 5.3 months'
average billing in January 1988 to 4.4 months' average billing in January 1989.
4.      Consultants funded by  the UK Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) recommended measures, endorsed by IDA, ADD, and ODA, to strengthen
BPDB's operations, focusing on decentralization of BPDB's power distribution
functions within BPDB and establishing an autonomous Dhaka Electric Supply
Authority (DESA) responsible for power distribution within the Dhaka area.
Further, UNDP is supporting the development of a program to reduce technical
and non-technical power system losses on a long term basis. Investments



-2-
required to implement the consultants' recommuendations (expected in August
1989) to reduce system wide technical losses would be financed under the
proposed FY90 Power Distribution and Rehabilitation Project. On account of
the operating inefficiencies stated above, BJPDB could not comply with self
financing or rate of return targets during FY84-88. However, the financial
projections show that the targets will be achieved in FY89. Through the
continued improvement in system losses and resource mobilization, and
operational efficiency resulting out of BPDB reform program, BPDB is expected
to improve its performance gradually.
5.       The investment analysis undertaken  under  the  ESAC shoved that the
priority in the power subsector now lies in the proper planning and
development of the transmission and distribution system, which is overloaded
causing high  technical  losses  and  unreliable  supply.    BPDB  is already
expanding and renovating the distribution systems in 32 towns. The proposed
project includes another 16 towns, which are included in BPDB's least-cost
distribution development plan, and a further nine towns would be financed
under the proposed FY90 Power Distribution and Rehabilitation Project. Under
the ESAC, GOBSBPDB agreed to prepare a priority investment p'.an (PIP) for
BPDB and other energy sector entities on a three-year rolling basis to ensure
that scarce funds and implementation capacity are allocated to priority
projects. The proposed project is included in the FY89-91 PIP.
6.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.    IDA has supported 12 credits, six
for power and six for other energy projects, to assist Bangladesh in
developing an efficient and balanced energy sector. The proposed project,
which would complement the on-going Power Transmission and Distribution
Project and the proposed FY90 Power Distribution and Rehabilitation Project,
is a key part of IDA's long-term lending strategy to address the major
technical, institutional and other factors impeding the power subsector's
efficient development.    These  pvojects  focus  on  energy conservation and
resource use efficiency issues through the reduction of BPDB's power system
losses and on BPDB's institutional  strengthening.   IDA's involvement in the
proposed project would support the speedy and effective implementation of
GOBIBPDB's loss reduction program by ensuring that all consumers are provided
with calibrated meters, which would reduce the waste of resources associated
with high losses.    Further,  IDA's  involvement would facilitate the major
institutional  strengthening  of  BPDB   through   the  implementation  of  a
comprehensive reform program and reorganization of distribution functions.
7.       Prolect  Obiectives.    The  principal  objectives  of  the proposed
project would be to meet load growth in the 16 project towns up to FY98 at
least cost, reduce system losses and improve the quality of electricity
supply, strengthen BPDB institutionally by implementing agreed reforms,
computerize its accounting system, consumer billings and distribution system
planning and train staff in these areas, and improve BPDB's financial and
technical performance.
8.       Pro1ect Description.  The proposed project, which would be completed
in six years, would consist of: (a) erection and renovation of 33-kV, 11-kV
and 0.4-kV lines and substations in 16 towns; (b) erection and commissioning
of compensation equipment for voltage stabilization; (c) meters and metering
equipment to reduce system losses; (d) spare parts for power plants and the



-3-
substations and transmission system; (e) implementation of BPDB reform
program; (f) consulting services for technical asilstance to BPDB and project
supervision during implementation; and (g) training BPDB staff for the
computerization of its billing and accounts functions and in distribution
planning.      The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  US$110.4 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$68.7 million (622). The
project provides retroactive financing up to SDR 6.3 million (US$8.5 million
equivalent) for expenditures incurred after September 30, 1988 for 33-kV
reactive  compensation  equipment  and   spare   parts  for  power  stations,
substations and the transmission system. Cost details and the financing plan
are  shown  In  Schedule  A.      Amounts  and methods  of  procurement  and
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of key  project  processing  events  and  the  status of Bank Group
operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Map
No. IBRD 20294R and the Staff Appraisal Report Nc. 7416-BD dated April 26,
1989 are attached.
9.       Agreed Actions.    GOB  has  agreed  to  decentralize  and delegate
additional administrative, financial and commercial powers to BPDB's Zonal
Chief Engineers by June 30, 1989 and to establish DESA by July 1, 1990. It
also agreed that by April 30 of each year it would annually review BPDB's 3
year priority investment program (PIP) including its financing plan with IDA.
Further, BPDB has agreed that it wouldt (a) earn a rate of return on revalued
assets of not less than 2Z in FY89, 4Z In FY90, 6? in FY91, 72 in FY92 and 8?
in FY93 and each year thereafter; (b) reduce its acco-outs receivable to no
more than 3.5 months billings, calculated on the basis of average billings
for the preceding three months' electricity sales, by June 30, 1989;
(c; complete an aging analysia of all its accounts receivable by June 30,
1990; (d) establish by September 30, 1989 four divisions for implementing the
proJects (e) furnish to IDA by August 31, 1989 a long-term program to reduce
both non-technical and technical losses taking into consideration the UNDP
funded consultants' recomuendations; and (f) recruit 14 additional qualified
accountants (in addition to 8 already selected) by advertising the posts each
quarter.
Before the credit is declared effective, BPDB would: (a) appoint
local engineering consultants; and (b) complete the ongoing program to
install about 1,400 high voltage meters and about 25,000 low voltage
industrial meters to reduce system losses.
10.      Benefits.  Benefits would  include: (a) the more efficient operation
and development of the power subsector; (b) resource saving by reducing power
system losses; (c) increased revenue from power sales in the project to-ns
where the number of present consumers is expected to increase from about
76,030 to about 150,000 in FY95; (d) improved power system reliability; and
(e) institutional  strengthening  of   BPDB   through   Implementation  of  a
performance improvement plan, and  computerization of its b. 'ing, accounting
and planning functions.   The  economlc  rate  of return of _aDB's least-cost
power development program for FY89-95, which includes the proposed project,
is estimated to be at least 332.
11.      Risks.   The  principal  risks  concern  possible  delays in project
implementation, both in procurement and during construction. To minimize



-4-
procurement  risks,  bids  for   all  major contracts  and -proposals  from
consultAnts have already  been  invited.    The  risk  of construction delays
bec&use of domestic financial resource constraints would be reduced through
implementation of measures to enhance BPDB's cost recovery, including
reducing system loz-ses and increasing its revenues. Possible construction
delays would also bv minimized  by  ensuring effective management of projest
engineering and aupervision by the formation of four new construction
divisions by September 30, 1989.
12.      Recommendation.  I  am  sadasfied  the  proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of 4Areement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
