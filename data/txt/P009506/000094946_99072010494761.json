Despite adequate identification of the\n            beneficiary's technical requirements, the Bank failed\n            to realistically assess Bangladesh Power Development\n            Board's (BPDB) ability to improve its commercial and\n            financial performance, in the absence of fundamental\n            institutional changes. Cooperation was provided by the\n            Borrower, such as submission of satisfactory reporting\n            requirements. However, and in spite of timely counterpart\n            funds' provision during implementation, BPDB's\n            inability to generate additional funds, adversely affected\n            the project outcome. The lessons drawn from the project\n            suggest that: 1) although project requirements called for\n            the separation of Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA)\n            from BPDB, provision for DESA's institutional\n            development was not established, nor to finance its\n            activities. This suggests that sufficient instruments should\n            be ensured within project design, to improve the\n            borrower's performance; 2) careful analysis of the\n            overall sector should be considered, to avoid irreversible\n            effects, caused by ad-hoc solutions; 3) implementation of\n            physical components require management capabilities to\n            overcome unpredictable issues, or predictable risks, and, 4)\n            distribution system improvement projects should include, and\n            properly coordinate, all developmental aspects, to\n            adequately contain non-technical losses."}, "docdt": "1999-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
