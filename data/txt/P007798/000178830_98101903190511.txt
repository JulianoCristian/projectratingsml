REPORT AND RECOPI1EIDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO PANAMA FOR THE TOCU:EN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Direccion de Aeronautica Civil with the guarantee of the
Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$20.0 million, to help finance
the construction of a new runway and a new passenger terminal at Tocumen
International Airporv, located close to Panama City. Modernized and
expanded facilities at the airport l-wll assure its continued use for
international traffic, provide for future traffic growth and boost
tourism. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 4 years of
grace, and carry interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Bank lending to Panama can be divided into two phases.  During
the first phase, from 1953 to 1962, the Bank made five loans totalling
$18.6 million. Two of these five, totalling $13.1 million, were for
road construction and suffered from political interference in the Highway
Department which took some time to overcome. TwIo relatively small loans
were made for agriculture during the first phase and one for electric
power.
3.        Because of political and economic problems no loans were made
between 1962 and 1970 when it became possible to resume lending with a
$42.0 million second power (Bayano) loan to the Instituto de Recursos
Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IliHE).  While IRHE has been operating
satisfactorily, the project is some six months behind in schedule, mainly
because of changes in engineering consultants, and only $0.4 million has
so far been disbursed. All of the previous loans have been fully disbur-
sed and three have been fully repaid. A statement of Bank loans to
Panama at June 30, 1971, is attached as Annex I.
4.        In June 1971, the International Finance Corporation made its
first investment in Panama, acquiring $0.3 million of equity in the
Corporacion de Desarrollo Hotelero, S.A., and agreeing to lend to it $1.2
million for the construction of a new international hotel. At the present
time, IFC is not considering any further investments in Panamanian compan-F 
PART II - TIE ECONOHlY
5.        The most recent economic report on Panama (WH-196a) was dated
February 19, 1970. An economic memorandum (CA-lla) was distributed to th&i
Executive Directors on July 15, 1971, and data on the economy is attached
as Annex II.  For more than two years, the Government which took over in
October 1968 has successfully attempted to combine domestic tranquillity
with rapid economic development. General Torrijos, head of the National
Guard, has exerted strong leadership, but relied on civilians to staff all



-2-
levels of Government i.ncluding the Presidency. With a group of well-trained
new officials, the efficiency of public adrinistration has increased.
6.        The new Government, in contrast to its predecessors, believes that
the public sector can play a leading role in economic development,
especially through a high level of public investment. In 1970, public
investment reached twice the level of 1967, and was equivalent to 6 percent
of GNP. The Government recognized at an early stage - in good part at the
suggestion of the Bank and the Fund - that new revenues would be needed
to sustain increased investment. In early 1970, just prior to the presenta-
tion of the Second Power (Bayano) project to the Ebcecutive Directors, an
important tax measure was enacted. As a result, government revenues
increased by about one-fifth in 1970, reaching almost 16 percent of GNP,
which is a considerably higher proportion than in the rest of Central
America. Moreover, taxation in Panama, amounting to 14.4 percent of GNP
in 1970, is higher than the average for Latin America.
7.        The economy has continued to grow rapidly, after some signs of
a slow-down during the politically difficult year of 1968. In 1969 and
1970 GNP growth averaged about 8 percent in real terms. This was slightly
above the 7.8 percent annual rate of the 1960-1968 period, which was
generated by the private sector and financed mainly by domestic savings.
The current account deficit in the balance of payments was only about
2 percent of GNP in the 1960-1968  period.   The sharp rise of public sector
expenditures and the effect of floods on banana exports raised the savings
gap to about 8 percent of GNP in 1970. The Government has justified the
expansion of its expendi-tures, both current and capital, on grounds of
employment and social reform. An agrarian reform program has been imple-
mented, rural health services are being expanded, and expenditures on
education are rising. At the same time the climate for private investment
has remained attractive; a reform of the banking law was carried out in
consultation with private banks in order to make Panama more attractive as
an international financial center, and progress is being made in the
negotiation of concessions for the exploitation of Panama's recently
discovered copper deposits.
8.         Growth in government revenue during 1970 was not accompanied by
any growth in government savings because of rapid increases in virtually all
categories of current expenditure, particularly education and administration
(including justice and police). Public savings have financed only a very
small share of the rising public investment, and the central government
has incurred a substantial fiscal deficit. The result has been that in the
past two years the external public debt outstanding, including amounts
undisbursed, nearly doubled, with much of the new debt being contracted at
medium and short-term from U.S. commercial banks. Of the shorter-term loan3,
$31 million was refinanced in 1970 and early 1971. As a result of these
borrowings, external debt service will average about 9 percent of Panama's
prospective earnings from the export of goods and services during the next
four years. This is three times the 1967/68 level (about 3 percent), but
is still manageable. Because Panama's currency is in effect the U.S. dollar
and there is no central bank, a more relevant indicator of indebtedness is ratio
cf total public debt service to government revenues. Although some of the debt



-3 -
;:C1-' in fact be serviced directly by autonomous agencies, the ratio of iet
service to central government revenues has increased from 12 percent in 1967
to 17 percent in 1970 and will rise to over 20 percent in the next few yearn
9.         The Bank and the Fund have both been concerned about the
deterioration of the fiscal situation and the low public savings since 196°.
The Fund recently stationed a representative in Panama, and on the basis of
a program that limits borrowing by the Government for less than 10 years,
agreed in March 1971 to a stand-by credit of $14 million. The Bank staff
has impressed upon the authorities the need to expand public savings
substantially if the public investment program is to be carried forward with-
out prejudice to Panama's financial stability. Several discussions with
General Torrijos, President Lakas and the Government's economic team have
been held by Bank staff in recent months. In these conversations, and in a
written communication of April 26, 1971, the authorities have assured Bank
staff that a substantial effort will be made to improve the fiscal position
of the central governrnent. The steps already taken include tighter control
of current expenditure and reductions in certain investment outlays includec(
in the 1971 budget. On this basis, the staff estimates that a public sectcr
surplus of $27 million (one-third of public investment) is feasible this
year, in comparison with only $5.6 million in 1970. The Government has
also clearly indicated that it plans to keep current expenditures for 1972
within the limits it indicated at the recent CIAP review, and that it is
prepared to approve a new tax measure which would yield $l5 million in 1972
(or about 1½ percent of GNP).  The Government has also reaffirmed that it
intends to stay within the limit of external borrowing set under the IMF
stand-by agreement.
10.        If the Government implements the financial program with vigor
there should be no threat to Panama's creditworthiness since prospects for
continued rapid economic growth are reasonably good. The longer-term out-
look is improved by the fact that Panama and the U.S. have resumed Canal
treaty negotiations which, if successfully concluded, could eventually result
in a large increase in Panama's revenue from the Canal. A 1967 draft treats
foresaw an increase of over $20 million above the present figure of about
$2 million a year.
11.        Panama's prospects are good, having regard to income provided
by the present Canal (and possibly by a sea-level canal towards the end of
the century) and prospects for developing the economy in other directions.
Copper mining, fisheries, and livestock are among the possibilities which
are already being canvassed. While there have been serious fiscal problems
in the last two years, these have not been the result of inadequate taxaticn
- on the contrary, central government revenues have risen rapidly - but of
excessive indebtedness to finance the Government's ambitious development
program.  The steps already taken and the dialogue with Bank staff on furthe-
measures augur well for the re-establisminent of a stronger fiscal positiorn
PART III - THE PROJECT
12.        The Tocumen Airport project is the first airport project for which
financing by the Bank Group is proposed. The loan would be made to the
Direccion de Aeronautica Civil (DAC), an autonomous agency of the Government
of Panama established in 1969, and would be guaranteed by Panama. The
Gcrernment approached the Bank for financing for the project in 1969, shcrtly



- 4 -
after DAC was established. DAC subsequently retained the Parsons Corporation
of Los Angeles to make a feasibility study.  The Bank commented on the term.z
of reference for the study. A suJnmary of the project is in Annex III; a
map of the Jocation of the airport in Panama is in Annex IV; and a layout
map of Tocumen Airport is in Annex V. After a draft consultants' report was
prepared, the Bank requested two addenda to explore technical alternatives
more thoroughly and to present a detailed economic justification of the
project. The project was approved by the Bank in September 1970 and negotia-
tions took place in June 1971. The borrower was represented by
ilessrs. Patricio Janson, Jose B. Sokol, Luis Barrow, Luis David and Morales.
13.        Panama's central position in the ;.Testern Hemisphere and its U.S.
dollar-related currencyhave encouraged,as noted above,the rapid growth of
commercial and financial activities oriented towards trade and banking. The
rapid expansion of these activities and their international orientation have
given rise to a substantial demand from business travelers for high quality
air transportation.  Moreover, in line with a policy of expanding foreign
exchange earnings not based on the Canal, the Government has begun to
promote tourism vigorously. It recently financed a study by consultants of
the tourist sector, and is making further studies to assess the possibilities
of three main tourist areas.  IFC is supporting this drive with an investment
of $1.5 million in the construction of a new hotel in Panama City, as
mentioned above. The Tourist Institute has begun a vigorous promotional
campaign and the Government has two tourist projects (reconstruction of the
old "Spanish Main" cities of Portobelo and Panama Viejo) in which other inter-
national lending agencies have shown some interest. The Government also
has long-run plans to expand the Colon Free Zone, which includes a number of
processing industries for export, and is the source of a significant portion
of Panama's air freight traffic. Improvement of the only international
airport at Tocumen is thus an integral part of the Government's plan to
expand Panama's growing commercial and financial sectors and tourism.
14.        The project consists of the construction at Tocumen   International
Airport of (a) a new paved runway 3,350m x 45m (11,000 ft x 150 ft) with
parallel taxiways, complete with lighting; (b) runway approach lighting; (c)
an Instrument Landing System (ILS); (d) aircraft parking apron; (e) new air
passenger terminal building; (f) control toi-er; (g) crash-rescue building;
and (h) other related works.  It also includes consultants' services for the
design and supervision of construction, for strengthening the management of
DAC, and for the preparation of a National Aviation Plan. Total cost of
the project is estimated at $3h.8 million, including allowance for contingenc-
ies of ;7.0 rnillion.
l.        The new runway will be parallel to the existing one but located
l,OOOm (3,280 ft) to the south of it on. the other side of the Panama-Tocumen
highway. A connecting taxiway will join the two runways and cross the high«tTa;
via an overpass.  The possibility of improving the existing runway rather
than building a new one was considered but the new runway construction was
found to be more advantageous. The new passenger terminal building consists
of a main building with two satellite buildings connected to it by corridors.
m±his represents the first phase. Further development of the airport at a
later stage would provide additional facilities.   Handling of air cargo vill
require improvements in cargo handling facilities at the airport.   These wRil
bh financed and operated by the users.



16.        Panamanian Cabinet Decree No.13 of January 22, 1969 brought into
existence the Direccion de Aeronautica Civil (DAC), which will administer
the proposed Bank loan, as an autonomous state agency in charge of the
various civil aviation activities in Panama that were previously handled
through three separate government ministries. DAC has the right to own
property, to manage its internal affairs and to introduce regulations for
ensuring the effective performance of its functions. Its autonomy also extends
over the establishment of ernployirent policies and practices, introduction
of user charges and management of funds. Control is exercised by a Board of
Directors whose powers include the initial approval of operating and
investment budgets before their presentation to the Government, the establisih-
ment of user charges policies and rates, and the control of salaries. The
Board of Directors consists of the Minister of Government and Justice, the
Controller General of the Republic and the Commander of the Air Force. The
decree also created the position of Director General, the legal and adinnis-
trative head of DAC, responsible to the Board. In addition, there is an
advisory board without executive power consisting of the Director General of
DAC (Chairman)and representatives of the Department of Planning, the Tourism
Institute, the Ministry of Public Works, the national airlines, the foreign
airlines, and the National Pilots Association.
17.        DAC-s financial position is sound. Projected cash holdings will
be adequate to meet operating requirements and there should be some surplus
available to finance future technological improvements, particularly with
regard to safety and operational efficiency. A covenant of the proposed LoanL
Agreement provides that net cash generation from operations for the fiscal
year preceding will be at least 1.4 times the scheduled debt service requi-e-
ment for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt before any additional debt
can be assumed. Other particular covenants proposed would provide for the
establishment and maintenance of user charges as would enable the Borrower
to earn a financial rate of return on net fixed assets of at least 1.5 percenjt
in 1976 (i.e. after completion of construction) increasing to at least 6.5
percent in 1980 and thereafter. Projections indicate that returns after 19.(T
should increase to reach 16 percent in 1984.
18.        The principal direct economic benefits proposed as justification
for the project are time savings by arriving and departing passengers and
time savings by departing aircraft, and yield an economic rate of return on
the project as a whole of 18 percent to 20 percent. The investment in the
terminal building alone is estimated to yield betwqeen 13.5 percent and 17
percent. The runway would yield economic benefits from savings in aircraft
operating costs and runway maintenance costs, and from the land to be vacated
by moving general aviation facilities from an urban location to Tocumen. ThRf
economic return on the runway is estimated to range between 22 percent and 2`
percent based on these considerations and on alternative assumptions on the
extent of usage by new wide-bodied jet aircraft. In addition there are other
unquantifiable benefits to business by having a modem airport, particularly
considering the international nature of Panama's banking and business
activities and its potential for tourism.

PART IV - LEGAL IYSTRUT1ENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Direccion de
Aeronautica Civil, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Panama and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for trans-
portation projects.
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOINENDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan~
