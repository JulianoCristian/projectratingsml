productivity, encouraging privatization, and developing\n            institutions in the sector. Specifically, it would provide:\n            (a) technical assistance to WICO to enable it to operate\n            profitably as a private company, restructure its Mazamba and\n            Dedza sawmills and rehabilitate its Zomba mill. This\n            technical assistance would further provide critical spares\n            and equipment, establish training programs and carry out\n            feasibility studies for new processing facilities, product\n            development and quality control. A second (b) technical\n            assistance component to the Government would be used for\n            developing alternative uses for forest resources, mainly the\n            large Viphya Forest."}, "docdt": "1984-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
