restructuring the productive base of the\n            economy in order to reduce its dependence on the oil sector\n            and on imports. With this in mind, the loan will support\n            specific policy reforms such as (i) introduction of a\n            market-determined exchange rate system; (ii) elimination of\n            trade restrictions and price controls; and (iii)\n            implementation of a package of export incentives. The loan\n            will provide US$450 million equivalent to finance general\n            imports of goods and US$2 million equivalent to finance\n            technical assistance and training for export development and\n            subsector investment studies. These reforms are being\n            undertaken in the context of a structural adjustment program\n            recently approved by the Government."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
