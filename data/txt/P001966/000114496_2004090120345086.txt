Dear Sir,
      We refer to the above-mentioned Agreement, dated December 29,
1987 (the Agreement), between the Danish International Development
Agency (DANIDA) and the International Development Association (the
Association), and to your telex, dated January 11, 1990, requesting
the Association to consider postponing the due date for the payment
of the third tranche of the DANIDA grant under the Agreement.
      We are pleased to inform you that the Association has no
objection to your request and that, accordingly, the Association
hereby proposes to amend the third sentence of Section 2.01 of the
Agreement as follows:
      The first tranche shall be payable upon effectiveness of this
      Agreement, and subsequent trenches shall be payable on January
      7, 1989 and January 7, 1990, respectively, or at such later
      dates as the parties may agree from time to time.
      For the purposes of Section 2.01 of the Agreement, as herein
amended, it is also proposed that the due date for the payment of
the third tranche be postponed to January 7, 1991.
      Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment, on
behalf of DANIDA, by signing and dating the confirmation form on the
enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us for our records.
                                          Sincerely yours,
