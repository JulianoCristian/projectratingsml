Some lessons learned included: one general\n            lesson is the importance of sustaining a commitment to the\n            implementation of all components and taking sufficient\n            ownership of the project to: address any constraints early\n            on, resolve them to ensure effective project implementation\n            as originally designed, or modify the project if necessary.\n            Concerning the electricity sector, the project showed that\n            despite adequate technical design, satisfactory results\n            cannot be expected from implementing it in a fundamentally\n            defective institutional and financial context. This was\n            recognized in the cancellation of the component and the\n            subsequent resumption of dialogue on sector reform. Hence,\n            before a project begins substantial investment in system\n            expansion, there should be firm commitment, identified\n            mechanisms and some evidence of implementation to resolve\n            major institutional and financial impediments to the\n            satisfactory performance of the project and the sector. The\n            experience with the project's petroleum sector\n            component indicated the encouraging possibility of\n            developing an appropriate division of roles and\n            responsibilities between the public and private sectors, and\n            with a correct enabling environment attracting private\n            sector willingness to absorb fundamental risk. The\n            experience also indicated the importance of insuring that\n            the implementing agencies, including relevant ministries and\n            other supervisory bodies understand both Bank procurement\n            procedures and the basic principles of efficient procurement practices."}, "docdt": "1997-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
