The main\n            lessons from this assessment follow. 1) Substantial effort\n            is necessary to integrate economic restructuring reforms\n            with social, and poverty reduction objectives. 2) The Bank\n            needs to ensure that the rationale for reforms (i.e., better\n            provision of energy services to the public) is clear to\n            domestic stakeholders. 3) \"Ownership\" of a\n            project, or an element of a project is key to its success,\n            and it is necessary to ensure that project partners are\n            fully committed to the aims and the approach taken. This\n            occurred for the successful household energy component, but\n            not for the electricity component. 4) A dynamic, supportive,\n            and committed approach by the Bank throughout the lifetime\n            of the project is vital to success, as was the case in the\n            project's household energy component. 5) Regular\n            post-closing project follow-up by Bank operational staff\n            (i.e., while supervising other ongoing projects) may be\n            needed, to ensure projects are meeting their long-term\n            objectives, and to reinforce to project partners the\n            commitment of the Bank to the reform processes in the\n            recipient countries."}, "docdt": "2005-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
