1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal:

a.      Macro-economic situation at appraisal

Panama's macro-economic performance prior to loan approval was robust. In the three
years preceding loan approval, economic growth averaged 7.5 percent annually, inflation stayed
around 2 percent, and unemployment dropped from 11.4 percent in 2003, when the country
emerged from a recession, to 6.8 percent in 2006. Facilitated by Panama's open trade and
investment regime, economic growth was mostly led by a recovery of exports of goods and
services, with little spillover into the agriculture and industrial sectors. The latter two stagnated
behind protective barriers and regulatory rigidities. Growth also gained traction through the
government's project to expand the Panama Canal1 and the negotiation of a new free trade
agreement with the United States2. It was expected that growth would continue at similar rates
over the next few years.

After a previous deterioration of fiscal balances in 2003/04 due to a weakening in the
finances of the central government and in the accounts of the social security institute, fiscal
stabilization became a key priority of the new government. The Torrijos government, elected
in 2004, followed a path of strict fiscal discipline, which it achieved through measures aimed at
increasing the tax revenue, as well as a consolidation of fiscal expenditure. Tax revenues
increased from a low of 21.2 percent of GDP in 2004 to 25.3 percent in 2006, as a result of tax
reforms passed in 2005, more effective tax collection efforts as well as stronger economic
growth. On the other hand, public expenditures (excluding the Panama Canal Authorities) were
curtailed, and dropped from 26 percent of GDP in 2004 to 24.8 percent in 2006. A pension
reform was approved in June 2005 with World Bank support. The reform was expected to
contain future deficits of the Social Security Institute (CSS) that had been predicted over the
medium term in the absence of reform.

As a result of the reform measures, key fiscal ratios improved in the last three years prior
to loan approval. The overall fiscal deficit dropped from 4.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to 2.6
percent in 2005, and turned into a surplus in 2006. The primary fiscal balances exhibited
surpluses of respectively 1.8 and 4.9 percent of GDP in 2005/6 (see table 1). The positive fiscal
results led to a reduction in the public debt, which dropped from a peak of 66 percent of GDP in
2004 to under 58 percent of GDP in 2006. Assuming a continuation of prudent macro-economic
policies, both WB and IMF suggested that the debt levels would fall further.

  A study commissioned by the Panama Canal Authority estimated that the Canal expansion would raise economic
growth by roughly one percentage point per year over the next 25 years.

  The Panama-U.S. Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) was signed in Washington on June 28th of 2007, but was
still pending US Congress ratification at the approval of the DPL I.

b.    Core issues in competitiveness and public financial management prior to loan
approval

With regard to private sector development, the core issue was to foster economic growth
through broadening the economic base. Dynamic and internationally-competitive service
sectors coexisted with largely protected and mostly domestically-oriented agricultural and
manufacturing sectors with low productivity. Panama thus faced not only the challenge of
sustaining high rates of economic growth, but also of ensuring that growth became more broad-
based. These issues became more pressing given the pending trade agreement with the US,
which was expected to expose hitherto protected sectors to international competition.

Regarding the business enabling environment, available surveys and indicators pointed to
significant shortcomings. The general indicators measuring a country's competitiveness pointed
to issues in the areas of (i) labor regulations and the lack of well-trained human capital, (ii)
deficiencies in the area of innovation, as well as (iii) governance issues3. With regard to labor
market regulations, non-salary labor costs as well as firing costs were below regional averages,

3
  See i.e. the Global Competitiveness Report 2006 of the World Economic Forum. The Doing Business Indicators in
2006 pointed to a solid performance in the areas of starting a business, licensing, trading across borders and
registering property, where Panama ranked close to OECD averages. Enterprise surveys carried out in 2006
confirmed shortcomings in the regulatory environment, as well as rule of law and infrastructure.

                                                         6
and working hours more flexible, but those areas were overshadowed by high minimum wages in
relation to the average value added per worker, as well as restrictive firing regulations were more
than double the regional average (with a Doing Business 2009 rating of 172nd in the world).
Additionally, shortcomings persisted in the average skill level of the labor force, despite high
levels of school attendance. As concerns innovation, Panama lagged behind its peers in the use
of technology4, as well as research and development expenditures. Overall, less than 5 percent of
the population had a computer (compared to 11 and 12 percent for the LAC region and upper
middle income countries), and only 22 percent reported using the internet (compared to 26
percent for LAC and upper middle income countries). Research and development expenditures
were a mere 0.38 percent of GDP in 2002, compared to 0.57 percent for LAC and 2.5 percent for
OECD countries. Finally, the high level of informality5 as well as inefficiencies in government
bureaucracy and regulatory quality6 were perceived to be key issues.

In the area of public financial management, a variety of deficiencies were highlighted in
prior analytical work, namely the PER and CFAPAR. Social expenditures were
comparatively high at 17 percent of GDP, but these expenditures did not translate into higher
social indicators. The latter continued to be similar or below neighboring countries. This pointed
to inefficiencies in strategic planning, resource allocation and monitoring of government
expenditures. Shortcomings were also highlighted in the area of fiscal transparency. Fiscal
information was not sufficiently available to the public, which in part stemmed from deficiencies
in public sector accounting and the production of financial statements. Furthermore, in the
absence of forward-looking planning, deficits were repeatedly financed via payment arrears to
suppliers, which placed a burden on the private sector. Transactional controls for expenditures
were burdensome and slow, and resulted in additional payment delays. Finally, while the overall
procurement system was deemed to be satisfactory, the government embarked on a reform
program to modernize practices and reap potential fiscal savings through more transparent and
easier processes. It was expected that enhancements in the procurement system would facilitate
channeling World Bank and other donor funds through the national system, which in turn would
again help increasing the in-country capacity.

c.      Alignment of the DPL program with government and Bank strategies

The proposed series of DPLs was based on the government's program for increased and
sustained economic growth. In 2005, the government launched its national program, the
"Strategic Vision of Economic and Employment Development Toward 2009", which included
reform measures aiming at (i) reducing poverty and income inequality, (ii) foster economic
growth and employment, (iii) reform public finance, (iv) develop human capital, and (v) reform
and modernize the state. The government program was developed with strong stakeholder
participation. Selected economic and sector work from various donors, amongst them the Bank,
helped further refine the reform process. Overall, there was broad ownership of the reforms.

  Informality was estimated to range around 50% of the workforce in the Poverty Assessment done by the WB in
2000.

                                                  7
The two DPLs aimed at promoting broad-based growth, and supported public financial
management and private sector reforms measures under (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of the
government program. The triggers and pace of the reforms were closely aligned with the
government's own program, and were also informed by earlier analytical studies in the area of
the investment climate and public expenditure management7, as well as a Country Financial
Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report done jointly with the IADB in 2006. QAG
assigned high marks to the analytical work conducted by the Bank, and its impact on the
dialogue with the government.

The series of DPLs formed an integral and important part of the Country Partnership
Strategy. The Bank supported the government's reform programs through a variety of
development policy loans as well as investment lending. In the area of fiscal reforms, a Public
Finance and Institutional Development Policy Loan was approved in FY07, and supported the
government reform measures in the area of restoring fiscal sustainability and enhancing fiscal
management. The two DPLs under review followed up on the reform agenda from the first DPL
in the area of Public Financial Management, but also included reforms to enhance the country's
overall competitiveness. Additionally, technical assistance for public financial management
reforms was provided through a TA operation which was approved in FY 02 and which is still
ongoing. The CPS also foresaw other relevant technical assistance, namely support through DEC
for the national statistics system, debt management support through the Bank's treasury
department, and support for education reform and M&E system under a separate investment
loan.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

The interrelated development objectives of the DPL program were to promote broad-based
growth through the enhancement of private sector competitiveness and to consolidate fiscal
sustainability and public sector transparency and efficiency through the modernization of public
financial management systems.

To track program outcomes, the two DPLs provided a detailed matrix of indicators (see table 2).
The indicators were slightly changed during implementation and approved by the Board upon
presentation of the second DPL, in order to reflect changes in the triggers and to clarify
individual indicators (see also 1.6. and Annex 1). Section F upfront provides in-depth
information on the actual status of the individual indicators.

 The Investment Climate and the PER were presented to the government in 2006 and 2007, but were not published
upon request of the government.

 This is a Government target that is supported by the actions recognized under the DPL series. Evidently, there are
other macroeconomic factors that will influence the decline of the debt-to-GDP ratio, as well as some risks
discussed in Section VI (Part F).

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification:
Not applicable

1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The two DPLs supported the government reform program in the areas of fostering broad-based
growth, reforming public finance, developing human capital, and reforming and modernizing the
state. In particular, the proposed policy loans supported reform actions in two major areas:
(i) enhancement of competitiveness through red tape reduction, improved training policies and
     increased investments in innovation; and
(ii) modernization of public financial management through enhancements in revenue and debt
     management, fiscal transparency and governance, and public procurement.

A list of triggers and their implementation is presented under 2.1.

1.5    Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):
Not applicable.

1.6    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements
and schedule, and funding allocations):

The two DPLs were implemented within the expected timeframe, and with only limited
changes. Under the competitiveness component, the trigger to modernize 22 training facilities
was dropped. While the training facilities were revamped and re-equipped, it was determined
that this type of conditionality was more in line with an investment operation, not budget
support. Under procurement, the trigger to issue standard documents for public sector entities
subject to Law No 22 was eliminated due to the complexity of the task, and a lack of time to
finalize implementation. Instead, the issuance of framework contracts was added as a trigger9.
The change in triggers was acceptable, since the two DPLs aimed at supporting the overall
reform program of the government instead of specific conditionalities, and the government was
on track in implementing its program.

The key performance indicators were adjusted to reflect changes in triggers, or to further
specify the indicators. The indicator for Panama Tramita was refined to add "consolidating or
eliminating of procedures", and the indicator for outstanding accrual was substituted by "time
needed to process payment". Additionally, a benchmark for number of bidders in
PanamaCompra was included. Finally, the indicator to issue standard documents was dropped
with view to the eliminated trigger, and a benchmark for the expected reduction in average unit
cost under the framework costs was added

9
  The project appraisal document of the second DPL states that "The adoption of framework contracts is a de facto
standardization process, as goods are procured from a predetermined list using a standard purchase order, leading to
a higher level of transparency whilst at the same time removing discretionality from the purchasing process. The
new prior action is deemed by the GOP and the Bank team to exceed the impact of the original trigger because, as
explained earlier, framework contracts significantly generate both price and transaction cost savings, while standard
bidding documents are mostly concerned with the latter (para 75, page 29).

                                                    10
        With regard to funding, the overall envelope under the second DPL was increased by USD
        25 million upon request of the government. As the international financial and economic crisis
        intensified in 2008, revenues dropped and funding on the international capital markets became
        increasingly scarce and expensive10, the government approached the Bank regarding a possible
        augmentation of the funding envelop under the second DPL in the size of USD 100 million.
        Given the good progress made on the overall reform package, the World Bank agreed to top up
        the initially foreseen USD 75 million for the second DPL to USD 100 million without additional
        conditionalities, and to accelerate another DPL foreseen for FY10 to FY09, including a top-up
        from USD 50 million to USD 80 million. The latter was approved by the Board in March 200911.

        2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

        2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix):

        As shown in table 3, the government's program, as described in the policy matrix of the two
        DPLs under review, remained on track. All the action triggers were a condition for Board
        approval, and thus met prior to Board presentation of the respective loans.

        2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

        The Torrijos Government elected in 2004 enjoyed a strong political mandate and profited
        from a majority in the Legislative Assembly. This strong position facilitated the tackling of
        more difficult reforms, such as in tax administration and the implementation of e-government.
        Furthermore, the reform process profited from "reform champions" in selected positions, such as
        the SPIG, SENACYT and INADEH, and also benefited from direct support of the President.

        With regard to the digitalization progress, the complexity of the task and the vast number
        of entities involved in the process slowed down implementation. The institutional capacity in
        the agencies continues to vary significantly as far as their readiness for the introduction of e-
        government is concerned. In the absence of a detailed strategic plan and training programs to

        progress was slower than anticipated.

        A slowdown in the economy as well as the upcoming elections also had an impact on
        project implementation towards the end of the DPL cycle. In the second half of 2008, the
        turmoil on the international financial markets and the unfavorable developments in the area of
        international trade led to a reduction of economic growth rates and put pressure on the budget.
        Together with the national election in June 2009, this diverted to some degree the government's
        attention away from the reform progress and slowed implementation of the remaining reforms.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The matrix of policy actions and expected outcomes provided clear and measurable
performance indicators for each individual subcomponent, but mostly focused on outputs.
The provided indicators were well aligned with the actual triggers, and baseline and expected
target values were specified for most indicators. However, the indicators measured in many
instances mostly expected outputs, and not impact / outcomes. For example, one of the indicators
measured the availability of on-line transactions on Panama Trámita, but there is no target
included to assess actual usage of those on-line transactions, as well as cost and time reduction
achieved through the elimination of procedures. With regard to INADEH, the indicators measure
the number of participants instead of individuals trained, and little information is available to
measure the actual results of the training (i.e. the number of people that achieved a certain level
of proficiency, found a new job, were certified etc). On the public financial management side,
the actual usage of CAAT in audits does not necessarily reflect an improved capacity to conduct
audits, as will be discussed later. Finally, a change in tax administration, audit and collection
procedures should be expected to translate into increased compliance by legal and natural
persons, which could have been tracked. Nonetheless, some more meaningful outcome indicators
could have been included and the Bank could have pushed for the collection of relevant impact
information.

Shortcomings in the monitoring and evaluation system of the DPL are by and large the
consequence of deficiencies in the national statistical system and the lack of a monitoring
and evaluation culture in the country. As it was difficult to design outcome indicators in the
subject areas given the lack of available data and the short timeframe of implementation, the
Bank used easily available data as indicators for the DPLs, but supported the development of
M&E systems through respective TA operations. The Bank detailed in its Country Partnership
Strategy in 2007 its support to help advance the monitoring and evaluation system in Panama.
The strategy foresaw a general grant to the Controller's office for improved national statistics, as
well as M&E support through various TA loans, amongst them the Public Policy TA Loan and a
TA provided by the Bank's Treasury Department.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

On the Bank side, some follow-up in the area of public financial management will be provided
through the ongoing Public Policy Reform Technical Assistance Loan, and non-lending fiduciary
technical assistance. One area of focus is the procurement system, where a detailed road map has
recently been approved with bank support, and support will be provided for its implementation.
Furthermore, technical assistance is ongoing to further the General Comptroller's Office control
and audit models, and to help implement the Fiscal Responsibility Law through enhanced
results-based budgeting, institutional capacity building and public investment planning. Selected




                                             16
support will likely also be provided by the IMF12 and other donors. On the private sector
development side, there is currently no direct follow-up planned.


3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

The supported reform areas continue to be relevant for Panama. As discussed above, the
reforms in the area of competitiveness and public financial management were in line with
various relevant analytical assessments13. They continue to be relevant today, and both the new
government and the latest progress report of the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy highlight
continued support for individual reform areas. The timing of the loans was well aligned with
budgetary requirements and, upon request of the government, stayed within the election cycle.

As described in the PAD of the first operation, the two sets of objectives were mutually
reinforcing. The PAD states (p.2) that "public financial management systems that contribute to
fiscal discipline, operational efficiency and strategic allocation of resources are critical elements
of public sector effectiveness, which in turn can positively influence the country's enabling
environment for private sector development. Moreover, both are critical for achieving progress
toward the GOP's overarching objective of increasing and sustaining broad-based economic
growth in Panama, which would in turn contribute to continued fiscal stability".
Regarding the design, the two DPLs involved a number of agencies that were in charge of
implementing the reforms. While this is necessary given the nature of the reforms involved, the
number and variety of agencies nevertheless introduced an element of complexity into the policy
loans and the dialogue with the counterparts.

3.2    Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between policy actions supported by the operation and outcomes):

The overarching objectives of the series of DPLs, namely to promote broad-based growth
through the enhancement of private sector competitiveness and to consolidate fiscal
sustainability and public sector transparency and efficiency through the modernization of public
financial management systems, were achieved. As can be seen in Section F upfront, progress
towards the medium-term outcome indicators has been steady, and at completion the vast
majority of indicators have been met, with the remaining expected to be met shortly due to the
implemented reforms. Furthermore, all the reforms were implemented, as reflected in the above
matrix of triggers. The following two subsections provide detailed information on the two areas
of reforms and progress made towards enhancements in competitiveness and fiscal sustainability.

   The IMF has recently opened a regional technical assistance center for Central America, which will provide ­
amongst other areas, support to individual countries in the area of tax and customs policy and administration, public
debt markets, and support for the development of MTEFs and sound public financial management systems.
13
   As discussed above, those were for example the unpublished Investment Climate Report (2006), the Doing
Business Indicators, the Kaufman and Kraay indicators and the Global Competitiveness Report of the World
Economic Forum, as well as an unpublished PER and the CFAPAR, published in 2007.

                                                    17
Overall, the macro-economic situation continued to be sound during project
implementation14. Growth rates reached 9.2 percent in 2008, after an average real growth of 8.8
percent between 2004 and 2007. The strong growth was the result of continuous external and
domestic demand, which only lately dropped off due to the global economic recession and a
slow-down of domestic demand. Similar to other countries, inflation rose in the last two years to
double-digit figures due to higher food and commodity prices as well as a surge in internal
demand, but declined again in the second half of 2008, reaching 3.7 percent year on year in
March 2009. The current account deficit increased to 12.4 percent of GDP in 2008, up from 7.3
percent in 2007, due to higher oil prices in combination with increased domestic demand and the
expansion of the Canal. It was mostly financed by foreign direct investment (10.4 percent of
GDP in 2008). Unemployment further dropped, reaching 5.6 percent at the end of 2008.

3.2.1 Reforms to foster competitiveness (satisfactory)

Under this component, the fundamental objective of the DPLs was to promote broad-based
growth by enhancing private sector competitiveness. Such competitiveness enhancement was to
be achieved by reducing business transaction costs, improving labor productivity by upgrading
workers' skills, and increasing business productivity by fostering innovation. Medium-term
outcomes and indicators have been met, as summarized in the tables presented at the beginning
of the document (Section F, Results Framework). Furthermore, as can be seen in Chart 1, the
fundamental objective of this component has been achieved, implying a satisfactory outcome
rating.

As confirmed by competitiveness indicators for Panama, the country made good progress
towards enhancing its competitiveness ranking worldwide, but corruption continues to
pose a problem. In the area of government's effectiveness, Panama made measureable progress
in reducing bureaucratic hurdles and facilitating procedures. Panama's ranking in the World
Economic Forum's Competitiveness Report improved during the last few years by 2 ranks
overall, and around 6 ranks if based on the sample of countries used in 2006. While Panama
continues to show shortcomings on the institutional side and on health and education indicators
(rank 70 and 64 respectively), the positive overall ranking is based on good infrastructure and
solid macro-economic performance15. The supported reforms have yet to translate into a
reduction of corruption. Based on the 2008 Global Corruption Barometer from Transparency
International, 64 percent of the surveyed population considered the government's measures to
fight corruption as ineffective ­ amongst the worst results for LAC countries. Correspondingly,
most of the corruption indices have not changed, or further deteriorated16.

   The compiled Doing Business indicator for Panama is only available for the last two years, and shows a slight
deterioration in Panama's ranking, despite reform progress in selected areas. The deteriorated ranking is likely the
result of measurable reform measures undertaken in other countries.

a.       Increase business competitiveness by reducing transaction costs.

The reduction of transaction costs for doing business has been built upon simplifying
and/or eliminating existing processes, and digitalizing as many processes as possible. Both
actions are conducive to a reduction in processing time and therefore to an overall reduction in
costs. SPIG has been instrumental in the strategic planning, design, and development of the
GOP's efforts to simplify and digitalize processes. However, execution responsibilities are
assigned to different ministries, which led to differences in progress due to various levels of e-
readiness in the respective ministries. It has not been easy to manage the cultural change needed
to migrate from a rather bureaucratic paper-based environment to simplified digitalized
processes in a short period of time. Furthermore, the GOP's reform program was very ambitious
in scope, which although well intentioned, ended building up complexity to the overall project.

PanamaEmprende has become an effective one-stop virtual site for the registration and
licensing of most businesses in Panama. Law 5 from January 2007 established the concept
where people wishing to start a new business in Panama may do it in a simple way, with the sole
obligation of informing the State that they are starting a new operation. This requirement is met
through the Operation Notice, which now is the only step required for starting most commercial,
industrial or service activity in the country17. The Operation Notice automatically triggers other
registrations, such as the Taxpayer's Unique Registry (RUC) and the Registry of New Businesses
before the relevant municipality. Fees can be paid electronically with no need to go through
different institutions. The public may access the system, and anyone can obtain information on
the companies doing business. Another important achievement of PanamaEmprende has been
enhanced transparency. Being a digital "one-stop window", the risk of irregular payments or
undue delays in the process has been eliminated. PanamaEmprende also allows for increased
tax/revenue collections by facilitating the formalization of economic activity in the country.

Progress towards establishing a digitalized Ventanilla Unica was made, but implementation
stalled. The Ventanilla Unica was meant to become the on-line tool for all export-import
processes, and a strategic design for the digitalization of the processes was finalized in December
2008. However, in the meantime, the government determined that a different e-portal should be
launched, which would encompass both export-import as well as investment processes. This new
portal, Panamarket, is currently in the design stage, and implementation of the Ventanilla Unica
was put on hold. Two other relevant projects in the area of export / import were digitalized:
AMP for the registration of cargo ships, and SDMC to control commercial goods movements in
the Colon Free Trade Zone and facilitate interaction between traders, banks, and customs.




17
   It should be noted that there are a few exceptions to this rule. Specifically regulated activities (i.e. banking,
insurance, liquor sales, security services, etc.) will still need to go first to their regulatory bodies before completing
the Operation Notice. But even in these cases, the ICR mission was informed in the field that the processes have
been shortened and simplified considerably.

                              20
Finally, progress was made towards digitalizing government transactions within the
Panama Trámita portal. This portal is mostly geared to individuals, and progress has been
made towards the digitalization of transactions related to the processing of passports, identity
cards, government issued certificates, and similar activities. These transactions require the
participation of a wide array of government agencies, the establishment of clear procedures, and
the harmonization of systems. This coordination has proved to be a significant challenge, thus
slowing down the pace of implementation. Nevertheless, as of April 2009, 90 different
transactions have been completely digitalized. Additionally, the portal provides information on
the documentation requirements for other processes that are not yet fully digitalized. The latter
has enhances transparency in the system.

This "technological road" chosen to enhancing business competitiveness has not been free
of difficulties. While the strategy was put in place, it was not translated into a comprehensive
Action Plan ("execution roadmap"). The latter is a very important tool for the coordination,
monitoring, control and evaluation of progresses being made, particularly given the complexity
of reforms supported in the area of digitalization. It is the coordination of execution efforts what
precisely has shown certain weaknesses.

b.      Improvement of labor productivity by upgrading workers' skills.

INADEH's performance has extended beyond the required actions, as it increased its
outreach to social groups and geographic areas that had not been served before. Given the
significant shortfalls in Panama's educational system, INADEH plays a key role in the country to
enhance the level of education and improve labor productivity. The institute has been focusing
on: a) building a training offer to serve the new labor demand generated by the economic growth
sustained by Panama in the last few years, b) working closely with universities in order to
facilitate the access and/or recognition of INADEH trained workers/students into tertiary level
education, c) building a fruitful mutually beneficial interaction with Private Sector entities and
developing recognized certification norms for selective occupations in high demand, and d)
reaching ­ in an exceptional effort ­ indigenous communities and other less privileged social
groups (single parents and jobless youth) to include them in its programs and tailoring their
courses for the benefit of these communities.

Through its various activities, INADEH has achieved significant impact in the last few
years. As described in the Annex, INADEH's 400 training programs involved over 200,000
participants in the last year alone. Furthermore, INADEH successfully trained instructors for
evening courses provided by the Ministry of Education (MEDUCA). Additionally, INADEH
entered into an agreement with the universities to allow that courses offered by INADEH are
acknowledged. As a result, topography students at INADEH may now claim credits towards
their acceptance at the University of Panama in order to further their education. A similar
situation has benefited INADEH's students of general and auto mechanics, who can now
continue to develop their technical knowledge and skills at the Technological University of
Panama. Finally, INADEH is reaching to foreign entities for the certification of technical labor



                                             21
competencies, and is working on an agreement with Electricity Workers Unions in Washington
DC, United States, to this effect.
Lately, INADEH has also ventured into virtual training to facilitate access to training. It
trained 150 tutors and instructors to staff its 96 virtual training centers, 53 of which are already
fully operational. These units ­ distributed all over the country ­ are equipped with 17 personal
computers each, and provide access to on-line training to students who do not have home access
to the Internet. As can be seen in table 4 below, a significant post-2006 increase in the overall
number of courses and beneficiaries is noticeable, as well as the inclusion of more indigenous
communities in INADEH's programs during the last 2 years.

c.         Increase business productivity by fostering innovation

A Strategic National Plan for the Development of Science, Technology and Innovations has
been launched. It encompasses the cooperation and interaction of the CNCYT (National
Commission of Science and Technology), the CICYT (Science, Technology, and Innovation
Inter-ministerial Commission), SENACYT (National Secretary for Science, Technology and
Innovation), and 13 Sector Commissions representing public, private, academic, and social
sectors. The whole system operates on the principles on "integration" (coordinated action) and
"transversalidad" (meaning the incorporation of components of science, technology, and
innovation across the board in all of its activities). It also encourages a closer interaction and
better understanding between the scientific community and the public and private sectors.



                                                           22
A significant step forward to fostering innovation was the approval of Law 56 in December
2007. The Law established the National Research System in Panama, governed by a National
Directive Council formed by 3 representatives of the GOP at ministerial level (Presidency,
Education, and Science, Technology and Innovation) and 4 representatives of research centers,
scientific organizations, universities, and private sector.  

Within this framework, SENACYT plays a key role in fostering innovation through the use
of science and technology. Its mission is to "convert" science and technology in tools to achieve
sustainable development for Panama. SENACYT was created in 1997 and was given
administrative autonomy by Law 50 in December 2005. At present ­ through a formal
arrangement ­ PNUD provides administrative support to SENACYT, improving the level of
transparency and effectiveness in its financial management. All SENACYT's activities, projects,
and programs are in compliance with the guidelines established by the Strategic National Plan
for the Development of Science, Technology, and Innovation.

The lengthy process for the production of statistics in Panama creates difficulties that are
very noticeable in the particular case of SENACYT. It takes a significant amount of time for
final year-end statistics to become available. According to the nature of the statistics, certain
entities are responsible for the development of the indicators, and SENACYT deals with Science
and Technology related ones. The process of capturing information is done during the first
semester after the year-end, and under normal circumstances, the compilation, tabulation and
analysis of the captured data takes an additional 6 months. This means that the final data usually
becomes available with a delay of between 13 and 18 months after the data date (i.e. 2005 data is
made available during first half of 2007). As from 2006 SENACYT identified the need to
enhance the level of analysis of the captured data, which added delays in the final output. As a
consequence of the above, it was only possible to obtain official 2005 data, preliminary 2006
data, and as from 2007 all data is according to goals/objectives as informed by SENACYT.
Although no doubts are raised regarding the authenticity of the information provided, it has not
been possible to verify such data with reliable final statistics, giving grounds to some concerns
regarding the accuracy of the information and/or the likelihood of eventual adjustments in the
final figures.

Budget execution improved during 2007 and 2008, reaching an average of 93 percent.
Investment represented 85 percent of the total budget and operating expenses remained stable at
around 15 percent. This performance is significantly better than during the period 2004-2006,
where budget execution averaged 77 percent, with investment representing 57 percent and
operating expenses 43 percent of available budgetary resources. Over 60 percent of the funds
allocated to the financing of R&D projects during the period 2004-09 have been to the bio-
science and agri-business sectors. Additionally ­ during the same period - there have been 181
projects related to innovation and the promotion of science and technology financed for an
amount of $5.8mm. All together, this adds to a total of projects financed for $14.4mm.

3.2.2. Reforms to enhance the efficiency of Public Financial Management (satisfactory)

Under the Public Financial management component of the loan, the focus was on sustaining
fiscal discipline, increasing the impact of public spending, and enhancing government efficiency.

                                            23
This was to be achieved through modernization of public financial management systems for
revenue, debt, fiscal reporting, and public procurement. It was expected that those reforms would
also supporting the environment for investment and business development. As can be seen in
Table 3, all the triggers were met, and solid progress has been made with regard to the key
performance indicators. Reform progress under this reform component is thus rated satisfactory.

Confirmed by the IMF Article IV surveillance mission18, public financial management
continued to be sound. The nonfinancial public sector balance remained positive during the last
three years, despite a large increase in public investment to 7 percent of GDP in 2008, and
additional social expenditures in the range of 1 percent of GDP to compensate for higher costs of
living. This positive development was possible due to a favorable external environment, as well
as fiscal reforms implemented in the earlier years, which led to higher revenues. Furthermore,
the government managed to contain current spending, mostly through a reduction of the share of
wages, social security deficits and pensions, but also due to lower overall interest payments. The
government's debt level continued to drop, and reached 38 percent of GDP in 2008 based on
latest IMF data. Given this positive development, which is also reflected in its EMBI spread (see
Chart 2), Panama was one of the few Latin American countries that were able to tap the
international capital markets in 200919. The project supported reforms played an important role
in achieving this overall satisfactory outcome.

The increased fiscal revenue is in part due to reforms in tax administration, which were
supported under the DPL program. Two areas of administrative reforms were tackled. On the
one hand, the Dirección General de Ingresos (DGI) developed monthly audit strategies, which
focus on sectoral audits of legal entities to enhance overall compliance within the respective
sector through a more massive effort. The sectors to be audited are determined by a sophisticated
computer model, which "detects" outliers and also matches the various data provided from other
sources to provide information on potential inconsistencies. The new strategy has proven to be
an efficient way of using the scarce human resources available in the DGI. Growth rates for
direct taxes paid by legal entities ranged on average around 60 percent between 2004 and 2008,
and the number of legal entities filing taxes increased by 14 percent during 2005 and 2007. On
the other hand, DGI fostered digitalization of tax filings to enhance its institutional efficiency.
Mandated by law, all direct taxes now are being submitted electronically, either in the form of
disks, or via on-line transfers (see Chart 2). This requirement has put some additional strain on
the taxpayer, in particular given the low computer penetration and internet access of the
population, but helped bring down internal processing times and costs. Further reforms might be
warranted in the area of tax reimbursements, which continue to be cumbersome, both for the
DGI and the taxpayer.

A Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law was enacted in June 2008, with technical support
from both the IMF and the World Bank. The law stipulates that the fiscal deficit should not

   Early 2009 saw some resumption of external issuances by a few of the higher-rated sovereigns in the region:
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Peru were all able to tap global capital markets. Panama successfully
placed USD 323 million in bonds on the international bond markets in March 2009.


                                                   24
fall under 1 percent of GDP20, unless economic growth drops below 1 percent, and that the total
public debt should stay below 40 percent of GDP from 2015 on21. Additionally, the law includes
provisions to enhance the fiscal accounts, and to increase fiscal transparency through provisions
of periodic compliance reports and increased public access to the medium-term fiscal
framework. There seems to be consensus in the empirical literature that strong fiscal institutions
and clear budget rules are in general associated with lower deficits and funding costs22, and the
law ­ if implemented - can thus be expected to have a positive impact on public financial
management. The law became effective in January 2009, and it is expected that Panama will be
able to meet this year's fiscal deficit target despite the slowdown in growth. However, in order
not to replicate the experience with the former fiscal responsibility law23, it is important that
Panama continues to make further progress in strengthening its fiscal institutions. This includes
reinforcing budget planning, execution and reporting, and strengthening accounting, statistical
and transparency standards. Furthermore, guidelines should be elaborated that detail the
procedures to be adhered to in case of a rapid deterioration in economic growth. It should also be
noted that the law does not specify sanctions for non-adherence, and the institutional
responsibilities are not clearly determined. Thus, implementation of the law hinges currently on
reputational incentives.

Progress was also made in the area of public debt management, but further capacity
building is needed, and the government needs to focus on developing the domestic debt
market. With World Bank technical support, the Government developed an analytical tool for
debt management as well as guidance for its application. The tool helped the government better
understand the available data, and assess costs and risks associated with individual strategies. In
part as a result of enhancements in debt management, the government extended the average debt
maturities, and was able to lower the costs of borrowing. Furthermore, the government reacted
proactively to a drying up of the international capital markets in the fall of 2008, and sought
additional financing from donors to secure the expected financing need for 2009. The overall risk
rating of the government has remained favorable (see EMBI evolution in Chart 2). However, it
should be noted that the new debt management model was only used once to assess cost-benefits
of extending the overall debt maturities, but since then has not been applied due to limited
internal capacity. Sustained efforts will be needed to reap the full benefit out of the tool,
including a further refinement of the model and the preparation of a medium-term debt
management strategy as well as further capacity building. Additionally, the government needs to
focus on developing the local debt market, which is of particular relevance given the size and
importance of the banking system in the country.

With regard to enhancing the functioning of the audit office, several reforms were
implemented, albeit with mixed results. Supported by the IADB, the government is
introducing a National Integrated Financial Management System (SIAFPA), which should
enhance transparency and accuracy in budget planning and execution. The General

   The Law was approved in 2002 but never really implemented in the absence of clear sanction mechanisms and
deficiencies in accountability.

Comptroller's Office (CGR) introduced a reporting tool to track the processing time for payment
verification, which allowed identifying and removing bottlenecks in internal processes. As a
result, over 97 percent of all payments are now being verifying within 15 days after reception
(with the majority being approved within 2-3 days), compared to 67 percent in 2006. This led to
a significant reduction in payment times, as shown in Chart 2, and contributed to an enhanced,
overall government efficiency. However, the computer software used by the CGR for the
tracking of payments is not compatible with the one used for the remaining payment process.
This leads to a duplication of data entry and reduces the potential benefits of computerization. As
regards the CGR's audit function, the introduction of computer added audit tools was not
successful. In the absence of a more radical change in culture and "the way of doing business",
most of the audits are still based on an assessment of manually created Excel spreadsheets, and
the actual application of CAAT technique has remained limited over time. The government is
currently seeking support from an external consultant for analyzing needed reforms to modernize
and computerize audits.

Reforms were initiated to enhance the procurement function in the government, and
Panama is now one of the few countries in the world in which Bank procurement is done
through the national system. The thrust of the reform progress has been on the implementation
of PanamaCompra, which has emerged as the on-line platform for government purchases with
the exception of the Panama Canal Authority (PCA), the Social Security Administration and ­
until a further roll-out has been implemented ­ the municipalities. PanamaCompra so far only
covers the publication of information on government procurement needs, but plans are advance
to include the on-line bidding in the near future. The government is now solely using
PanamaCompra for the publication of upcoming purchases and tenders, and in April 2009, over
13,000 bidders were formally registered in PanamaCompra to receive the information. Since its
introduction in December 2006, more than 200,000 contracts for a total amount of around 2.5
billion UDS were made publicly available through PanamaCompra (May 2009)24. In order to
increase transparency and minimize petty corruption, it would desirable to prioritize the
implementation of the on-line bidding process.

Finally, the DPL program also supported the development and implementation of
framework contracts. Experience in other countries suggests that these types of contracts can
significantly reduce the individual costs of small scale purchases through a lowering of price and
procedural costs. Furthermore, framework contracts can increase the transparency of
procurement processes and eliminate potential for petty corruption. In Panama, 21 annual
framework contracts were negotiated since 200725, and savings in the range of US$ 100 million
have been reaped so far based on information from the authorities, including i.e. a 5 million
savings for fuel purchases.

   Based on a recent management report of the GDCP, more than 8,219 public contracts were minor purchases

The procurement reforms are generating a cultural change in the way both the GOP and
suppliers do business. Procurement processes in Panama continue to be characterized by a
multitude of different processes and requirements in individual agencies. To streamline
processes, the government of Panama created the Dirección General de Contrataciones Publicas
in July 2008, which is in charge of modernizing and coordinating the procurement process for
the public sector. As a milestone, it published a Strategic Plan for public sector procurement in
February 2009, which was developed with World Bank support. The strategy is publicly
available26, provides a clear road map of reforms needed to foster the digitalization of the
government's procurement processes, coordinates the implementation and harmonization in
various agencies, and also provides monitoring tools to measure actual progress. The existence
of a detailed strategy and road map will likely facilitate the full roll-out of the platform, and
facilitate the standardization of bidding documents.

3.3       Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs):

Rating: satisfactory

Based on the significant achievements made in the area of tax administration, procurement
reforms, internal audit function of the government, fiscal responsibility legislation as well as
vocational training, the provision of technology services and the introduction of e-government
processes for doing business, the overall outcome for each of the DPLs is rated to have been
satisfactory. The Government's reform program lead to an overall enhancement of Panama's
competitiveness, as measured by available international indicators such as the Global
Competitiveness Report of the WEF and the Doing Business Reports, and is also reflected in the
favorable evolution of key fiscal indicators.

3.4    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously
covered or to amplify discussion above):

(a)       Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

While the two DPLs did not have a direct impact on poverty reduction, the reforms did
support the economic development in the country, and have likely contributed to the
overall favorable developments in the area of poverty. The training programs administered
by INADEH provided training to semi-skilled and unskilled workers, thus enhancing their
profile on the job market. Close to two-thirds of the people attending trainings in the first quarter
of 2009 were women. Additionally, INADEH reached out to indigenous communities, and rural
areas, which were previously not covered. Furthermore, the increased transparency of
government procedures and the required documentation as well as the reduction in costs is likely
to have a larger cost reduction impact on SMEs than on larger domestic firms, which usually can
handle those processes more efficiently due to scale.

                                               28
The measured incidence of poverty dropped in the last few years, but continues to be high
for an upper middle income country. Based on the latest LSMS Survey conducted in Panama
in 2008, poverty fell in the last few years from 37.3 percent in 1997 and 36.8 percent in 2003 to
32.4 percent of the population in 2008. Poverty continues to be most prevalent in rural and
indigenous communities, but the reported incidence has declined significantly in those areas. The
capital-intensive services sector and highly skilled laborers in the two main cities, Panama City
and Colon, were the main beneficiaries of the solid economic growth, while lower-skilled
laborers, as well as the rural population saw only a minor improvement in economic opportunity.
Although GNI per capita based on the Atlas method increased from USD 3,740 in 2000 to USD
4,940 in 2006, poverty continued to be pervasive in certain pockets of the population, as
reflected in a GINI coefficient of 56,1 percent for 2007. Based on the latest available figure
available at appraisal, 37 percent of the population lived below the national poverty line in 2003,
and 17 percent in extreme poverty.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development):

The reforms supported under the two DPLs had a major impact on institutional
strengthening:

      With regard to training, INADEH emerged as a key provider of vocational training, and has
      made various efforts to further the education agenda in Panama. Progress in the area of e-
      government has helped make individual government processes more transparent and also led
      to some reduction of administrative hurdles, particularly in the area of starting a business.
      However, the majority of e-government reforms is still at an early stage and need to be
      advanced significantly in order to reap the full benefits of streamlining of procedures and
      digitalizing processes.
      In the area of public financial management, the introduction of PanamaCompra laid the
      foundation for comprehensive procurement reforms, and it is expected that the full
      implementation of the electronic procurement platform will lead to a complete revamping of
      the institutional processes. The institutional capacity in other government institutions,
      amongst them the tax authority DGI, the debt management office, as well as the Comptroller
      Office (CGR) have increased, which led to a reduction in costs and more efficient
      government processes.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: moderate

While the new government is committed to further the reform processes supported under the
DPLs, and to continue prudent fiscal management, risks to the sustainability of the reforms
cannot be ruled out at the current stage, leading to a moderate risk rating:

The transition to the new government is likely to slow down reform implementation. During
the ICR mission, it became already apparent that a larger number of staff in individual
government agencies is in transition, which will likely lead to a loss of institutional capacity, and
can potentially proof to be disruptive to on-going programs. At the current stage, it cannot be
precluded that individual reform areas, which have shown to be more cumbersome like Panama
Tramita, will continue on the same scale.

Medium-term economic risks could also affect the sustainability of some of the reforms.
The impact of the global financial and economic crisis has already started to translate into lower
economic growth in Panama, a decline in exports, as well as a reduction in Canal traffic. While
the expectation is that the country will not fall into a recession, a significant reduction in
economic growth in combination with lower fiscal revenues could potentially impact the
adherence to the Fiscal Responsibility Law, and also slow further reforms through a reduction of
budgetary envelops.

Finally, it should be noted, that the funds for INADEH were cut in half during last year
due to an overall tighter budget, as well as a shift in expenditures during the national
elections. While INADEH as an institution has build up significantly its institutional capacity, its
legal framework does not permit it to solicit money from the private sector, neither in the form of
training fees, nor through other contributions. Although the new President has made public his
support and appreciation for the work being done by INADEH, an increase in its budgetary
resources will be needed to be able to maintain the achieved capacity, and to further its outreach.


5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation
and outcome issues)

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: Satisfactory
As discussed above, the program supported under the two DPLs was relevant, and well
designed. The reform program was fully aligned with the government's own priorities and
reform strategies, and the Bank delivered relevant analytical work in both areas of reforms to
support reform implementation and share international experience. The task team members of



                                             30
the core analytical work were also involved in the preparation of the two loans, which helped
continuity in the dialogue. The analytical work was deemed helpful by the government.27

Shortcomings in the M&E framework are mostly the result of a lack of available
information in the country. The Bank was aware of those shortcomings and discussed the lack
of available impact indicators in internal meetings. As mentioned above, the decision was taken
to use available information, and support M&E enhancements through investment lending and
non-lending technical assistance in selected areas.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

Rating: Satisfactory

During the project completion mission, the government expressed appreciation for the
Bank's support for the on-going reform process, and the targeted and timely technical
assistance provided in the area of public financial management reforms. Throughout
implementation, the Bank maintained a close dialogue on public financial management reforms
with the government, and Bank budget was made available to provide selected technical
assistance to the government. The task team leader and the core team of the DPL were also
involved in the technical assistance operations, which allowed for continuity and a more in-depth
dialogue.

In the area of competitiveness, the on-going dialogue was made difficult by high staff
turnover. The task team leader changed three times during project implementation, as a result of
staff rotation to new departments within the Bank. Additionally, the team composition also
changed for similar reasons. There are however no indications that this staff turnover negatively
impacted the quality of the supervision, and supervision inputs and processes were adequate for a
DPL. The government and main counterparts were overall satisfied with the dialogue on the
private sector components. The Task Team made an effort to enhance and further detail the
available indicators during supervision, which translated into some refinements of the indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory. The reform program was based on prior
analytical work, were relevant and the loan conditionalities were well aligned with the
government's own reform program. During supervision, the Bank provided targeted support in
selected reform areas upon request of the government.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

27
  According to the Country Partnership Strategy (p. 18), the government "praised the responsiveness of the Bank to
the administration's development strategy and the contribution of analytical and technical assistance from the Bank
(p. 16, para 27.)

                                                    31
Rating: Satisfactory

The government put forward a very ambitious reform agenda, which aimed at
modernizing the state and facilitating private sector growth. The reforms were broadly
discussed, translated into clear political strategies, and were based on analytical findings in the
respective areas. Additionally, "reform champions" were in place in key agencies to coordinate
and push the respective agenda. The agencies under reform were put in charge of the actual
implementation, which is considered best practice for Latin America.

While the government had the needed political mandate to put forward this reform agenda,
it did not translate well defined political strategies into concrete action plans and
performance targets to trace implementation. This is not unusual in Latin America, but led to
inefficiencies in reform implementation. The ambitious reforms in the area of e-government
likely underestimated the level of institutional capacity needed to implement a broad and far-
reaching revamping of administrative procedures, and the needed coordination and capacity
building efforts to bridge differences in e-readiness between the various agencies. These
shortcomings have lately been addressed in selected reform areas, such as in procurement, where
a detailed road map of actions has been elaborated. While progress on the overall reform
program has been achieved and has been impressive in some areas, progress in other areas such
as Panama Tramita and the Ventanilla Unica was slow and entailed some inefficiencies. Many of
the started reforms are not yet completed and so far only bear limited fruits. Finalization will
depend on the new government's support for a continuation of the reform program, which
appears to be given.

Continuation and provided funding for the reform progress have overall been good, with the
exception of the budgetary allocation for INADEH in 2009. Given those minor shortcomings, the
ICR opts to rate Borrower performance as satisfactory, despite the many achievements which
could otherwise argue for a highly satisfactory rating.


6.           Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

The ICR concurs in general with the lessons learned from prior DPLs in Panama mentioned in
the Project Appraisal Document for the new Development Policy Loan "Protecting the Poor
under Global Uncertainty28. Additionally, some lessons of general applicability can be drawn
from the two Competitiveness and Public Financial Management DPLs:

        Strategic plans need to be translated into clear action plans, which include monitorable
        output indicators to track progress. Governments might be reluctant to invest the needed
        time to develop such action plans, particularly given the short time-frame that most
        governments in the Latin American region face due to election laws. However, experience
        has repeatedly shown that the lack of coordination and prioritization leads to inefficiencies
        in implementation, and slows down reform implementation.

     p. 26

                                               32
      Several government agencies expressed regret of not having invested more time and
      energy into developing a solid monitoring and evaluation framework. In the absence of
      such information, there is only limited evidence to argue for sustained funding and support,
      which makes agencies more vulnerable to political shifts. Additionally, the government
      loses an opportunity to "market" achieved results, and use the data to convince other
      stakeholders and involved agencies of the need for reform.
      Available BB funds can provide the needed flexibility to react to government request,
      and maintain a close dialogue with the government on selected areas of interest. While
      funding through a technical assistance loan was available to help implement some of the
      reforms, those funds usually are not flexible enough to cover "quick turnaround" analysis,
      and ongoing knowledge building support. The provision of additional Bank budget funds
      did allow several Bank experts to maintain a close contact with the government and to
      provide targeted short-term support.
