outcome is rated highly\n            satisfactory, and sustainability of project outcomes is\n            likely. The overall performance of both the World Bank and\n            the Borrower is rated satisfactory. Lessons emerged\n            regarding the need for technical assistance to support\n            substantial policy reforms. They are: 1) Pairing a TA\n            operation with an adjustment lending one was an excellent\n            combination, which helped the counterpart to achieve the\n            policy objectives of adjustment program with much higher\n            quality, stronger ownership, and better assurance for\n            sustainability. 2) This project is proof that with limited\n            resources and their strategic use, major achievements can be\n            nmade in moving policy reforms forward. 3) The\n            Borrower's commitment and ownership are essential for\n            successful implementation of critical policy reforms. 4) The\n            way in which pension reform was managed and coordinated is\n            an excellent example of being able to carry out complex and\n            sensitive pension policy reforms by involving all\n            stakeholders. 5) Continuity of staff is important. 6) Bank\n            support to the Steering Committee in designing and\n            implementing a public information campaign was essential for\n            two reasons: to achieve a consensus on the need for the\n            pension reform among major stakeholders and 2) to get public\n            support for the planned policy reforms. 7) Even in countries\n            with a more stable political and civil environment, the\n            passage of legislation through the Parliament might require\n            more time than planned."}, "docdt": "2002-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
