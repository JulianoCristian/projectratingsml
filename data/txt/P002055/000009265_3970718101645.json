program to\n            develop, in five selected states of Nigeria, a structure\n            capable of providing technical advice and credit to small-\n            and medium-scale enterprises (SME).  It would strengthen\n            NBCI as a financial institution, develop its capacity to\n            lend to SMEs, and train federal and state extension workers\n            in the promotion, appraisal, and supervision of SMEs.  In\n            addition to credit and training, the project would provide\n            for some further studies concerning the SME subsector, in\n            particular the potential of small contractors.  Since this\n            would be the first effort at an integrated approach to SME\n            development in Nigeria, the project could experience some\n            delay in putting in place the proper institutional\n            structure.  The project seeks to reduce this risk through\n            the strengthening of NBCI."}, "docdt": "1983-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
