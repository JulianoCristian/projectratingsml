program to\n            develop, in five selected states of Nigeria, a structure\n            capable of providing technical advice and credit to small-\n            and medium-scale enterprises (SME). It would strengthen NBCI\n            as a financial institution, develop its capacity to lend to\n            SMEs, and train federal and state extension workers in the\n            promotion, appraisal, and supervision of SMEs. In addition\n            to credit and training, the project would provide for some\n            further studies concerning the SME subsector, in particular\n            the potential of small contractors. Since this would be the\n            first effort at an integrated approach to SME development in\n            Nigeria, the project could experience some delay in putting\n            in place the proper institutional structure. The project\n            seeks to reduce this risk through the strengthening of NBCI."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
