A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The development objective of the project is to increase efficiency, transparency, and accountability
in the procurement of goods, works and services by government ministries, departments, statutory
corporations and other public bodies. The project would support public procurement reform through
introducing appropriate procurement rules and procedures; building up procurement management capacity;
and establishing a series of mechanisms to improve transparency and reduce corruption. This reform is
crucial to strengthen the country's aid utilization capacity and aid effectiveness, and to gain donor group's
confidence to justify continued development assistance to Bangladesh.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Process and outcome indicators to gauge the attainment of the project's objective have been
developed and are shown in Annex 1.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 21326-BD Date of latest CAS discussion: December 12, 2000
The 2000 CAS identified govemance and institutional constraints as the most serious impediments
preventing Bangladesh from achieving its full economic potential and accelerating the pace of poverty
reduction. Opaque public procurement practices, poor financial management, high level of corruption, and
decline in the quality of civil services have led to very low expectations of public services, and contributed
to the high cost of doing business that, in turn, has deterred private sector development. According to the
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), the deficiencies of the current public sector
procurement practices are the single most serious issue affecting the whole public sector's activities.
Outdated procurement rules and procedures, inadequate capacity to manage public procurement, lack of
accountability, and corruption has seriously affected the country's aid utilization capacity and aid
effectiveness. According to some estimate, the economic losses due to corruption overall are estimated to
cost the country about 2.5% GDP growth per annum. There is growing recognition within the country that
improved govemance is a prerequisite for improving the investment climate and accelerating private
sector-led economic growth. In this context, the Govermment's commitment to undertake a broad-based
reform agenda on governance is a trigger to Bank's moving toward a high case lending support.
Procurement reform is one of the priority areas for govemance improvement. The proposed Public
Procurement Reform Technical Assistance (TA) project is thus closely aligned with the Bank assistance
strategy to Bangladesh.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The Bangladesh CPAR has identified a whole series of deficiencies contributing to the poor public
sector procurement performance. These include: absence of a sound legal framework governing public
sector procurement leading to proliferation of diverse rules and procedures among various agencies;
protracted bureaucratic procedures allowing multi-point rent seeking; lack of critical mass of professionals
to manage public procurement as reflected in poor quality bidding documents and bid evaluation, inordinate
delays in completing the procurement process and ineffective contract administration; and absence of
mechanisms for ensuring transparency and accountability in public procurement.
To address the above underlying causes of poor public procurement performance, the Bank, with
- 2 -



support of the government, conducted a country procurement assessment in 2000. The government has
broadly endorsed the findings and recommendations of the CPAR report, which, among others,
recommends the following:
*   create a Central Procurement Policy Unit in an appropriate ministry having the mandate to manage
the public sector procurement reform program;
*   prepare and issue Public Procurement Rules and Procedures;
*   introduce a set of Standard Bidding Documents for goods, works, and professional services,
applicable to all public procurement;
* revise delegation of powers and delayer the procurement approval process;
* publish contract awards, introduce appeal procedures, and a code of ethics for procurement staff;
and
*   establish regular training programs to develop the needed human resources.
These recommendations underpin the design of the proposed project.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project design is based on the CPAR's recommendations. The strategic choice is to support the
creation of basic policy and institutional frameworks in the medium term, which will sustain further
reforms and institutional capacity building effort in the longer term. The proposed project design also
reflects the strategic approach of harvesting the low-lyingjfruits first by (a) reforming the procurement
rules and mandatory use of standard bid documents so as to cut procurement delays-the single most
important problem in public sector procurement in Bangladesh; and (b) introducing mechanisms to ensure
transparency in the procurement process and restore public confidence. The quality of procurement is the
second priority but results may materialize slowly as attraction and retaining of suitable staff and their
training require time. Preparation and enactment of a public procurement law will be a follow-up action
after the urgently needed reforms as outlined above are successfully completed.

The project will have the following three components:
- 3 -



(i) Establishing a Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU): A Central Procurement Technical Unit
will be established in the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the Ministry of
Planning with adequate staffing and logistics, responsible for carrying out procurement reformns in line with
the recommendations of the CPAR. The CPTU will have no procurement / contracting functions at any
level except for its own needs. The unit may provide technical/professional advice on generic procurement
issues referred to it, but shall not get involved or provide opinion in any specific procurement evaluation or
contract award, thus preserving its pristine role as a policy, technical assistance, training and oversight
unit. One of the function of the CPTU is to create procurement awareness at all levels. GOB shall
establish the CPTU as a permanent institution of the Govermment funded under the revenue budget that will
be sustained after the project period. The CPTU will be located in the IMED. Office for the consultants
will be provided at the same location. (Detailed functions of the CPTU are in Annex-2).
The Government in its memo dated April 4, 2002 confirmed that the CPTU has been created in
IMED as a permanent institution funded under revenue budget.
(ii) Implementing Public Procurement Reforms and Rules/Procedures: Public procurement
rules/procedures and standard bidding documents will be developed in line with the CPAR
recommendations. The CPTU will follow a participatory consultation process involving government and
private sector stakeholders to develop ownership and support for reforms. GOB will furnish the draft new
rules/procedures to IDA for review and will incorporate recommendations for changes, if any, into the final
documents prior to their implementation. Activities under this component will include:
improving economy and efficiency by:
*   developing and introducing public procurement rules and procedures;
*   developing and publishing a set of: (a) standard bidding documents for goods and works,
including sample models for BOT / BOO / turn-key contracts and community contracting; and
(b) standard request for proposals for consultants services, including NGO services; and
*   drafting a procurement law.
improvinz transparency by:
*   publishing in the press and web site awards of all contracts valued at US$200,000 and above;
*   simplifying procedures for advertisement by making the implementing agency directly
responsible for publishing invitation for bids without routing through the Ministry of
Information;
*   introducing public procurement website and electronic bidding;
*   including an expert of known probity in the evaluation committee for selection of consultants;
and
*   sequestering of evaluation conunittee for contracts over certain thresholds.
improvin- accountabilitv by..
*   revising procurement approval process with significantly reduced number of layers;
*   revising delegation of powers;
*   introducing appeal procedure in the rules;
*   introducing mandatory procurement audit by independent auditors for each public sector entity,
regardless of the source of funding; and
*   introducing code of conduct for procurement professionals.
(iii) Improving Procurement Management Capacity: Procurement management capacity will be
- 4 -



developed via a two-pronged effort: (a) institutionalization of comprehensive and regular training
programs through selected institutions; and (b) establishing a monitoring and evaluation capacity at CPTU
to track procurement performance of public sector entities. The contents and delivery modalities of the
training programs will be tailored to meet the needs of various target groups, including private sector
construction /consulting industries and the NGO sector. The activities under this component would include:
Procurement Trainini
*   A critical mass of 25 trainers will be built up through intensive training, on-the-job evaluations
and a rigorous accreditation process. This will help and sustain the in-country training
capacity.
*   Approximately 1600 participants will be provided with in-country procurement training during
the project period.
*   Course curriculum, teaching materials and training programs for various target groups,
including government officials / auditors / selected private sector staff, will be developed.
*   The International Training Center of the ILO, Turin (ITC-ILO) has been selected on a
single-source basis to provide services for the above activities. And initially, Bangladesh
Institute of Administration and Management (BIAM) will provide in-country training logistics.
Procurement and Compliance Monitoring
*   A fully computerized and real-time procurement management information system (MIS) will
be established at the CPTU to monitor and enforce compliance with new procurement rules
and procedures, and evaluate the impact of the public sector procurement reform.
*   A public procurement website will be established to provide access to procurement related
information.
Project Manaeement Training
*   A separate project management training program will be supported under the project to provide
training to about 600 government project staff. This training will be conducted by IMED in
collaboration with Academy for Planning and Development (APD) or similar institutions.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
As described in section B.3, the project seeks key policy reform in public procurement by introducing a set
of comprehensive procurement rules and procedures. The key institutional reforms will include
establishing a permanent Central Procurement Technical Unit to manage the procurement reform program
and developing regular procurement training programs at selected institutions in Bangladesh.
3. Benefits and target population:
This project is designed to support priority procurement reforms to reduce procurement delays,
improve procurement quality and ensure transparency in public sector procurement. The direct benefits
envisaged under the project would include faster and better use of public resources, significant reduction of
corruption and increased aid utilization capacity. The project would restore the public confidence, thereby
contributing to the creation of good investment climate in Bangladesh. The project would also enhance the
capacity of the domestic construction and consulting industries to participate more effectively in national
and international procurement. In the longer term, all the above would create a powerful force toward more
transparent and accountable institutions, resulting in accelerated economic growth and faster poverty
reduction.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
IMED within the Ministry of Planning will be the implementing agency for the project. The CPTU
headed by a Director General will oversee all project activities. The Director General will be supported by
two Directors, one for procurement rules, procedures and training, and the other for monitoring and
evaluation. The CPTU will be assisted by a team of high caliber experts under a technical assistance major
consultancy.
A Steering Committee headed by the Secretary, IMED, comprising representative of the key
ministries will provide policy and implementation guidance.
Implementation of Technical Assistance: The single most critical procurement under the project
relates to the procurement of technical assistance (TA) for procurement reform activities and procurement
training activities. Given the need to assemble a team of experts of high caliber to assist the GOB in
implementing procurement reform and ITC-ILO's track record as a premier procurement training
institution under UN umbrella and its successful experiences in assisting procurement reforms in East
European and Central Asia countries in collaboration with OECD, at the request of the Borrower, its
selection on a sole source and single responsibility basis was considered justified to provide expert inputs
for the procurement policy reform (under Component 2) and procurement training (under Component 3).
Initially, ITC-ILO will deliver the procurement training at BIAM. Annex 6 provides more details.
Procurement: Procurement under the project will be handled by CPTU. Procurement under the
project will largely involve consultants' services including training, with small quantities of goods.
ITC-ILO, through a team of international and national experts, will provide services on a single source
basis for the major TA contract for procurement reform and training. The team of experts include a
number of Procurement Specialists. For goods, since the contracts' sizes are very small, shopping is the
preferred procedure, however, depending on the implementation experience, the borrower may follow NCB
for contracts valued less than US$200,000. For procurement of goods, the Bank's Procurement Guidelines
shall apply. For consultants' services, the Consultants Guidelines shall apply.
For goods, since the contracts' sizes are very small and shopping is the preferred method, IDA will
carry out prior review of the first two contracts for shopping. However, depending on the implementation
experience, if the borrower follow NCB, one contract will be subject to prior review. For consultants'
services, IDA's prior review will be required for consultants' services contracts estimated to cost
US$100,000 equivalent or more for firms and US$50,000 equivalent or more for individuals.
Financial Management: The current government accounting system, the main focus of which is
on book-keeping and transactional control over expenditure will be followed in CPTU, which is adequate
for the project. The recently introduced Project Accounting Manual of the government will provide
guidelines on policy and procedures to be followed for transactions relating to Govt. funds. Considering
that most of the project transactions relate to a small number of local and international consultants, the
current financial management system in CPTU is capable of processing all financial transactions following
the Project Accounting Manual. The Accountant currently working in IMED will handle financial
management activities of the CPTU, once the CPTU has been established. IMED will ensure that the
Accountant is onboard with the establishment of the CPTU. In addition, IMED will appoint the
financial management consultant (finance manager) no later than June 30, 2002.
The CPTU is responsible for preparing Financial Management Reports (FMRs) on a semi-annual
basis. The Financial Statements will be prepared within fifteen days of the following month. A set of
- 6 -



customized formats of FMRs are included in the PIP and would be submitted to the Bank for monitoring
project physical and financial progress.
The annual financial statement of the project would be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor
General (C&AG) and would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year. The
audit report will include separate opinions on Project Financial Statements, Special Account and SOE.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The alternative of pursuing procurement reform through an umbrella " Governance Improvement
Project " was considered but rejected for the following reasons. While there is increasing
recognition of the need to tackle the underlying governance issues in the country, to secure
Government commitment and ownership of a broad range of reforms in public administration,
banking, public sector financial accountability and etc., will take time. Furthermore, internal
discussions within the Bank also suggested that adjustment credits based on the Government's
taking bolder reform steps upfront may be a more effective instrument to assist in moving the
governance agenda forward. On the other hand, there is already agreement with the Government
on the priorities and approaches to basic procurement reform, thus there is a critical need to move
forward in a decisive manner so as to maintain the momentum created through the CPAR process.
Based on the above, it is proposed to proceed with a self-standing procurement reforn TA credit.
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed,
ongoing and planned).

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Three key lessons identified by the OED's evaluation of the Bangladesh portfolio have been reflected
in the project design.
The first lesson relates to the ownership issue. Many projects in Bangladesh show signs of
incomplete ownership and commitment to project objectives. To address this, basic reform steps would be
sought in the early stage of project implementation, which are difficult to reverse and which will produce
tangible results quickly, thereby building up public support for procurement reform.
The second lesson is to limit project goals to a small number of crucial policy reforms and
development impact objectives. Specifically, the project is aimed at cutting procurement delays, improving
procurement quality and enhancing transparency in the procurement process.
It is recognized that the determinants of success of public procurement reform will include not only
changes of rules and procedures but also changes in incentives and behaviors. To bring about sustainable
improvement in procurement will be a long-term undertaking. The Government has agreed to establish the
CPTU as a permanent unit to lead the long-term reform process.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Procurement reform is one of the top of GOB's broad governance improvement agenda. The GOB
has demonstrated its commitment and ownership of the project by (i) completing prior actions enabling
fast-track project processing in a record short period of time (pre-appraisal in mid. November 2001,
followed by appraisal in early February 2002, with negotiations and Board presentation schedule in March
and April 2002 respectively); and (ii) its commitment to take upfront key reform steps within three months
of credit effectiveness.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
In Bangladesh, the Bank has carried out substantial amount of AAA work. Besides the CPAR,
three major reports have been prepared: the Country Financial Accountability Assessment; Corruption
in Bangladesh; and Taming Leviathan : An Institutional and Governance Review. During the course of
the above ESW work, the Bank has deepened its understanding of the country specific issues and has been
leading the donor group's dialogue with the Government on governance. The Bank's expertise and advice
have been well received by the Government, the donor group and the civil society. Given the Bank's
- 8 -



institutional knowledge on procurement reforms and its ability to bring global best practices to bear on the
formulation of reform program in Bangladesh, the Bank's support has contributed immensely to help ensure
the quality and substance of the reform program.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
O Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
* Cost effectiveness
O Other (specify)
As explained in section C.3, the proposed project is expected to generate enormous direct benefits
as measured in terns of reduction in procurement delays and development costs resulting from improved
economy and efficiency in public procurement. To gauge the impact of the proposed reforms, a set of
procurement performance benchmarks will be developed. A procurement management information system
will be established to monitor the performance of public sector entities against the said benchmarks during
project implementation. In view of the nature of the project, no calculation of economic rate of return will
be attempted.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
To ensure sustainability of the reform initiatives, the Government has agreed to provide counterpart
funding for the reform program, including budgetary support to maintain the CPTU. In addition, cost
recovery mechanisms for providing training to private participants will be reviewed during implementation.
Fiscal Impact:
The Government will fund the CPTU staff s salaries, local taxes and part of operating expenses.
The project's direct fiscal impact is minimal in consideration of its small contribution of about US$0.5
million, constituting 9% of the project cost. The project, however, would have significant fiscal impact on
GOB's overall budget in terms of reduction of corruption, more effective competition, decrease of
contracting costs, and timeliness of contract execution.
3. Technical:
The key technical issues requiring special attention relate to (i) how to develop the in-country
capability to deliver quality procurement training programs in an efficient and demand-driven manner, and
(ii) how to sensitize the target groups for acquiring and applying procurement knowledge in their work.
ITC-ILO will provide: in-country training to a large number of participants and extensive rigorous
in-country/abroad training to a limited number of participants who will act as critical mass. The in-country
training will initially be at BIAM. The engagement of ITC-ILO to provide quality support in procurement
training and certification / accreditation program for training recipients (critical mass) would help ensure
sustainability and provide incentives.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
See Section C.4.
4.2 Project management:
-9-



The technical and managerial capacity of IMED has been reflected in the project design through
adequate staffmg of the CPTU and contracting of the ITC-ILO for providing technical assistance major
consultancy. The contract for ITC-ILO will be signed before Credit effectiveness.
4.3 Procurement issues:
The project procurement include a technical assistance major consultancy contract and purchase of
very small quantity of goods. IMED has prepared a draft Procurement Plan that is included in the PIP.
As part of the advance procurement actions, ITC-ILO has been selected on a single-source basis to
provide services of the technical assistance for procurement reform and training, which is the most critical
activity under the project. IMED will sign contract with ITC-ILO before Credit effectiveness; the contract
would be effective upon credit effectiveness. Being very small size with limited number of contracts,
goods may be procured following shopping procedures. The CPTU in its team of expert has number of
Procurement Specialists, who will assist in procurement of goods. Given the size and nature of
procurement, the risk is average.
Annex 6 describes further details on procurement aspects.
4.4 Financial management issues:
The CPTU has financial management system which is adequate to cater to minimum FM
requirements by credit effectiveness. The recently introduced Project Accounting Manual of the
Government would also provide a framework for ensuring basic financial management system in
the project.
Transaction-based disbursement procedures will be applicable for withdrawal of funds from the
Credit. IDA funds will be channeled through a special account in a commercial Bank with terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA. The DG/CPTU will be the authorized person for issuing
payments through checks, payment request to Chief Accounts Officer (CAO) of the miniistry for
counterpart funds and withdrawal of funds from IDA credit. IDA will make direct payment to
ITC-ILO through "Blanket Withdrawal Application" procedures with intimation to CPTU.
The current manual system in IMED will be followed in CPTU, which is adequate to keep
track with project financial transactions. Though the computerized accounting system is not
imperative for effective financial management system, the implementing agency has plan to go for
computerized system, provided CPTU appoints staff with required IT skills.
From the financial management perspective, there is low risk affecting the credit. This is
because the credit would have several consultancy contracts, where the financial flows are simply
from Special Account to the Consultants and direct payment in case of ITC-ILO contract and will
be paid as per the terms and conditions of contractual agreements.
5. Environmental:                  Environmental Category: C (Not Required)
5.1 Sunmmarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.

n/a
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
One social issue which would be addressed relates to "child labor". The standard bidding
documents will contain a specific clause for compliance with the applicable minimnum age labor laws and
requirements of the Government of Bangladesh and applicable World Bank policies regarding hazardous
forms of child labor. Another issue is on how to develop an environment for compliance of standard of
ethics by staff of implementing agencies, bidders/suppliers/contractors in the broad country context. A
program through printed and electronic media to raise public awareness on good procurement practices has
been incorporated into the project.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
As indicated in Section C. 1 .(i), the project will develop a mechanism to disseminate information on
the progress and impact of the procurement reforms. Procurement awareness campaign will be undetaken
by the CPTU. At the same time, feedback from public and private sector stakeholders and the public at
large will be gathered with the objective to adapting the implementation processes.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
As in E.6.2 above.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
The social development objectives include: capacity building, behavioral change, and public
awareness. Capacity building will be attained through extensive training program. A core team of trainers
will be provide with accreditation that would act as incentive to changed behavior. Awareness campaign
through procurement website and mass media will create public support for reform.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
The Management Information System included in the project will, among others, monitor and
measure performance in terms of social development outcomes.
7. Safeguard Policies:

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
OP4.01 was applied for screening and categorizing the project. And no safeguard issues and
impacts are expected to arise as a result of project implementation.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The project design has made the strategic choice to support the creation of basic policy and
institutional frameworks in the medium term, which will provide the foundations to sustain further reforms
and institutional capacity building effort in the longer term.
The reforms to be implemented during the project period-- establishing a Central Procurement Technical
Unit, introducing sound public procurement rules and procedures, and improving procurement management
capacity-- are perrnanent improvements to the present regime. The CPTU will be maintained and will
continue its functions after the project period. The enforcement of proper procurement rules and
procedures together with measures to improve transparency--particularly the appeal procedure and
publication of bidding results--, would help contain corruption, restore private sector confidence and
contribute to improving investment climate. All these would help ensure sustainability of project outcome.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
BANGLADESH: Public Procurement Reform Project
The 2000 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Bangladesh identified governance and institutional
constraints as the most serious impediments preventing Bangladesh from achieving its full economic
potential and accelerating the pace of poverty reduction. Opaque public procurement practices, poor
financial management, high level of corruption, and decline in the quality of civil services have led to very
low expectations of public services, and contributed to the high cost of doing business that, in turn, has
deterred private sector development. According to some estimates, the economic losses due to corruption
overall are estimated to cost the country about 2.5% GDP growth per annum. There is growing recognition
within the country that improved govemance is a prerequisite for improving the investment climate and
accelerating private sector-led economic growth. In this context, the Government's commitment to
undertake a broad-based reform agenda on governance is a trigger to Bank's moving toward a high case
lending support. Procurement reform is one of the priority areas for governance improvement.
To address the underlying causes of poor public procurement performance, the Bank, with support
of the government, conducted a country procurement assessment in 1999-2000. According to the Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), the deficiencies of the current public sector procurement
practices are the single most serious issue affecting the whole public sector's activities. The CPAR
identified a series of deficiencies contributing to the poor procurement performance. These include: absence
of a sound legal framework governing public sector procurement, outdated procurement rules and
procedures leading to proliferation of diverse rules and procedures among various agencies, inadequate
capacity and lack of critical mass of professionals to manage public procurement as reflected in poor
quality bidding documents and bid evaluation, inordinate delays in completing the procurement process,
ineffective contract administration, protracted bureaucratic procedures allowing multi-point rent seeking,
and absence of mechanisms for ensuring transparency and accountability in public procurement. All these
have seriously affected the country's aid utilization capacity and aid effectiveness.
The government in February 2001 has broadly endorsed the findings and recommendations of the
CPAR, and assigned Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the Ministry of
Planning to initiate follow-up actions. Procurement reform has become one of the priority areas for
governance improvement and the proposed Public Procurement Reform Technical Assistance is thus
aligned with the Bank assistance strategy to Bangladesh.
The development objective of the project is to increase efficiency, transparency, and accountability
in the procurement of goods, works and services by government ministries, departments, statutory
corporations and other public bodies. The project would support public procurement reform through
introducing appropriate procurement rules and procedures; building up procurement management capacity;
and establishing a series of mechanisms to improve transparency and reduce corruption. This reform is
crucial to strengthen the country's aid utilization capacity and aid effectiveness, and to gain donor group's
confidence to justify continued development assistance to Bangladesh.
By Component:
Project Component 1 - US$1.25 million
Establishing a Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU)
- 20 -



A Central Procurement Technical Unit will be established in IMED, Ministry of Planning with
adequate staffing and logistics, responsible for carrying out procurement reforms following the
recommendations of the CPAR. CPTU will have no procurement / contracting functions at any level
except for its own needs. The unit may provide technical/professional advice on generic procurement
issues referred to it, but shall not get involved or provide opinion in any specific procurement evaluation or
contract award, thus preserving its pristine role as a policy, technical assistance, training and oversight
unit. GOB shall establish the CPTU as a permanent institution of the Government funded under the
revenue budget that will be sustained after the project period. The CPTU will be located in the office of the
IMED, including office of the consultants.
Key functions of the CPTU are to:
*   implement the recommendations of the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR-
Attachment-i);
* prepare and issue the "Public Procurement Rules and Procedures" applicable to all government
and public sector bodies;
*   monitor compliance of the public procurement rules, issue clarifications, obtain feedback and
continuously improve and update them;
*   develop and publish a set of Standard Bidding Documents, using the World Bank SBDs as
models and inputs and integrating the numerous documents now in use by other development
partners and the government;
* publish contract awards as determined by the Government from time to time (initially all
contracts valued at US$200,000 and above) in public procurement website;
*   develop and maintain a public procurement website;
*   revise procurement approval procedures and delegation of powers, introduce mandatory
procurement audit, appeal mechanism and code of conduct, simplify advertisement procedures,
consider inclusion of independent expert in the evaluation of consultants' proposals;
*   plan, prepare and schedule training programs to cover the target group during the project and
continue the training on a sustainable basis;
*   collect data from various public sector and project implementing entities, analyze, and submit
report;
*   prepare and issue procurement technical notes on selected procurement topics;
*   carry out studies (through out-sourcing the tasks) on areas/issues identified as problems and
bottlenecks in public procurement and conduct procurement awareness campaign;
*   maintain close link with the training and research institutions for continuation of the production
of the procurement manpower and further strengthening of the existing knowledge and
expertise; and
*   draft a Public Procurement Law for consideration of the Government.
The Government in its memo dated April 4, 2002 confirmed that the CPTU has been created in
IMED as a permanent institution funded under revenue budget. Before effectiveness of the credit, (a) the
Director General and the two Directors of the CPTU, with appropriate qualifications as per the PIP, will be
onboard who will work for the entire project period, with the proviso of satisfactory performance; and (b)
IMED will sign contract with the Intemational Training Center of the ILO, Turin for procurement reform
and training.
Project Component 2 - US$1.59 million

Implementing Public Procurement Reforms and Rules/Procedures
Public procurement rules/procedures and standard bidding documents will be developed in line
with the CPAR recommendations. The CPTU will follow a participatory consultation process involving
government and private sector stakeholders to develop ownership and support for reforms. GOB will
furnish the draft new rules/procedures to IDA for review and will incorporate recommendations for
changes, if any, into the final documents prior to their implementation. Activities under this component
will include:
improving economy and efficiency bv:
*   developing and introducing public procurement rules and procedures- after review of various
rules, procedures and models including the World Bank Guidelines and UNCITRAL model
law, a set of nationally applicable procurement rules and procedures will be developed and
mandated;
*   developing and publishing a set of: (a) standard bidding documents for international
competitive bidding and national competitive bidding for procurement of goods and works,
including possible models for BOT / BOO / turn-key contracts and sample bidding documents
for community contracting; (b) standard request for proposals for professional services,
including NGO services; and (c) sample form for bid/proposal evaluation reports; and
*   drafting a procurement law.
improving transparency by:
*   publishing contract awards- CPTU will collect contract award information in prescribed
formats from all public sector entities and will publish in the media and/or web site awards,
initially, of all contracts valued at US$200,000 and above, starting within three months of the
effectiveness of the credit;
*   simplifying procedures for advertisement- existing procedures for publishing invitation for
bids (IFBs) that currently involves routing through the Ministry of Information (MOI) will be
reviewed and discontinued, by making the implementing agency directly responsible for
publishing IFBs without routing through MOI, within ninety days of effectiveness of the credit;
*   introducing public procurement website and electronic bidding- a public procurement website
will be developed and introduced after review of relevant websites that have been introduced
elsewhere. Public sector procurement related information will be available in the website, for
instance, standard bidding documents, standard request for proposals, technical notes,
invitation for bids, contract awards. With a gradual approach, the possibility of introducing
electronic bid processing will be undertaken;
*   including an independent expert in the proposal evaluation committee- for selection of
consultants, a list of national experts with well-known probity and integrity will be prepared
and provision will be made in the rules to include one such expert in evaluating consultants'
proposals; and
*   sequestering the evaluation committee- sequestering the evaluation committee, until the final
report is completed, will be considered that will be applicable for large contracts at the
beginning (valued at US$5 million or above for goods and works, and US$1 million for
consultants' services).
improving accountability by:
* revising procurement approval process- existing procurement approval process involving large
number of steps and causing excessive delays will be reviewed, and a revised, streamlined and
transparent approval procedures with significantly reduced number of layers (say, a maximum
- 22 -



of five for the ministry level and three for the agency level) will be introduced and mandated in
the rules, starting within six months of credit effectiveness;
*   revising delegation of powers- existing delegation of powers to the project directors for revenue
and development programs of all sectors and entities (for instance, Rural Electrification Board,
Bangladesh Power / Water Development Board, City Corporations, Port Authorities, and
Directorates/Departments of various ministries), including their complexity, will be reviewed
and a revised delegation of powers will be developed and mandated;
*   introducing appeal procedure- a provision of appeal or a review procedure of written protests
by the interested supplier or contractor or consultants will be introduced and mandated in the
rules. The review panel will consist of three experts selected from a list of distinguished
personnel (alternate location of this review panel to be explored);
*   introducing procurement audit- for carrying out post review of contracts, mandatory
procurement audit by independent auditors for each public sector entity, regardless of the
source of funding, will be introduced and mandated in the rules; and
*   introducing code of conduct- code of conduct for public procurement staff and code of ethics
for business communities (suppliers, contractors, and consultants) will be developed and
introduced.
Project Component 3 - US$ 2.07 million
Improving Procurement Management Capacity
Procurement management capacity will be developed via a two-pronged effort: (a)
institutionalization of comprehensive and regular training programs through selected public and private
training institutions; and (b) establishing a monitoring and evaluation capacity to track procurement
performance of public sector entities. The contents and delivery modalities of the training programs will be
tailored to meet the needs of the various target groups, including private sector construction /consulting
industries and the NGO sector.
Following activities are included in this component:
Procurement Training
*   A critical mass of 25 trainers will be built up through intensive training, on-the-job evaluations
and a rigorous accreditation process. This will help and sustain the in-country training
capacity. Trainers will be selected based on a set of criteria (indicative criteria are included in
the PIP and will be furiher developed and agreed upon during implementation).
*   Procurement management capacity and training needs of the public sector including auditors,
private contracting & consulting industry will be assessed. Approximately 1600 participants
will be provided with in-country procurement training during the project period. Trainees will
be selected based on a set of criteria (indicative criteria are included in the PIP and will be
further developed and agreed upon during implementation).
*   Course curriculum, teaching materials and training programs for various target groups
including training of trainers, procurement professionals, govemrnment officials, public &
private sector auditors and selected private sector staff will be developed.
*   Bangladeshi institutions establish link programs with mature and well-perforning intemational
training institutions in order to sustain the training program. To materialize this approach,
initially a link program would be established between the International Training Center of the
ILO, Turin (ITC-ILO) and Bangladesh Institute of Administration and Management (BIAM);
- 23 -



the project may identify other local public/private institutions subsequently, for instance,
Academy for Planning and Development (APD), BRAC, etc.
Procurement and Compliance Monitoring
*   The project includes a provision of technical assistance to establish and operationalize a fully
computerized and real-time procurement management information system (MIS) at CPTU to
monitor and enforce compliance with new procurement rules and procedures and evaluate the
impact of procurement reform.
*   CPTU will establish a public procurement website to provide access to procurement related
information. This website will be integrated with the MIS.
Project Management Training
*   The project will provide separately project management training to about 600 participants of
the government in order to develop management skills. This training will be conducted by
IMED in collaboration with APD or similar institutions.
Project Implementation Arrangements
IMED will be the implementing agency for the project. The CPTU will be headed by a Director
General who will oversee/ manage all project activities. The Director General will function as the Project
Director for the proposed technical assistance and will be supported by two Directors, one for the
procurement rules, procedures and training, and the other for monitoring and evaluation. The Director
General and the Directors shall be professionally qualified for their functions and their selections shall be
made accordingly. (CPTU Organogram: Attachment-2).
A Steering Committee headed by the Secretary, IMED will provide guidance to implement the TA
project and will meet once in three months. The other members of the committee would be Secretary /
Additional Secretary / Joint Secretary or similar level officials from the Finance, Cabinet Division,
Communication, Power and Energy, Economic Relations, Planning, Establishment, Local Government,
Education, ECNEC, C&AG, Health, and public Works. The Project Director will be the Member
Secretary.
Procurement of Technical Assistance: The single most critical procurement under the project
relates to the procurement of technical assistance for procurement reform activities and procurement
training activities. A competitive selection process would take 9-12 months at minimum in the current
Bangladeshi context. Given the need to assemble a team of experts of high caliber to assist the GOB in
launching and implementing the procurement reform and ITC-ILO's track record as a premier procurement
training institution under UN umbrella and its successful experiences in assisting procurement reforms in
East European and Central Asia countries in collaboration with OECD, at the request of the Borrower,
selection of ITC-ILO on a sole source and single responsibility basis was considered justified, to provide
expert inputs for the procurement policy reform (under Component 2) and procurement training (under
Component 3). Having reviewed the proposal submitted by ITC-ILO, IDA shared with IMED's views
expressing satisfaction at the quality of the proposal, which clearly demonstrated their deep understanding
of the objectives of the assignment; the fact that proposed team comprises intemationally reputed experts
provides confidence to meet the objectives of the assignment. As indicated in the proposal, initially
ITC-ILO will deliver the procurement training through a link program with BLAM. BIAM is expected to:
(a) provide all logistics and associated services including boarding, lodging, etc. for smooth carrying out of
in-country training by the ITC-ILO and (b) acquire, develop and institutionalize capacity for carrying out

If the difference between the present value of financial and economic flows is large and cannot be explained by
taxes and subsidies, a brief explanation of the difference is warranted, e.g. "The difference between financial and
economic costs arises from price controls on the inputs."
Summary of benefits and costs:
The single most critical element under the project relates to the techmcal assistance for
procurement reform activities and procurement training. It was extremely important for the project to
assemble a team of experts of high caliber to assist the GOB in launching and implementing the
procurement reform. The Intemational Training Center of the ILO, Turin (ITC-ILO), with its track record
as a premier procurement training institution under UN umbrella and its successful experiences in assisting
procurement reforms in many East European and Central Asia countries in collaboration with OECD, has
been considered to be engaged on a sole source basis to provide expert inputs for this component. The
proposal submitted by ITC-ILO clearly demonstrated their deep understanding of the objectives of the
assignment; the fact that proposed team comprises internationally reputed experts provides confidence to
meet the objectives of the assignment. The benefits expected out of this activity has tremendous potential
in providing sustainability to the procurement management capacity.
The Government will fund the CPTU staff's salaries, local taxes and part of operating expenses.
The project's direct fiscal impact is minimal in consideration of its small contribution of about US$0.5
million, constituting 9% of the project cost. The project, however, would have significant fiscal impact on
GOB's overall budget in terms of reduction of corruption, more effective competition, decrease of
contracting costs, and timeliness of contract execution.
Main Assumptions:
None
Cost-effectiveness indicators:
None
These indicators should compare the project with a suitable comparator, e.g. unit project costs of alternative
project designs or international standards.

Annex 6(A): Procurement Arrangements
BANGLADESH: Public Procurement Reform Project
Procurement
1.     The total value of the project is US$4.91 million, of which the IDA Credit will finance US$4.45
million. Procurement under the project will largely involve consultants' services including training, with
small quantities of goods.
2.     All IDA financed procurement of goods will follow procedures outlined in the Bank's "Guidelines
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits ': published in January 1995, and revised in January
and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999. Consulting services and training will be procured
in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers ': published in January 1997, and revised in September 1997 and January 1999. Procurement
of goods and services will follow the Bank's approved/standard documents.
Goods (US$0.69 million)
3.     Goods to be financed under the Credit include: computers, office fittings and fixtures,
audio-visual equipment, office equipment, photocopiers, air conditioners, two vehicles, and
furniture. All procurement under the project is expected to involve small contracts, with estimated cost
less than US$100,000 per contract (most contracts value less than US$30,000). The nature of these small
contracts is unlikely to attract the interest of foreign bidders, and as such procurement will not involve
intemational competitive bidding. Also, in consideration of the urgency of establishing the Central
Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) in the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of
the Ministry of Planning, procurement through national competitive bidding may not be efficient.
Depending on the implementation experience, the borrower may, however, follow NCB for contracts valued
less than US$200,000, with the proviso of paragraph 13.
(i)    National Shopping (NS): Given the nature of procurement, goods under the project with an
estimated value less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate limit of US$650,000,
may be procured through prudent shopping procedures by solociting price quotations from at least three
suppliers.
(ii)   Direct Contracting (DC): Computer software, books, journals, and magazines, with individual
contract costs less than US$2,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate limit of US$50,000, may be procured
following DC.
Consultants' Services and Training (US$3.87 million)
4.     The single most critical procurement under the project relates to the procurement of technical
assistance for procurement reform activities and procurement training. The single most critical procurement
under the project relates to the procurement of technical assistance for procurement reform activities and
procurement training. A competitive selection process would take 9-12 months at minimum in the current
Bangladeshi context. In the context of the requirements for improving govemance in Bangladesh as
outlined in the CAS, this is of paramount importance for the success of the project the excellency and
timeliness of selecting a team of experts of high caliber to assist the Government in launching and
implementing the procurement reform. Consequently the Borrower has recommended, and the Bank project
- 31 -



team agrees, the selection on a sole-source basis of the Intemational Training Center of the ILO, Turin
(ITC-ILO). ILO's excellent track record as a premier procurement training institution under UN umbrella
and its successful experiences in assisting procurement reforms in East European and Central Asia
countries in collaboration with OECD justifies the Borrower's request for its selection on a sole source and
single responsibility basis to provide expert inputs for the procurement policy reform (under Component 2)
and procurement training (under Component 3). The contract value is estimated to be about US$2.6
million. To institutionalize the in-country training, initially, ITC-ILO will have a link program with the
local training institution Bangladesh Institute of Administration and Management (BIAM). Subsequently,
depending on the training requirements, other public and/or private institutions could be invited to join the
training programn.
ITC-ILO's proposal to the Government includes input of a former Bank staff (Mr. Raghavan
Srinivasan) for about six staff-months, who worked for the Bank, as Consultant, for the preparation of the
CPAR for Bangladesh and was involved for about one week in the preparation of the project. The
Government has requested a waiver for him in perception of the possible conflict of interest. Mr.
Srinivasan's involvement would be primarily in the area of training. Considering the contribution that he
made in the CPAR, his expertise in the field, and the respect he commands in Bangladesh, the Bank, as an
exceptional case, agrees to provide such a waiver'.
(i) Quality-Based Selection (QBS): Services through firms estimated to cost US$100,000 or more per
contract may be procured following QBS. Contracts include: establishment of procurement monitoring
system (MIS) including procurement website.
(ii) Fixed Budget Selection (FBS): Services through firms estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per
contract may be procured following FBS. Major contracts include: procurement awareness campaign and
procurement audit.
(iii) Single Source Selection (SSS): Services for assignments that meet the requirement of paragraph 3.9
of the Consultants Guideline may be procured following SSS, subject to IDA's prior agreement. Contracts
include: ITC-ILO contract for procurement reform and procurement training, BIAM contract for providing
procurement training logistics, other training institutes / universities' contracts for research / studies /
project management / seminars / workshops / translation services (for instance, Academy for Planning and
Development (APD), Public Administration Training Center (PATC), Bangladesh University of
Engineering and Technology, Bangla Academy, and BRAC).
(iv) Individual Consultants (IC): Services for assignments for which teams of personnel are not required
and the experience and qualifications of the individual are the paramount requirement will be procured
through individuals in accordance with Section V of the Consultants Guidelines. Individuals will be
selected on the basis of their qualifications for the assignment. Contracts for specialists include: finance
manager, mid-term review experts, and other short term assignment contracts.
Footnote 1: This was cleared with LEGPR and OPCPR.
- 32 -



5. Training: The project includes extensive training provisions for developing in-country procurement
management capacity. Approximately 1600 staff of the government and private sector will participate in
the in-country procurement training, to be provided by ITC-ILO, initially under the link program with
BLAM. A core team of about 25 national professionals will be developed as procurement trainer, who will
have training opportunities (training of trainers) inside and abroad. For capacity building of the
implementing agencies' in carrying out efficient procurement and understanding the benefits of procurement
reform acitivities undetaken in various countries, about 55 government officials will have opportunities for
overseas training and study tours. ITC-ILO will organize these training events. To develop management
skills in project implementation, about 600 government and public sector staff will be trained in project
management. APD or similar institution will provide this training.
Incremental Operating Costs (US$0.35 million)
6.     IDA will not bear CPTU personnel/staff salaries costs. Only the incremental operating costs of
CPTU, such as, office utilities, supplies, fuel, maintenance of equipment and vehicles, etc. will be covered
under the project on a declining basis.
Procurement and Selection Planning
7.     The draft Procurement Plan for goods and Selection Plan for services have been prepared by
IMED and included in the PIP. Prior to issuance of any invitation for bids for procurement of goods and
selection of services, the proposed Plan shall be furnished to IDA for its review and concurrence, in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph I of Appendix 1 to the respective Guidelines. Procurement of
goods and selection of all consultants will be undertaken in accordance with Plans concurred by IDA and
with the provisions of said paragraph 1 of Appendix 1 of the respective Guidelines.
Use of Standard Documents
8.     For ICB procurement of goods, the use of IDA's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) is
mandatory. For NCB procurement, IMED/CPTU will use the SBDs for Goods approved by IDA.
However, at this stage, the project does not envisage any ICB or NCB procurement. For selection of
consulting firms, the Bank's Standard Request for Proposals (RFP) including standard contract form will
be used. The Bank's Standard Bid Evaluation Form for goods and Sample Form of Evaluation for
consultants' services will be followed for submission of evaluation reports to IDA.
Prior Review Thresholds
9.     Goods: Since the contracts' sizes are small and shopping is the preferrred method, IDA will carry
out prior review of the first two contracts for shopping. Review will include: request for quotations,
evaluation of quotations, and the purchase order. Depending on the implementation experience, if NCB is
used, one contract will be subject to prior review.
10.    Consultants Services: IDA's prior review will be required for consultants' services contracts
estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more for finms and US$50,000 equivalent or more for
individuals.
Post Review
11.    For compliance with the Bank's procurement procedures, IDA will carry out sample post review of
- 33 -



contracts that are below its prior review threshold. Such post review of contracts below the thresholds will
be carried out as the Bank deemed appropriate.
Review of Procurement Performance
12.   IDA will monitor the compliance with the requirements of Bank's different procurement methods
and performance standards on a continuous basis. As part of the project's planned mid-term review, a
comprehensive assessment of procurement performance will also be carried out. Based on the review, in
consultation with the government, IDA may revise the prior review threshold including the procurement and
selection methods.
Acceptability of NCB
13.   In order to ensure economy, efficiency, transparency and broad consistency with the provisions of
Section I of the Procurement Guidelines:
(i)   standard bidding documents approved by the Association shall be used;
(ii)  invitations to bids shall be advertised in at least one widely circulated national daily
newspaper and bidding documents shall be made available to prospective bidders, at least 28
days prior to the deadline for the submission of bids;
(iii)  bids shall not be invited on the basis of percentage premium or discount over the estimated
cost;
(iv)  bidding documents shall be made available, by mail or in person, to all who are willing to pay
the required fee;
(v)   foreign bidders shall not be precluded from bidding and no preference of any kind shall be
given to national bidders;
(vi)  qualification criteria (in case pre-qualifications were not carried out) shall be stated in the
bidding documents, and if a registration process is required, a foreign firm determined to be
the lowest evaluated bidder shall be given reasonable opportunity of registering, without any
let or hindrance;
(vii) bidders may deliver bids, at their option, either in person or by courier service or by mail;
(viii) all bidders shall provide bid security as indicated in the bidding documents. A bidder's bid
security shall apply only to a specific bid;
(ix)  bids shall be opened in public in one place immediately, but no later than one hour, after the
deadline for submission of bids;
(x)   evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the criteria disclosed in the bidding
documents, in a format and specified period agreed with the Association;
(xi)  bid shall not be rejected merely on the basis of a comparison with an official estimate without
the prior concurrence of the Association;
- 34 -



(xii) split award or lottery in award of contracts shall not be carried out. When two or more
bidders quote the same lowest price, an investigation shall be made to deternine any evidence
of collusion, following which (A) if collusion is deternined, the parties involved shall be
disqualified and the award shall then be made to the next lowest evaluated and qualified
bidder and (B) if no evidence of collusion can be confirmed, then fresh bids shall be invited
after receiving the concurrence of the Association;
(xiii) contracts shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders within the initial period of bid
validity so that extensions are not necessary. Extension of bid validity may be sought only
under exceptional circumstances;
(xiv) extension of bid validity shall not be allowed without the prior concurrence of the Association
(A) for the first request for extension if it is longer than eight weeks and (B) for all subsequent
requests for extensions irrespective of the period;
(xv) negotiations shall not be allowed with the lowest evaluated or any other bidders;
(xvi) re-bidding shall not be carried out without the Association's prior concurrence; and
(xvii) all contractors or suppliers shall provide performance security as indicated in the contract
documents. A contractor's or a supplier's performance security shall apply to a specific
contract under which it was furnished.
Reporting
14.    The project will prepare quarterly Procurement Monitoring Report (PROCMOR) as per specific
formats agreed with GOB.
Procurement Management Capacity
15.    Procurement Issues: The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), broadly accepted by
the Government in February 2001, stated procurement as a generic problem in Bangladesh. The CPAR
identified a series of factors accounting for procurement problems in the country that, among others,
include absence of procurement law, poor advertisement, poor bidding documents, multiple evaluation
committees, award of contract through lottery, negotiations, lack of professional competence, corrupt
practices, political influence and pressure from special interest groups and collective bargaining agencies.
16.    Risk Assessment and Strengthening of Procurement Capacity: In order to implement the
CPAR recommendations, this project, under the Bank financing, has been undertaken by the Government.
The CPTU, established as a component of the project funded by GOB, will play pivotal role in improving
the procurement management capacity of the public sector institutions.
17.    The project procurement include a technical assistance major consultancy contract and purchase of
very small quantity of goods. IMED has prepared a draft Procurement Plan, stating all procurement
packages, that is included in the PIP. As a part of comprehensive and tightened project preparation, all
procurement arrangements has been well defined and sufficient progress has been made in the selection of
consultants. As part of the advance procurement actions, ITC-ILO, being the premier international
institution in procurement reform and training, has been selected on a single-source basis to provide
- 35 -



services of the technical assistance. IMED will sign contract with ITC-ILO before the effectiveness of the
credit. Also, for the first year's procurement program of goods, arrangements have been finalized. Being
small size with limited number of contracts, goods may be procured following shopping procedures. The
CPTU in its team of expert has number of Procurement Specialists, who will assist in procurement of
goods. Given the size and nature of procurement, the risk is average.
18.    Action Plan: The following time-bound action plan for strengthening management capacity and for
completing tasks as readiness for implemenation of the project has been agreed with IDA:

Annex 6(B) Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
BANGLADESH: Public Procurement Reform Project
Financial Management
1. Summary of the Financial Management Assessment
2. Audit Arrangements
Adequacy of financial management system
The CPTU has financial management system which is adequate to cater minimum FM
requirements by credit effectiveness. The key tasks that remained to be carried out to enhance the financial
management system throughout the project life is the appointment of financial management consultant
(finance manager). Agreement has been reached that the appointment of the financial management
consultant will be a dated covenant- June 30, 2002. The government has already approved the engagement
of the financial management consultant for this project.
Current Financial Management System:
The executing agency for the project is the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation
Department (IMED) of the Ministry of Planning. The CPTU will follow the current government
accounting system, the main focus of which is on book-keeping and transactional control over
expenditure, which is adequate for the project. The recently introduced Project Accounting
Manual of the government will provide guidelines on policy and procedures to be followed for
transactions relating to Govt. funds. Considering that most of the project transactions relate to a
small number of local and international consultants , the current financial management system in
CPTU is capable of processing all financial transactions following the Project Accounting Manual.
The Accountant currently working in IMED will handle financial management activities of the CPTU, once
the CPTU has been established.
IMED will ensure that the Accountant is onboard with the establishment of the CPTU.
Summary of Project Description:
The US$4.91 million Technical Assistance Loan to reform Public Procurement System is
to increase efficiency, transparency and accountability in the procurement of goods, works and
services by government ministries, departments, statutory corporations and other public bodies.
The single most critical procurement under the project relates to ITC-ILO for USD 2.6 million
and the payment will be made following "Blanket Withdrawal Applications" procedures as per the
contractual agreement between ITC/ILO and IMED. Other procurement of services consisting
of small number of local and international contracts will follow the standard procurement
guidelines and the payment will be made through traditional disbursement procedures.
Risk Analysis:
From the financial management perspective, there is low risk affecting the credit. This is
because the credit would have only several consultancy contracts, where the financial flows are
simply from Special Account to the Consultants and direct payments by the World Bank in case of
ITC-ILO contract and will be paid as per the terms and conditions of contractual agreements.
- 40 -



Implementation Arrangements:
The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) in IMED under the Ministry of Planning
(MOP) will have the overall responsibility for implementation of the project. The CPTU is a
permanent set up established under the project headed by a Director General and will be assisted
by a core team consisting of accountant and administrative staff. There will be two units in CPTU
headed by two Directors for: Procurement Rules, Procedures and Training, and Monitoring &
Evaluation.
There will be local and international consultants including a full time financial management
consultant to assist the CPTU during the tenure of the project.
Funds Flow:
IDA funds will be channeled through a special account in a commercial Bank with terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA. The DG, CPTU will be the authorized person for issuing
payments through checks, payment request to Chief Accounts Officer (CAO) of the ministry for
counterpart funds and withdrawal of funds from IDA credit. IDA will make direct payment to
ITC-ILO with intimation to CPTU.
The GOB will allocate counterpart funds for the project on the basis of annual
development plan (ADP) and Ministry of Finance would release funds to MOP in four trances
against approved Technical Assistance Project Proforma (TAPP). The CAO of MOP would
make payment of Govt's share of actual project expenditure upon receiving statement of
expenditure or payment request from CPTU.
Accounting and Internal Controls:
The financial management system would cover all project related transactions, i.e., all
sources and usages of funds would be accounted for and reflected in the financial statements.
Books of accounts would be maintained on a cash basis using double-entry bookkeeping
principles. The accounting system would capture financial data using Govt's standard Chart of
Account and would be capable of providing financial information by project Disbursement
Categories and funding sources.
A current manual system in IMED will be followed in CPTU which is adequate to keep
track with financial transactions. Though the computerized accounting system is not imperative
for effective financial management system, the implementing agency has a plan to go for
computerized system, provided CPTU appoints staff with required IT skills.
Approval authority and the procedures to process financial transaction are laid down in the
Project Accounting Manual of the Govermnent and will be followed in case of transactions
relating to eligible project expenditure, including contracts not requiring Bank's clearance.
-41 -



Financial Reporting and Monitoring:
The CPTU will be responsible for accounting, reporting and consolidation of financial
information from various sources including actual expenditure on ITC-ILO contract. The
Financial Statements will be prepared within fifteen days of the following month.
CPTU is also responsible for preparing Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) on a
senm-annual basis. A set of customized formats of FMRs are included in the PIP and would be
submitted to the Bank for monitoring project physical and financial progress.
Staffing:
The Accountant currently working in IMED will handle financial management activities of the
CPTU, once the CPTU has been established. In addition, a financial management consultant will be
appointed to help CPTU in maintaining a sound project financial management during the tenure of
the project.
Job descriptions of the financial management consultant is included in the PIP. The
accountant would start functioning from the beginning of the project. The financial management
consultant (FMC) is expected to be in place by June 30, 2002.
External Audit:
The annual financial statement of the project would be audited by the Comptroller and
Auditor General (C&AG) and would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of
each fiscal year. The audit report will include a separate opinion on Project Financial Statements,
Special Account, and SOE.
The following audit reports would be monitored in the Audit Report Compliance
system (ARCS):
Implementing Agency       Audit                    Auditors
IMED                      Project Account/SOE      C & AG
IMED                      Special Account          C & AG
Retroactive Financing
Vehicles / office equipment and part of the operating expenses will be required at the
start-up of the project, and IDA will provide retroactive financing for such expenditures.
Retroactive financing will be provided for an amount not exceeding US$300,000 for expenditures
incurred after January 1, 2002.
3. Disbursement Arrangements
Table C shows the allocation of IDA proceeds and the financing for various categories of
expenditures. Preparation and submission of withdrawal applications would be the responsibility of the

IMED. The proposed project is expected to be disbursed over a period of five years. The closing date of
the proposed project will be November 30, 2005. Disbursement estimates of IDA proceeds over a five-year
period are presented on page 2 of the PAD.

Total                                     4.45
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Transaction-based disbursement procedures will be applicable for withdrawal of funds from the
Credit. With each withdrawal application, IDA will require full documentation where contracts for (i)
goods exceed US$100,000 equivalent, (ii) consulting firms exceeds US$100,000 equivalent, and (iii)
individual consultants exceeds US$50,000. Expenditures below the above thresholds and expenditures for:
individual training, and (b) operating costs will be claimed through SOEs.
Special account:
To facilitate project implementation and to make timely payments of IDA's shares of eligible
expenditures to consultants (except ITC-ILO contract) and suppliers, the Borrower may open and maintain
a Special Account (SA) in Convertible Taka in a commercial bank, on terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA. Payments under ITC-ILO contract will follow "Blanket Withdrawal Applications" procedures as laid
down in the contract between ITC-ILO and IMED. Director General, CPTU will have access and manage
the Special Account. The authorized allocation of the Special Account will be equivalent to four-months of
estimated expenditures, excluding ITC/ILO contract, equivalent to BDT 13,600,000.00. At start of the
project the initial deposit to the SA will be limited to BDT 9,000,000. The remaining amount of the
authorized allocation may be requested only after the cumulative disbursements reach the equivalent of
SDR 800,000.
