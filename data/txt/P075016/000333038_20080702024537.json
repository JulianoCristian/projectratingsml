 Reform Project for Bangladesh were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            continuity of qualified and experienced Project Director for\n            the initial years of the project, if not for the entire\n            period, can contribute immensely to moving difficult reform\n            agenda forward and while providing better conduit for\n            project implementation. Continuous efforts need to be made\n            through successive interventions to institutionalize\n            capacity development with a robust framework for monitoring\n            and evaluation of procurement performance through a set of\n            clearly defined well articulated set of indicators. Reform\n            actions can be sequenced for a longer-term horizon with\n            clearly laid out phased approach, most likely through a\n            number of interventions/ projects, each with specific\n            objectives, focused within the framework of the project."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
