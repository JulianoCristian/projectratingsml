Thus, the Public Procurement Reform\n            Project aims at supporting public procurement reform, by\n            introducing appropriate rules and procedures, building\n            procurement management capacity, and establishing the\n            mechanisms to improve transparency. The project components\n            will: 1) establish a Central Procurement Technical Unit\n            (CPTU), created as a permanent institution funded under\n            revenue budget, at the Ministry of Planning, whose\n            responsibility will be to prod procurement reforms in line\n            with the recommendations of the Country Procurement\n            Assessment Report (CPAR). CPTU may provide\n            technical/professional advice, but shall not provide opinion\n            on procurement evaluations, or awards, in order to preserve\n            its role as policy, technical assistance, training, and\n            oversight unit; 2) implement public procurement reforms,\n            and, rules and procedures, and help develop standard bidding\n            documents in line with the CPAR recommendations, while the\n            CPTU will follow a participatory consultation process\n            involving government, and private sector stakeholders, to\n            develop ownership, and support reforms; and, 3) improve\n            procurement management capacity by institutionalizing\n            comprehensive, and regular training programs through\n            selected institutions, and, by establishing a monitoring and\n            evaluation capacity at CPTU to monitor the procurement\n            performance of public entities."}, "docdt": "2002-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
