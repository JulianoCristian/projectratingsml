The project's overall objectives were to:\n            protect the existing priority road network and strengthen\n            road institutions through: (i) the involvement of the local\n            industry; (ii) greater efficiency in force account works;\n            (iii) improved personnel management and training; (iv) local\n            financing of maintenance and rehabilitation through the road\n            fund; and (v) continued institutional development and\n            capacity building. Bank performance was rated satisfactory.\n            Borrower performance was rated deficient. There were eight\n            key lessons learned from the project and they were as\n            follows: (a) streamline procurement procedures; (b) assess\n            the relative costs of force account versus private\n            contracting and ensure adequate commitment to increase\n            private participation by private enterprises in road\n            maintenance and rehabilitation; (c) establish adequate and\n            timely project accounts and audits; (d) design the project\n            with a monitorable objective, such as a transfer of\n            knowledge and expertise to the local counterparts; (e) avoid\n            the project-by-project approach in the highways sector\n            without a broad policy statement; (f) use Bank remedies,\n            such as suspension, for Borrower compliance of covenants;\n            (g) have all donors review annual programs in a sector round\n            table as is done under the Transport Sector Project(TSP);\n            and (h) seek borrower and stakeholder ownership prior to\n            appraisal and maintain it during implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-03-19T00:00:00Z"}
