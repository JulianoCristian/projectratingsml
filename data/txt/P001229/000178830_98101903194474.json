After 30 years,\n            when the first timber is expected to be felled on saw-wood\n            plantations in the proposed project, about half the output\n            will be absorbed domestically and the other half exported.\n            Ecological advantages and relatively short distance provide\n            comparative marketing advantages in the Near East which is a\n            potentially important market for Kenyan saw-wood. It may\n            also be possible for the project to supply some of the\n            European demand for high quality softwood. The pulpwood\n            plantations, which will be operated on a 14-15 years\n            rotation, will produce raw material for a pulp and paper\n            mill to be located at Broderick Falls near the plantations."}, "docdt": "1969-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
