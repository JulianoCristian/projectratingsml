Project's (MRMP II) Environmental Management Plan (EMP)\n            is to identify the environmental mitigation measures,\n            screening process, capacity building and monitoring\n            activities to be undertaken, as well as the institutional\n            arrangements to be set up to ensure that any potential\n            adverse environmental impacts are either eliminated or\n            minimized. The overall environmental impacts of the project\n            are expected to be positive. The inclusion of the Global\n            Environmental Facility component will ensure that\n            environmental considerations are mainstreamed in the\n            project. The environmental assessment identifies potential\n            environmental impacts on drinking water quality. To reduce\n            the impact of water contamination by sewage or animal\n            wastes, cisterns will be dredged every three years to\n            restore the dead storage capacity taken up by sedimentation.\n            Animals will be kept away from the cisterns used for\n            drinking water. Water treatment mitigation measures involve\n            the sterilization of water. To reduce the potential impacts\n            related to the range rehabilitation activities, the location\n            will be planned and a connectivity between the areas for\n            habitat will be maintained. Construction of cisterns must\n            incorporate a silt trap, sediment basin and sieve on the\n            inlet side of the cistern to reduce potential impacts from\n            the small-scale infrastructure subprojects and rural roads."}, "docdt": "2003-02-05T00:00:00Z"}
