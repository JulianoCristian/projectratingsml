 people living in the Northwest Coastal zone, reducing the\n            incidence of poverty, through community development,\n            capacity building, and access to services to help improve\n            welfare, and increase incomes to conserve, rehabilitate, and\n            use their natural resources in a sustainable manner. The\n            project comprises six components as follows. Capacity\n            building of communities includes an initial training,\n            followed by a criteria, and processes for establishing\n            development activities, prioritizing on resource allocation.\n            It also includes women's development capacity, to allow\n            them partake in the participatory planning process. The\n            integrated natural resource management will focus on: water\n            harvesting, and watershed management, through underground\n            cisterns/reservoirs, dykes of water and soil retention, and,\n            implementation of sustainable watershed management plans;\n            develop a strategy for sustained use of communal resources,\n            managing vegetation together with animals; and, integrate\n            biodiversity conservation, through education, awareness, and\n            capacity building, introducing alternative fuel sources. The\n            development of productive activities comprises an extension\n            outreach, and adaptive research for livestock, crop, and\n            horticulture production, as well as off-farm productive\n            activities, to diversify rural household incomes. The rural\n            roads component will prod the possibility for further\n            sources of income, while the revolving fund, and rural\n            micro-finance component will support the establishment of\n            professional credit retailers in the project area. Project\n            management will fund technical assistance and monitoring, as\n            well as equipment and vehicles."}, "docdt": "2003-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
