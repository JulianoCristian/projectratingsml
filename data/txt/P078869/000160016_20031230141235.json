outcome is rated satisfactory\n            with project sustainability likely. A key factor in the\n            successful outcome of this first operation was the\n            Government's strong commitment to the reform process in\n            the financial sector. With respect to macroeconomic\n            policies, the government has held firm in terms of its\n            commitment to lowering inflation. More stable inflation\n            during the past two years has contributed to lower\n            inflation-adjusted interest rates. The strong commitment of\n            the Implementing Agency, the Ministry of Finance, and the\n            high degree of cooperation of the Superintendency of Banking\n            were also conducive to the Program's satisfactory and\n            timely results. World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            both rated highly satisfactory. Findings and implications\n            for subsequent operations in this series included the\n            following: 1) By emphasizing legislative and regulatory\n            changes in the first Operation of a Programmatic series,\n            there are some benefits of scope in the design of\n            conditionality across various sub-sectors, followed by\n            greater attention to implementation and second generation\n            reforms in subsequent operations. 2) It is more difficult to\n            apply and enforce current international best practices than\n            to design them: Regulators were keen to begin enforcing new\n            market rate risk norms but had to provide detailed guidance\n            and await the building up of internal capacity and\n            competency n the supervised financial entities before the\n            process could be implemented in a successful manner. 3) The\n            design of new regulatory tools and the development of more\n            complex rules, as part of a financial sector reform program,\n            should depend on the commitment of the Government to provide\n            the resources to upgrade supervisory skills as well as on a\n            timetable for helping regulators become expert in\n            implementing new policies and procedures. 4) A solid\n            macroeconomic policy framework is essential for the\n            successful implementation of a financial sector reform\n            program; the Government's success in lowering inflation\n            and resuming growth during the past two years has helped to\n            stabilize the financial system. 5) The completion of a\n            comprehensive stocktaking study of the financial sector\n            emphasizing potential risks should provide an initial\n            perspective on the impact of recent financial sector reforms\n            and any future risks."}, "docdt": "2003-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
