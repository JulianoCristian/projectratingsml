crisis, and to strengthen the government's\n            capacity to manage and mitigate weaknesses in the financial\n            system. A key aspect of the proposed program is the design\n            of a multi pronged effort to first dispose of the financial\n            system's residual loan assets by developing more agile\n            and modern financial instruments and fiduciary arrangements\n            to package, and sell loan assets. The project also aims to\n            strengthen and diversify the participation of the housing\n            mortgage market including improved access to finance for the\n            micro sector, as well as strengthening non bank financial\n            services, and securities institutions in the financial\n            system. The securitization industry will be further\n            developed to support bank asset sales, to provide more\n            liquidity to the mortgage industry, and to help develop the\n            capital markets. A reform of the entire securities\n            legislation will be conducted as part of the program's\n            second phase, to promote a more agile development of the\n            local capital market. This will involve reforming corporate\n            governance and disclosure standards as well as proper\n            criteria for securities industry participants."}, "docdt": "2003-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
