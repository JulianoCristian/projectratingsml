3. Program Description
3.a. Overall Program
I.     The Financial Sector Program which is supported by two Programmatic Loans (this ICR covering the
first) encompasses comprehensive sector reforms that were embarked upon by the Government to overcome the
difficulties resulting from the 1998-99 banking crisis and achieve sound growth of the financial system. A
programmatic approach was adopted because of the need for flexibility in terms of loan timing and
conditionality in view of the complexity and the sequencing of the reform efforts. This first Operation
(Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loan I, P-FSAL I) focused on legislative and regulatory reforms
oriented mainly towards the banking system, with the expectation that the implementation of these reforms in
the financial system would provide a sound basis for the Second Operation which would have a larger focus on
non-bank financial institutions and capital markets. Because of the reform sequencing under the two
Operations, it was necessary to allow for flexible timing between the two phases to ensure that all necessary
reforms had been fully applied in the first operation within realistic time margins, so as to allow the second
operation to build on these adequately. At the same time, the government's financial sector strategy was a
comprehensive medium-term program that had been defined for the duration of the current administration,
which took office in August 2002. Bank support was thus appropriately envisioned as a series of Operations,
which would also permit adjustments, as the new administration unfolded its reform agenda for the banking
system and the subsequent capital market and non bank sectoral reforms.
The objectives of the overall Program were:
(i)   to strengthen the government's capacity to manage and mitigate weaknesses in the financial
system through an improved legal and regulatory framework and the implementation of
modernized risk management approaches to cushion future losses;
(ii)  to complete the clean up of the banking system as a result of the 1998-2001 crisis and provide
mechanisms to dispose of assets which might represent contingent liabilities of the State, and
(iii)  to strengthen and diversify the participation of the housing mortgage market as well as of non-
bank financial & insurance services. as well as the securities market framework and related
institutions in the financial system.
2.     The achievement of the first objective was to focus on the reinforcement of existing financial legislation
to incorporate better standards of corporate accountability, governance and risk management as key elements in
the regulatory framework. A new financial system law would enable the supervisory agencies to establish more
effective rules and regulations that would strengthen the basis for banking practices promoting sound growth as
well as modernized risk management tools for financial system participants.
3.    In support of the second objective the Government was to implement measures to dispose of the
financial system's loan assets remaining from earlier bank interventions, while making collateral liquidation
procedures and future bank resolution processes more agile and effective. In addition, the remaining intervened
banks were expected to be divested and the largest public second tier problem bank to be wound down.
4.     The third objective was to be supported by several initiatives including the development of market risk
hedging mechanisms for the mortgage sector and micro finance instruments, a liquid securitization market for
primary residential mortgages, the raising of capital adequacy standards in the insurance sector, the deepening
of the government securities market including the development of unbiased securities valuation methodologies
and more effective government debt management policies, and the reform of the securities legislation to
promote a more agile development of the local capital market.

The principal componenits of the program include:
1. Bank Regulation and Resolution
*  Implementation of the Reformed Financial System Law to strengthen and ensure sustainability and
prudential treatment of credit, market, governance and operating risks in the financial system;
*  Implementation of the refonned Financial system Law for improving the effectiveness of banking
resolution procedures to reduce excessive fiscal outlays in the process;
*  Privatization and winding down of State banks;
II. Housing Finance
* Strengthening the housing finance sector and expansion of the mortgage market while mitigating
market and financial risks in that sector. This includes development of instruments to hedge interest
rate and inflation risks, expansion of micro housing credit instruments, and further developing the
mortgage securitization market.
III. Non-bank financial institutions
* Strengthening the regulatory framework and financial soundness of the insurance, trust and pension
industries.
IV. Capital Markets
* Modernizing the legislative framework for the securities market and instituting improved market
surveillance procedures and higher professional standards for market participants.
V. The Government Debt and Money Markets
* Upgrading the policy and operational framework for the government securities market and developing
that market as a zero risk benchmark for fixed income securities.
Economic Context
5.     At the time of the Program's preparation, Colombia's vulnerability to external shocks had intensified as
a result of increased domestic violence and uncertainty regarding the future path of the internal conflict; a
worsening of market sentiment towards Latin America; problems in Venezuela, the second largest market for
Colombia's non-traditional exports; and an uncertain outlook for the US economy, Colombia's main trading
partner. These problems were exacerbated by a sharp deterioration in sovereign debt spreads. which posed
greater hurdles for the management of the country's external debt. On the other hand, Colombia was relatively
well-equipped to deal with moderate external shocks, given its floating exchange rate, falling inflation, adequate
international reserves, as well its commitment to the implementation of fiscal adjustments. On the fiscal side,
the nationwide referendum called for by the Administration to seek support for its program, did not garner the
critical mass of voters to make it binding (despite the fact that over 90% of those who did vote, supported the
proposed government initiatives) - this generated some uncertainty regarding the ability of the government to
fully implement its intended fiscal and macroeconomic stabilization program.
6.     Colombia's macroeconomic performance was expected to continue to improve during the period under
the Program; although it was anticipated to take longer for the economy to achieve its full growth potential.
During the period 1983-1997, and prior to the economic recession which started in 1998, GDP growth had
averaged 4.1 percent per annum, compared to the projected growth rate of 3.0 percent during the
implementation of the Program covering 2003-06.
7.     The principal risk to the country's macroeconomic stability, and thus to the sustainability of the
financial sector reforms, remained the large fiscal deficits and the high burden of public sector debt. Excluding
the one-time effects of the privatizations, the public sector deficit had risen from 0.3 percent of GDP in 1993 to
4.3 percent in 2001 (see Economic Indicators Table 1 in the Annex). Assuming full implementation of the
macroeconomic reform package, it was expected that the overall public sector deficit would fall from about 4.0



- 4 -
percent of GDP in 2002, to between 2.5 - 3.0 percent in 2003, and then to between 2.0 - 2.5 percent during
2004-2005.
8.     External Environment. The outlook for the external sector at the time of Program preparation was
less favorable than during the previous economic expansion period. While the current account deficit was not
expected to grow, financing from the capital account, particularly from private lenders, was expected to reflect
negative flows on the order between -US$ 1.0 billion to -US$1.5 billion, for the foreseeable future. Therefore,
balance of payments financing requirements would have to rely primarily on multilateral and official financing
to meet the gap which, including other sources of capital inflows, would require on average, US$2 billion
annually during the Program period 2003-2004.
Status of the Financial System
9.     As a result of the economic downturn during 1998-1999, the financial system had entered a period of
substantial stress. The adverse effects were significantly accentuated by turbulence in the global financial
markets which affected most emerging economies in 1998. At the same time, domestic interest rates jumped in
1998 to very high levels, which intensified credit woes in the financial system (see Table I in the Annex). One
of the factors behind the increase in domestic interest rates was the Government's reduced access to external
financing, which led to greater reliance on domestic financial markets, thus putting upward pressures on interest
rates.
10.    Two particularly vulnerable components of the financial system at that time were the CAVs (Housing
Finance Banks) and the cooperatives. The CAVs specialized in residential mortgage lending and had built up a
notable pricing imbalance between their deposit liabilities which paid a nominal peso rate of interest and their
mortgage loans which were indexed to the inflation rate. The dramatic rise in peso interest rates (DTF rates)
resulted in excessively high real, or inflation adjusted, interest rates, thus creating an unsustainable unfavorable
gap between the mortgage bank's interest income and expenses.
11.    As a result of the financial sector crisis, total assets of the commercial and housing banks dropped 25
percent in real terms during 1999-2002. In dollar terms, the banking system shrunk by 40 percent during that
period. Huge losses during 1998-2000, induced by problem loans, resulted in an average return on equity
(ROE) of -24 percent. By 2002, system earnings had recovered to an acceptable ROE of 9.6 percent (see Table
2 in the Annex). However, within these figures, the commercial banks showed much improved results while
segments of the CAVs (renamed BECHs following the crisis) still had serious vulnerabilities from over
exposure to the mortgage sector.
12.    The Bank's successful FSAL during 1999-2000 had helped set the stage for closer collaboration with
the Government on the preparation of the current Program. The measures supported by that FSAL focused on
three key areas: (i) intervention, liquidity and capital support for weak institutions; (ii) strengthening of capital
and solvency standards; and (iii) implementation of early corrective actions by the Banking Superintendency
and Fogafin to avert an eventual failure of an institution. While these measures were comprehensive, they faced
institutional and legal constraints that were addressed in the design of this Program.
3.b. The Current Operation (P-FSAL I)
13.    The P-FSAL I dealt with the adoption of major banking reforms and regulations; while the second P-
FSAL II is expected to focus on the implementation of institutional reforms and the preparation of a revised
securities law and a framework for the non-bank sector. This Operation was thus designed to set the stage for a
sound and sustainable banking sector and some initiation of reforms in the non-bank sectors, to be expanded
further under the subsequent loan. The actions contemplated under the P-FSAL I comprise a critical mass of
reforms and institutional upgrading that are expected to correct remaining weaknesses in the banking system
and to support the successful outcome of the entire Program.



- 5 -
14.    The banking legislative component in P-FSAL I was anchored in the passage of Law 795 of the
financial system and the development of appropriate rules and regulations to enhance asset quality, earnings
performance, and liquidity of financial intermediaries, while introducing new methodologies for measuring and
managing credit risks, interest rate risks, and other mark-et risks. The bank reso]ution measures were aimed at
structuring a standard operational procedure for the swift resolution of intervened banks by carving out and
securitizing the "good" assets with corresponding deposit liabilities of the affected institution under a scheme
that sought to minimize the government's deposit insurance liabilities.
15.    The housing finance initiatives focused on legal reforms to streamline banking foreclosure proceedings,
increasing access to housing micro-financing, providing an inflation hedging mechanism for mortgage
borrowers; and enhancing the liquidity of mortgage-backed securities.
16.    The other components of the operation focused selectively on other key areas of the financial system.
With respect to non-bank financial institutions, P-FSAL I called for a strengthening of basic capital standards
for the insurance industry. The capital markets and the govemnment debt components shared similar initiatives:
the consolidation of methodologies for securities valuation adopted by both the Superintendency of Banks (SB)
and the Superintendency of Securities (SV), as part of an ongoing convergence strategy regarding the regulatory
standards applied by both agencies; and the establishment of a formal arrangement for coordination of
examination activities undertaken by both supervisors. In addition, the government debt market component
called for the development of a pricing methodology for the valuation of government securities based on a
standard yield curve that would in turn be applied to the valuation of other non-government fixed-income
securities.
4. Achievement of Objectives anid Outputs
17.    The outcome of the first operation, P-FSAL I, is considered highly satisfactory in terms of its
contribution to the overall objectives of the Program. Many of the achievements of this operation dealt with the
establishment of a framework - through legislative and regulatory reforms, that will serve as the basis for the
continuation of the Program through its implementation as part of the second operation. The principal
achievements are outlined in Table 1 below.

18.    The measures aimed at improving banking regulations are expected to result in greater efficiency and
competitiveness in financial intermediation. Most regulations pertaining to the provisions of Law 795 are
issued. The introduction of the SARC methodology which reflects some of the most advanced Basel II
recommended models for bank quantification and reporting of credit risks, elevates risk management to a new
level seen primarily in the more highly developed countries. Financial intermediaries, under these rules, are
developing internal quantitative and actuarial models to project losses and provisioning requirements in their
portfolios based on both probabilistic and credit history data. The methodologies use highly sophisticated
statistical tools which incorporate expert knowledge on risk attributes - these are being introduced by
regulation, and are expected to be fully implemented by end 2004 once the SB has evaluated the methodologies
presented by the banks in the system. In terms of financial asset valuations, new norms for the valuation of
securities developed under a common methodology by the SB, SV and the Central Bank, adopt international
best practices. Both of these regulatory innovations will result in improved transparency in asset classification
and pricing in the financial system. The SB has started implementing Basel norms regarding interest rate risk
and other market risks. Once fully implemented, these regulations will contribute a more solid solvency position
of financial intermediaries and a better ability to foresee and deal with asset price changes and requisite loss
provisioning. The SB has developed methods for evaluating financial intermediaries that will enable regulators
to better track their risk profiles. Nevertheless, the successful outcome of the bank regulation initiatives now
hinges on the SB's ability to enforce the new norms in the banking sector in a timely manner. In this context,
supervisors need to be brought fully up to speed regarding the review process for methodologies presented by
banks, and efficient oversight methods to detect weaknesses once they are implemented. For this, the
Superintendency of Banks (SB) will require additional resources for staff training, hiring of personnel, and
acquisition of needed equipment and software.
19.    The introduction of a new bank resolution scheme, backed by Law 795, to facilitate the expedient
resolution of intervened financial intermediaries should minimize the fiscal cost of any future interventions. The
process whereby the deposit insurance agency, FOGAFIN, carves out the good assets to be placed in a trust
under a securitized instrument that in turn backs the corresponding deposit liabilities of the intervened bank, has
been applied successfully in other countries and facilitates the prompt transfer of assets to new institutional
buyers. In the meantime, the State bank. BANCAFE has been formally offered for privatization and IFI, the
non-solvent industrial development bank has been wound down, with its remaining viable assets merged into
BANCOLDEX, the export financing development bank.
20.    Selective initiatives in the housing finance sector have improved the infrastructure for lending. The
measures adopted under the P-FSAL I were aimed at channeling more financing to the lower income bracket of
the population, to protect existing borrowers from unexpected increases in inflation; and to contribute to greater
liquidity of the mortgage-backed securities market and availability of micro housing credit and micro housing
leasing through the banking system. Despite the positive characteristics of these initiatives, the lingering
memories of the 1998-1999 financial system crisis have discouraged banks from extending residential
mortgages, though the measures under the operation provide numerous incentives and market hedges to expand
in that sector. With the securitization market now developing, the SB has also progressed in developing a
capital adequacy regulation for asset risks inherent in mortgage securitization instruments.



- 8 -
21.    Demand for the inflation hedge by borrowers has been below the targeted level, in part because
consumers find the mechanism complex, and also because inflation has been relatively low and stable during
the past two years. On a related initiative, the Central Bank program for banks to swap the rates on their
mortgages from a UVR (inflation) to a DTF (interest rate on deposits) based index has also met with minimal
demand.' Once again, the design of the FRECH swap mechanism may have limited its appeal2, although the
relatively low inflation rates and peso interest rates have discouraged banks from incurring the costs associated
with this hedging instrument. Should nominal interest rates become more volatile in the future, the availability
of these hedging schemes will serve to minimize systemic risk. More importantly in the short-run, as regulators
begin to adopt a more strict adherence to interest rate risk guidelines, financial institutions are more likely to
seek these swap mechanisms as well as directly adjusting their asset/liability gap in order to avoid encumbering
their own capital to provision for such risks. In the meantime, the Central Bank is developing an alternative
option instrument to purchase interest rate protection. The Central Bank's fund used for swapping mortgage
securities into government securities for use in collateral under repo transactions, is now operational.
22.    Government efforts under the P-FSAL I to strengthen the regulatory framework and financial
soundness of the insurance, trust and pension industries have so far established a new regulatory framework
demanding stricter solvency and capital standards. Additional substantive measures for implementing the new
standards and developing appropriate risk measurement models, are conditioned on the second operation with
respect to the implementation of new proposed methodologies for risk management (SEARS for insurance
sector) that address insurance companies' calculation of technical and mathematical reserves against a broad
menu of risk factors, as well as identifying values-at-risk in the investment portfolios of insurance companies,
pension funds, and trusts, an area that has progressed substantially in terms of defining the underlying
methodologies and transparent disclosure of market risks of institutional investors that manage collective
investment schemes.
23.    The capital market measures emphasized joint actions between the Superintendency of Banks and the
Superintendency of Securities. Each regulatory agency issued comparable rules regarding the valuation of
public sector fixed income securities and certain private sector securities. Bank participation in this process was
instrumental in getting the Securities Valuation Committee, comprised of the MoF, SB, and SV. and which had
unsuccessfully attempted to reach an accord on a common valuation methodology since 1995, to agree on a
common set of rules and methodologies. later incorporated into regulation. At the same time, the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding between the two regulatory agencies to carry out joint supervision and
surveillance, should help to preserve a level playing field within the financial system and avoid regulatory
arbitrage. To-date, much progress has been achieved in developing regulations for harmonizing the prudential
rules for the operation of mutual funds and similar collective investment schemes. Submission to Congress of a
new Securities Market Law would strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework for the issuance of new
securities in the market, and has been identified as a feature of the second operation.
24.    In an effort to bolster the liquidity of the government securities market and to provide an accurate
methodology for the valuation of a range of other securities, the government, as part of the P-FSAL I,
developed a framework to construct a zero coupon yield curve, including the authorization for the Treasury to
issue short term T-bills, which will then be applied to the development of a matrix of fixed-income security
prices. The more rigorous valuation process will result in greater transparency and eventual investor demand for
long-term securities, which will likely improve the supply of instruments for longer term financing.
Most housing loans are indexed to inflation using the so-called UVR index. On the other hand, driven by depositor
preferences, banks usually pay a nominal peso interest rate on their deposits (DTF rate). The short duration of these
deposits imply that the banks' liabilities are being re-priced at a high frequency, and are thus vulnerable to a jump in
nominal interest rates that could create an unfavorable interest rate gap between their deposits and loans.
2To protect against upswings in interest rates, participants in the FRECH swap needed to continuously contribute funds
reflecting the difference between the current low interest rates and the trigger rate beyond which participants were
protected. However, in a low rate environment, banks were suffering cash outflows and would only benefit once rates rose
above the trigger. A protracted period of low rates was making the mechanisms less desirable and unpopular.

25.    In view of the wide scope and complexity of the new reforms adopted in the P-FSAL I and considering
the remaining weaknesses in the financial system, it is essential that the government undertake a stocktaking
review of the financial sector as specified in the matrix of conditionality for the second operation. This review
should include appropriate stress tests of the banks' loans portfolios, and the vulnerability of housing finance
banks to interest rate changes as well as asset/liability risk mismatches. Progress is already underway and a first
draft has been prepared jointly by the authorities and the Bank. The conclusions of the study may result in some
adjustments in the design of the Second Operation.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
26.    The vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, as explained in the earlier section, had initially
dampened activity in the financial sector leaving some segments of the system more fragile than others. The
regulators' decision to implement the new rules in a gradual manner (such as the verification of the new risk
management models to be presented by both banks and insurance companies, as well as some components of
market risk provisioning), were influenced by concerns about possible negative repercussions on the balance
sheets of financial institutions, and the need to avoid inadvertent technical insolvencies on account of purely
normative rather than performance criteria. Nevertheless, regulators should consider fully implementing these
rules as soon as technical capacity is evidenced both within the private sector and the SB, so as to avoid
obscuring fundamental solvency issues which would have been less apparent under the older normative
framework.
27.    The presentation of new legislation, which depends on Congressional approval, is to some extent
beyond the control of the Government. In this case the modernization of the legislative framework for the
securities market involves the passage of a revised securities law. Recent government setbacks at the polls as
well as in assuring passage of an ambitious set of fiscal reforms, could affect the timely approval of such
legislation, which is a condition for the second operation of the Program.
28.    A key factor in the successful outcome of the first operation was the Government's strong commitment
to the reform process in the financial sector. With respect to macroeconomic policies, the government has held
firm in terms of its commitment to lowering inflation. More stable inflation during the past two years has
contributed to lower inflation-adjusted interest rates. The strong commitment of the Implementing Agency,
MoF and the high degree of cooperation of the SB, was also conducive to the Program's satisfactory and timely
results.
6. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
29.   In the identification phase of the Program the Bank showed sound judgment in selecting the targets
drawing on the previous experience with the earlier FSAL as well as comparative reforms undertaken in other
parts of the region. The Bank was instrumental in getting the regulatory agencies to work out an agreement
regarding the methodologies for the valuation of securities and providing technical assistance in the process.
While the design of the P-FSAL I was complex, it was compatible with the Borrower's capacity. In general the
Program and the corresponding first operation were well designed and consistent with the Bank's country
strategy and its contribution to macroeconomic stability.
Borrower
30.    The commitment of the Government to support the Programmatic framework was instrumental in the
smooth process of design and implementation of the P-FSAL I. Senior staff at the Implementing Agency, the
MoF, as well as the staff of key regulatory/supervisory agencies such as SB, SV, and Fogafin, were closely
involved in the design of the Program and had also participated in the earlier FSAL. The three agencies
maintained a very positive policy dialogue with the Bank during program design. The quality of the technical



- 1( -
output produced by the Implementing Agency as well as the SB, the Central Bank, Fogafin, and the SV, was
excellent.
7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series
*  By emphasizing legislative and regulatory changes in the first Operation of a Programmatic series, there
are some benefits of scope in the design of conditionality across various sub-sectors; followed by
greater attention to implementation and second generation reforms in subsequent operations. The P-
FSAL I was heavily weighted towards legislative and regulatory reforms. This approach also appears to
be more adaptable to a relatively new government which can, at the outset, push forward an ambitious
legislative agenda.
* It is easier to design sophisticated methodologies for risk management that reflect current international
best practices, than to apply and enforce them. In the case of the P-FSAL I, regulators were keen to
begin enforcement of the new market rate risk norms but had to provide detailed guidance and await the
building up of internal capacity and competency in the supervised financial entities, before the process
could be implemented in a successful manner. Likewise, the internal capacity requirements on the part
of the SB, to implement such changes, need to be incremented to ensure a timely conclusion.
*  The design of new regulatory tools and the development of more complex rules, as part of a financial
sector reform program, should be dependent on the commitment from the Government to provide the
resources to upgrade supervisory skills as well as on a realistic timetable for bringing regulators up to
speed in the implementation of new policies and procedures. The development of the SARC system as
well as the expanded CAMEL rating of financial institutions will require additional training of
examiners as well as time to fully implement. Budgetary support and expert training to match the new
responsibilities, should be adequately provided to ensure success.
*  A solid macroeconomic policy framework is an essential condition for the successful implementation of
a financial sector reform program. The Government's success in bringing down inflation and resuming
growth during the past two years has helped to stabilize the financial system.
*  While the successful outcome of the P-FSAL I will improve the likelihood of a successful second
operation, the completion of a comprehensive stocktaking study of the financial sector with emphasis
on potential risks should provide an initial perspective on the impact of recent financial sector reforms
and any future risks, particularly on those aspects related to capital adequacy and loss provisioning for
achieving adequate solvency. These latter effects will become more transparent following the
stocktaking analysis. The recommendations from such a study should be used as input in the final
design of the Second Operation.

INFORME DE EVALUACION
Primera Operaci6n: Cr6dito Programatico de Ajuste para el Sector Financiero, P-FSAL I
Ministerio de Hacienda y Credito Publico - Direcci6n General de Regulaci6n Financiera
Con el prop6sito de continuar promoviendo el fortalecimiento del sistema financiero y el desarrollo del
mercado de capitales, el Gobierno Nacional solicit6 al Banco Mundial la estructuraci6n y el acompahamiento
para el desarrollo de un nuevo cr6dito programatico de ajuste para el sector financiero, FSAL I Programatico
Las acciones mas importantes que el presente Gobierno ha puesto en marcha, en el marco de los
compromisos de 6ste cr6dito, estan relacionados con las areas de fortalecimiento de la regulaci6n, supervisi6n y



- 11 -
esquemas de resolucion de entidades, creaci6n de mecanismos para la financiaci6n de programas de vivienda y
apoyo al desarrollo del mercado de valores y de deuda publica.
Como consecuencia, a partir del ano 2002, el sector financiero ha presentado una recuperacion
significativa frente a la dificil situaci6n presentada a finales de la decada del 90 y, hoy por hoy, las distintas
entidades que conforman el sector financiero presentan menores niveles de cartera vencida, menor exposici6n
patrimonial y mejores indicadores de rentabilidad. Ademas, la recuperaci6n del sector financiero ha contribuido a
Ia reactivaci6n de los diversos sectores de la economia por cuanto el sector financiero es canalizador de
recursos hacia el sector productivo y eje del sistema de pagos.
En efecto, los indicadores disponibles muestran que este ano el crecimiento del PIB sera mayor al de la
meta establecida para el ano 2003 (2.0%); al primer semestre de este aho el crecimiento del PIB fue de 3.1% y
sectores como el de la construcci6n, servicios financieros, industria manufacturera, comercio y transporte deben
seguir impulsando este crecimiento.
DESARROLLOS
Un aspecto importante que se ha venido desarrollando para seguir en la direcci6n de fortalecer el sistema
financiero y adecuar nuevos instrumentos es la reglamentaci6n de la Ley de Reforma Financiera (Ley 795 de
2003); la misma incluye dentro de sus articulados muchos de los compromisos adquiridos por el Gobierno
Nacional en la Matriz de condicionalidades del FSAL I Programatico.
Instrumentos y operaciones previsto en la Ley 795 de 2003, tales como el leasing habitacional, cuyo fin
es impulsar la construcci6n y financiaci6n de vivienda; fondeo para el microcr6dito, para financiaci6n de
microempresas; y, operaciones de microcredito inmobiliario, han permitido incentivar el desarrollo de
determinados nichos de mercado.
Igualmente, el establecimiento de nuevas medidas de salvamento y resoluci6n de entidades; normas de
protecci6n a los clientes y usuarios del sistema financiero; incorporaci6n de parametros que otorgan mayor
responsabilidad al supervisor bancario y establecimiento de un regimen sancionatorio objetivo y coherente; y
ajuste al regimen de algunas entidades financieras publicas con el prop6sito de definir su funci6n dentro del
sistema financiero, ha permitido modernizar algunos aspectos de la legislaci6n, corregir las debilidades
evidenciadas en el proceso de reacomodamiento del sector financiero y flexibilizar rigideces de la normatividad
actual.
Por otro lado, y en desarrollo de la Ley de Ajuste a la Legislaci6n Financiera, se han emitidos normas
claras y prudentes en el desarrollo de la actividad de intermediaci6n que permitan una adecuada supervisi6n asi
como, normas que armonizan la legislaci6n colombiana con los parametros internacionales en materia de
solvencia, capitales minimos y regimen de inversiones, particularmente del sector asegurador.
En el tema de vivienda y su financiaci6n, y teniendo en consideraci6n que este sector es un pilar
generador de empleo y de inversi6n, se han disenado nuevos mecanismos para contrarrestar los factores que
afectan la demanda de credito y el riesgo en que incurren las entidades crediticias. Lo anterior, en el marco de la
Ley 546 de 1999 que introdujo ajustes que significaron una profunda modificaci6n a la estructura de financiacion
de vivienda e implicaron el reordenamiento del negocio y de su regulaci6n.
De esta forma, las medidas adoptadas en el marco de esta Ley, han permitido definir claramente las
caracteristicas de los cr6ditos hipotecarios y los nuevos mecanismos creados por el gobierno estan teniendo



- 12 -
buenos resultados. Ademas, si el entorno macro y las tasas de cambio e inflaci6n siguen bajo control se
generara mayor confianza en el sistema, lo que a su vez fortalecera la reactivacion que se viene presentando.
Uno de los esquemas creados con la finalidad de implementar un mecanismo que le permita a los
usuarios de vivienda asegurar los flujos futuros de sus creditos hipotecarios y al sector financiero acelerar el
proceso de desembolsos de cr6ditos para financiaci6n de vivienda dentro de un marco de seguridad y riesgo
manejable es la cobertura contra la inflaci6n que, a agosto de 2003, ya habia sido solicitado por 6.024 deudores
de creditos por valor de $148.000 millones.
Igualmente, se ha continuado revisando el esquema de operacion del Fondo de Reserva para la
Estabilizaci6n de la Cartera Hipotecaria - FRECH, mecanismo creado para cubrir el riesgo de los
establecimientos de credito hipotecario del diferencial entre la tasa de inter6s y la inflaci6n. Principalmente, se
han adelantado estudios para determinar la viabilidad del mecanismo a las necesidades de los agentes
involucrados. Ante todo se busca garantizar la estabilidad del sector financiero hipotecario dada la volatilidad
existente en sus fuentes de fondeo.
Como se observa, la estrategia del Gobierno para el sector de la construcci6n y la financiaci6n de
vivienda ha sido integral, sin dejar de lado el impulso decidido a la vivienda de interes social y a la adquisici6n de
la misma, dada la importancia de este tipo de vivienda dentro de segmentos de la poblacion colombiana.
Por otro lado, y en desarrollo del programa de Renovaci6n de la Administraci6n PCublica, a traves del
cual se adelanta la creaci6n y consolidaci6n de un Estado gerencial, que presupone una gesti6n austera en el
manejo de los recursos publicos y al servicio del ciudadano, se ha venido adelantando la racionalizaci6n de
entidades estatales, incluidas las del sector financiero. El espiritu de esta politica es enajenar las participaciones
accionarias que se tengan en diferentes entes econ6micos publicos y privados, conservando exclusivamente
aquellas entidades necesarias para que el Estado cumpla con su funci6n social.
En cumplimiento de esta politica de racionalizaci6n de la banca publica el Gobierno tom6 la decision de
mantener como unica entidad financiera publica de primer piso al Banco Agrario de Colombia S.A. y procedio a
liquidar la Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero, castigar los activos improductivos y transferir los activos
productivos y los pasivos con el publico del BCH a Granahorrar, transferir los activos productivos y pasivos con
el publico de BanEstado a Bancaf6. Respecto de Bancafe, actualmente se esta buscando vincular como
operador estrategico a un inversionista(s) calificado(s) para tener a su cargo la operaci6n del banco y con el
apoyo de FOGAFIN y la Corporaci6n Financiera Internacional (IFC) se apoyara el proceso de vinculaci6n de
capital privado en el Banco.
El sector fiduciario y la banca de segundo piso tambien ha sido objeto de intervenci6n con el prop6sito
de reducir la participaci6n del Estado en este sector. En el primer caso, la ultima acci6n adelantada tiene que
ver con la fusi6n por absorci6n de Fiduagraria S.A. con Fiduifi S.A.. y, en el segundo caso, con el desmonte del
IFI mediante la cesion de activos y pasivos a BANCOLDEX y la recuperaci6n de activos residuales mediante la
venta a un tercero.
Otro aspecto que se debe mencionar en el cual el Gobierno Nacional esta comprometido, dado el
fen6meno de la globalizaci6n de los mercados que exige que la regulaci6n de los mismos se ajuste a las
practicas y tendencias internacionales y que la competencia y las nuevas tecnologias en informatica y
comunicaciones han permitido un vertiginoso desarrollo de los mercados de valores alrededor del mundo, es la
necesidad de ajustar el esquema regulatorio a las nuevas formas de negocios y a los nuevos riesgos
involucrados.



- 13 -
Bajo esta premisa, se ha retomado el analisis de proyectos de regulacion y del anteproyecto de ley para
regular las actividades de manejo, aprovechamiento e inversi6n de recursos del publico que se efectuen
mediante valores, con el fin de proveer al pa[s de un marco legal coherente, actualizado, moderno y flexible, que
organice las distintas autoridades, instituciones y agentes del mercado de valores de manera armonica; proteja
los derechos de los inversionistas; promueva el desarrollo, eficiencia y funcionamiento; y preserve la confianza
del publico. Hay que mencionar, ademas, el esfuerzo que el Gobierno Nacional esta haciendo para fortalecer la
supervisi6n del mercado de valores.
CONCLUSIONES
Son muchas las tareas por desarrollar para continuar con los esfuerzos hasta ahora realizados y lograr
afianzar el sector financiero asi como el fortalecimiento de la regulaci6n, supervisi6n, creaci6n de mecanismos
para la financiaci6n de programas de vivienda y apoyo al desarrollo del mercado de valores y de deuda publica.
Por ello, el Gobierno Nacional, para la segunda fase del FSAL Programatico, ha previsto continuar y
complementar las reformas iniciadas, dentro de las cuales se pueden destacar:
*  Continuar con la reglamentaci6n e implementacion de  la Ley 795 de 2003 mediante la emisi6n de
Decretos y Circulares.
*  Adoptar por parte de la SB un Plan Estrat6gico que incluya procesos de supervisi6n y politicas,
manuales y procedimientos, metodologias de valoracion de riesgos, entre otros.
*  Adoptar medidas que incrementen la competitividad, eficiencia y transparencia del mercado hipotecario.
*  Presentar propuestas de reforma al Mercado de Valores, ya sea a traves de Decretos o Leyes.
Sin embargo, es importante mencionar que los avances son satisfactorios y las condiciones econ6micas
y sociales estan dadas para continuar con las reformas que se requieran en la direcci6n de dotar al mercado
intermediado y no intermediado de estabilidad y claridad en las reglas que los regulan, en beneficio de todos los
participantes, en particular, usuarios del cr6dito, inversionistas, instituciones, ahorradores, depositantes y demas
actores.
