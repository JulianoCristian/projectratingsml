    financial crisis of February 2001, and, ensure as well\n            continued social programs through adequate funding. To this\n            end, the project will examine, and help the government amend\n            as needed the banking regulatory framework, including\n            strengthening of the new Bank Regulation and Supervision\n            Agency (BRSA), and, restructuring/privatization of state\n            banks. Regulation regarding banking failure resolution and\n            problem banks, will be institutionally strengthened, through\n            a process of aligning prudential banking systems, to reduce\n            banking vulnerability, withstand external shocks (thereby\n            reduce systemic failure risk), to position Turkey's\n            banking sector for accession to the European Union (EU), in\n            accordance with applicable EU banking sector directives.\n            Furthermore, structural fiscal adjustment policies will be\n            supported, to achieve macroeconomic stability, and ensure\n            the protection of public social spending. The\n            Government's public expenditure management reform\n            program will be broadened, which includes improvements to\n            budget planning, financial accountability, and public\n            liability management, as well as initial steps for civil\n            service reforms. However, the politically sensitive public\n            sector reform agenda may be jeopardized by vested interest\n            groups, while capacity constraints are also risks that may\n            hinder the pace of envisaged reforms."}, "docdt": "2002-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
