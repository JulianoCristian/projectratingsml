{"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that The lesson\n            learned indicated that a number of banks that had fallen\n            below the minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) level were\n            re-capitalized from private sources. Vakif bank received a\n            subordinated loan from the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund\n            (SDIF) to meet the minimum CAR requirement. Presently only\n            two banks remain with SDIF (Bayindir and Pamuk). Liquidation\n            proceedings for Ticaret are continuing, although these have\n            been interrupted from time to time by legal actions taken by\n            the employee pension fund. Pamuk bank was re-offered for\n            sale as of April 2003 and SDIF is currently evaluating the\n            two active proposals. Bayindir's status as a bridge\n            bank and the timing of its eventual liquidation will be\n            reviewed at the appropriate time. The failure of Imar bank\n            in mid-2003 was a serious blow. The bank, owned by the\n            controversial Uzan Group, saw its license revoked by the\n            Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) in July 2003.\n            A subsequent investigation found that the bank: (i) vastly\n            understated its deposits - a true total of US$5.5 billion in\n            contrast to the balance sheet figure of US$550 million; (ii)\n            had paid only a fraction of its with-holding tax\n            obligations; and (iii) had sold some US$500 million in\n            T-bills that it had never owned and was not licensed to\n            sell. The Government announced a payment plan for individual\n            depositors in November which will create a burden on the\n            Treasury totaling some 2.2 percent of GNP. Imar bank has not\n            been formally intervened by SDIF and therefore the blanket\n            guarantee for depositors and creditors has not been invoked.\n            Following completion of a review of the improvements\n            required in the legal framework for bankruptcy and\n            collateral foreclosure to facilitate resolution of\n            non-performing loans (NPLs)-meeting a second tranche\n            condition for Programmatif Financial Sector Adjustment Loan\n            - PFPSAL II, a series of amendments to the Execution and\n            Bankruptcy Act (EBA) were enacted in mid-2003. The\n            Government has prepared a second set of amendments to\n            introduce a pre-packaged bankruptcy option in the EBA and\n            these additional amendments are expected to be enacted by\n            early 2004."}, "docdt": "2003-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
