Health Sector\n            Support Project is to assist the Kingdom of Tonga in\n            improving the performance of its health sector by supporting\n            selected reforms.  The project is comprised of four\n            components.  The first component, strengthening health care\n            financing will support the review, development and\n            implementation of policies which define the funding and\n            overall allocation of resources to health services.  The\n            second component, improving health information management,\n            will include three sub-components: (i) strengthening the\n            information culture, (ii) developing and implementing a\n            Hospital Information System at Vaiola Hospital, and (iii)\n            information management for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD)\n            prevention and control.  The third component, improving the\n            quality of Vaiola Hospital, will improve the administrative,\n            technical and functional efficiency of Vaiola Hospital by\n            investing in infrastructure redevelopment and management\n            strengthening. This component will focus on three areas:\n            redevelopment of Vaiola Hospital, improving hospital\n            management and developing a health care waste management\n            system.  The fourth component concerns project management\n            and coordination and the operation of the Project Management\n            Unit (PMU)."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
