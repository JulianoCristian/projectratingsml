satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: close\n            coordination with development partners during preparation\n            and implementation was critical. Complementary technical\n            assistance provided by Australian Agency for International\n            Development (AusAID) and World Health Organization (WHO) was\n            crucial to the development of the sector. The capacity to\n            mobilize financial resources from Japan International\n            Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Bank for the redevelopment\n            of the Vaiola Hospital and the close monitoring of progress\n            of construction packages financed by the two financiers\n            ensured that construction work was completed timely and\n            effectively. The strategy pursued through this Project and\n            through activities financed by AusAID and WHO gives evidence\n            of a balanced choice between visible results in terms of\n            reconstruction and improved service delivery and the\n            development of a health financing policy framework and\n            medium-term planning. The decision by Government and the\n            project team to focus intensively on strengthening of\n            information management and processes, as well as basic\n            computer skills development, for the first half of project\n            implementation before investing in computerized information\n            systems was crucial to maximize the effectiveness of\n            Hospital Information System (HIS) investments, and build\n            user support and buy-in. Institutionalization of important\n            activities such as National Health Account (NHAs) can be\n            achieved with strong commitment from relevant staff and\n            management who understand the benefits for decision making\n            to be derived from the NHAs."}, "docdt": "2010-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
