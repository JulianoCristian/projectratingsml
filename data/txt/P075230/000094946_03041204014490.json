Vaiola Hospital - a\n            redevelopment program, which include facilities\n            infrastructure works. However, the likelihood of asbestos\n            presence in a hazardous form, poses concerns during the\n            renovation process, not only as related to patients, but to\n            the public at large. Moreover, medical wastes generated by\n            health facilities, are considered hazardous materials that\n            may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive, which should be\n            handled in accordance with standard medical, and biomedical\n            waste management disposal practices. The first volume\n            focuses on the issue of asbestos, and offers guidance as\n            follows: should demolition activities generate visible\n            airborne dust, the contractor(s) will cease activities until\n            the dust is controlled, namely by water spraying; and,\n            demolition contractors should include in their bids,\n            techniques to control, and monitor materials of potential\n            environmental concern, such as that in the resilient floor\n            covering, and Transite board materials found at the Vaiola\n            Hospital. Asbestos should be removed from demolition debris,\n            treated as hazardous material, kept adequately wet until\n            disposed of in accordance with international standards. The\n            second volume identifies medical waste management issues,\n            and proposes initially the development of a health care\n            waste management policy, and comprehensive plan, that\n            includes training and public awareness, supported by\n            appropriate legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks.\n            Mitigation measures call for the proper disposal of\n            segregated infectious medical wastes, using options such as\n            autoclave, landfill, and existing incineration, as the case\n            may require. A sanitary wastewater treatment system should\n            be installed at Vaiola Hospital, while the use of\n            disinfected effluents for irrigation, and sanitary sludge\n            composting for soil amendment, should be evaluated."}, "docdt": "2003-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
