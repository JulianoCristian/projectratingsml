Second Railway Project - Credit 903-MAG
Project Completion Report
Preface
The Second Railway Project was financed with a Credit of US$ 13.0
million, which was approved on May 8, 1979, was signed on May 20, 1979 and
became effective on May 7, 1980. The closing date of June 30, 1984 was not
extended. The Credit was disbursed except for US$ 21,044.61 which was
cancelled.
The project was cofinanced both by the Caisse Central de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and Fonds d'Aide et Cooperation (FAC) of
France. CCCE financed FF90 million (about US$20.5 million equivalent) for
the original project, increased by another FF71.5 million (US$11.0 million
equivalent) to cover the Recovery Program from 1982. FAC made a grant of
FF2.0 million (US$300,000 equivalent) for further assistance to the
Recovery Program, not foreseen in the origlnal project.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
Transportation Division, Eastern and Southern Africa Projects Department.
The PCR is based on data provided by the Reseau National des Chemins de Fer
Malagasy (RNCFM, Madagascar National Railway) and in particular the RNCFM
Bilan des Operations dated October 1984, missions in 1984 and 1985 for the
preparation and appraisal of the Third Railway Credit (Credit 1694-MAG),
and a review of Bank files including supervision reports.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Copies of the draft report were sent to the Borrower for comments.
Comments received are reproduced as Attachment I to the report.

IDA/CCCE legal conditions, such as conditions precedent to the disbursement
of the CCCE Loan, and the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between RNCFM and the
Government. The implementation of the physical component was moderately
successful after rapid procurement of IDA-financed project components.
Procurement of rolling stock had to be reduced by 20% to finance badly
needed spare parts. Most of the track renewal and infrastructure work on
less essential lines had to deferred to the Third Railway Project due to
critical shortages of spare parts and sleepers. Implementation of
institutional and financial measures fell short of appraisal plans due to
the Government's inability to take required institutional decisions.
RNCFM's operational performance deteriorated during 1980-82 leading to a
severe deterioration of its financial situation, caused partly due to
inadequate tariffs and revenue collection and the lack of operational
autonomy for RNCFM (paras. 3.01, 3.02, and 5.04).
6.       To overcome the deterioration, the Government, RNCFM, CCCE and IDA
agreed in late 1981 on a Recovery Program also comprising the supply of two
additional locomotives, track maintenance equipment, spare parts, and 65
man-months of additional technical assistance in the fields of management,
planning, operations, and equipment utilization and maintenance.
Implementation of the program increased Project cost, by about FMG 4.1
billion, most of which was financed from additional CCCE lending. In mid-
1982 IDA suspended the credit on the grounds that the Government and RNCFM
failed to comply with several institutional and fi?Lancia  covenants of the
Project agreement, particularly the need to revise tariffs and for the
Government and parastatals to pay their overdue bills to RNCFM (para. 3.04).
7.       The suspension was lifted in late 1982 when the Government changed
the status of RNCFM to give it more operational autonomy and started
implementing the Recovery Program. Project implementation during 1983-84
went smoothly and the operational and financial results of RNCFM improved
dramatically although traffic continued to decline. This demonstrated that
IDA was right in participating actively in the design of the Recovery
Program, closely supervising its impleme.tation and suspending its Credit
until the Government took institutional and organizational measures allowing
RNCFM's to improve its efficiency and financial viabilit, (paras. 3.02-3.10).
8.       Total Project cost amounted to FMG 16.8 billion (US$56 million
equivalent) translating into cost overruns of 75% in FMG and of 28% in
dollar terms., This included the Recovery Program estimated at FMG 4.1                  *
billion (US$13.7 million equivalent). The cost of the original Project
(excluding the Recovery Program) exceeded appraisal forecasts by 32%
measured in local currency, but was 3% below appraisal expectation measured
in dollars. The difference between the overrun/underrun in local currency
and dollars is explained by changes in the exchange rate over the Project
period (para. 3.05).
9.       The obsolescence and poor condition of motive power and rolling
stock at the time of Project approval and the acute shortage of spare parts
during Project implementation prevented RNCFM from achieving the unrealistic-
ally high operating targets listed in the Project Agreement (para. 3.09).
10.      There were no procurement problems of any consequence encountered
during Project execution. Credit disbursements were essentially completed
one year ahead of appraisal schedule despite the late start of Project
implementation (para. 3.11).

MADAGASCAR
Second Railway Project - Credit 903 MAG
Proiect Completion Report
Highlights
1.       Fourth largest island in the world, Madagascar is still in an
early stage of development.  Ninety percent of its 9.5 million inhabitants
work in the agricultural sector, the output of which accounts for 40% of
GDP. As an Island Madagascar is naturally dependent upon mainline shipping
for external links. This explains why the main transport links from the
ports of Toamasina and Manakara (both on the East Coast) to Antananarivo,
the capital, and Fianarantsoa respectively are served by railway lines and
parallel roads. The Government has started to replace part of the old
Toamasina-Antananarivo road by a new paved highway. However, since the
remaining old paved section of the Toamasina-Antananarivo road is badly
aligned and the Manakara-Fianarantsoa road is 60% (100 km) longer than the
railway line, the railway will remain a main transport means both for
freight and passengers. Almost half the island's population lives in areas
served by these railway links (paras. 1.01 and 1.02).
2.       Bank support to the Railway began with a First Railway Project
(Credit 488 MAG in FY1974). This project was essentially a holding
operation aimed at keeping the Reseau National des Chemins de Fer Malagasy
(RNCFH) operational. The project was moderately successful and useful
since it helped the Government to maintain its main transport link between
the port of Toamasina and Antananarivo, and made the Government aware of
the shortcomings of its railway such as its inadequate operational
efficiency and poor financial performance (para. 1.03).
3.       As the First Project was nearing completion, the Government
requested IDA participation in a Second Project, the objective of which was
to enhance the Railway's operating efficiency and financial viability. The
Project was based on RNCFM's 1978-85 investment plan, amended and
supplemented by an operating plan prepared by consultants SOFRERAIL
(France). During appraisal in April 1978, conducted jointly with CCCE
(France), it ws8 decided that the Project should also include technical
assistance for improving RNCFM's operations, financial and accounting
procedures and carrying out of a study on the long-term viability of
RNCFM's secondary lines (paras. 2.01 to 2.05).
4.       The Project comprised: (i) track renewal and maintenance work and
equipment; (ii) the pro#ision of motive power, rolling stock and spare
parts; (iii) infrastructure rehabilitation work and equipment; and (iv) 50
man months of technical assistance. The Project cost was estimated at FMG
9.6 billion (US$43.7 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component
of FMG 7.4 billion (US$33.5 million eqvtivalent) of which FMG 0.1 billion
was for technical assistance, including the study of secondary lines. The
foreign exchange component was to be financed from an IDA US$13 million
Credit and a French Francs 90 million (about US$20.5 million) CCCE Loan
(paras. 2.02, 2.06, and 2.08).
5.       Project implementation and disbu:sements started one year behind
the appraisal schedule due to delays in Credit effectiveness to meet



- vi -
11.      The financial objectives of the Project ware surpassed.  RNCFM's
operation yielded a return of 7.6% on net fixed assets in 1983 and 12.6% in
1984 compared to the 3% Credit Agreement target. The 1984 achievement was
twice the appraisal projections. Thanks to this impressive return to
profitability, RNCFM's short-term financial situation was very comfortable
by Project completion. Mainly because of the heavy additional loans
contracted for financing the Recovery Program RNCFM's long-term situation
was less positive and the effect of additional borrowing has to be
carefully watched. This is taken care of in the financial covenants of the
Third Railway Project (paras. 5.01 to 5.12).
12.      Sinde RNCFM's good financial results were achieved despite lower
than anticipated traffic, they were mainly generated by tariff increases.
The potentiul adverse effect of high and inflexible tariff increases could
have been counter-productive in a more competitive environment. In
retrospect, IDA did not pay enough attention to the need for market-
oriented tariffs (paras. 4.01 to 4.02).
13.      The institutional objectives of the Project were reached.  The new
legal status of RNCFM grants it the operational and financial independence
it needs to play its role efficiently in the Malagasy economy (para. 6.01).
14.      Mainly due to the very poor economic performance of Madagascar
over the 1979-83 period railway traffic was considerably less than forecast
at appraisal. RNCFM's traffic performance in 1984 was 36% below the
appraisal forecast. The shortfall in traffic adversely affected the
economic rate of return of the Project, despite increases in RNCFM's
operational capacity and improved institutional setting. The reestimated
ERR was 122 as compared to the 17% estimated at appraisal, mainly because
of lower traffic demand and slow implementation of the track renewal and
improvement program (paras. 4.01 to 4.02).
15.      The Association's role in project preparation, design and
supervision was highly efficient. The combination of the design and
implementatior of the Recovery Program, disbursement suspension and the
continuation of a constructive dialogue with the Government and RNCFM, in
close cooperation with the co-financiers, was effective since it induced
the Government to take long overdue institutional and financial measures.
The effectiveness of this combination should be re-membered as an efficient
tool for handling future potential problem projects (paras. 6.06 to 6.08).
16.      Another lesson to be drawn from this project is the advantage of
spreading IDA action over a long period of time and several projects. In
this particular case, the First Project (1974-79) was no more than a
holding operation aimed'at keeping the Railway in operation. Despite a
relatively low econom:; rate of return, the Second Project (1980-84)
reached most of its objectives i.e. to (i) change RNCFN's legal status and
organization; (ii) improve its operating efficiency; and (iii) restore its
financial viability. The Third Project (1985-89) is expected to (i) make
sure that the institutional changes implemented during the Second Project
will be efficiently applied; (ii) further improve RNCFM's operation
efficiency and financial viability; and (iii) introduce a market-oriented
pricing policy (paras. 6.02 to 6.05 and 7.05).

Second Railway Project - Credit 903-MAG
Pro1ect Completion Report
I. Introduction
1.01     Fourth largest island in the world, Madagascar covers an area of
about 590,000 km2. The topography is generally rugged and a central
mountain range traverses the country from north to south. The tocal
population was estimated at 9.5 million in 1985 and growing at almost 3%
p.a. The population is unevenly distributed, with about one half of all
inhabita;.ts occupying the central quarter of the island: ninety percent of
the population work in the agricultural sector, the output of which
accounts for 40% of the Gross Domestic Product. The main crops are rice
and cassava, used for domestic consumption, and coffee, cloves and vanilla
which are the country's most important export commodities. Scarce mineral
resources consist mainly of graphite, chromite and mica which are also
exported. Manufacturing, which accounts for 14% of GDP, consists almost
entirely of consumer induvcries catering to local demand and agro-
industries. Annual per _apita income grew from about $200 by the end of
the 1970s to about $265 in the mid 1980s. As a result of the urgent need
to correct serious imbalances in the external account, the volume of
imports in 1985 was approximately 23% lower than in 1978; the scarcity of
raw materials and spare parts had disrupting consequences for the economy's
productivity.
1.02     As an island Madagascar is naturally dependent upon mainline
shipping for links with the outside world. The domestic transport system
consists therefore essentially of links between the ports and the inland
for carrying imports and exports.  This explains why two of the main
transport links are the two rail sections between the Ports of Toamasina,
which handles 66% of Madagascar imports and exports, and Manakara (both on
the east cost), and the Central Plateau. Each railway line is paralleled
by roads. The Government has replaced part of the old Toamasina-
Antananarivo road by a new paved highway. However, the remaining older
parts of this road are still of low standard, narrow and badly aligned.
The railway may lose some traffic to this and other roads, construction and
maintenance of which has been supported by the World Bank during six
consecutive Highway Projects. However, the railway will for a long time
remain a main mode of transport, both for bulk cargo and passengers,
between the most populated and economically developed parts of the country.
Almost half the island's population lives in areas directly served by the
railway.
1.03     Support for the railway began with a First Railway prolect (Credit
488 HAG, $6 million) approved in 1974. As mentioned in the June 26, 1984
Project Performance Audit Report this project was essentially a holding
operation aimed at keeping the railway operational. Political unrest,
underestimated costs and delays in implementation resulted in scaling down
the initial project; the overall estimated rate of return was less than
10X; and the financial and institutional performance of the Reseau National
des Chemins de Fer (RNCFM) was poor. However the project was useful



- 2 -
becauset (a) it helped the Government to maintair. opeii its main transport
link; and (b) it made the Government conscious of the shurtcoming of its
railway's institutional setting and financial objectives and organization.
The Second Project aimed at pursuing the rehabilitation of the railway
track and equipment and implementing institutional changes required for
improving its organizational, managerial, and financial efficiency.



II. Project Identification. Preparation and Appraisal
Identification and Preparation
2.01     The Second Railway Project (the Project) is a sequel to the
previous project (First Railway Project - Credit 488 MAG). In early 1977,
the Government and RNCFM asked the Association to participate in a Second
Railway Project based on the railway's proposed investment plan divided in
two tranches covering the years 1979-82 and 1983-85 respectively.
Consultants SOFRERAIL (France) were commissioned to prepare an investment
plan for the period 1978 through 1985 and to draw up an operating plan.
Both studies financed from Credit 488 MAG were concurrently carried out in
February - May 1977. The Government and the railway accepted the
consultants' amendments and proposed for World Bank consideration the first
(1979-82) tranche of the investment plan. In fact, the World Bank
assistance covered RNCFM's investment program through 1983, since it became
clear that implementation of the track renewal program could not be
completed earlier.
2.02     A Bank preappraisal mission visited Madagascar from October 28 to
November 7, 1977. The main conclusions of the mission were that in
addition to physical investments, the project should include technical
assistance for improving the institutional setting, operations and RNCFM's
financial and accounting systems and procedures. The appraisal mission was
carried out April 1-18, 1978, in parallel with a CCCE mission.
2.03     The main issues raised during appraisal and the Decision Meeting
were: (i) cofinancing arrangements; (ii) the railway's institutional and
organization status; (iii) the railway's inadequate financial performance
and situation; (iv) the railway's ability to respond to anticipated traffic
demand in the light of road competition; and (v) the future of secondary
lines, mainly the Manakara-Fianarantsoa (FCE) line.
2.04     In order to couply with the World Bank's conditions for Board
presentation the Government increased RNCFM's tariffs by 25% across the
board effective March 17, 1979 and reimbursed RNCFM two-thirds of all the
s^counts receivable of Government departments and parastatals as of October
31, 1978.
2.05     Taking into consideration the railway's inherent problems the
Project focused on:
(a) the continuation of the renewal and modernization of fixed
installations, motive power, rolling stock, telecommunications
and container handling facilities;
(b) the improvement of its operations' and making them more reliable
and efficient through increased productivity and capacity :
(c) the improvement of the railway's financial management and
accounting system; and
(d) the carrying out of studies on the long term viability of the
Antananarivo-Antsirabe (TA) and the FCE lines.
The two latter items were to be carried out with the help of consultants.



- 4 -
2.06     The project's main physical components were:
A. Track
(i) the renewal of worn out track on 74 km of the Antananarivo-Cote
Eat (TCE) line and of 106 km on the Moramanga-Lac Aloatra (MLA)
line;
(ii) the improvement of 124 km of track on the TCE line;
(iii) the procurement and installation of 136 points and crossing; and
(iv) the procurement of quarry equipment for RPCFM's own ballast
production unit, of equipment for sleeper production and of track
maintenance equipment.
B. Motive Power and Rolling Stock
the procurement of seven line locomotives, 1 rail car, 10 coaches
and 76 freight-cars.
C. Infrastructure
(i) the realignment of about 14 km of track between Ambila and
Brickaville, the repair of selected bridges and structures and
the rebuilding/improvement of yards;
(ii) the improvement of the telecommunications system; and
(iii) the improvement of workshop installations and the replacement of
workshop equipment.
2.07     The project's software component comprised:
D. Technical Assistance
(i) design and implementation of an up-to-date financial and general
and cost-accounting system based on recommendations made by
consultants under the First Railway Project, and training of
accounting personnel; and
(ii)  implementation of the railway's newly designed operating plan.
E.  Study
- Carrying out of a study of the long-term viability of the two TA
and FCE railway lines, having a low-volume of traffic.
To help RNCFM to implement project components D and E, the Credit included
funds for the financing of about 50 man-months of technical assistance.
Cost and Financing
2.08     The Project was estimated to cost FMG 9.6 billion, (US$43.7
million equivalent) with a foreign component of FMG 7.4 billion (US$33.5



-5-
million equivalent). This estimate included 10% physical contingencies on
the Ambila-Brickaville realignment and Brickaville yard rebuilding project
components and price contingencies projected at 10% p.a. for local cost
over 1979-83 and at 7.52 for 1979 and 7% over 19E0-83 for foreign costs.
RNCFM was expected to finance the local cost (FMO4 2.2 billion, US$10.2
equivalent), while Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and IDA
were to share the financing of foreign cost as follows:   CCCE FMG 4.5
billion (US$20.5 million equivalent at the then prevailing exchange rate of
US$1.0 = FMG 220) and IDA FMG 2.9 billion, US$13 million equivalent. No
FAC assistance was envisaged at that time. CCCE agreed to finance motive
power, passenger and freight rolling stock, track maintenance equipment and
the realignment of 14 km of track on the Ambila-Brickaville (TCE line), and
IDA track and technical assistance as indicated in Para 2.06.

III. Project Implementation and Cost
Credit Effectiveness
3.01     The Credit and Project Agreements became effective almost one full
year after signature due to the Government's delay in meeting the
conditions of Credit effectiveness which weret (i) fulfillment of all
conditions precedent to the disbursement of the CCCE Loan; (ii) the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and RNCFM; and (iii) the
Legal Opinion.
Physical Components
3.02     Implementation of the physical components of the Project was
moderately successful. Procurement of track renewal material and
equipment, the main item financed from the Credit, was completed rapidly.
An aerial rope-way for sleeper production, however, was deleted from the
project to release funds to finance high priority spare parts. The
locomotives and the railcar financed by the CCCE were procured on time but
only 7 coaches and 60 freightcars were purchased (para 3.09) to allow for
the purchase of badly needed spare parts. Track renewal and infrastructure
works were completed in early 1984 on the main Tomasina-Antananarivo (TCE)
line but most of the works had to be deferred on the Moramanga-Lac Alaotra
(MLA) line due to inadequate supply of sleepers and ballast. These works
are now underway as part of the Third Project.
Technical Assistance Component
3.03     Financial Procedures.  The local firm appointed to upgrade RNCFM's
financial and accounting procedures and to plan and supervise their
implementation could only complete the design phase, mainly due to the
inadequacy of the railway's computer equipment. The implementation phase
YTas carried out as part of the Recovery Program (para 3.12). Cost
Accounting and Implementation of the operating plan. Because of the
problems in recruiting suitable experts, implementation of these items
suffered delays and the Credit funds earmarked for them were reallocated to
finance the Recovery Program. They were Implemented later under CCCE
financing. Study of the Viability of the TA and FCE Lines. The study was
carried out in 1984. Its conclusions were that the TA line covers
operating costs and even makes a contribution to RNCFM's overheads, but
that the FCE line does not, and is in poor condition. While this
conclusion made sense from a strict financial point of view, it did not
take into consideration the transport needs of the area, the only other
transport means being a poorly aligned road between Fianarantsoa and the
coast, over 60% (100 km) longer than the railway. Sections of this road
are impassable during the raining season. Transport planning in the area
was therefore funded by the Bank's Project Preparation Facility. Based on
this study the Government submitted, at negotiations of the Third Railway
project, an Action Plan on the FCE line, providing for rail transport until
adequate road transport becomes available.

Recovery Program and Credit Disbursement Suspension
3.04     While the investment component of the project was executed
satisfactorily it became clear at an early stage of project implementation
that the operational efficiency and financial performance of the railway
was se7erely declining. To halt the decline a Recovery Program was set up
in late 1981, which is explained fully in Chapter 6. Most of the problems
addressed in this Program had been identified during appraisal. They would
have been at least partially resolved if the Government and RNCFM had
complied with related covenants of the Credit and the Project Agreement.
To press the Government and RNCFM to take needed action, including full
implementation of the Recovery Program, the Association suspended Credit
Disbursements in June 1982. The suspension was lifted in November 1982
after the Government and RNCFM took such action. The design and
implementation of the Recovery Program favorably affected RNCFM's operating
efficiency (Chapter 4) and financial results (Chapter 5).
Proiect Cost and Financing
Costs
3.05     Table 1 (page 1) shows actual and projected costs.  Total project
cost expressed in FMG amounted to FMO 16.8 billion versus the FMG 9.6
billion appraisal forecast. The FMG 7.2 billion cost overrun represents
75% of the appraisal estimates. However, FMG 4.1 billion of the increase
represents the cost of the Recovery Program, reducing the overrun on the
original project to 32% measured in local currency. A rough breakdown of
the Recovery Program cost is as follows:
Two additional locomotives            FMG 300 million
Additional track equipment                900 million
(including shunters and
tamping equipment)
Spare parts                              2000 million
Additional technical assistance           900 million
4100 million
Table 1, page 3, demonstrates that, when expressed in dollar equivalent,
the cost of the original Project was actually below appraisal estimates.
The total Project cost amounted to US$55.96 million (a 28% overrun over the
$43.66 appraisal estimate) of which $13.65 million for the Recovery Program
and $42.31 million for the original Project. The latter amount represents
a 3S underrun as compared with the appraisal projection. This underrun in
US$ equivalent project cost is explained by the devaluations of the FMG
against the US$. The exchange rate fell from FMG 212.72/$ in 1979 to FMG
576.60/$ in 1984. Local prices more than doubled over the same period.

CCCE financed the major part of the overrun, the major part of which
represents the financing of the Recoverv Program.  Most of the technical
assistance component of the Program was carried out by SOFRERAIL with CCCE
financing (FMG 700 million). Some short-term problem identification
missions were carried out by OFERKAT, a French railway technical assistance
organization, financed by the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC)
(FMG 100 million). This originally unplanned aid by FAC came as additional
support for the Recovery Program (Chapter 6). An analysis of the execution
of major project components covering the original Project and changes
resulting from the implementation of the Recovery Program follows.
Track Renewal and I!provement
3.07    The Project provided for the renewal of about 160 km of track out
of which 54 km on the TCE line and 106 km on the MLA line, and the
improvement of 124 km of track on the TCE line. In 1981 the Association
agreed to finance the renewal of an additional 13 km of track as part of
the Recovery Program to facilitate traffic on a difficult section of the
TCE. RNCFM also purchased equipment and materials on its own to renew an
additional 21 km on the MLA line. Although needed equipment and materials
were purchased and delivered by the end of 1983, track renewal was
completed on 60 km of the TCE line (the highest priority sections) but only
3 km of the MLA line (106 km) by December 1984.  Track improvement work was
completed on only 28 km of 124 kms. The main reasons for the slow
implementation of the track renewal on the MILA line and track improvement
program were: (a) the shortage of motive power to haul service trains;
(b) the shortage of ballast due to the lack of specialized equipment and
deficient operation of the railway's quarry; and (c) insufficient
availability of sleepers due to deficiencies in the railway's wooden
sleeper production unit. To make up for these deficiencies the Recovery
Program included the supply of: (a) two additional locomotives and four
additional shunting locomotive; (b) a crusher for the quarry; (c) steel
sleepers; and (d) the provision of technical assistance for improving track
renewal and track improvement planning and procedures, operations at the
quarry and the sleeper production units. However, the effect of the
Recovery Program designed in late 1981 was not immediate since delivery



- 9 -
delays of equipment ordered under the Program generally exceeded one year,
and most of the equipment was not delivered before mid-1984. Because of
this late delivery and of RNCFM's shortage of sleepers, the MLA track
renewal program was deferred. It is now included in the Third Railway
Project, which also includes the supply of steel sleepers. Some 40 km of
MLA track were rehabilitated in 1985 and 1986.
3.08     The total cost of the track renewal program amounted to FMG 8.2
billion compared to appraisal estimates of FMG 4.6 billion. The larger FMG
3 billion part of the FMG 3.6 billion cost increase is due to the
devaluation of the FMG. The rest is explained by the purchase of
additional track maintenance equipment under the Recovery Program.
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.09     The Project provided for the procurement of seven line
locomotives, 1 railcar, 10 coaches and 76 freightcars, all under CCCE
financing. Actual procurement of rolling stock was reduced in order to
purchafce additional spare parts, some quarry equipment and track motor
trolleys. Nine locomotives were actually purchased, two additional ones
under the Recovery Program. The railcar was purchased but the procurement
of coaches was reduced to seven. The number of freight cars was also
reduced to 60 (30 flat and 30 covered). The actual cost of this project
component was double the appraisal estimates (FMG 6 billion versus 3
billion projected). FMG 2.4 billion of this differenc_ is explained by the
procurement under the Recovery Program of badly needed spare parts to
rehabilitate idle locomotives and shunters. The remaining FMG 0.6 billion
overrun is explained by domestic inflation (FMG 250 million) and by
currency devaluation.
Infrastructure
3.10     The track realignment on the critical section between Ambila and
Brickaville was completed in December 1981. Local costs were in line with
appraisal forecasts but the foreign cost (FMG 910 million), financed by
CCCE, exceeded appraisal projections by about FMG 150 million or 18%.
Except for bridge repairs, for which CCCE contributed -71MG 120 million, and
most of the imported workshop equipment, other infrastructure work,
rehabilitation or repair was financed from RNCFM funds and carried out
satisfactorily. The appraisal plans for the Brickaville Yard rebuilding
were not executed due to lack of financing.
Procurement
3.11     There were no procurement problems of any consequence encountered
during Project execution, nor were there any particular delays or failures
in supply contracts due to procurement procedures or failure of suppliers
(Table 5).   While appraisal projections provided for completion of
disbursements by September 30, 1983, 96% of the Credit was disbursed by
September 30, 1982, one year ahead of schedule. Deficiencies and delays in
spare parts supplies, which hampered seriously RNCFM's operations, were due
to the country's shortage of foreign currency and to RNCFM's inadequate
procurement procedures, both factors taken into consideration in the
Recovery Program.



- 10 -
Technical Assistance and Studies
3.12     The original Project provided for 50 man-months of technical
assistance to updste RNCFM's operating, financial and accounting procedures
and for studying the long-term viability of the TA and FCE lines. The
scope of the financial technical assistance program was widened under the
Recovery Program to include additional support in the fields of (i)
transport organization; (ii) financial management; and (iii) the
computerization of RNCFM's accounting and statistics and the procurement of
computer equipment to replace the existing equipment which suffered
numerous breakdowns (see Para 4.02). The TA and FCE viability study was
carried out in 1984. Its outcome is commented on in Para 3.03.
Audit
3.13     Because of complications arising from cumbersome financial
accounting and internal procedures, audit reports were late and not up to
required standards until the new financial organization was put in place.
After this was done, the selection of a qualified auditor and the
adaptation to the new financial organization led to further delays in the
production of audit reports. The audit report on the 1984 accounts,
prepared by Cabinet FIVAROANA, which had provided technical assistance for
the design of RNCFM's accounting plan and costing, was produced in May 1985
and was satisfactory.
Report Requirements
3.14     Quarterly and annual reports provided by RNCFM were often late
initially, incomplete, and not very reliable. This situation was reversed
once RNCFM's legal status -was changed, a financial director appointed and
the Recovery Program implemented. However, operating statistical reports
(Table 3) were never complete due to the computer breakdowns.



- 11 -
IV. Traffic and Operations
Traffic Development
4.01     As indicated in Table 29 traffic on the RNCFM has been
considerably less than forecast in the appraisal report. The main reason
was the poor economic performance of Madagascar in the 1979-1983 period.
This affected all transport modes as indicated by port traffic declining
from 2.4 million tons in 1979 to 1.75 million tons in 1984 and petroleum
product demand declining from 485tO00 m3 in 1979 to 342,000 m3 in 1983.
That rail freight traffic declined from 225.5 million ton-km in 1979 to
180.5 million ton-km in 1981 is not surprising under these conditions.
Nevertheless this was followed by a recovery to 224 million ton-km both in
1984 and 1985. Passenger traffic declined from 303.5 million passenger-km
in 1979 to 217 million in 1984. These figures are considerably less than
the appraisal forecast of 359 million ton-km and 329 million passenger-km
for 1984 or a total of 688 million traffic units, compared to an actual of
441 million traffic units. This represents a shortfall of 36%. In
addition to the general slowdown of the economy, in particular the exports
of chrome and transport of petroleum has been declining. These two
commodities which should have accounted for almost 500,000 tons in 1984 in
fact were only 205,000 tons. The reduction in petroleum traffic was also
partly due to the new hydro-electric power station serving Antananarivo.
The new road to the coast and Toamasina began to affect traffic only in
1985 and not in the early 1980s as the appraisal report forecast. This
increased the actual benefits for 1982-1985.
Operations
4.02     Selected actual and projected statistics for the project period
are given in Table 3. However, a substantial number of 1982 and 1984
productivity indicators are lacking due to repeated computer failures at
RNCFM. This section consequently focuses on the comparison of 1982 and
1984 results with the operational objectives listed in Schedule 3 of the
Project Agreement (Table 4). In hindsight some of these objectives were
unrealistically high, taking into consideration the obsolescence and poor
condition of RNCFM's motive power and rolling stock at the time of Project
appraisal.
(a) Motive Power Availability
Line locomotives. The availability increased from 86.9% in 1977
to 91% in 1982 practically in line with the objective of the
Project Agreement. Due to delays in the delivery of spare parts
financed by IDA and CCCE under the Recovery Program and the
country's shortage of foreign currency, this high level of
availability could not be sustained for a fleet which included
some 30-year old locomotives. It fell to 76% in 1984.
Shunting locomotives. Because of the obsolescence of equipment
and the lack of spare parts, the 1982 availability of this type of
equipment reached a very low of 37X, far below the 90-95% Project
Agreement objective. Thanks to the delivery of CCCE shunters,
this performance improved to 461 in 1984.



- 12 -
Railcars. Their availability stayed in the 90% range between 1978
and 1981, but decreased thereafter to 73S in 1982 and 502 in 1984,
mainly due to the shortage of spare parts. The target was 90-95%.
(b) Productivity Rer Available Power Unit (km Per year)
Line locomotives.  The actual achievement was 73,000 km in 1982,
27% less than the target. The shortfali then was mainly due to
inadequate utilization of available equipment because of the lack
of effective operational planning. By 1984, the performance was
76,000 km, following CCCE financed technical assistance.
Shunting locomotives. The 1982 objective (25,000 km) was reached
but could not be sustained. The 1984 performance was only
15,800 km. Under the Third Railway Project the railway is
expected to return to its 1982 performance in 1988 based on better
utilization of available equipment.
Railcars. The high 100,000 km target in 1982 was not achieved.
The actual performance of 54,000 km reflects the same problems as
for locomotives. The Third Railway Project provides for a more
reasonable target of 80,000 km in 1988.
(c) Average Availability of Freight Cars
The 1982 objectives of 90-95% for ore cars and 95-98% for other
freight cars were reached and in 1984 actual performance was close
to the objectives (Table 4).
(d) Average Turnaround Time (days)
Initially, because of poor perfonrance of ore wagons (10.2 days
actual instead of the 3.5 days objective) the 1982 objectives were
not reached. Major progress was then made in 1983 and 1984 as a
result of assistance provided under the Recovery Program and the
1982 targets were surpassed in 1984 for the most important
category of covered wagons.
(e) Average Wagon Load
The 1982 objectives were reached for general cargo (covered and
flat cars) but not for specialized cars: ore wagons were loaded
at 64% and tank wagons at 69% instead of the respective 100% and
91% respectively. The objectives set were too high.
(f) Productivity per Available Wagon per Year
1982 objectives were only slightly higher than RNCFM's 1977 actual
performance. But actual results showed a substantial
deterioration in transport productivity mainly for specialized
(ore and tank) cars. This is mainly due to the long turnaround
times.



- 13 -
(g) Staff productivity
RNCFM's actual 1982 staff productivity (traffic units per employee
p.a.) was 26% below 1977's and 50% below the operating plan
objective. The main explanation behind this disappointing result
is that the number of staff increased by about 200 between 1978
and 1984, while traffic expressed in traffic units fell as
indicated in Para 4.01. Appraisal projections provided for no
increase in staff and traffic increases of 20% between 1978 and
1982 and an additional 7% between 1982 and 1984. Because of the
expectations that traff4- will only slowly increase over 1984-90
and that reductions in the number of staff will be difficult given
Madagascar's political and economic situation there are little
prospects for an increase in staff productivity.
4.03     The technical efficiency of the railway declined during the two
first years of project implementation. This was due to a combination of
external and internal factors. The main external factor was the sluggish
economic situation of the country which led to a decrease in traffic
demand. The economic situation also lead to a severe shortage of foreign
currency. This shortage in turn prevented the railway from keeping an
adequate supply of spare parts for maintaining its track, motive power and
rolling stock and from financing the renewal of worn out equipment.
Internal factors were the institutional and managerial deficiencies
commented on in Chapter 6, the lack of planning capacity, organization and
discipline in technical departments, poor staff morale and training and
above all the shortage of, and uneven and erratic supply of spare parts,
mainly for motive power. The design and implementation, in cooperation
with FAC and CCCE, of the Recovery Program and the World Bank's firm
attitude aimed at persuading the Government to give the railway an adequate
institutional setting led to a dramatic improvement of RNCFM's
organization, and managerial, operational, and financial performance.
Technical assistance and the provision of equipment and spare parts under
the Program also contributed to the rehabilitation of the railway's
efficiency.

V. Financial Evaluation
5.01     The analysis of RNCFM's financial performance is divided into
three parts: the first one provides for brief comments on the 1977-78
results (the two years preceding project implementation) and on the balance
sheet as of December 31, 1978; the second covers 1979-82, i.e. the period
preceding implementation of the Recovery Program and the suspension of the
Credit; and the third deals with RNCFM's finances in 1983-84, reflecting
the institutional and organizational measures taken by the Government and
RNCFM and the early effects of the implementation of the Recovery Program.
Financial Performance and Situation at Project Start-Up
1977-78
5.02     Projections under the First Railway Project implied that RNCFM's
operationis would yield a working ratio of 68% in 1977 and a 3% rate of
return on average net fixed assets in use in 1977 and thereafter. The
actual 1977 working ratio reached 85%, the rate of return was negative and
the situation worsened in 1978 (table 6), almost depleting the railway's
working capital (Table 7).
5.03     The following summarizes RNCFM's balance sheet as of December 31,
1978.  Details are in Table 8.
FMG million
Assets                           Liabilities
Current Assets              3,224
-Current Liabilities        -2,224
Net Current Assets          1,000        Long Term Debt      2,921
Net Fixed Assets           16,196        Equity Equivalent 14,342
Other Assets                   67
Total Cost               17,263                           17,263
Ratios - Current:          1.4
- Debt to Equity: 17183
Despite the 1.4 current ratio and the 17/83 debt to equity ratio, a closer
analysis discloses a major problem in the short term with accounts payable
exceeding liquid assets by FMG 273 million, as the resulh of RNCFM's
insufficient cash generation over several years. In addition, both
receivables and payables were very high. This was mainly due to the large
and increasing amounts of long overdue accounts receivable from Government
departments and parastatals which, in turn, forced the railway to delay its
own payments resulting in an increase in accounts payable. The conditi,rns
for Board presentation referred to in Para. 2.04 aimed at remedying this
situation.
Financial Performance and Situation During Project Implementation
1979-82
5.04     RNCFM's financial performance slightly improved in 1979-82 but
much less than projected at appraisal as shown by the following ratios.
Detailed revenues and costs are in Table 6.

5.05     Actual 1979 working and operating costs were close to appraisal
projections. However, revenues were not because: (a) actual traffic was
12% below projections; and (b) the tariff increase implemented by the
Government to comply with the Bank's condition for Board presentation did
not become effective until March 17, 1979 (Table 9) while projections
assumed that it would apply for all of 1979. Because of these two adverse
factors RNCFM achieved a 100% operating ratio in 1979, i.e. its deficit
equalled interest charges.
5.06     The 1980-82 appraisal projections assumed that:  (a) traffic would
increase 2.5% p.a.; (b) unit sales would increase about 72 p.a.; and
(c) working and operating working costs would also increase by 7% p.a.
Actual traffic decreased steadily from 528 million traffic-units in 1979 to
439 million in 1982. During that same period unit sales increased by about
20% p.a., working costs by 30% and operating costs by 252 p.a. While most
of the higher than projected cost increase is due to inflation, unit costs
increased also in real terms since short-term fixed costs could not be
reduced i.e. were spread over a lower number of traffic units.  However,
the most important reason for RNCFM's disappointing financial performance
has been the inadequacy of tariff increases. Tariffs were not increased at
all for about 2 years. As a result RNCFM suffered heavy net operating
losses (Table 6) averaging ?MG 600 million p.a. and even heavier net losses
(after interest charges) peaking at FMG 1.2 billion in 1982.
Financial Situation
5.07     These heavy losses adversely affected RNCFM's financial situation
as shown by the following summary of its balance sheet as of December 31,
1982 (Table 8).

Total                      22,663                             22,663



- 16 -
The low current ratio and the heavy 51/49 debt to equity ratio disclosed
that RNCFM9s financial situation would rapidly become untenable unless the
institutional changes referred to in the Project Agreement and the Recovery
Program were implemented.
1983-1984
5.08     In addition to implementing required organizational changes the
Government took the following measures aimed at alleviating the railway's
financial performance and situation, all of which were specified in the
Credit and Project Agreements and/or in the Recovery Program.
(i) impiemerting substantial tariff increases (Table 9);
(ii) settling accounts payable and receivable and scheduling payments
of arrears due to RNCFM by various government departments and
parastatals;
(iii) scheduling payments of railway arrears to foreign suppliers. In
addition to decreasing RNCFM's payables this measure was needed
to speed up the crucial delivery of spare parts the lack of which
severely hampered the availability of motive power and rolling
stock and prevented RNCFM from meeting demand; and
(iv) revaluing fixed assets.
Income Statements
5.09     Table 6 shows that the action taken by the Government and RNCFM
was immediately beneficial to RNCFM's financial performance. In 1983 RNCFM
earned a net operating revenue of FMG 1827 million and a net profit of FMG
904 million translating to an 83% operating ratio and 7.6% rate of return
on average net fixed assets in use, more than double the 3% provided for
under section 4.07 of the Project Agreement. RNCFM's 1984 financial
performance was even better as disclosed by the 12.6% rate of return on
average net fixed assets in use. These spectacular improvements of RNCFM's
financial results were explained by the 1982/83 tariff increases (Table 9)
and a substantial slow down in working and operating cost increases as
compared with the 1980-82 period.
Sources and Application of Funds and Balance Sheet
5.10     The combination of the slow-down in cost increases and higher
tariffs resulted in a dramatic rehabilitation of RNCFM's liquid assets
situation under the double effect of: (a) a substantial increase in cash
generation which grew more than tenfold in 1983 as compared with 1982 from
FMG 350 million to FMG 4,381 million and by another 44% to FMG 6,313 in
1984, 2.5 times appraisal projections; and (b) the provision of equity
capital by the Government using a FMG 2 billion CCCE grant. The liquid
assets balance as of December 31, 1983 reached FMG 1,798 million and grew
to FMG 4,011 million by the end of 1984. The current and liquid ratios
reached respectively 2.2 and 1.7 by the end of 1983 and 4.1 and 2.9 by the
end of 1984 compared with 0.9 and 0.5 respectively at the end of 1982.

5.11     RNCFM's balance sheet as of December 31, 1984 (one month before
the formal Credit closing date of February 4, 1985) is summarized
hereafter. Details are in Table 8.

Conclusion
5.12     As compared with 1978, RNCFMHs short-term position strongly
improved as a result of Project implementation. However, the debt to
equity ratio deteriorated from 13/88 in 1978 to 52/48 in 1984. RNCFM's
financial position at the end of the Second Railway Project was
nevertheless very comfortable but further improvements are still necessary
to consolidats its financial recovery, especially given the competitive
environment resulting from the construction of a paved road replacing part
of the old road between Antananarivo and Toamasina. Actual tariff
increases may have been too high as shown by the 12.6% rate of return on
average net fixed assets in use in 1984, more than twice the Project
Agreement's reasonable target. This would not have been possible in a
competitive environment. End 1984 tariffs may actually have been high
enough to make some customers switch from rail to bus transport and/or
trucking on the new Antananarivo-Toamasina road and on the Antananarivo-
Antsirabe road. RNCFM has begun to pay attention to the potential adverse
impact of high tariff increases.

VI. Institutional Development
Background
6.01     Between 1965 and 1973 RNCFM passed through various forms of state
controls without precise statutes or bylaws. In fact, it was run as a
Government department, subject to civil service rules and Government
financial and budgeting procedures. Effective January 1, 1974, in order to
increase its operational and financial autonomy, RNCFM was established as a
state owned public industrial and commercial establishment under Decree No.
74-154. In 1975 the responsibility for overseeing the new establishment
was given to the newly formed Ministry of Transport, Supplies and Tourism.
Under Its new status RNCFM had the theoretical powers to carry out its
operations. However, it had no real control over its financial management
and operations since many of its activities, especially financial, could
not be carried out without the prior agreement of the Chief Accountant
appointed by and reporting to the Ministry of Finance.
6.02     To make up for this structural weakness in RNCFM's institutional
setting, consultants commissioned under the technical assistance program of
the First Railway Project recommended that RNCFM's status be fundamentally
changed to transform it into a commercially oriented and financially
autonomous enterprise applying modern management methods.
6.03     With this recommendation in mind the Government, RNCFM, and the
Association agreed at Credit negotiations that: (a) the Government would
exchange views with the World Bank any proposal for a material change in
the statutes and organization of the Railway; (b) the proposed Project
should comprise a 'review and implementation of a unified financial and
cost accounting system" and "training of accounting personnel"; (c) in
order to ensure efficient implementation of the financial and accounting
reforms comprising this part of the Project the railways "shall employ a
financial manager whose qualifications and experience shall be acceptable
to the Association (Project Agreement section 3.03)"; and (d) that the
accounts and financial statements be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association.
6.04     By late 1981, more than one year after the Project's start, the
Government had not taken legal action needed to amend RNCFM's status,
especially with respect to financial autonomy, nor on items (b), (c), and
(d) above. Partly due to this failure, but also because of declining
traffic as a result of the country's severe economic problems, the
operational and financial performance of the railway began to deteriorate
seriously. This decline, which lead the Bank to classify the Project as a
"problem project', was discussed with the Government, RNCFM, and CCCE
during supervision missions and several meetings were held outside the
country, most of them in Paris. To halt the decline, a Recovery Program
was set up in late 1981 to help RNCFM overcome its institutional,
financial, and operational problems.
6.05     The Program, partly financed from a reallocation of Credit 903-
MAG, comprised:
(a) additional technical support and studies in the fields of
transport organization, financial management and the economic
and financial viability of low traffic density lines;



- 19 -
(b)  procurement of equipment and spare parts;
(c)  preparation of a financial recovery program consisting of (i)
specific measures aimed at balancing RNCFM's 1982 income
account; (ii) a timetable for collection of arrears owed to
RNCFM by Government agencies and parastatals; (iii) proposals
for improving RNCFM's financial management along the lines of
earlier recommendations by financial consultants; (iv)
proposals for preliminary measures for streamlining RNCFM's
budgetary and accounting procedures; (v) a timetable for the
selection and appointment of RNCFM'8 financial director; and
(vi) proposals and a timetable for amending RNCFM's by-laws
in order to grant it financial autonomy;
(d)  proposals for amending RNCFM's procurement procedures; and
(e)  preparation of a global investment program with economic
justification and priority settings.
6.06     The Recovery Program also provided for a comprehensive set of
technical assistance to identify problems, propose solutions, and help
implement them mainly through staff training.
6.07     However, implementation of the Program started slowly and the
railway's operational and financial performance continued to decline to the
point that it was at the brink of financial collapse (its 1981 traffic was
the lowest in the last ten years) by end-1982. To speed up Program
implementation and trigger action on Credit and Project Agreement covenants
and agreements, the Bank stopped Credit disbursements on June 23, 1982 in
view of non-compliance of the railway's obligations under Sections 3.03,
4.02, 4.03, 4.05, and 4.07 of the Project Agreement.
6.08     The Bank's firm attitude did slow down consultations between the
Government and RNCFM on the Malagasy side and donors (the Bank and CCCE) on
the other. Rather it intensified them as demonstrated by several joint
meetings between them in Paris, Rome and Antananarivo, the main result of
which was that the Government took strong action to rehabilitate the
technical and financial efficiency of its railway. The most meaningful
part of this action was the promulgation of Ordinance No. 82014 of May 6,
1982 and Decree No. 82.286 of 7-1-1982. These two pieces of legislation
established RNCFM as a Societe d' Etat (State Company) the main feature of
which is that it is organized along the lines of a private company with
capital of FMG 10 billion, increased operational and financial autonomy and
profit making financial objectives. The State Company is under the control
of a 15-member Board with full organizational and managerial powers. The
Board comprises six representatives of the Government (majority
shareholder) two of the shareholders (other State Companies), five of the
staff and two representing railway users. The railway's general manager
reports solely to the Board. The financial audit of state companies is the
responsibility of an auditor appointed for 3 years by the majority
shareholder. RNCFM's audit has been carried out along Bank guidelines.
6.09     This institutional change was complemented by:
- the nomination of a qualified financial director;



- 20 -
- the establishment of a satisfactory financial plan compribing
measures discussed in Pars. 6.05; and
- the establishment of a traffic costing system.
Thanks to the above-described action, the Bank was able to lift the
suspension of its Credit in November 1982.
Conclusion
6.10     In contrast to the First Railway Project (see PCR Para 6.08) the
Second Project met its institutional objectives. The railway's statutes
are now adequate; its current management team competent, dynamic, and
dedicated; its operations reasonably efficient; and its financial
organization and management on an improving trend. These achievements need
to be consolidated under the recently approved Third Railway Project.
During this Project RNCFM intends to pursue its efforts to face rising road
competition by the setting of a tariff system taking advantage of its
recently completed analytical cost accounting system.

VII.  Economic Reevaluation
7.01     The appraisal report indicated a potential capacity increase of
some 137 million ton-km and 30 million passenger-km. Actual line
improvements and new rolling stock provided for about 60 million ton-km and
23 million passenger-km. New roling stock and teehnical assistance was
financed by CCCE and track improvement for the TCE and MLA lines and
studies were provided for by the IDA Credit. The effects of these measures
are difficult to separate since they largely coincided in time.  One
immediate effect, directly related to the TCE track renewal, was a
reduction in time lost for derailments which were reduced from over 600
hours in 1977 to some 370 hours in 1983.  The most positive development of
the overall IDAICCCE program was a marked reduction in turn-around time for
covered wagons as indicated in Table 4. This set of data has been used to
calculate the benefits of the Project.
7.02     The Project was critical in reversing a serious capacity shortage
in 1979-80 when an effective rationing of rail transport was in effect
which has since been removed. Until the opening of the main missing link
of the paved road from Toamasina to Moramanga, RN 2, the TCE-line was
effectively the main supply route for the principal population center of
Madagascar. For the period 1980-84, the Project was therefore vital in
serving a large part of the population. From 1985 the savings are still
substantial but less critical since RN2 can now provide effective
competition, although at higher economic costs.  The line-renewal of MLA
was less successful since ballast and sleeper production was slower than
anticipated. This is now supported by the Third Railway Project and the
only benefit for the earlier Project is the residual valuu of rail used for
this new project.
7.03     The main benefits which were quantified in the appraisal report
were the need for additional road vehicle capacity in case the railway
project was not nmdertaken, equivalent to some 70 additional heavy trucks,
mainly related to the track improvements under the project. For motive
power and rolling stock as well as workshop equipment the main benefits
were related to increased cost of transport by road of both passengers and
freight, for a demand that could not be satisfied by rail transport. In
the economic reevaluation these factors have again been considered i.e. by
the difference in transport operating cost and the need for additional
transport capacity without the Project. With the actual railway
performance at the beginning of the Project (1979-80) an additional 31
million ton-km in 1981 growing to 58 million ton-km by 1984 would have had
to be transported by road without the Project. For the recalculated return
the same parameters were used as for the appraisal of the Third Railway
Project, and the same base year, 1984. The equivalent of 31 additional 20-
ton trucks would have been needed without the Project in 1982 and 28 trucks
in 1984. For the HIA line only the residual value of rail has been used as
the benefit of this project component. For other project components a
residual life of 10 years has been assumed after benefits for a 10-year
period.
7.04     The costs which were considered were all investments in the 1980 -
84 period, revalued to the price level of 1984, using local price indices.
This included the increased cost of the Recovery Program, but not



- 22 -
investments in 1979, prior to investments financed under the Project which
only began in 1980. The cost overrun in US$ terms of 28% is due to the
additional investments under the Program, without which overall costs would
have been less than the appraisal estimate.
7.05     The benefits of the Project increased as a result of the delays in
opening the improved Toamasina-Moramanga road from the early 1980s to 1985,
but decreased because of lower traffic, both with and without the Project.
Furthermore, the delays of the works on the MLA line lowered the economic
return substantially since only about 1/3 of the track renewal program was
achieved in the 1980-84 period. The track renewal that was carried out,
however, covered both the most costly, and the most rewarding part of the
system.   The overall ERR of 12% (Table 10), for all rolling stock and
track investment in 1980-84, would increase to 15? without the MLA track
cost. Therefore, it is most likely that the track renewal of the TCE line
was well justified.
7.06     In summary, the overall project has provided highly needed
capacity for RNCFM and substantial institutional improvement.
Nevertheless, lower traffic demand from economic conditions for the whole
country and slow implementation of the MLA line renewal has lowered the ERR
from the 17% estimated at appraisal to about 12% for the actual Project
financed by IDA and CCCE.

VIII. Role of IDA
8.01     IDA's role in project preparation, design, and supervision was
even more constructive than under the First Railway Project, mainly because
it took advantage of the lessons learned from this Project and when
required reoriented the Project through the Recovery Program. IDA's role
was especially noticeable in:
(a)   the selection of institutional building objectives;
(b)   the assistance to the Government and RNCFM in designing and
implementing the Recovery Program; and
(c)   the decision to suspend Credit disbursements when it became
clear that the Government was unwilling to take the measures
needed for rehabilitating its railway's status, operations,
and finances. The Government then did tackle the railway's
problems and took action that reversed the long decline of
RNCFM's operating efficiency and financial viability;
8.02     The constructive cooperation in Project dejign and implementation
between the Bank and CCCE, was a positive factor in the success of the
project. During several joint meetings with representatives of the
Government and RNCFM, the two donors were able to assist their Malagasy
counterparts to design the Recovery Program.
8.03     Another noticeable point is that, even during the difficult period
which culminated in the suspension of disbursements, relationship among the
Bank, the Government and the railway remained highly constructive. The
continuity of the open-minded dialogue among all the parties has been a key
factor in the Project's successful completion.
8.04     While the action by Bank/CCCE was highly efficient and was a major
factor towards successful completion of the Project, IDA made two
misjudgements. The first of these relates to the selection of operating
targets during Project appraisal. Most of these were unrealistically high,
taking into consideration the age and poor condition of RNCFM's motive
power and rolling stock at that time. In fact, they were not met despite
RNCFM's commendable efforts. In retrospect, IDA probably also made a
misjudgement when it let the Government implement unduly high tariff
increases in 1982-83. Tariffs at the end of 1984 may actually have been so
high that some customers switched from rail to road transport. The Bank
and RNCFM should have paid closer attention to the potential adverse effect
of such high and relatively inflexible tariff increases.  The Third Railway
Project will introduce a more market-oriented pricing policy.



- 24 -
IX. Lessons Learned
9.01     The main lesson is that when a project agency, in this case the
railways, cannot reach its objectives because of government policies (low
tariffs) or operations (interference in day to day management and not
paying its bills), the project cannot be successful. In this case, the
Bank stopped its disbursements until Government agreed to implement a
Recovery Program without which the railways could not have made any
improvement.  This drastic action, at the time controversial, appears in
hindsight to have been the correct position to allow the railways to make
its contribution to the country's development.
9.02     The joint action of the Bank and French aid agencies was very
effective in assisting the railways, particularly in the ability of the
CCCE and FAC to provide additional funds in a timely and flexible way. Aid
coordination was worth the effort.
9.03     IDA should have done better in two fields.  The first relates to
the selection of unduly high operating targets (para 4.02). The second
refers to the need to prevent borrowers from over reacting when they take
Bank recommended measures. In this particular case, tariff increases
applied for restoring the railway's financial performance were probably too
high and may have had an adverse effect on traffic at a time the de facto
monopoly of rail transport was being reduced (para 5.12). The Project,
however, was a successful operation of which the Bank and the Borrower can
be justifiably proud.
