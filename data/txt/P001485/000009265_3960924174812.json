The project was moderately successful and\n            useful since it helped the Government to maintain its main\n            transport link between the port of Toamasina and\n            Antananarivo, and made the Government aware of the\n            shortcomings of its railway such as its inadequate\n            operational efficiency and poor financial performance. The\n            Association's role in project preparation, design and\n            supervision was highly efficient. The combination of the\n            design and implementation of the Recovery Program,\n            disbursement suspension and the continuation of a\n            constructive dialogue with the Government and Reseau\n            National des Chemins de Fer Malagasy (RNCFM), in close\n            cooperation with the co-financiers, was effective since it\n            induced the Government to take long overdue institutional\n            and financial measures. The effectiveness of this\n            combination should be remembered as an efficient tool for\n            handling future potential problem projects."}, "docdt": "1987-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
