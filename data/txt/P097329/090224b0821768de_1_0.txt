                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final/last Implementation Status report as the project closes on December 31st, 2013. The ISR ratings therefore reflect the ratings for the entire project period for the two
                         public sector institutions i.e Auditor General Department (AGD) and the Deptt. of Census and Statistics (DCS).

                         The project was originally conceived to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of two key public sector agencies -- the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) and
                         the Auditor General’s Department [AGD]) -- through organizational strengthening, capacity building, information management, communication improvements, physical and
                         information technology infrastructure, and information and communication technology support. The project’s development objective was amended in August 2012 to focus on the
                         effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of the AGD. By the original December 31, 2011 closing date of the project, the target Project Development Objective level results indicators

                         for the AGD component of the project had all been met or exceeded, with significant undisbursed funds and unspent balances in the Designated Account. The closing date of the
                         project was extended twice at the Government’s request (each for a 12 month period) to enable the AGD to utilize project savings to: construct a regional training center in
                         Ratnapurna; host a major international seminar of Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions member countries, and; to further institutionalize enhancements to the
                         effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of the AGD.

                         Excellent performance both in terms of achieving the PDOs and overall implementation of the project were noted under the AGD component. The AGD component is fully disbursed
                         by the project closing date with a 'Highly Satisfactory' performance. The key highlights of this component were completion of AGD office building which is fully functional with new
                         divisions such as the 'training division', a dedicated division to work with parliamentary committees (COPE and COPA), new divisions for financial, investigative and performance
                         audits; preparation of manuals in financial, performance and investigative audits; substantial improvement in audit methodology with the help of a auditing software called
                         'TEAMMATE' replacing manual working papers by electronic formats and real time improvement in compliance, risk assessments, proper planning and timely completion of audits
                         and 100% achievement on completion of SOEs; establishment of a fully operational new AGD office building and construction of training center at Ratnapura (which was not originally
                         planned in the project) with the savings from the construction of the AGD office building; substantial capacity strengthening of the AGD staff through training, post graduate courses
                         etc. The scope of audit has been expanded which now includes besides the core audit the performance and investigative audits. Five performance audit reports have already been
                         tabled in Parliament and available in public domain. The Auditor General’s Department hosted an international conference ‘Supreme Audit Institutions: Meeting Higher
                         Expectations' in Colombo in July, 2013 as part of the project’s
                         communication strategy. The conference was well attended by representatives of Supreme Audit Institutions of 18 countries. The Annual report was tabled in Parliament. The results
                         achieved strengthening of the Auditor General Deptt. are in line with best practice models/projects in the Bank.

                         The DCS component however could not match the stellar performance of the AGD component because of reasons explained in the Mid Term review of the project. DCS was slow to
                         start with and was weak agency both in terms of capacity and knowledge to manage large projects. In the Bank, the experience of similar statistical projects is somewhat akin to the
                         results that have been achieved in this project. The CSOs in most of the countries are weak agencies and they require substantial hand-holding at the beginning of the project in
                         order to bring them to speed. The DCS after a slow start, in part reflecting the lack of experience of DCS in implementing a large capacity building program with Bank finance and, in
                         part, a result of limited resources available for intensive supervision in first two years of the project, substantial progress was made in 2010 with active supervision and meticulous
                         hand-holding by the Bank team. Both intensive supervision, better hand-holding on procurement and financial management aspects by the Bank team enabled the DCS component
                         to achieve a 'Moderately Satisfactory' rating in PDOs and overall implementation. According to the Mid Term Review of the project some issues on the design of the DCS component
                         are worth highlighting to make a more informed judgement of the component and its performance against all odds:-

                         •         It was unrealistic to expect results from a complex program of capacity building and strengthening in much less than five years, especially where the implementing agency
                         has limited experience of managing large-scale projects and where the agency itself is going through a process of reform and change.

                         •        Prior to 2008, DCS had no little or no previous experience with the implementation of large scale Bank projects and, therefore, took some time to develop the experience and
                         expertise needed and to ensure that systems were put into effect. Without more intensive support or supervision than was possible when the project started, more time should
                         probably have been allowed for this process.

                         •        The implementation plan should probably have included some capacity to deal with problems such as the turnover of staff with procurement experience at critical stages of

                         the project.

                         •       The limited detail in the results framework in the PAD and, especially the lack of baseline data have limited the extent to which results can be properly assessed and
                         measured. Some time was required, therefore, to develop the baselines and to identify in detail what was needed in key areas of statistics. It would have been better to ensure that
                         these baselines were developed as part of the project preparation rather than during implementation.

                          Another important point is that the Government decided to complete the remaining construction work for the DCS building and now the office building is nearing completion with govt.
                         money. When part of the loan was cancelled for the DCS component, the piling work for the building was complete and the superstructure had to be raised on that so almost 35-40%
                         of works for the DCS building were completed with IDA money. Substantial training and capacity building activities were also completed by DCS involving both domestic and foreign
                         training and all the 5 core consultancies were utilized for creating a baseline assessment of the key statistical activities which included surveys, scanning of census questionnaires,
                         national accounts, ICT plan etc. All these sub-components did contribute towards enhancing the productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of the statistical system partially and the

                         PDOs were not fully achieved under the DCS component. The DCS component on the PDO rating closed as 'Unsatisfactory' in December 2011. Thus with a PDO rating of
                         'Satisfactory' for AGD and a 'Unsatisfactory' for DCS, the overall PDO rating for the entire project would work out to be 'Moderately Unsatisfactory'. However, the rating for the overall
                         implementation of the project would be Moderately Satisfactory.
