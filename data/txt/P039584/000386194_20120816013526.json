"versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "4163;7442;P302", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Additional Financing for\n            the Buenos Aires Urban Transport Project (PTUBA) for\n            Argentina were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was significant;\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: importance of flexibility in project\n            design in view of unexpected outcomes. The PTUBA project\n            illustrates why it is critical to introduce flexibility in\n            the design of a project so that in an event of a crisis the\n            project can survive and support a government recovery\n            strategy. The flexibility in the PTUBA project stemmed from\n            a sound understanding that the project had to accompany\n            heavy infrastructure components with numerous small scale\n            works. Design of additional finance instrument, with its\n            maximum three year period, in countries with consistent\n            delays in loan effectiveness might need reconsideration.\n            Such loans still need to traverse the same bureaucratic\n            procedures in country as a regular SIL. Institutional\n            integration agendas are difficult, political and\n            time-consuming. Metropolitan transport agencies are highly\n            political and it remains a challenge to support such\n            ambitious institutional agendas within the constraints of\n            the Bank's instruments for investment loans. A lesson\n            learned for transport operations is to more explicitly\n            recognize the limitations of project implementers and\n            overall Bank instruments to catalyze such complex\n            institutional reform. Consolidation of transport reforms\n            cannot be sustained without building capacity for future\n            generations of transport leaders. In the case of Argentina,\n            there has been a virtual absence of academic programs in\n            educational institutions to develop a pool of professionally\n            qualified manpower for undertaking such urban transport\n            planning. Transformative complementary approaches in urban\n            transport, other lessons that are confirmed with the\n            implementation of PTUBA are: that small scale accessibility\n            projects can significantly improve the mobility of public\n            transit users, that public consultations can have a\n            significant impact in project design and community\n            ownership, and that rational transport planning is paramount\n            for efficiency of resource allocation which can only be\n            assessed when information is available. Client-focused\n            application of the Bank's procurement policy can add a\n            lot of value. The innovative manner in which the Bank's\n            procurement guidelines were adapted to the actual situation\n            of the Metrovias context was exceptional."}, "docdt": "2012-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
